		EARLY CRITICAL OPINIONS OF WINSTON CHURCHILL 'S new novel
CONISTON	ORGANIZATION	describe it as `` first of all a delightful love-story , vigorous , vibrant and realistic . ''

		CONISTON '' is a love-story of the sort that warms the cockles of the heart , arouses every laggard and latent impulse of sympathy , and lends enthusiasm to fancy ... its sentiment is so true , its humor so native and abiding , and its grip on the eternal verities so strong , that its characters seem to live and move in the immediate present . ''

		CONISTON '' is by long odds the best , the most important , and most significant novel that has proceeded from Mr.

		NOTES 21 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 22 POETRY AND ARBORICULTURE .

		The daily press has reported the slaughter , in a
New York	LOCATION	town , of some grand old white oaks that lifted their heads in majesty one hun - dred feet heavenward , each of them '' a forest waving on a single stem '' ; and , with shame be it confessed , these monarchs of the tree world were sacrificed to the demands of a local spoke - factory .

		Wood that has for centuries matched its strength with the fierce fury of winter blasts , and braved the devasting thunderbolt , must henceforth patiently describe its wearisome epitrochoids -LRB- if that be the name of the curve -RRB- beneath the weight of some groaning dray , or more nimbly revolve with the nickel-mounted hubs and silently-s \ s ` ift rubber tires of some smart trap , or festive tally-ho , or road devour - ing motor car , -- not altogether ignoble uses , it may be urged , but served at how lamentable a cost !

		The annual recurrence of arbor-day may have suggested to many besides the present writer the query whether , in the present endeavor of all enlightened persons to create a public sentiment adverse to the reckless .

		sacrifice of natural beauty to commercial utility -- and even , as is often proved in the end , to commercial inutility , -- poetry may not be enlisted as a powerfid ally in the righteous cause , a more powerfid ally , that is , than we have yet recognized it to be ; and this , too , without gi > * ing the slightest oflFense to the ad - vocates of '' art for art 's sake , '' or incurring the faintest suspicion of seeking to harness
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	to the plough .

		Qmte the contrary ' .

		The poetry of trees and forests and woodland scenery may , by appealing to our love of natural beauty , serve the interests of arboriculture , and , by a pleasing reciprocation of benefits , ai-boricidture Avill yield inspiration to the muse of the nature-losing poet .

		The right influences thus brought into action by the apostles of sweetness and light shoidd broaden down from the more to the less cid - tured , until all good Americans shall feel the same instinctive respect for noble trees and majestic forests that is entertained in the older communities of the world .

		Something of the same recoarnition accorded to the rights of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 1	DATE	, animals will thus more and more be yielded to the claims of our rooted and stationary fellow - ci'eatures .

		Although the poet has , of necessity , less often taken a theme for his song from the calm beauty of field and forest than from the rich multiplicity of human emotions and passions and actions , yet a very considerable body of verse coidd be got together descriptive of wood - land scenes and of the majesty of individual trees , to say nothing of the many poems that , like '' The Building of the Sliip '' and '' The
Wonderful One-Hoss Shay	PERSON	, '' treat of the uses of timber -- mechanic uses , which it is our pres - ent purpose to put entirely out of mind .

		The Old Testament writers , as living in a poorly - wooded land , make but few references to trees .

		The green bay tree of the Psalmist , and the cedars of
Lebanon	LOCATION	, are familiar to us ; the oak , cypress , sycamore , pine , and fir tree are also occasionally mentioned , as are various kinds of fruit trees ; and the ash occurs once , in '' Isaiah . ''

		But of the stately beauty of the forest primeval we get hardly a hint .

		In his '' History of
Israel	LOCATION	, ''
Ewald	PERSON	says that
Solomon	PERSON	made gardens , vine - yards , and pleasant parks around
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, and that he wrote a book describing all the plants and trees cultivated there ; but this treatise is lost .

		Homer , rich in marine effects , gives but a faint idea of the charms of sylvan scenery .

		In the sixth book of the '' Iliad '' he aptly likens the successive generations of men to the leaves of the trees , ever dying and as often renewed ; and in the '' Odyssey '' he pictures the grove that surrounds
Calypso	ORGANIZATION	's grotto , and also de - scribes the orchards of the Phaeacians .

		But , though other references to trees are not lacking , Homer is by no means the forest-lover 's poet .

		Hesiod , now and then , is a little more satisfying , as in the first book of his '' Works and Days , '' where he depicts a country rejoicing in peace and plenty , and adds : ' • Nature indulgent o'er their land is seen ; With oaks , high-towering , are their mountains green ; With heavy mast their arms diffusive bow , While from their trunks rich streams of honey flow . ''

		Theocritus , as some of his Idyls prove , was sensitive to the beauty of tree and forest .

		He sings of the '' clustering pine-tree that scatters many a cone , '' and elsewhere thus voices his love of the same tree : '' Yon breezy pine , whose foliage shades the springs , In many a vocal whisper sweetly sings . ''

		Moschus celebrates the calm delights of repose beneath a plane-tree , whose leafage , cool and deep , guards the sleeper from every annoyance .

		The Greek tragic poets , as might have been expected , offer scarcely anything to our purpose .

		But coming down to the post-classical poets of
Alexandria	LOCATION	, we find in the '' Argonautica '' of Apollonius Rhodius at least two graceful refer - ences to trees .

		A hamadryad thus pleads for the life of an oak : '' Oh , rustic , stay , nor wound the hallowed rind ; For ages with that stem I live entwined . ''

		Again , after the too-adventurous
Phaethon	PERSON	has come to grief , and , hurled from the sun-chariot by
Jove	ORGANIZATION	's thunderbolt , has perished in the river Eridanus , we read : '' The daughters of the sun , a mournfid band , Along the bank , enclosed in poplars stand . ''

		Items such as these , however , are rather matters of curiosity than of literary interest .

		Passing to a better-known poet than old Apollonius , we find in
Ovid	LOCATION	's story of Orpheus and Eurydice all the trees of the forest described , with appro - priate epithets , as following the sweet strains of the musician 's lyre ; and in the legend of Ver - tumnus and
Pomona	LOCATION	the patroness of the apple - tree is represented as a scientific arboriculturist .

		In the same poet occurs the following descrip - tion of an aged oak : '' An ancient oak in the dark centre stood , The covert 's glory , and itself a wood ; Garlands embraced its shaft , and from the boughs Himg tablets , monuments of prosperous vows .

		In the cool dusk its unpierced verdure spread The Dryads oft their hallow 'd dances led ; And oft when round their gauging arms they cast , Full fifteen ells it measured in the waist . ''

		Virgil , too , is responsive to the appeal of wood - land scenes .

		When ^ neas reached
Italy	LOCATION	, one of the first sights to attract his attention and win his admiration was : '' A mighty grove of glancing trees .

		Embowered amid the sylvan scene , Old Tiber winds his banks between . ''

		In the second book of the '' Georgics , '' all the methods , natural and artificial , by which trees are propagated , are enumerated in realistic de - tail .

		A fine description of the oak is also met with in this poem .

		Passing abruptly -LRB- to avoid the tedium of too long lingering among the ancients -RRB- from
Virgil	PERSON	to
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, we come upon a good picture of a rugged old oak in '' The
Shepherd	ORGANIZATION	's Calendar '' -LRB-
February	DATE	-RRB- : '' There grew an aged tree on the green , A goodly Oak sometime had it been With arms full strong and largely displayed : The body big and mightily pight , Thoroughly wooded and of wondrous height ; Whylorae had been the king of the field , And muckle mast to the husband did yield , And with his nuts larded many swine : But now the gray moss marred his rine ; His bar ^ d boughs were beaten with storms .

		His top was bald and wasted with worms , His honour decayed , his branches sere . ''


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		The swine-feeding virtues of this oak recall the early English custom of estimating the value of forests by the number of hogs they would fatten ; and in the survey made at the time of the Nor - man Conquest , and embodied in Doomsday Book , woods of a single hog have a place on the list .

		The derivation of acorn -LRB- from '' aec '' or ** ac '' and ' • corn , '' as being the com produced by the oak -RRB- is interesting .

		The tree first yields acorns at about eighteen years of age , and it does not attain its maximmn height and pro- ductiveness until it is much older .

		The vulgar proverb , • ' soon ripe , soon rotten , '' holds true throughout the vegetable world .

		Dryden voices the prevailing belief as to the great age attained by the oak , in these lines : '' Three centuries he grows , and three he stays Supreme in state ; and in three more decays . ''

		But from competent authority we leam that the tree 's maximum tale of years far exceeds the limit here set , being in fact about two thousand .

		There are flourishing in
England	LOCATION	to-day trees that are said to have been old enough to cut for lumber when A-Yilliani the Conqueror landed in
1066	DATE	.

		Venerable indeed are such veterans of the tree - world .

		The historic oaks of this and other lands -- the Chai-ter Oak , the Eliot Oak , the Ro ^ al Oak , and coimtless others -- need not here detain us .

		Of an oak with its historic pos - sibilities still before it ,
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	writes : '' There is an oak a mile from where I am now sitting , at
Beverly Farms	LOCATION	,
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts , to which I always lift my hat .

		What a future that robust , fidl-bloo < led , broad-armed , symmetrical young giant has before it if the human ephemera which carries an axe in its grasp does not sacrilegiously invade its life I '' Less hardy and shorter-lived than the oak , but more pliantly graceful in form , is the elm , espe - ciallj ' the American elm .

		Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	speaks of '' the grand old patriarchs , those mighty elms , before which I often , when alone , and without affectation , bowed my head , and could without shame have knelt and kissed the turf at their feet . ''

		With a pleasing bit of imagery he has told us that ' • the proper rule for measuring the girth of the trunk of an elm is the same as that for taking the measure of a lady 's girdle , '' -- that is , in the waist of the tree , just where the trunk begins to expand downward and to throw out its mighty roots , and to broaden upward into its powerfid branches .

		This point is usually about five feet from the ground .

		In rhythmic and poetic phrase the same writer somewhere exclaims , '' What tales , if there were tongues in trees , this giant elm could teU ! '' ''

		It might well have been with our splendid ebns in mind that
Walt Whitman	PERSON	asked , '' Why are there trees I never walk luider but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me ? ''

		Lowell -- under the trees at
Elmwood	LOCATION	, we may suppose -- TNTites : '' I care not how men trace their ancestry , To ape or Adam : let them please their whim ; But I in
June	DATE	am midway to believe A tree among my far progenitors .

		Such sympathy is mine with all the race , Such mutual recog ^ tion vaguely sweet There is between us , -- surely there are times When they consent to own me of their kin .

		And condescend to me , and call me cousin . ''

		Of the charms of countless other trees , as celebrated in song and story , only the briefest hints can here be given .

		How vivid and how familiar the picture presented in these three lines from Wordsworth : '' I saw far off the dark top of a pine Look like a cloud , -- a slender stem the tie That bound it to its native earth . ''

		What could be more magnificent than the horse - chestnut in full bloom , its thousand chandeliers aflame , and the whole as resplendent as an illu - minated pagoda ?

		The catalpa , in its pride of foliage and blossom , presents a somewhat sim - ilar appearance .

		Who can celebrate fitly , even in stateliest verse , the grandeur of the maple in autumn ?

		Who will picture its rosy charms -LRB- we have in mind now the red maple -RRB- in
spring	DATE	?

		Lowell has attempted the double task : '' The maple puts her corals on in
May	DATE	, While loitering frosts about the lowlands cling ' , To be in tune with what the robins sing ' .

		Plastering new log huts ` mid her branches gray ; But when the autumn southward turns away , Then in her veins bums most the blood of
spring	DATE	, And every leaf , intensely blossoming , Makes the year 's sunset pale the set of day . ''

		It is , however , a tardy
spring	DATE	that sees the maple first donning her corals in
May	DATE	; nor , in prosaic truth , are the maple blossoms light enough in hue to suggest the delicate pink of coral .

		Of the chestnut in springtime , and its swelling buds ,
Tennyson	PERSON	has written : '' What an hour was that , When after roving in the woods -LRB- Twas
April	DATE	then -RRB- , I came and sat Below the chestnuts , when their buds Were glistening to the breezy blue . ''

		The sombre beauties of evergreen groves have been celebrated by many poets .

		Most fanuliar to us are the opening lines of '' Evangeline '' : ' * This is the forest primeval .

		The murmuring pines and the hemlocks , Bearded with moss , and in garments green , indistinct in the twilight , Stand like Druids of eld , ■ with voices sad and prophetic , Stand like harpers hoar , with beards that rest on their bosoms . ''

		From these stately lines to
Bryant	PERSON	's * ' Forest Hymn '' is a natural transition : THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, '' The groves were God 's first temples .

		Ere man learned To hew the shaft , and lay the architrave , And spread the roof above them -- ere he framed The lofty vault , to gather and roll back The sound of anthems ; in the darkling wood , Amid the cool and silence , he knelt down , And ofPered to the Mightiest solenm thanks And supplication . ''

		Still finer and more natural are the sentiments of the same poet 's '' Inscription for the Entrance to a Wood '' : '' Even the green trees Partake the deep contentment ; as they bend To the soft winds , the sun from the blue sky Looks in and sheds a blessing on the scene . ''

		Let US remember , too ,
Bryant	PERSON	's `` Autumn Woods , '' glowing with color and murmuring with the southwest wind , -- perhaps the best of his woodland lays .

		With
Wordsworth	PERSON	, it is needless to say , the lover of nature must ever delight '' to range her blooming bowers and spacious fields , '' '' Or pierce the gloom of her majestic woods ; Koaming , or resting under grateful shade In peace and meditative cheerfulness . ''

		The gustatory delights of a fruit orchard need not here be enlarged upon , although the pleasure of owning a few cherry-trees , snowy wonders in early
May	DATE	, or a half-dozen rows of apple-trees , clothing themselves in pink-and-white prettiness as the
summer	DATE	approaches , is not exclusively a gastronomic satisfaction .

		Says our always - enjoyable Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, in writing of his large apple-trees : '' Fine trees they are , and I am grate - ful to them , and even proud of two of them , -- the ' green tent ' and the ' seven-branched candle - stick ' ; but they are lacking in ' distinction , ' as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	would say , and are fruit - peddlers , while the elm deals only in sunbeams . ''

		It is a cheering sign of the times , and one that goes far to offset the discouraging symptom noted at the beginning of this article , that one million young trees are to be , or already have been , dis - tributed by the
State Forestry Commission	ORGANIZATION	to dweUers on the treeless plains of western
Kansas	LOCATION	.

		The pioneer 's inveterate hatred of '' timber '' we may hope to be passing away .

		To quote once more , and for the last time , the tree-loving Autocrat , '' when trees are spoken of under the fatal name of timber , the settler may expect soon to find himself in a graveyard of blackened stumps , '' or , worse still , a cemetery of those gaunt horrors , girdled trees , done to death in shameful fashion , and lifting their naked and stiffening arms in mute appeal to heaven .

		But let us hope that blackened stumps and girdled trees are fast becoming things of an irrevocable P ^ * -

		THE DIAL following the AVar of
1812	DATE	.

		We are made to see the tide of settlement reaching the edge of the prairies of the Old Northwest even under the discouragements of the panic of
1820	DATE	, and are shown the far-reaching effect of this body of cheap lands upon discontented English farmers .

		We get graphic views of back ^ ^ ` oodsmen making new frontiers up the
Missouri	LOCATION	and the
Arkansas	LOCATION	, and of planters carrying the question of slavery into the new lands .

		Beyond these areas of set - tlement we see the daring hunters and Indian traders , whose predecessors had traversed the forests of the
Ohio Valley	LOCATION	and the
Great Lakes	ORGANIZATION	, now pushing forward to reveal the mysteries of the arid plains and the
Rocky Movmtains	PERSON	, there to contest with Englishmen the possession of the
New Northwest	ORGANIZATION	in the
Oregon	LOCATION	country , and with Spaniards the
New Southwest	ORGANIZATION	in the region of
Santa Fe	LOCATION	.

		A fresh horizon of American ambi - tion rises into view : the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	engages the interest of pioneer and statesman , and another advance is prepared into Spanish American lands .

		Among the best of the English travellers is
James Flint	PERSON	, whose moderation and insight make his travels especially valuable for the period 1818-1820 , when he studied agricultural condi - tions from
Long Island	LOCATION	to
Ohio	LOCATION	and into
Canada	LOCATION	.

		He is alert to note new agricultural implements , prices of lands and products , wages and freight - rates .

		The beginning of the agricidtural occu - pation of the edges of the prairies engages his interest .

		The changing values in this period of disturbed industrial conditions diminish the reli - ability of his observations , but the panic of
1819	DATE	itself gave him occasion for usefid comments on Western banking and currency .

		His sojourn of several months in
Indiana	LOCATION	furnished the op - portunity for a series of usefid chapters on American political , economic , and social condi - tions , which make him an interesting predecessor of his feUow-countryman
James Bryce	PERSON	, although it must be confessed that he is not in the same class .

		He gives intelligent estimates of the rela - tive advantages of the different sections for im - migrants , and predicts the effect of slavery not only in turning foreigners away from the South , but also in the inevitable discord produced along the extensive boundary-line between free and slave States , His friendly attitude toward the West as a whole , and his faith in its future , was shown by his settling in
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		Ogden 's '' Letters from the West '' and Bul - lock 's '' Sketch of a Journey , '' briefer sketches , are somewhat inappropriately placed in the present series , in the same volume with
Gregg	PERSON	's '' Commerce of the Prairies . ''

		The first of these travellers was a
New England Quaker	ORGANIZATION	who spent two years , beginning in
1821	DATE	, along the
Ohio	LOCATION	towns .

		He furnishes little valuable information , much of his description being second-hand .


Bullock	PERSON	was an English jeweller interested in natural history , who twice visited
Mexico	LOCATION	in the search for curios , and on his visit in
1827	DATE	voy - aged from
New Orleans	LOCATION	up the ^ lississippi to
Cincinnati	LOCATION	.

		Here he purchased a large estate across the river , and plotted an interesting site for a future city .

		Returning by way of the cities along
Lake Erie	LOCATION	and the

		The English settlement in
Edwards County	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, called out a large amovmt of contro - versial literature in this period .

		Founded by
Morris Birkbeck	PERSON	and
George Flower	PERSON	, on the prairie between the Big and the
Little Wabash	LOCATION	, in
1817	DATE	, it was an interesting experiment in the occupation of the neglected prairie lands , by wealthy and scientific English farmers who had left

		Free lands furnished only the opportunity for liard work in this frontier , where a wage class hardly existed .

		Of the voluminous literature called out by this settlement , Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	prints the narra - tives of
Hulme	ORGANIZATION	,
Woods	ORGANIZATION	, Faux ,
Welby	PERSON	, and the letters of
Richard Flower	PERSON	, the father of
George Flower	ORGANIZATION	.

		The student will find in
Birkbeck	LOCATION	's '' Notes on a Journey '' and '' Letters from
Illi	PERSON	- nois , '' and in
George Flower	PERSON	's '' History of the English Settlement , '' important accoimts to supplement the above ; but the editor has selected for reprinting the works that are less accessible .

		Hulme 's '' Journal '' abounds in usefid notes on economic conditions , wages , prices , etc. .

		He writes in the spirit of fairness , though he de - cided against remaining in
Illinois	LOCATION	; but his work was unfairly used by
Cobbett	PERSON	in his '' Year 's Residence '' to attack the West as a field for English emigrants .

		Flower 's letters are written in defense , but contain valuable information on Western conditions .

		Woods gives us a straight - forward account of his journey to the West , his land purchases , and his experience with the retreating frontiersmen .

		Faux was a less agreeable type of the
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	farmer , lacking adaptability to new condi - tions , and devoid of good breeding .

		He talks with unrestrained freedom of the seamy side of American life , and professedly has a mission to deter Englishmen from removing to a land of sharpers .

		The primitive conditions gave him only disgust .

		Faux 's strictures were not kindly received by contemporary Americans , and later critics have found liim guilty on many counts of violating good taste , truthfulness , and judg - ment .

		But his book is a useful one .

		If the win - dows which he opens upon American conditions following the financial panic of
1820	DATE	show vistas of the back yard instead of the well-kept lawns , they are none the less real windows ; and after due allowance for his prejudices , the reader will find in Faux abundant repayment for opening his pages .

		The narrative of his sojourn in
Charles	LOCATION	- ton society and among interior planters fur - nishes very readable and intimate views of the life of the slaveholders , while his
Washington	LOCATION	visit opened to him an acquaintance with large land-owners from whom he drew more or less reliable accoimts of the agricultural conditions of the region .

		His data on Western agrarian economics , when checked by that of other con - temporaries , is a useful source of information on the cost of clearing lands , the profits in successive years , and kindred subjects .

		But his general attitude toward the country is sununed up in this statement : '' The American , considered as an annual , is filthy , bordering on the beastly ; as a man , he seems a being of superior capabilities .

		... All his vices and imperfections seem nat - ural ; those of the semi-barbarian .

		He is ashamed of none of them . ''

		In
Welby	PERSON	's account we have another amusing and unfavorable view of Western life .

		He jour - neyed to
Illinois	LOCATION	in a handsome phaeton and pair , attended by a groom in top-boots and on horseback .

		Naturally enough , this intrusion into backwoods taverns created consternation and resentment , and led in turn to disrespectfid remarks on the democratic and vulgar society of the frontier on the part of this English visitor .

		Several of these travellers give considerable space to the very interesting German commu - nistic experiment at Harmony in
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		All were impressed by the thrift and prosperity of the settlement , which was indeed a revelation of what combined and differentiated industrial activity could do in building up a successful economic society on the frontier .

		In this con - nection may be noted the repeated evidence that a home market developed by the rise of the little cities along the
Ohio Valley	ORGANIZATION	increased the value of lands and furnished a profitable market for the products of the adjacent regions .

		No care - ful reader of these travels can fail to see more clearly how Clay 's American System woidd ap - peal to the
West	LOCATION	.

		In general it may be said that the student of society , and the economist as well as the his - torian , can profit by the perusal of these travels .

		With all their prejudices and superficial infor - mation , they present , as it is nowhere else so well presented , the picture of society in the making in the American back country : Indian yielding to backwoodsmen ; backwoodsman selling out his little clearing on the approach of capital and civilization ; farming rapidly giving rise to cities as markets for crops , and these in turn calling into existence the mercantile and professional classes , and creating irresistible demands for manufacturing and improvements in transporta - tion .

		Hard on the heels of the woodchoppers came the academies and churches ; and then the work of social evolution had to be begun anew on a remoter frontier .

		Turning from the
Middle West	LOCATION	to the trans -
Mississippi	LOCATION	empire , a new and fascinating theme is presented ; for here American civilization was brought to its early survey of the
Great Plains	LOCATION	, the
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, and the

Phila	LOCATION	- delphia edition .

		This `` Yellowstone Expedition , '' imdertaken diu-ing
1819	DATE	and
1820	DATE	, was sent out by the
United States Government	ORGANIZATION	, with the com - bine < l purpose of extending the military posts up the ^ lissoxiri in order to ovei-awe the Indians and diminish British influence , and of fur - nishing scientific information concerning the trans-Missouri coimtry .

		The latter project was confided to Major Long , who , with a party of scientists , proceeded from
Pittsburg	LOCATION	to the Rocky Movmtains by way of the
South Platte	LOCATION	, and returned in two detachments by descending the
Arkansas	LOCATION	and the
Canadian Rivers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The party were but poorly equipped by the Gov - ernment , for the panic of
1819	DATE	compelled retrenchment .

		The scientific residts were not of enduring value , and as an exploration it was not especially productive of new discoveries , the lack of equipment preventing them from pene - trating the mountain valleys , although
James	PERSON	distinguishetl himself by making the first ascent of
Pike	ORGANIZATION	's Peak .

		By the confiising reports of Indians , Long was led to descend the Canadian under the mistaken idea that he had reached the upper waters of the
Red River	LOCATION	, which his instructions required him to explore .

		Nevei-the - less , the '' Western Engineer , '' the first steam - boat to ascend the
Missouri	LOCATION	above
Chariton	LOCATION	-LRB- near the present
Glascow	LOCATION	-RRB- , bore them along the line of advancing pioneers : and the des - criptions of this new area of frontier settlement are interesting .

		Quite as useful is the account of life in the sparse settlements between
Arkansas	LOCATION	and
St. Louis	LOCATION	, given by the returning explorers .

		Valuable also is the data on the sociology of the Indians of the plains , especially that of the Omahas .

		The most enduring result of Long 's expedition , however , was the characterization of the region of the plains as the Great American Desert , unsuited for agricultural occupation , and valuable chiefly as a western frontier bar - rier against Indians and foreign nations .

		A different type of book is Pattie 's '' Narra - tive '' of the wanderings of a trapper .

		His grandfather was a pioneer in
Kentucky	LOCATION	, serving in the frontier fighting under
Logan	LOCATION	and
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	; his father , as the editor points out , joined the Boones in the migration to Mis - souri , and in this new frontier defended block - houses against the Indians in the War of
1812	DATE	, The Patties , father and son , conducted a trading caravan up the Platte to
Santa Fe	ORGANIZATION	in
1824	DATE	, and after romantic adventures , including the rescue from the Indians of a Spanish senorita , daugh - ter of the Governor , they secured permission to trap on the
Gila River	LOCATION	.

		In this distant land , the adventurous Patties traversed the wilderness be - tween the
Big Horn	ORGANIZATION	and the
Gila	LOCATION	, until in
1827	DATE	they followed this river into
California	LOCATION	, suffering horrible hardships in the deserts before they reached
San Diego	LOCATION	.

		Here they were promptly jailed by the governor , and the elder
Pattie	PERSON	died in his cell .

		The son , after his release from prison , gives a most interesting account of
California	LOCATION	life in this period before the coming of the Amer - ican pioneer ; but his hatred of the Mexicans for the treatment which had been received no doubt colors his narrative .

		Passing into
Mexico	LOCATION	, he finally returned by way of
New Orleans	LOCATION	to
Ken	PERSON	- tucky .

		The especial value of the narrative lies in the accoimt of the life that went on in the Spanish -
American Southwest	ORGANIZATION	prior to American exploitation .

		But it has an interest from the fact that it is a weU-told story of adventure , and because Pattie broke a new trail for Americans to the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		Even more valuable for its portraiture of conditions in the arid lands is the classic '' Com - merce of the Prairies , or the Journal of a
Santa	LOCATION	Fe Trader , '' by
Josiah Gregg	PERSON	, here reproduced in two volumes .

		The work is by far the best account of the trade along the
Santa Fe Trail	ORGANIZATION	, and is at once accurate and fascinating .

		It cov - ers the period from the beginning of this trade to its interruption in
1841	DATE	, when
Mexico	LOCATION	closed the custom-houses .

United States	LOCATION	into the region he describes .

		The same abundance of maps , pictures , and valuable annotations which characterize the earlier volume are to be found in these later issues of the series .

		In spite of rare slips , such as the attribution of the

		Revival , of ax Elizabethan Poet .

		* There are few English poets as well known by name as
Drayton	PERSON	who is at the same time so little accessible to the general reader .

		Outside of libraries , it is almost impossible to get together a complete set of his works ; and the valuable selection made by Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	has long been out of print .

		Other volimies of selections have been edited by Mr.
Henry Morley	PERSON	and by
Canon Beeching	ORGANIZATION	, -- the latter 's , published as late as
1899	DATE	, heralding the manifestation of a new popular interest in the old poet who has been largely neglected save by scholars since the days of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	and
Southey	PERSON	.

		Now there are announced a new complete variorum edition of
Drayton	ORGANIZATION	's poems imder the editorship of Mr.
Arnold Glover	PERSON	, and a new selection with an introduction by Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	.

		And as an avant-courieur to this concerted attempt to restore
Drayton	PERSON	to his place of eminence in English literature , there has lately been pub - lished in
England	LOCATION	a little volume by Professor
Oliver Elton	PERSON	which will tell the prospective reader of the poetry all that is known , through the researches of modern scholarship , of the man and his work .

		Professor Elton 's essay , -- for it is scarcely more , -- is not a new piece of work , but was published ten years ago under the title of `` An Introduction to
Michael Drayton	PERSON	, '' by the
Spenser Society of Manchester	ORGANIZATION	, which had already issued various reprints of
Drayton	ORGANIZATION	's poetry .

		Owing , as the author says , to this *

		obscure method of publication , the new bio - graphical and other matter which it contains escaped the notice of recent historians of En - glish literature , including Professor Courthope . ''

		I regret , '' writes Professor Elton in his Intro - duction , `` that Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	was not saved some of the labor of his independent inquiries , and hope that my reasons may relieve him of some serious doubts he has expressed in regard to
Drayton	LOCATION	's behaviour .

		If
Drayton	PERSON	acted as Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	thinks , he was the less a gentle - man ; but if the charge is not true , no other is left against his personal character . ''

		The charge which is here referred to , and which is dealt with by Professor Elton in his first chapter , is that
Drayton	PERSON	, having originally addressed Lady Bedford as '' Idea '' in the son - nets , later , out of pure spite , transferred that name to
Anne Goodere	PERSON	,
Lady Rainsford	LOCATION	.

		A break
Drayton	PERSON	did have with
Lady Bedford	PERSON	, who had been his patron , never his mistress ; but the name '' Idea , '' as Professor Elton con - clusively shows through a rather complicated but consistent concatenation of bibliographical evidence , had never been applied to that lady by the poet , but liad , from the very start , if we are to find any concrete personality behind this abstract term at all , referred exclusively to the other lady .

		Drayton is thus saved from the im - putation of having used the same series of verse twice under the same fanciful name of address in the service of two separate love-suits .

		Professor Elton does not overlook the theory , which has of late been so prominently brought forward and strongly sujiported by Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, that
Drayton	PERSON	, in conmaon with the other Elizabethan sonneteers , wrote in a purely lit - erary convention of the Renaissance , and that '' Idea , '' instead of being
Anne Goodere	PERSON	or any other real person , is , like
Sidney	PERSON	's ''
Stella	PERSON	, '' Shakespeare 's '' Dark Lady , '' and the various other heroines of these sonnet sequences , a mere fiction required by the convention as it was taken over from French and Italian literature .

		To this theory , while allowing the weight of Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's recent discovery of the hitherto unsus - pected extent of the indebtedness of the group as a whole to
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	,
Desportes	LOCATION	,
Ronsard	ORGANIZATION	, and others .

		Professor Elton replies in the only man - ner possible for those who apprehend in their own consciousness the processes of art as modes of real experience , and who are susceptible to the charm and vitality of the best of these sequences as poetry .

		Between the two theories , -- the one , that the Elizabethan sonnets transcribed in every detail real experience , and the other , that they

		THE DIAI .

		11 are merely translations or academic exercises supplied by piKerings from foreign poets , -- there is a third way of interpreting them , that of the imaginative artist who gets his original impulse from his personal experience , but who proceeds in a mood of creative elation , filling out his frame with those themes , motives , and ex - pressions which , get them when he may , appear to him beautiful and worthy to be wrought into the work of his own heart and brain .

		Professor # lton writes most felicitously of Drayton 's son - nets in this vein : '' They are plastic experiments where the original impulse of lore or complaint is transflorured in the joy of fashioning ; much as when a man should begin to paint his mistress ' face upon a fan , but should find that it did not suit the spaces and design , and then should alter it into some happy pattern , perhaps inspired by another artist , but should stiU send her the offering as his handiwork in her honour .

		This kind of work will be undreamed of , if we forget that a shy gift may hide itself in a line of translation , or in what seems purely scholar 's practice ; that the presence of a common theme in many artists , perhaps influencing one another , is a poor proof of the insincerity of any of them ; and that the existence of weaker work on the same theme else - where or by the same hand does not prejudice the quality of a noble and graceful poem . ''

		In succeeding chapters .

		Professor Elton treats of the Satires and Odes , Later Works , and with a short critical chapter , concluding with a Bib - liography , Appendix , and an Index , that fill fully one-third of the volume .

		Here , then , is the preparation one shoidd need for the study and proper imderstanding of
Drayton	LOCATION	's volumi - nous works .

		And it may be said that if any - thing coidd find favor for Drayton in advance on the part of one unfamiliar with the poet and a little halting in his approach to such for - midable masses of verse , it woidd be Professor Elton 's happy success in striking just the right note in presenting the claims of his poet for consideration .

		These claims are certainly modest and reasonable .

		Unlike so many editors and resurrectors of neglected reputations , he does not seem to be holding a brief which he is boimd to sustain at all costs .

		He admits that Draj ` ton as a poet possessed industry rather than inspiration , although his patience and persever - ance , his fine scholarly equipment , his noble respect for his craft , and above all an inner sweetness of the man himself which yielded itself fully only as his years advanced , led him to real inspiration in more than one line and passage .

		Surely , to have ^ NTitten one i -RRB- erfect sonnet , and to have approached
Sidney	PERSON	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and Shake - speare in others ; to have invented the form of the Heroical and of the Ode or Ballad ; to have been the author of
Nympkidia	LOCATION	; to have prac - tised with some measure of success nearly every other form of composition known to his time , including forms so remote from each other as the epical narrative and the verse drama , -- surely to have done these things was to have accomplished something to make him worthy of remembrance among the greater men with whom he lived .

		He was in all respects a representa - tive Elizabethan , -- perhaps , judging by the scope and diversity of his work , the most repre - sentative , -- indicating best of all , certainly better than
Shakespeare	PERSON	, the general level of cidtivation and the general aims and tendencies of the age in letters .

		And he had that in him , too , which made him representative of even more than his age : his intense and ardent patriotism , which constitutes him , more than almost any other English poet , the national bard of
Britain	LOCATION	.

		Other greater English poets have dedicated their most glowing numbers to love of country ; but never has one lived so exclusively at the moment of inspiration in this pervading patriotism , or made inspiration so exclusively coextensive with patriotic enthusiasm as he .

		Hence has been shaped the kind of recognition which has been most freely accorded him . ''

		Xo poet , '' writes one critic -LRB- Mr.
Bullen	PERSON	-RRB- , '' is more thoroughly English than
Michael Drayton	PERSON	; there is not a poem in our literature that breathes a finer spirit of patriotism than the ' Ballad of
Agincourt	ORGANIZATION	' ; and who loved better than the author of the ' Poly-olbion ' all the highways and byways of
England	LOCATION	, its lulls and dales , its woods and streams ? ''

		The ' Poly-olbion ' is indeed , for the Briton of to-day , now that the face of
England	LOCATION	is sadly scarred since
Drayton	PERSON	's time with iron rails and hideous factory towns , a kind of sacred reposi - tory of her pristine beauty and freshness .

		There England lives again as once she was before a material and progressive age had all but dried up the founts of poesy at her heart .

		It was the heart of Drayton that spoke through the lips of
Ruskin	LOCATION	, when that apostle of beauty and of na - ture poured forth his jeremiads over
England	LOCATION	's sylvan and pastoral defilement .

		Hence the more than merely surface significance of the revival , at this time , of work which has so long been allowed to slumber in old folios and scarce reprints .

Upton	PERSON	and
Miss Kelley	PERSON	, in their collab - orated work entitled `` Remenyi , Musician and Man , '' have given us a book about a musician rather than a work on music .

		The personal element presses strongly forward in every page .


Edouard Remenyi	PERSON	was incapable of classification ; as a violinist he represented himseK , not a school .

		With splendid technical equipment , he played with all his soul ; and so at times was carried away by his impetuous temperament to extrava - gant results .

		It was the custom in some critical quarters to stigmatize him as a sort of inspired charlatan who knew how to play all sorts of tricks on his violin for the popular edification .

		Nothing covdd have been farther from the truth .

		The same charge has been made against all artists who had eccentric manners or yielded in any unusual degree to the claims of a fiery nature .

		Paganini had to meet it ; so had Von Biilow ; so has De Pachmann .

		Remenyi was a trained and versatile musician who knew the classic literature of the violin and loved to play it to the people .

		He will always have the praise which belongs to those who have moved many thousands of souls with pure delight , and moved them deeply .

		Knowing , as he did , many of the great men of our times , -- among them the musicians
Wagner	PERSON	,
Brahms	PERSON	,
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	,
Joachim	PERSON	, RafP , and others , -- it is to be regretted that
Remenyi	PERSON	did not write his memoirs , as he often talked of doing .

		In his later years he was a welcome guest at the home of Miss
Gwendolyn Kelley	PERSON	in
Columbus	LOCATION	, and became a warm friend of both herself and her mother .

		To
Miss Kelley	PERSON	were entrusted many of his let - ters and other biogi'aphical documents , with the intention of some day using them in making a story of his life .

		That hope was frustrated by his sudden death at
San Francisco	LOCATION	in
1898	DATE	; but
Miss Kelley	PERSON	, knowing his purpose , made as fidl a collection of material as possible , added her own graceful tribute of admiration , together with one from her mother , and secured , to edit the whole , the practised hand of Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	, the well-known musical critic and author , of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The result is , accordingly , a cento of impressions , sketches , letters , anecdotes , in which , after all , we get a pretty clear idea of the ardent , whimsical , somewhat vain , but quite sim - ple and lovable nature of the man .

		THE DIAL 13 Three Mex of the Rexascexce .

		* Any promising addition to the very limited number of books in English on the Renascence is sui-e of a cordial welcome among students of literatui-e and students of history alike .

		In his '' Renascence Portraits , '' Professor
Paul Van Dyke	PERSON	has contributed a book of substantial value to all students of that interesting but often misinterpreted movement .

		The volume is an attempt to illustrate the Renascence by the de - scription of thi-ee men who were affected by it , typically and contemporaneously , in
Italy	LOCATION	, En - gland , and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		These men are
Pietro Aretino	ORGANIZATION	, the Venetian satii-ist , whom Biu-ckhardt calls the founder of modern joiu * nalism ;
Thomas Cromwell	PERSON	, the powerfid \ acar-general of Henry the Eighth ; and
Maximilian I.	PERSON	, the first German Emperor trained under the New Learning .

		The three '' portraits * ' which make up the bidk of the voliune are biogi-aphical studies embo < l -RCB- Tng the well-authenticated residts of carefid research , and they are given a style of treatment which makes them enjoyable reading .

		The author be - lieves that the writer of history may worthily aspire to something more than scientific exact - ness ; he has succeeded in his own avowed pur - pose to be interesting .

		The initial essay is concerned with an expo - sition of what the Renascence was .

		Against the popidar idea , the author expresses his \ aews m these words : '' The Renascence was not an equivalent to the revival of classic antiquity .

		Nowhere has the undue liking of writers on history for memoi-able , sharp , and picturesque statements made more plain its evU effects upon popular misconceptions than in this matter .

		Large numbers of educated people believe that the Renascence began with the fall of
Constantinople	LOCATION	, which di-ove a crowd of Greek teachers into
Italy	LOCATION	and so reArived the knowledge of the classic world -- mother of arts , literature , and learning . ''

		The fallacy of this popidar idea of the Re - nascence becomes quite apparent when one remembers that
Petrarch	PERSON	, the '' first of the mod - ems '' and the more notable of his confreres of the early Renascence in
Italy	LOCATION	, were all dead or very old men by
1453	DATE	.

		What bearing , there - fore , had the recovery of classic ciAalization upon the Renascence movement ?

		On this point the author 's words afford a direct answer : '' The truth is that the influence of classic antiquity in the art , the langiiage and the literature of
Rome	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	was only the means of accomplishing the Re - nascence ideal . ''

		Again he observes : '' The end of the men of the Italian Reuascence was • Renascence Portraits .

Paul Van Dyke	PERSON	,

Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		New a broader and more human culture of the mind , their favorite means the study of classic antiquity , but neither their means nor their end was the source of the impulse which moved them . ''

		This impulse is explained as '' a revival of the love of truth and beautj ' , making men more sen - sitive to the world around them and quicker to respond to its glories of form and color with vi \ dd emotions of pleasure . ''

		This revival foimd in the uncovering of classic cvdture a '' new and better means of expression . ''

		This is a some - what more direct statement of the same view that is presented by such authorities as
Burck	PERSON	- hardt and
Symonds	PERSON	, and by almost every recent writer on the Middle Age .

		Yet one finds a scholar of no less eminence than
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, in his brilliant essay 's on sixteenth century En - glishmen , tending to emphasize the causal , rather than the instrmnental , importance of the clas - sical discovery in the Renascence of
Western Europe	LOCATION	.

		With no disposition to fall into a meta - physical defense of his position .

		Professor Van Dyke states his belief that '' to use the word Renascence intelligently , we must see behind it the men of the Renascence '' ; that whether it be true that man helps to make his history or is made by it , '' we act as if it were true that he helps to make it , '' and he contends that to assume that personality is a leatling factor in the life of our own day justifies the assump - tion of its potency in the life of the sixteenth century .

		It is to the author 's credit that he has given us , in his first Portrait , the fullest and most trustworthy account of
Pietro Aretino	ORGANIZATION	to be found in English .

		Aretino has received but brief treatment at the hands of
Symonds	PERSON	and
Burck	PERSON	- hardt : and much new light has been thrown on his character since their works were written .

		His importance as an illustration of the spirit of the later Italian Renascence is very great .

		Well known to Englishmen in
Addison	LOCATION	's day , the fame , or rather the ill-fame , of this remark - able sycophant gradually lapsed into obscurity , until to-day , even among the etlucated , he is scarcely known by name .

		The researches of Italian scholars have recently made the writings of this erstwhile '' Perverter of morals and let - ters '' accessible to the extent to which they have sur \ aved , so that it is now possible to study
Aretino	ORGANIZATION	soberlj ^ in the light of the diseased age in which he lived .

		Aretino spent the
last thirty years	DATE	of his life in
Venice	LOCATION	, where he died in
1557	DATE	.

		Unaided by a knowledge of the himianities , he developed in the vernacidar a style of expression remarkable 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, for its facility and power .

		His mastery of pas - quinade made him in truth the '' Scourge of Princes . ''

		He reduced invective and eulogy to a successful commercial system .

		The dread or pleasure which his pen inspired became a con - tinual source of revenue from the official incum - bents of both church and state .

		His knowledge of the crimes and rumors of crimes chargeable to the priests and princes of
Europe	LOCATION	made it desir - able for them to keep the facts of their careers out of his Giudizi , periodically circulated and eagerly read .

		On the principle that ofPenders hate publicity , he demanded gifts from promis - ing victims as a condition of his silence or eulogy .


Henry VIII.	PERSON	,
Francis I.	PERSON	, and
Charles V.	PERSON	were among those who pensioned him ; such was the power of the press in its incipiency !

		He was always ready to confer immortality for a sub - sidy -- an exchange of '' servitu '' for '' cortesia . ''

		In return for generous treatment , he thus writes to
Barbarossa	LOCATION	, pirate prince of Algiers : '' The sun envies you because the glory of the fame which crowns you with eternal praise goes into those parts of the world where the light of the flame which he offers can not go . ''


Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		's liberality is rewarded by similar grandiloquence of praise .

		An instance of
Aretino	ORGANIZATION	's failure of reward is afforded in
Michaelangelo	LOCATION	's admirable indifference to his request for some sketches ; but the great artist was punished by a seriously phrased denunciation of the nudities in the '' Last Judgment . ''

		In hiring himself out as a giver of immor - tality ,
Aretino	ORGANIZATION	illustrates the '' common weak - ness of the men of that day , an insatiable desire for fame . ''

		His own words best express this `` characteristic passion of the age '' : '' I do not know the pleasures misers feel in the sound of the gold they count , but I know well that the blessed spirits do not hear music which is more gratefid than the harmony that comes out of one 's own praises .

		One feeds on it as in
Para	LOCATION	- dise the souls feed on the vision of God . ''

		As a writer ,
Aretino	ORGANIZATION	was prolific and ver - satile .

		His works include comedies , obscene sonnets , and pornographic dialogues which he maintained were '' a warning to virtue and an exposure of vice . ''

		His religious writings in - clude a life of Christ and the lives of several mediaeval saints .

		Presumably he wrote about six thousand letters , of which more than half have survived .

		It is , of course , in these that Professor
Van Dyke	PERSON	has found his best material for exhibiting
Aretino	ORGANIZATION	's curious personality .

		To portray personality is the supreme task of the biographer 's art .

		To gather and judge facts is one thing ; it is quite another to frame them fitly into an individuality , so tliat a reader of ordinary imagination may receive a trustworthy impression of the character that is interpreted for him .

		The task is well-nigh baffling when the material at the biographer 's disposal is practically void of the personal ele - ment .

		Such a difficulty opposes itself to the historian of
Thomas Cromwell	PERSON	.

		About seven thousand letters and documents about him are calendared in the
State Papers of Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		's reign , but he has left us no personal record of his motives .

		Such is not the case with his great namesake and kinsman ,
Oliver	PERSON	.

		Professor
Van Dyke	PERSON	's fresh and independent study of the great minister -- based on a personal examination of these letters and state papers -- is on the whole sympathetic and vindicatory .

		He believes that
Cromwell	PERSON	was neither so incredibly bad as most of his contemporaries thought him to be , nor so great and good as , for instance ,
Froude	PERSON	's extravagant estimate woidd imply .

		He sees in
Cromwell	LOCATION	a man of the Renascence able to discern
England	LOCATION	's need of a strong national government , and strong enough to employ the truculent methods of the time in devising and executing a definite programme of reform .

		This programme embraced the overthrow of papal authority by making
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		supreme head of the church ; the displacing of the old ascetic and political ecclesiasticism by the protest-ideal ; and the final destruction of the declining feudal nobility .

		In thus centralizing the power of the sovereign ,
Cromwell	PERSON	employed and preserved the Parliamentary sanction .

		He strove to re - place the Old Learning by the New ; and hav - ing embittered the king by his attitude toward the distastefiil marriage with the German prin - cess , he fell a sudden victim of the courtly party , who were not only his personal enemies , but were unwilling to share his manifest sympathy for the transition of
England	LOCATION	from the mediaeval to the modem idea of the state .

		The essay on CromweU embodies the conclu - sions of Professor Van Dyke 's criticism of Car - dinal Pole 's portrait of
Cromwell	PERSON	m the Apologia ^ written in
1539	DATE	to urge
Charles V.	PERSON	to invade
England	LOCATION	and '' force it from schism to obedi - ence . ''

		This criticism , first published in the '' American Historical Review , '' is reproduced in an appendix to the volume .

		In it , Professor Van Dyke presents an elaborate and fairly sat - isfactory argument to disprove Pole 's contention that
Cromwell	PERSON	's diabolism was inspired by Ma - cliiavelli 's II Principe .

		Cromwell 's portrait in
Fox 's Book of Martjrrs	ORGANIZATION	, as a '' Martyr of the
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 Gospel , '' is likewise shown to be untrustworthy .

		Both estimates were outgrowths of the violent polemic spirit which attended the breaking up of the old conditions in
England	LOCATION	to make place for the new .

		The essay on Alaximilian I. affords a schol - arly and readable illustration of the crude con - ditions under which the German Renascence moved forward .

		An account of the inchoate political confederacy which was
Germany	LOCATION	's in - heritance from mediaevalism forms a clearly - sketched background for the author 's portrait of the picturesque but inefficient Hapsburg em - peror .

		Although much care had been given to his education ,
Maximilian	PERSON	shared but little of the real humanistic spirit , and was thoroughly mediaeval as a ruler .

		This aspect Professor Van Dyke makes clearer than most \ s ` riters on the Renascence in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Maximilian gave some encouragement to the universities , and possessed a passion for art : he even found time for such literary composition and dictation as his Haps - burg pride was capable of ; but the material for the four allegorical works for which he is directly or indirectly responsible -- Weisskunig .

		Teuer - dank .

		The Triimiphed Arch , and The Triumphal Procession -- savor of the medifeval rather than of the modem taste .

		He manifested no intelli - gent interest in the Reformation .

		He failed to recognize the awakening national consciousness of his people , and their growing aspiration for reform in church and state .

		The inherited fan - tasy of the Holy Roman Empire fed his thirst for personal distinction and family aggrandize - ment , and blinded him to the demands of his time for a stronglv-organized internal adminis - tration of authority .

		He was happiest when hunting , dancing , or leading an army upon some foreign conquest .

		He had no taste for construc - tive statesmanship , and was a complete failure in matters of finance .

		The Renascence forces slowly gathering were his opportunity to become the national leader of a people evidently moving toward modernism in its ideals .

		But whatever interest he had in his patronage of Renascence tendencies ' • grew fix -RRB- m the hope of presenting his figure to posterity as the greatest member of the glorious house of
Hapsburg	LOCATION	, and illus - trating the lessons of his example to descendants who might raise the dynasty to the heights of power where his day-dreams had placed it . ''

		Of American historians , Professor Van Dyke has given us the most important contribution to the literature of the Renascence .

		^ \ Tiat in his earlier work he did for the general reader , he has done in these ' '' Renascence Portraits '' for the student .

		It is a book that will be read with much satisfaction and profit by everyone inter - ested in the great transition movement from mediaeval to modem life , x i ?

		His discovery of the

1799	DATE	, was one of the two permanent and bene - ficial results of his Egyptian campaign .

		For it was by the decipherment of that unique docu - mentary relic of antiquity that
Champollion	PERSON	and other decipherers introduced to us the Ancient Egyptians .

		Explorers , excavators , archaeolo - gists , linguists and historians have been unroll - ing their history for nearly a century .

		Temples , tombs , pyramids and papyri have almost poured their treasures into the laps of those laborers .

		Every season 's work is filled with surprises ; every new campaign of exploration and excava - tion yields some results that help bridge the chasm between the known and vmknown in the long stretch of Egyptian time .

		The wealth and abundance of the material gathered during the last century have increased with every decade .

		Its scope has included history , science , religion , poHtics , and social customs .

		Time and again scholars have prepared , on the basis of discover - ies , elaborate treatises , discussions , and extended histories of that great Oriental people .

		But the new facts found even in one decade require another re-casting and re-Avriting to be commen - surate with our newly discovered knowledge .

July 1	DATE	, sion of the very best material available .

		That he might utilize to the fullest extent the latest improvements and results of research , he per - sonally translated the entire body of known Egyptian inscriptions ; and these translations are now appearing in four volumes from the Uni - versity of
Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		This material forms the basis of his present '' History of
Egypt	LOCATION	. ''

		The entire sweep of time covered by the vol - ume stretches from
4241	DATE	B. C. to 525 B. C , or from the introduction of the calendar year , '' the earliest fixed date in the history of the world , '' down to the conquest of
Egypt	LOCATION	by the Persians .

		This period of time is discussed under eight books , -- 1 , Introduction ; 2 , The Old Kingdom ; 3 ,
The Middle Kingdom	LOCATION	, The Feudal Age ; 4 , The Hyksos , The Rise of the Empire ; 5 , The Empire ,
First Period	ORGANIZATION	; 6 , The Empire , Second Period ; 7 , The Decadence ; 8 , The Resto - ration and the End .

		The most startling discover - ies of the
last decade fall	DATE	within the scope of the first two books .

		Histories of
Egypt	LOCATION	written more than ten years ago began authentic history after the time of the reputed Menes . ''

		Menes the Good , '' the foimder of
Memphis	LOCATION	, was said , in
1894	DATE	, by Professor
Maspero	PERSON	-LRB- '' DaAvn of Civili - zation , '' p. 234 -RRB- to have owed '' his existence to a popidar attempt at etymology . ''

		Again he says , '' The two Thinite dynasties , in direct descent from the fabulous
Menes	PERSON	, furnish , like this hero himself , only a tissue of romantic tales and miracidous legends in the place of history '' -LRB- p. 237 -RRB- .

		At this date , however , we not only know that
Menes	PERSON	was a historical character , but we have an abundance of his personal effects -- some of which may be seen in the HaskeU
Oriental Museum of the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		More than this .

		Professor
Petrie	PERSON	's excavations have produced evidence of the existence of sev - eral kings who rided previous to the establish - ment of the so-called first dynasty .

		These finds have pushed back the historical beginning of
Egypt	LOCATION	more than seven hundred years , even on the basis of the calendar year introduced in
4241	DATE	B. C .

		The third book , on '' The
Middle Kingdom	LOCATION	, '' contains some new material , though less than the first two books .

		The feudal age is described with ample fvdness as that in which the empire finally expanded and began to reach beyond its ancient boundaries and to aspire to the position of world rulers .

		On the Hyksos period , treated in the fourth book , we have next to no new light .

		Josephus , some fragments of antiquities , and an occasional reference or hint , constitute the bulk of our sources for an accoimt of that Asiatic domination of the
Nile Valley	ORGANIZATION	which stretches over 208 years of time .

		But the historian is at his best in treating the XVIIIth and XlXth dynasties -- The Empire .

		Here we have a plethora of information touching almost every phase of Egyptian life .

		The discoveries of the last decade have given us a new conception of the glory of the XVIIIth dynasty .

		The uncovering of the
Der el Bahri	ORGANIZATION	temple of
Queen Hatshepsut	PERSON	has unlocked many of the mysteries of that remarkable woman 's power and reign .

		The relations of the XlXth dynasty to
Asia	LOCATION	and to the Hittites constitutes one of the chief inter - ests of that period .

		To Rameses II .

		and to his tremendous energy in erecting monuments are due the vivid pictures that we have of that epoch .

		Professor Breasted has sho ^ vn remarkable skill in weaving together the scattered fragments of information that we possess covering the whole period of his treatment ; and the result is a vigorous , popidar , and highly interesting narra - tive account -- even though sometimes severely condensed -- of the political , religious , and social life of the ancient Egyptians .

		The type used in the volume is large and clear , and the text is not burdened with references -- these appearing as footnotes .

		The volume is rather profusely illustrated with half-tones and etchings of scenes and antiquities that are connected directly with the narrative .

		Another edition shoidd correct these errors : Figure 26 , opposite page 42 , is upside down ; map 11 , page 444 , is also inverted ; a few misprints , as '' called '' for '' call , '' line 9 from bottom of page 80 , and '' born '' for ' ' borne , '' line 8 , page 123 .

		The publishers have done their part excellently , but they should give a book of this weight a firmer binding .

		Professor
Flinders Petrie	PERSON	is now the Nestor among active living excavators .

		He has dug out of the tombs and tumuli of
Egypt	LOCATION	a vast amount of antiquities , that have proved to be new chap - ters in the history of Old
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		His skill , both as an excavator and an Egyptian scholar , has given him the advantage of being able to utilize his discoveries at once .

		His work in the present volume reveals an exhaustive knowledge of the antiquities , including inscriptions , of Old
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		But the narrative is not popidar in character .

		It is rather a complete index of every known historical monument that belongs to the XlXth and succeeding dynasties through the XXXth , with a careful and scholarly estimate of its character and contents .

		The atmosphere of the book is studious and learned .

		It requires patient , thoughtful , concentrated effort to read

		THE DIAL 17 it and get out of it the best that it contains .

		It is not history in the popular sense of that term , but is rather a chronological arrangement of the materials out of which a running narrative could be constructed .

		As a compendiimi , it is inval - uable to the scholar .

		The book Ls well illustrated by 155 beautiful reproductions of seals , statues , monuments , and inscriptions , belonging to the period that it covers .

		The first two voliunes of the series to which Professor
Petrie	PERSON	's work be - longs appeared several years ago , and brought the history down to the close of the X ^ ^ IIth dynasty .

		The succeeding volumes of the series are to be on
Ptolemaic Egypt	LOCATION	, by Professor
J. P. Mahaify	PERSON	;
Roman Egypt	LOCATION	, by Mr.
J. G. MUne	PERSON	: and Arabic

		Professor
Georg Steindorff	PERSON	, of the
University of Leipzig	ORGANIZATION	, delivered , in the
spring of last year	DATE	, the fifth course of lectures in the '' American Lectures on the History of Religions . ''

		A spe - cialist himself , and dealing with his material at first-hand , he gives us his own interpretation of the phenomena of religion as he finds them in the monuments of
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		There were no peoples in antiquity which were more deeply religious than were the Egj ^ tians .

		It permeated their actions and controlled their conduct .

		The mass of religious ritual , amidets , charms , divinities , temples , are but the externals of the thoughts and beliefs that swayed their lives .

		The abund - ance of religious texts that now speak to vis of their thoughts are relatively meagre in definite information .

		In the earliest times , we find local divinities on the one hand and cosmic beings on the other , standing at an infinite distance from man .

		As time went on , these two became blended by theological speculation ; and from that com - bination we discover an almost new religion .

		The sim-god -LRB- Atum -RRB- of On or
Heliopolis	LOCATION	was the first divinity to enter into special relations with the hiunan race , and to receive special wor - ship .

		By a process of reasoning , the sun-god that soared in the heavens was regarded as one and the same in essence as he .

		In a similar manner , they everywhere united local deities and cosmic beings until there was evolved a unique religion .

		But the most striking element in the Egyptian religion was their conception of life after death .

		This idea modified not only their whole lives , but shows itself in all their funeral customs , and in their elalx -RRB- rate tombs and burial - places .

		The l > elief in the transmigration of souls likewise permeated all their ideas of the here - after .

		Professor
SteindorfF	PERSON	's lectures are com - paratively comprehensive of all the light we have on Egyptian religion , set forth in popular and readable but distinctly scholarly terms .

		We are extremely fortunate to receive from the press the sources of Professor Breasted 's '' History of
Egypt	LOCATION	'' in his '' Ancient Records of
Egypt	LOCATION	. ''

		This latter work is appearing in four volumes , three of which are already out , and will present in translations aU the known historical documents from the earliest times to the Persian conquest .

		The author has wisely introduced his translations by discussing , in the initial volume , with sufficient detail , the documentary sources of Egyptian history and the chronology ; and he has also included therein a chronological table .

		The first volume embraces the material from the first to the seventeenth dynasties .

		The earliest date said to be fixed in Egyptian history is 4241 B. C , the time of the introduction of the Egyptian calendar .

		Under this scheme ,
Menes	PERSON	, the first king of the first dynasty , began to rule 3400 B. C , and succeeding dynasties and reigns follow in such order that each can be almost exactly dated .

		This fact gives great satisfaction to the student of history .

		Thence through this volume the author gives under sepa - rate sections a translation of each little inscrip - tion of each year , so far as found , of each king 's reign .

		In some places the section is almost bar - ren , because of lack of material or of its broken character .

		To make the matter more significant .

		Professor Breasted describes each inscription before translating it , and in footnotes gives textual remarks or references so that the reader may verify his statements .

		Volume II .

		presents translations of all the known inscriptions of the eighteenth dynasty -- one of the two most productive periods of Egyptian history .

		This large volume is replete with the marvellous documents of the reigns of
Thutmose III	ORGANIZATION	.

		and his half-sister queen .

		We can trace through these inscriptions the won - derfid seventeen campaigns of Thutmose , as he sweeps the plains of
Western Asia	LOCATION	and makes his influence felt over in the
Mesopotamian Valley	LOCATION	.

		We can also trace in outline the steps by which the religion of
Western Asia	LOCATION	invaded the sacred precincts of the gods of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, and possibly , in a later age , contributed to the overthrow of that powerful dynasty .

		I The third volume deals likewise with a single dynasty , the nineteenth .

		The largest contribu - j tions to our knowledge of any one monarch of i this dynasty are the known records of Rameses 18 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, II .

		The number of wars , conquests , temples , statues , and palaces of that monarch are almost incredible .

		With an indomitable energy he perpetuated his name and fame in almost every available space in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		These translations , as none before , convince the reader of the vast significance of his career in the history of that period .

		Such source-books are invaluable to the stu - dent of Egyptian history , and serve as the chief basis of the popular work reviewed above .

		Thepersonaiuv '' The True
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, '' by of Andrew Mr.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	, is the
Jackson	PERSON	.

		seventh of the series of '' True Biog - raphies '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Like the other volumes of the series , this one aims simply to present a per - sonality , and not to furnish a complete life with a discussion of the military and political events of the time in which the subject lived .

		The topics treated will exhibit the compass of the work :
Jackson	PERSON	's family and his early life ;
Jackson	PERSON	as lawyer , planter , soldier , politician ; his manners and personal appear - ance ; his devotion to mother and wife , his respect for women and kindness to children ; his pugnacity , his patriotism , his duels and quarrels .

		The book is well illustrated , and the .

		appendix contains a paper on the birthplace of Jackson by Mr.
A. S. Salley , Jr.	PERSON	, of
South Carolina	LOCATION	, some nullification documents ,
Jackson	PERSON	's farewell address , and his last will and testament .

		A usefid chronology is also given .

		Mr.
Brady	PERSON	has evidently made use of all available ma - terial in print , and in constructing his account he has drawn heavily upon former biographers of '' Old Hickory '' --
Parton	PERSON	,
Buell	PERSON	,
Sumner	PERSON	,
Colyar	PERSON	, and
Brown	PERSON	, besides the general historians who deal with the Jacksonian period , such as
Roosevelt	LOCATION	,
Peck	PERSON	, and
Schouler	PERSON	.

		From these sources have been drawn anecdotes , opinions , estimates , so numerous that the reviewer is tempted to assert that not a single in - teresting one has escaped .

		And here is one fault of the book : -- there is too much quotation , and the result is too much like a scrap-book .

		We are glad to have the stories and opinions of
Jackson	PERSON	's contemporaries , but there is no need of an array of estimates from Mr.
Brady	PERSON	's contemporaries .

		Mr.
Brady	PERSON	has made a closer study of
Jackson	PERSON	than most of the recent authorities quoted by him , and his judgment , not theirs , should have been given .

		Many of these extracts are practically duplicates ; too many of them are not labelled as to source .

		The historical structure is unusually sound , in this respect the work ranking among the best of the series .

		The author has a correct conception of the forces at work in the
West	LOCATION	, and has rightly estimated the importance of
Jackson	PERSON	's environment in relation to his career in war and politics .

		There is a tendency toward hero - worship -- a slight Jacksonian disposition to under - rate
Jackson	PERSON	's opponents ; but this is useful to offset such unfriendly accounts as that of Sumner , whom our author handles without gloves .

		In view of Mr.
Brady	PERSON	's understanding of the Southwestern frontier spirit of expansion , we hardly expect to find him say - ing that as a result of the battle of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, '' to
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	is due the vital fact that the western boundary of the
United States	LOCATION	is the
Pacific	LOCATION	and not the
Mississippi	LOCATION	'' ; also , understanding
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	as he does , he should be able to explain hi '' hero 's attitude toward the annexation of
Texas	LOCATION	, -- '' oiu * national iniquity , '' as he calls it , seemingly unmindfid of oiu * later and far greater transgressions .

		But in spite of such defects as those noted , the book is a live and interesting one ; the author 's method and his love for his subject have made it the most readable life of
Jackson	PERSON	since
Parton	PERSON	's , and it has the advantage of
Parton	ORGANIZATION	's in being shorter .

		Lives of two
Edyard Grieg	ORGANIZATION	is probably the most living masters eminent of living composers -- pace of music .


Camille Saint-Saens	PERSON	; and although he has reached his '' grand climacteric , '' being sixty - three this year , curiously enough no connected account of his life and personality and works has been written in English .

		His countless admirers will therefore welcome the compact little biography con - tributed to the '' Living Masters of Music '' series -LRB-
John Lane	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- by Mr.
Henry T. Finck	PERSON	, the well-known musical critic .

		Its 130 pages contain just what one would most wish to know about the Norwegian mas - ter -- his childhood , education , originality of genius , and relation to other composers ; together with vari - ous photographs , f ac-similes of music , and a complete bibliography by opus numbers of all his compositions to date .

		It is not generally known that
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	is of Scottish descent -- pretty well back ; and that the name originally was
Greig	PERSON	, as it is so often misspelled now .

		Mr.
Finck	PERSON	's admiration for his musical heroes is hard to restrain within moderate limits ; it is like Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	talking of
Marlowe	ORGANIZATION	, or
Victor Hugo	PERSON	when he says of Solvejg 's Cradle Song in ''
Peer Gynt	PERSON	, '' `` I would not give it for all the songs of
Brahms	ORGANIZATION	, Hugo ,
Wolf	PERSON	, and
Richard Strauss	PERSON	, put to - gether .

		The creative thrill of delight which
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	must have felt when he penned the last twelve bars of this song -- which have not their equal in more than twelve other songs ever composed -- surely atoned for all the disappointments of his life . ''

		This is pretty strong ; but , for all that , the book is a sound and sympathetic study of this great son of the North .

		-- Another interesting book in the same series is the sketch of
Theodor Leschetizky	PERSON	, the great Viennese teacher of the piano , by Miss
Annette HxiUah	PERSON	.

		Of Bohemian and Polish parentage ,
Leschetizky	PERSON	was musically endowed from birth , and as a Wunderkind made the usual sensation by his public performances at the age of nine .

		At fourteen he began to take pupils himself ; and ever since then -- for more than sixty years -- he has been beset by eager students

		THE DIAL .

		19 from all parts of the world .

		The story of this con - centrated career is well and clearly told hy
Miss Hullah	PERSON	, who makes the discriminating point that
Leschetizky	PERSON	is emphatically an individualist in his work : '' Less philanthropic than his friend
Rubin	PERSON	- stein , he has preferred to work in a smaller field .

		He would devote himself heart and soul to watching and tending the unfolding of any young talent , but not to the education of the masses ; and it is well that it is so , for otherwise a specialist would have been lost to the world .

		His chief care was that each pupU entrusted to him should develop to the best of his abilitj ' ; if pianism in general incidentally bene - fited by the system of study he had built up , so much the better . ''

		The deadlv '' ^ * ^ * ^ ^ ^ S ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ t ^ ^ legalized strife w
$ uteof	MONEY	for gold , '' says Mr.
Sidney C. Reeve	PERSON	, competition .

		u ^ hich is the root of all evil . ''

		The institution of ' • barter '' and the resultant '' competi - tive system '' have indeed many sins to answer for , if all be true that this author says throughout the six hundred pages of ' • The Cost of Competition '' -LRB- McOure ,
PhiUips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The first half of the book treats the economic cost , in contradistinction to the ethical cost , and the future of competition .

		That economics , as a science , is as yet in a very crude stage of development , is sadly impressed upon the reader , who can not forbear wishing that writers on this subject would adopt a standard terminology , and in so doing omit new definitions whose distinc - tions from old ones are apt to seem arbitrary and are certainly confusing .

		Mr.
Reeve	PERSON	, however , start - ing with his own definitions , builds up a perfectly consistent system of economics , pointing out , by means of statement and diagram , the waste of pro- ductive energj ' in the present system of exchange .

		His arguments are convincingly stated , and perhaps the only barrier to the reader 's conviction is the absence of statistical proof , which the author depre - cates as '' the weakest method of all . ''

		In the second part of the book , Mr.
Reeve	PERSON	estimates the ethical cost of competition , and its effect , especially upon the community ' .

		This cost , he would lead us to be - lieve , is so tremendous that half-way reforms are futile , and the only remedy is the adoption of co - ordination and communitj ' - ownership of all value produced .

		This economic transformation he confi - dently predicts for the near future : it is , indeed , the only hope of a man who says that he is `` pal - pably , absolutely sure that all want , the great bulk of all crime , and an enormous proportion of all sin , sorrow , and ugliness , are the inevitable fruit of a single artificial and irremediable but indestructible institution : Barter . ''

		Hence all nature , it would seem to us , escapes without its share of responsibility in this indictment ; and we can not agree ■ with 31r .

		Reeve to the extent of believing that economic forces are the only sources of ethical results .

		Why
Mrs Emily J. Climenson	PERSON	, the '' great-great-niece '' of Mrs.
Elizabeth Montagu	PERSON	, '' Queen of the Blue-Stockings , '' should feel called upon to issue two large volumes -LRB- which bear the imprint of
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of that lady 's correspondence , when we have at least five volumes already , is not apparent to one who is neither a
Robinson	PERSON	nor a
Montagu	ORGANIZATION	.

		False dates in some of the
Montagu	ORGANIZATION	letters published by the present editor 's grandfather ,
Baron Rokeby	PERSON	, have been cor - rected ; but exactly how many of the letters in this collection are here printed for the first time , one could tell only by a laborious comparison of Mrs.
Climenson	PERSON	's pages with
Lord Rokeby	ORGANIZATION	's , and with perhaps a dozen other publications containing por - tions , large or small , of Mrs.
Montagu	PERSON	's correspond - ence , -- and the game is not worth the candle , or , in this case , the
midnight	TIME	oil and the strain on the eyes .

		We are told that if all the letters were pub - lished they would fill a large bookcase ; so that presumably many fresh pages are here opened to the reader .

		Not a few letters to Mrs.
Montagu	PERSON	are also included , and the interspersed narrative matter and accompanying footnotes are all that could be expected of a painstaking editor .

		She hopes , if life is spared her , to continue her labors at some future time , pausing here with the year
1761	DATE	, thirty-nine years before her distinguished kinswoman 's death .

		As a portrait gallery , the volumes are attractive , with their twent -RCB- ' - f our reproductions from
Reynolds	PERSON	,
Lawrence	LOCATION	,
Opie	LOCATION	,
Hogarth	PERSON	,
Hudson	LOCATION	, and other artists ; and to the genealogical enthusiast the opening pages of family historj - , and the large folder showing the
Robinson	PERSON	pedigree , will prove choice reading .

		Of Mrs.
Montagu	PERSON	's acknowledged merits as a letter - writer -- despite Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's poor opinion of her intellectual equipment -- it is unnecessary here to say anything .

		Education at Through the translation -- acceptable the German though not masterly -- of Professor univertttie * .


Paulsen	PERSON	's comprehensive volume upon `` German Universities '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a significant contribution to the American 's knowledge of Grer - man education has been rendered accessible .

		The book presents an adequate historical survey of the development of the German universities , -- a story that on the whole shows how few of the essential characteristics of these seats of learning are properly ascribed to their age .

		Modern education is as mod - ern in one countrj - as another ; and the American who takes comfort for the deficiencies of Amer - ican universities by leaving their shortcomings to their youth is resting his judgment upon illusive sup - port .

		An account of the modern characteristics of a German universitj - is followed by a detailed ac - count of the spirit and methods of university instruc - tion , by an equally careful rSsumS of the student life , , and by a less pertinent -LRB- to American readers -RRB- ac - count of the ways and purposes of the several facul -
20	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, ties .

		While useful and authoritative , the volume is not wholly suited to English i-eaders , and suggests that a book specially written for their needs would be a more efficient means of promoting an acquaintance and a comprehension of German universities than is afforded by this translation .

		Professor
Paulsen	PERSON	's critical and painstaking analyses of points and argu - ments that appeal only to the German in his more technical moods mar the perspective of the work for the American reader .

		At the same time , they serve to present the perspective of importance to the Ger - man mind , and empliasize the great differences of problem and point of view that the educational stu - dents of the two countries have to face .

		The trans - lation is welcome , but does not lessen the need for a volume that shall present the story of the German universities in a way adapted to the American point of view and to the American interests .

		Fragments of ' ^ `` understand the career of anyone an actress 's who has exerted a marked influence autobior/raphy .

		upon art or science , it is necessary not only to have some sympathy with that person , but still more to understand the circumstances and conditions which made his or her career and influ - ence possible .

		In the autobiographical sketch of her life , Mrs.
Clara Morris Harriott	PERSON	has appealed to a sympathetic audience by dedicating her work to '' those women Avho tasted sorrow and defeat before they won success . '' ''

		The Life of a Star '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is made up of a collection of short articles , reprinted from various periodicals ; they por - tray the dignity of the actor 's art , with its difficulties , its uses , and its triumphs .

		Personal reminiscences of many persons famous in art , literature , and politics are interspersed .

		Fragmentary views of
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	and
Garfield	PERSON	, gained from personal acquaintance , are here made no less interesting than the anecdotal sketches of
Salvini	LOCATION	,
Rachel	PERSON	, or
Dion Boucicaidt	PERSON	.

		The author 's own histrionic invasion of the metrop - olis , her crucial moments in critical
Boston	LOCATION	, her ad - ventures en route , suggest , as she intimates , one of those small kaleidoscopes wherein these short sketches become the bits of colored glass -- '' green for hope , blue for faith , red for courage , purple for power . ''

		This record of the thoughts , fancies , sen - timents and reflections of a good and talented woman is commendable alike for the grace , purity , simplicity and expressiveness of its diction , its apt and oft - times felicitous collocation of words and plrrases , and the easy flow of its style .

		It will bear comparison with some of the best of similar work by authors of acknowledged rank in literatm-e .

		Catherine ^ he story of the gi-eat Empress of
Russia	LOCATION	,
Catherine	PERSON	is retold in two substantial and her court .

		volumes by Mr.
Fitzgerald MoUoy	PERSON	, in '' The Russian Com-t in the Eighteenth Century '' -LRB- imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- .

		It is the narrative of a career as strange and astonishing as any to be found in the annals of history .

		This princess of a little German state , who was brought into
Russia	LOCATION	to be the consort of the stupid heir to
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's throne , by her force of will and magnetic personality made herself absolute mistress of the great Russian Empire , casting off her unspeakable husband and drawing to her support the nobility and the masses as she proved her power to rule .

		She practised unbridled and open licentiousness ; but inasmuch as in that barbarous court licentiousness was common , she maintained her sway and proved herself to be a great ruler and state-builder , one of the great rulers of modern history .

		Mr.
MoUoy	PERSON	's work does not contain a narrative of political events , but rather the personal narrative of
Catherine	PERSON	's life and of the lives of those with whom she was asso - ciated as
Grand Duchess	LOCATION	and
Empress	ORGANIZATION	.

		We see the procession of handsome favorites on whom she lavished affection and wealth to the end of her life ; the venal and cruel courtiers ; the Empress
Eliza	PERSON	- beth who preceded her , her husband , and the base son who followed her .

		And we find incidentally set forth the motives , mainly personal , that led to
Russia	LOCATION	's various intei ` ventions in European affairs during the latter half of the eighteenth century , and to the great scheme of
Catherine	PERSON	's later life , the Partition of
Poland	LOCATION	.

		The whole story is of absorb - ing interest to one Avho would watch the play of the elemental passions either in individual relations or in a barbaric state .

		The work is illustrated with many fine portraits .

		j ^ y ^ .

		^ ^ g book , '' to come upon SO wisely specialized a volume as Mr.
Rhead	PERSON	's '' The Basses , Fresh - Water and Marine '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Even those who usually find the printed page of little avail , either for inspiration or instruction , wUl do well to make an exception in this case , for the editor-author has succeeded not only in telling '' how , when , and where to fish for bass , '' but in giving the reader an intimate acquaintance with the history , habits , and distribution of the various species .

		The basis of the descriptions is carefully scientific , but science serves mostly as a point of departure , and the '' pleasing vicissitudes of angling '' receive due attention .

		The book represents a division of labor , the chapters on the fresh-water basses having been wi'itten by the late Mr.
William C. Harris	PERSON	, and those on the marine basses being contributed by Mr.
Tarleton H. Bean	PERSON	, while the editor himself adds interesting reminis - cences and practical suggestions .

		Colored plates of the basses , and of artificial flies , have informing value , though most of the illustrations serve for general attractiveness rather than accurate exposi - tion .

		To the actual fisherman , the chapters on baits , flies , and artificial lures will be most serviceable ; while to others the story of the marine basses will perhaps be most engaging , for the spice of rather rare adventure in it .

		A satisfactory feature of the book is the credit given the
United States	LOCATION	Fish Com - mission for the successful stocking of many waters with this typically American fish .

		Constitution '' -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	:
William Ritchie	PERSON	-RRB- seems to be a miniature reduction of the principal facts in the first part of a constitutional history of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is not such a critical study as the volumes of a similar title by
Stevens	PERSON	,
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	, and other investigfators , but rather a sum - mary or outline .

		The chapters deal with the for - mation and failure of the Articles of Confederation , the incidents of the Convention and its work , the ratification by States , and a sketch of the amend - ments .

		In the introduction , the author hints that neither the ' • inspired '' theory nor the inheritance from
England	LOCATION	explains the origin of the Constitu - tion ; but he nowhere lifts the veil .

		The only novel feature of the sketch is a summary of '' what might have been , '' describing the proposals that failed of adoption in the Convention .

		Defects exist in the frame of national government , according to the au - thor , in the discrepancies of divorce laws in the vari - ous States , in the veto power , which is '' a remnant of kingly prerogative , '' and in the ease with which a
State	ORGANIZATION	may alter its constitution after admission to the Union -- whereas its admission should be in the nature of a contract .

		The accustomed official docu - ments take up a large portion of the volume .

L. Anderson	PERSON	takes an optimistic view of the future of rural communi - ties , though by no means ignoring the unfortunate tendencies which have been emphasized by other ^ vriters .

		He has read widely and thought deeply on the subject , and on many other subjects in so far as they affect his theme ; but though he cites numerous authorities , he writes in the graceful stj ` le of the essajTst .

		While recognizing that tendencies are at work which , unchecked , would ruin all rural com - munities , he relies upon the power of children to be better than their fathers , and upon the innate virtue of the rural environment to make up for the migra - tion of the more progressive elements of the popula - tion to the cities .

		There is a philosophical vagueness about the proposals for conscious improvement , and the author seems to under-estimate the value of such a definite movement for the betterment of rural conditions as the revival of old-time handicrafts .

		BRIEFER MENTION 43 NOTES 44 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 44 KNOWLEDG E AN D WISDOM . ''

		Knowledge comes but wisdom lingers . ''

		Tennyson understood the matter well enough , for he was one of the wisest of men .

		But the phrase , glibly quoted though it may be , prob - ably has little meaning for the majority of those who use it .

		To cocksure youth , in partic - ular , making confident pronouncement upon all things in heaven and earth , the distinction be - tween knowledge and wisdom can hardly exist , for vvisdom is of the years far beyond , when knowledge shall have been duly sifted and syn - thesized .

		And what passes for wisdom even to advanced age may be no more than that crystal - lized prejudice which is the intellectual founda - tion of most lives that are past their prime .

		Let us take a moment to inquire into this dis - tinction .

		We realize , of course , that all wisdom must be knowledge , and also that the proposition is not a convertible one .

		For knowledge ranges all the way from the baldly empirical statement of isolated facts to such generalizations as those that have made immortal the names of
Newton	LOCATION	and
Darwin	PERSON	.

		With every step taken in the di - rection of rationalization , knowledge approaches wisdom more closely , and to that extent begins to partake of its character and share its dignity .

		Yet the attainment of a certain degree of intdl - lectual abstraction is not in itself enough to admit mere knowledge to the jealously-guarded courts of wisdom ; we have an instinctive feeling that other credentials are demanded , and an inquiry into their nature inevitably leads us to the realization that they should also be affected by a human interest .

		The profoundest and most completely-classified knowledge , as of the mathe - matician or the naturalist , may make a man learned , but need not make him wise ; it is the former term , rather than the latter , that is the more fitting for the Newtons and the Darwins , but we need have no hesitation in attributing wis - dom , using the word with the nicest sense of its value , to an Aristotle , or a
Bacon	LOCATION	, or a Goethe .

		We attribute wisdom to such men as these because , in the possession of highly specialized stores of knowledge , they have not been content with it for its own sake , but have been insistent in bringing it to bear upon the conduct of life .

		Their aphoristic utterances form a sort of frac - tional distillate of the rarer elements of their thought , and , whether expressed in prose or verse , impress us with the sense of their finality .

		Here , of course , the poets have a little the best of it , for they know how to add to a wise saying just that touch of beauty that is needed to make it forever memorable .

		Never was a criticism more just than was addressed by
Jowett	PERSON	to
Tennyson	LOCATION	, saying : '' Your poetry has an element of philosophy more to be considered than any 28 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, regular philosophy in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		And never was a definition more profound than Words - worth 's of poetry as '' the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge , the impassioned expression which is in the coimtenance of all science . ''

		Much of the world 's inheritance of wisdom is impersonal in its nature , not traceable to a defi - nite source , being the expression of racial rather than of individual consciousness .

		It flashes upon us from apologue and parable and proverb , which have no assignable origin save dim tra - dition , but are treasured from age to age for the universality of the thought they embody , making them no less applicable to our own lives than to those remote conditions which gave them birth .

		Every people has its store of such wis - dom as this , ranging from the dignity and au - thority of whatever scriptures it holds sacred to the homeliness of those practical maxims that oral transmission rather than the printed page serves to keep alive .

		This is the wisdom which , albeit with a certain admixture of superstition , is brought to bear upon us from the nursery upwards , and whispers its monitions in our eai - at all seasons and upon all occasions .

		It is perhaps the deepest of all wisdom , by virtue of the very fact that it has thus triumphantly borne the test of time , and approved itself to human intelligence under circumstances so numerous and so diverse .

		Those of us who have succumbed to civiliza - tion , however , enduring its inherent evils for the sake of the benefits which so manifestly out - weigh them , have also at our command the world of books , which means the recorded wis - dom of past generations and of our own which is even now passing .

		It is a bewildering maze , filled with the sound of many voices , their coun - sels sharply at variance , and their conflicting claims irreconcilable in any synthesis now ap - parent to the understanding .

		Yet something forbids us to exclaim , in
Milton	LOCATION	's phrase , '' Vain wisdom all , and false philosophy , '' which is the refuge of indiff erentism ; something urgent within us impels to the quest of truth , no matter how laborious may be the tracking thereof .

		Nor , again quoting
Milton	PERSON	, may we be content with the proposition which he thus words : '' To know That which before us lies in daily life Is the prime wisdom . ''

		Or if this be '' the prime wisdom '' in a narrowly practical sense , it can not suffice for the spiritual needs of beings of our '' large discourse , looking before and after . ''

		We can not stifle the im - perious cry of our nature for that deeper wis - dom which subsmnes our temporal existence under the species of eternity .

		Not to despair of truth , but to learn to know wisdom from its counterfeit , is the obligation laid upon every serious soul .

		There is in cir - culation much spurious coin of thought , and careless observation permits it a wide currency .

		In some cases the imitation is too obvious to deceive any who are not willing to be deceived ; in others the expert requires all his skill to dis - tinguish between the false and the true .

		How well we know the musty phrases to which sophis - try invariably has recourse when some wrong is to be defended or some lie varnished with the semblance of verity !

		Let one of these phrases make its cunning appeal to some prepossession of ours , and the wrong is supported , the lie coimtenanced .

		Eternal vigilance is the price , not of liberty alone , but of intellectual and moral integrity .

		There is a type of mind for which the wisest precepts grow stale by repetition , and are even - tually spurned in favor of more piquant rivals .

		For the mind of this type the phrase-mongers ever lie in wait , their epigrams pointed by wit and baited with paradox .

		They acquire vogue by sheer audacity of utterance , and no truth is sacred enough to shame them from its denial .

		We need not specify , for modern instances will occur to every reader .

		But the mischief done by these smart philosophasters is considerable .

		They sap the ethical foundations of society , and sell their birthright for the pottage of a little applause . ''

		As the crackling of thorns under a pot '' -- so were their antics described of old by one who was wise indeed .

		Wisdom receives its highest warrant from age and experience .

		Despite the scriptural tes - timony that it may come from the mouths of babes and sucklings , we are justified in viewing with suspicion any coinage of thought , however sharp its mintage , that can not claim a respon - sible origin .

		Young 's verse , '' The man of wisdom is the man of years , '' is the statement of a truism , generally speaking , for no form of words may as such so bear the impress of authority as to dispense with the support of a weighty personality .

		Many a saying that is in itself without force or distinc - tion acquires both from the character of which it is the deliverance , and is given a higher power of energetic impact by the very name of its author .

		The man who has seen life from many angles and has upheld the standard of truth in many conflicts , the man who has been tested by

		THE DIAL 29 adversity and whose thought is the product of ripe reflection , is the man who may fitly claim our respect and confidence .

		But each new generation , as the scroll of time is unrolled for it , must work out its own salvation .

		The accumulated wisdom of the past is offered for our guidance , but something more than passive acceptance is reqvured of us .

		Ovir spiritual no less than our material inheritance must be earned anew if we woidd make it in very truth our own possession .

		New occasions bring new duties , and bring also new problems of conduct that for their solution tax our utmost powers .

		And specious counsels are ever whis - pered in the ears of youth , making the worse appear the better reason , and seeking to turn its gaze away from the old ethical landmarks .

		Si jeunesse savaitf But youth does not know , and from its very nature can not know , many things of the highest import that are clear to the eyes of experience .

		So it pursues the old rovmd of foUy and disillusionment , of sin and expiation , slowly shaping itself in character and purpose .

		Wisdom is vindicated in the end , but the waste of the process seems pitiful .

		Yet this , too , is wisdom -- to discern the educative value of the very faidts that come near to making shipwreck of life , and to realize that something more than counsels of perfection are required for the up - bidlding of the poised and full-statured soul .

		I have just read with sympathetic pleasure the article on '' Poetry and Arboriculture , '' in your issue of
July 1	DATE	.

		`` Worthy to stand with anything that the poets have writ - ten about the trees , is
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's simple enumeration in the first book of the first canto of '' The Faerie Queene '' : '' Much can they praise the trees so straight and hy .

		A little instruction in some of the fimdamental prin - ciples of Forestry , with a wider acquaintance with what the great poets have said about the trees , would pro- duce more practical results , and would open the way to a great deal more of pleasure and profit , than many of the subjects that now absorb much of the time in our public schools .

		liiFE OF ' * The Arabian Kxight . ''

		* Good wine needs no bush .

		A good book needs no laudatory preface .

		The confident , al - most exulting , tone of Mr.
Thomas Wright	PERSON	's in - troduction to his '' Life of Sir
Richard Burton	PERSON	'' tends to prejudice the reader against what is to follow , '' My revelations , '' declares the self - complacent author , '' which form an astonishing story , will no doubt come as a complete surprise to almost everybody .

		I can imagine them , indeed , dropping like a bomb-shell into some circles . ''

		Bombastic prediction !

		In the same strain is to be noted the following : '' The amount of absolutely new information in this work is very large .

		Thtis , we are telling for the first time the history of
Burton	ORGANIZATION	's friendships vrith Mr.
F. F. Arbuthnot	PERSON	, Mr.
John Payne	PERSON	, and others ; and we are giving for the first time , too , a complete and accurate history of the translation of The Arabian Nights , The Scented Garden , and other works .

		Hundreds of new facts are recorded respecting these and other absorbing topics , while the citations from the impublished letters of
Burton	PERSON	and Lady
Burton	PERSON	will , we are sure , receive a welcome .

		We are able to give about fifty entirely new anecdotes -- many of them extremely piquant and amusing .

		We also tell the touching story of
Burton	PERSON	's brother
Edward	PERSON	-LSB- who was diunb for the last forty years of his life -RSB- .

		In our account of
Burton	ORGANIZATION	's travels will be found a number of interesting facts and some anecdotes not given in
Burton	LOCATION	's works . ''

		And yet , self-confidence and self-praise not - withstanding , the author has turned out a cred - itable piece of book-making .

		The story is not offered as the glowing tribute of an intimate and admiring friend , -- in fact , there is no indication that the narrator ever even saw the subject of his narrative ; but the whole book bears such evidence of painstaking research , draws from so many sources hitherto neglected or unavailable , presents so many new facts and throws so much new light on the old ones , that it can not be dis - missed as merely a pretentious piece of hack - work .

		Read the preface as an appendix , -- and a preface , though first in the order of position , is always last in the order of creation , -- and there is less fault to find with it .

		30 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, fully weighed the claims of this man of varied talents and striking personality to be accounted also a great translator and man of letters .

		As it is in the treatment of
Burton	LOCATION	as a scholar and writer , rather than as a daring and resource - ful explorer , a speaker of many tongues , and an ardent anthropologist , that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's book offers something new to the general reader , it will here be fitting to confine our attention to these interesting '' revelations , '' merely adding by the way that the story of his restless wan - derings , gathered chiefly from his own too - voluminous writings , is so well told as to make it difficult to point to a single dull page in the narrative .

		Sir
Richard	PERSON	's fifty or more pub - lished volumes , prolix and ill-proportioned , have been squeezed and made to yield their juice for us in Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's more scholarly pages .

		After giving a long list of his authorities for information never before divulged , the biog - rapher teUs of his success -LRB- the reward of per - sistent effort -RRB- in winning Mr.
John Payne	PERSON	's consent to the publication of the true story concerning his own and
Burton	PERSON	's '' Arabian Nights . ''

		Some of these facts are already known to Arabic scholars who have critically examined the two versions .

		Intimate friends and zealous co-workers though these two men were .

		Burton seems to have been most strangely willing to take credit that was the other 's due .

		He acknowledges indebtedness to Mr.
Payne	PERSON	, but not in terms equal to the extent of his obli - gation .

		In the mere drudgery of translation , Mr.
Wright	PERSON	makes it clear , by '' deadly parallels , '' that his hero was not above '' cribbing . ''

		Two of the shorter tales are printed in the two versions side by side , and they show a transference of whole clauses from the earlier to the later pub - lication .

		The biographer , '' yielding to nobody in admiration of Sir
Richard Burton	PERSON	, '' yet finds him - seK obliged to make the following admissions : `` When I compared the two translations , page by page , I could scarcely believe my own eyes ; and only one conclusion was possible .


Burton	PERSON	, indeed , has taken from
Payne	PERSON	at least three-quarters of the entire work .

		He has transferred many hundreds of sentences and clauses bodily .

		Sometimes we come upon a whole page with only a word or two altered .

		In short , amazing to say , the public have given
Burton	PERSON	credit for a gift which he did not possess -- that of being a great translator .

		... I must mention that Mr.
Payne	PERSON	gave me an abso - lutely free hand -- nay , more than that , having placed all the documents before me , he said -- and this he repeated again and again -- ` Wherever there is any doubt , give
Burton	PERSON	the benefit of it , ' and I have done so . '' ''

		Amazing as the statement may seem , we feel our - selves compelled to say at once , though regfretfully , that
Burton	PERSON	's own account of the history of the transla - tion , given in his Translator 's Foreword to The Arabian Nights , and Lady
Burton	PERSON	's accoimt , given in her life of her husband , do not tally with the facts as revealed in his letters .

		In matters relating to his own history .

		Burton often spoke with amazing recklessness , and perhaps he considered he was justified in stating that his translation of The Arabian Nights was well advanced by
November 1881	DATE	, seeing that it had for thirty years intermittently occupied his thoughts .

		As regards Lady
Burton	PERSON	, no doubt , of some of the facts presently to be given , she was unaware .

		But she was one who easily deceived herself .

		Whatever she wished , she was apt to believe .

		The actual facts compiled from existing documentary evidence -- including
Burton	PERSON	's own letters -- will now be revealed for the first time ; and it will be found , as is generally the case , that the unembroi - dered truth is more interesting than the romance . ''

		An instructive chapter deals with '' The Fate of ' The Scented Garden . ' ''

		The biographer holds that the loss was chiefly a pecuniary one , to Lady
Burton	PERSON	herself , who burned the manu - script , and that its publication would not have added to the translator 's fame .

		An earlier ver - sion of all but the rare twenty-first chapter , from
Burton	PERSON	's pen , had been published by the
Kama Shastra Society	ORGANIZATION	, and apparently the mis - sing chapter had not been supplied in the later translation ; and such notes as
Burton	PERSON	may have added are probably better lost .

		His fondness for the pornographic , and his firm conviction that researches in all the nameless forms of oriental vice make for the advancement of an - thropological science and of human welfare , can never cease to astound and even to dismay his admirers .

		Tndy his was a nature woven of mingled yam .

		In unsparing reprehension , his biographer writes : '' Henceforth every translation was to be annotated from a certain point of view -LSB- as indicated in
Burton	LOCATION	's preface to his Catullus ' -RSB- .

		One can but regret this per - versity , for the old Roman and other authors have unpleasantnesses enough without accentuating them .

		... Unfortunately , Sir
Richard	PERSON	now made this kind of work his speciality , and it would be idle -- or rather it would be untrue -- to deny that he now chose certain books for translation , not on account of their beautiful poetry and noble thoughts , but because they lent them - selves to pungent annotation .

		Indeed , his passion for this sort of literature had become a monomania .

		He insisted , however , and he certainly believed , that he was advancing the interests of science .

		We wish we could say that it was chiefly for their beauties that he now set himself to translate Catullus ,
Ausonius	PERSON	, and
Apuleius	ORGANIZATION	.

		... For the translating of so delicate , so musical and so gracious a poet as Catullus he was absolutely and entirely imqualified . ''

		`` Of
Burton	PERSON	's rendering of
Camoens	LOCATION	, we read the following : '' Regarded as a faithful rendering , the book was a success , for
Burton	PERSON	had drunk The Lusiads till he was super-saturated with it .

		Alone among the translators , he had visited every spot alluded to in the poem , and
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 31 his geographical and other studies had enabled him to elucidate many passages that had baffled his predeces - sors .

		Then , too , he had the assistance of
Anbertin	LOCATION	,
Da Cunha	PERSON	, and other able Portuguese scholars and Camoens enthusiasts .

		Regarded , however , as poetry , the book was a failure ; and for the simple reason that
Burton	PERSON	was not a poet ... On every page we are reminded of the translator 's defective ear , annoyed by the unnec - essary use of obsolete words , and disappointed by his lack of what
Poe	PERSON	called ' ethericity . ' ''

		What is told of Lady
Burton	PERSON	's reckless bum - ing of her husband 's papers after his death must fill the reader with regret -- not for the loss of '' The Scented Garden , '' but for the destruction of diaries , letters , and other autobiographic material that would have made good reading if carefully \ \ ` innowed and edited , and would have contributed to the better imderstanding of a puzzling but ever fascinating personality ' .

		The otherwise excellent appearance of Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's volimies is marred by perhaps more than the pardonable number of misprints .

		Or shall we call some of them slips of the pen ?

		And yet we Ameri - cans have been accused of a reprehensible and peculiarly national proneness always to com - mence , never to begin .

		In the matter of pictorial embellishment , we have it on Mr.

		They include the
Burton	PERSON	family por - traits , which , owing to certain family quarrels ,
Lady Burton	PERSON	was unable to use in her own work .

		They are now reproduced for the first time .

		The Struggle for LiIberty .

		* For many years the late
Lord Acton	PERSON	of
Cambridge	LOCATION	is said to have cherished the plan of writing a History of Liberty , which , considering his vast erudition , would probably have been a masterpiece of historical writing .

		Professor Mac - kinnon , of
St. Andrews University	ORGANIZATION	, has given us the first two volumes of a work planned on somewhat the same lines , except that he purposes to restrict himseK to a narrower field , -- namely , the history of liberty during modem times .

		This self-imposed limitation has not , however , been strictly observed by the author , for his initial volimie is devoted entirely to the pre - modern period , with a view to tracing the me - diaeval origins of modem liberty which were slowly evolved from the chaos and confusion of the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	in the
West	LOCATION	.

		The second voliune covers the period of the Reformation , the major part being devoted to a study of the struggle for liberty in
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	; for here it was , says the author , that `` the great battle of constitutional liberty was fought out , and that the struggles of the Reformation Age in those countries formed the preliminary of that great constitutional drama . ''

		Succeed - ing volumes , we are told , will be devoted mainly to tracing the impidse which the theories and conflicts of the sixteenth century gave to liberty , which came to full maturity in the French Revolution , and were displayed in the constitu - tional struggle in
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	in the seventeenth century , the American and the French Revolutions in the eighteenth , and in those movements in the nineteenth century re - sidting in the establishment of full intellectual , religious , political , and social liberty .

		An examination of the two volumes at hand warrants the conclusion that a usefiJ and valu - able contribution to historical literature will be matle if the work is ever completed on the scale its author planned .

		It shordd be observed , however , that the work is designed to be what its name indicates -- a history of liberty , not a philosophical treatise .

		In vain does one search for a discussion of the nature and limitations of liberty , with the exception of a few brief obser - vations in the preface ; or of the theories that have obtained in different ages and by different schools concerning the idea and scope of liberty .

		82 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, cally , criticism on this score is hardly just .

		Nevertheless , we are justified in feeling a sense of regret that a work on so important a subject should be restricted entirely to its historical aspect .

		It may be seriously questioned whether the usefulness of the work would not have been in - creased by the topical method of ti-eatment rather than the chronological .

		Thus , there is no place to which one can turn for an account of the rise of religious liberty , or the freedom of the press , or the other forms of intellectual emancipation .

		To gain specific information con - cerning the development of liberty under any one of these heads would require a reading of the entire work .

		Another possible ground of criticism is the inclusion in the history of much that has little or no bearing on the subject of liberty , as the term is ordinarily imderstood .

		Thus , there is a long account of the
Reforma	LOCATION	- tion , that has little to do with liberty except as regards the emancipation of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	from
Rome	LOCATION	.

		The work is encumbered with a detailed history of the religious wars , and a discussion of the lives and doctrines of Luther ,
Von Hutten	PERSON	,
Calvin	PERSON	,
Zwingli	PERSON	, and other reformers , containing a large amount of historical detail mainly foreign to the subject of liberty .

		The same is to a less extent true of the detailed discussion of the po - litical theories of
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Hotman	PERSON	, Lan - guet , L'Hopital ,
Bodin	PERSON	, and other political philosophers , -- theories interesting in them - selves , but belonging rather to a history of polit - ical philosophy than to a history of liberty .

		Professor
Mackinnon	PERSON	's style in places is characterized by lucidity of statement , forcefvd - ness of expression , and even by brilliancy ; but too often the detail which mars his discussions is dry and prolix .

		Unfortunately for the serious student , he does not indulge in what he calls the luxury of footnotes , or in citations of authorities .

		Often one wishes to know the source of infor - mation for particular statements ; but this is not given .

		At the end of each chapter , however , is appended a list of the authorities consulted , an examination of which affords evidence that the author possesses a wide familiarity with the literature of his subject .

		Starting out with a definition of liberty as the free development of man .

		Professor
Mackinnon	PERSON	reviews the history of the Middle Ages in a vain search for some evidence of that larger conception which the word possesses to-day .

		He points out that the terms '' rights , '' '' liberties , '' and `` priv - ileges '' are frequently met with in the chronicles and state papers of the Middle Ages , but that they seldom had reference to the masses . ''

		Lib - erty of the subject , '' he says , applied to the privileged few , not to the servile class .

		Popular liberty as we understand it was wholly non - existent .

		Occasionally a bold champion of free - dom of thought and conscience appeared to challenge traditional authority , but he was usu - ally suppressed by the sword or fagot .

		The revival of commerce and the growth of towns , following the crusades , gave an impulse to the movement for emancipation from feudal sub - jection .

		Then came a recognition of the rights of the craft-guilds , or artisans , and the gradual elevation of the peasantry in the social scale , to be followed in time by the admission of the
Third Estate	ORGANIZATION	to the Parliaments .

		During the feudal regime , the indi ^ ' ^ dual overshadowed the
State	ORGANIZATION	, just as during the period of the
Roman Empire the State	ORGANIZATION	regulated and controlled al - most every activity of the individual .

		The sovereignty of the individual under feudalism was no more conducive to the development of real liberty than was the despotism of
Rome	LOCATION	, for the former regime meant disintegration of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, with its resulting anarchy and oppres - sion of the masses , just as the latter meant the crushing out of the individuality of the citizen .

		Everywhere the despotism of caste tended to compress within narrow limits the liberty of action of the individual , and to destroy his sense of initiative and energy .

		The sum total of the struggles during the Middle Ages was the ele - vation of the serf to a condition of partial free - dom , the endowment of the merchant and artisan with political and civil rights , the attainment of municipal freedom , and the inauguration of the movement for intellectual and religious liberty .

		The Renaissance and the Reformation con - stitute an important stage in the evolution of modern liberty .

		The former was characterized by an emancipation of the intellect from the thralls of tradition and the bonds of the feudal age , the latter by an emancipation of the con - science in spiritual matters .

		More particularly it liberated the soul from the authority of
Rome	LOCATION	and brought it into immediate relation with God .

		The modem spirit of liberty of thought and of worship breathed freer , and gradually awoke from the nightmare of authority .

		The Reformation , the author says , was a crusade in favor of liberty as the age understood liberty ; but , mighty as the movement was , it constituted little more than the mere backgroimd of that larger movement which did not finally take shape imtil the nineteenth century .

		* '' I have loved books and music , and , above all , the earth and the things of the earth .

		To the wholesome , normal man , these things are but an agreeable background , and the real business of life lies with wife and child and work .

		But to me the real things have been the beautiful things -- sunrise and sunset , streams and woods , old houses , talk , poetry , pictures , ideas .

		And I always liked my work , too . ''

		So writes the author of ' • The Thread of Gold , '' not , indeed , of himself , but of one of the interesting and quiet types of character that he describes with so much skill .

		Yet the words , with but little modification , are applicable to him , as also to the author or authors of the two volvunes that we have grouped with his .

		It is no doubt an intrusion on Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's anonymity to attrib - ute to him these two delightful imsigned books .

		One sees clearly enough why they are unsigned .

		Such intimate avowals as these are made with more freedom from behind even a transparent mask .

		The greater spontaneity and charm of the anonymous volumes , as compared with '' From a College Window , '' are evidence of this .

		Cer - tainly , however discreet one may incline to be , he can not resist the conviction that the three books are the work of one hand .

		The subjects considered , the opinions expressed , the allusions and illustrations employed , the personal stamp of the style , are as convincing as such things can well be .

		It would be stupid , however , to infer that the two imacknowledged volimies are in any way autobiographical .

		They merely express , from behind a thin veil of fictitious characters and situations , the author 's inmost mind .

		These are not clever books , as current taste estimates cleverness .

		They contain no paradox , no epigram , no scintillation .

		Still less are they literary books .

		The writer of them knows his poets , but for the most part he carefully ignores occasions to quote from them .

		Indeed , at times he seems rather to do violence to himself in his effort to avoid an allusion .

		One need not admire the reminiscent habits of
Hazlitt	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	, to regret that in such books and by such a man an apt quotation should be so patently scouted .

		For example , it is hard to believe that he wrote the following passage in '' The

		Is it indeed withheld ?

		Can we not by quiet pas - sivity , rather than by resolute effort , learn the secret of it ?

		I believe myseK that the source is there in many hearts , but that we visit it too rarelv , and forget it in the multitude of Kttle cares and businesses , which seem so important , so absorbing . ''

		Nor are these books , although they deal much with out-of-door delights , the beauty and sig - nificance of natural objects , the quaint and interesting ways of animals , in any sense `` nature-books . ''

		They deal , to use a phrase that occurs in '' From a College Window , '' not with '' the pursuit of natural history , but the pursuit of natural emotion . ''

		The latter pursuit is one that most so-called ' * nature-books '' pointedly avoid .

		Most of all , they are not hollow with the great emptiness of the current literature of '' the simple life . ''

		Concerning this , Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- son , in '' From a College Window , '' sufficiently says : '' The moment that a man is conscious that he is simple and humble , he is simple and humble no longer . ''

		Yet the genuinely simple life is the very theme of which they treat . ''

		To be natural , to find our true life , to be independ - ent of luxuries , not to be at the mercy of pre - judices and false ideals -- that is the secret of life , '' says '' The
House of Quiet	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		These books appeal , then , to no special class , but , as
Wordsworth	PERSON	said of poetry , to man as man .

		They are fidl of a broad and winning hmnanity .

		Hvmian associations give them their charm , and a full hxunan pulse beats in every sentence .

		To be sure , they are hardly universal in their ap - peal .

		They are too subtle , too tender , too thoughtful for that .

		But they deal , after all , with the elements of ' • mere living , '' which is not the less elemental because it is fine and cid - tivated .

		Indeed , their chief charm consists in their portrayal of a certain type of mind , and they will have an interest for those only who can in any degree sympathize with that type .

		This type is perhaps sufficiently described in the passage quoted at the beginning of this article .

		It is a mind to which the earth and the things of the earth are endlessly interesting and de - lightfid , which is '' awake and aware '' before the beauty of the world , which watches for its brief epiphanies , which loses no finest touch of 34 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, it , which lives in the memory of it .

		It is alive , also , to the beauties of art , though toward these it maintains a somewhat reluctant attitude .

		The artist is , by definition , too hard and self - centred to satisfy so humane and benign a spirit .

		The cuckoo 's '' heartless customs '' are to him suggestive of the ways of the poet . ''

		Those that sing so delicately , '' says '' The Thread of Gold , '' '' would not have leisure and courage to make their music so soft and sweet if they had not a hard heart to turn to the sorrows of the world '' ; and '' The House of Quiet '' affirms , even more distinctly , '' that literature and art play a very small part in the lives of the major - ity of people ; that most men have no sort of an idea that they are serious matters , but look upon them as more or less gracefid amusements ; that in such regions they have no power of criticism and no judgment ; but that these are not nearly such serious defects as the defect of vision which the artist and the man of letters suffer from and encourage -- the defect , I mean , of treating artistic ideals as matters of pre - eminent national , even of moral , importance . ''

		We could wish , perhaps , that this fine spirit received with less grudging thanks the gifts pro- vided by the gods of art .

		He is in danger of giving aid and comfort to persons with whom , we are persuaded , he would be even less in sym - pathy .

		Yet we must take him as we find him .

		Perhaps this gentle heresy adds an original and piquant touch to a character of such a type .

		For he belongs naturally to a class to whom artistic ideals are matters of preeminent importance .

		He is a scholar , in the himiane , not the scien - tific , sense of the term , living a quiet life of thought and imagination ; though secluded from the business of the world , delighting in human association of every sort , and feeling to the full the charm , almost a pathetic charm at times , of the gay young life about him .

		In '' The Thread of Gold '' he writes : '' Aiid then , too , there is the tide of youthful life that floods every corner of the place .

		It is an endless pleasure to see the troops of slim and alert young fig - ures , full of enjoyment and life , with all the best gifts of life , health , work , amusement , society , friendship , lying ready to their hand .

		The sense of this beating and thrilling pulse of life circulating through these sombre and splendid buildings is what gives the place its inner glow ; this life full of hope , of sensation , of emotion , not yet shadowed or disillusioned or weary , seems to be as the fire on the altar , throwing up its sharp , darting tongues of flame , its clouds of fragrant smoke , giving warmth and significance and a fiery heart to a sombre shrine . ''

		To say that the author is a scholar implies , of course , that he has the limitations of his class , limitations so much greater and more narrow - ing , we are assured nowadays , than the limi - tations , say , of business or professional life .

		Well , here at any rate is one man who ac - cepts them without protest or apology .

		And to many , do doubt , it will be a genuine satisfac - tion , amid the prevalent talk of making oneself better , or at least different , to find this quiet acceptance of the limitations of temperament and situation .

		To have the courage of one 's limitations -- not many of us are as bold as that !

		He has also the scholar 's and the poet 's per - sistent sense of the past , of '' the incommuni - cable touch of time . ''

		He dwells upon the life that has throbbed and grown quiet , worked and loved , enjoyed and suffered within the walls of the old picturesque English houses that he loves so well .

		Of one of them he writes in '' The Thread of Gold '' : `` I hajdly know what it was that it spoke of ; but I felt the care and love that had gone to the making of it , and the dignity that it had won from rain and sim and the kindly hand of nature ; it spoke of hope and brightness , of youth and joy ; and told me , too , that all things were passing away , that even the house itself , though it could outlive a few restless generations , was indeed debita morti , and bowed itself to its
fall	DATE	. ''

		He has the scholar 's sense of '' the greatness and littleness of human life , '' its relative littleness , its absolute greatness .

		He has the scholar 's per - spective , which forbids him to approve what he calls '' the vicious circle '' of conventional duties and amusements , the scholar 's estimate of values , that teaches him the futility of ambition and influence . ''

		I think that God puts us into the world to live , '' says one of the characters that he analyzes , '' not necessarily to get in - fluence over other people .

		If a man is worth anything , the influence comes ; and I do n't call it living , to attend public luncheons and to write unnecessary letters , because public luncheons are things which need not exist and are only amuse - ments invented by fussy and idle people '' ; and again : '' One has no longer any anxious sense of duty ; one desires no longer either to impress or influence ; one aims only at guarding the quality of all one does or says . ''

		Over and over again this note of an ennobled Cyrenaicism recurs : '' To seize the moment , with aU its con - ditions , to press the quality out of it , that is the best victory . ''

		Pater himself is hardly more micompromising , though this is not the Cyre - naicism of Pater .

		He lias , finally , the scholar 's type of religion .

		`` Ought we not , '' he asks , '' to try to make our religion a much wider , quieter thing ? ''

		Before the immense mysteries of nature and of suffering , his attitude is that
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		35 of a perpetual question followed by a perpetual acquiescence .

		He has an abiding sense of the fatality of things , like that of
Edward Fitzgerald	PERSON	when he chose for his epitaph the words , '' It is He that hath made us , and not we ourselves . ''

		But beneath this , and coloring all his outlook upon history , nature , human life , the sufferings of dumb creatures , the limitations and sorrows of his own career , there is a serene faith in a possible explanation , in what he calls '' a tender secret . ''

		As to the manner in which all this is ex - pressed , the passages q \ ioted are the best witness .

		These pages are written con amore ^ with an indescribable effect of sincerity and meditative beauty .

		Their style is delicately , subtly , un - obtrusively figurative .

		It varies , of course , in quality ; and while it is never imitative , it fol - lows so closely the feeling of the subject that it now and ag ^ ain reminds us of other men 's treat - ment of similar themes .

		The picnic of the pauper lunatics , in '' The Thread of Gold , '' has a little of the quaint and unusual charm , just mis sing the grotesque , of some of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's tales .

		Whenever he dwells upon the human associations of landscape and buUdings , the pathetic evanescence of himian things , the way in which even brick and stone , rocks and trees , may become saturated with human joy and sor - row , upon his pages lies the serene mellow after - noon light that rests upon the pages of Irving .

		In a passage like the following , one is reminded inevitably of a landscape by
Bocklin	PERSON	: '' A stone 's throw away lay a large square moat , full of water , all fringed with ancient gnarled trees ; the island which it enclosed was overgrown with tiny thickets of dishevelled box-trees , and huge sprawling laurels ; we walked softly round it , and there was our goal : a small church of a whitish stone , in the middle of a little close of old sycamores in stiff
summer	DATE	leaf . ''

		Such comparisons may easily do these volumes injustice .

		Their manner is original , spontaneous , imstudied , but at the same time it is the fruit of prolonged and delicate cidtivation .

		They endure perfectly the test of being read out-of - doors , for they are as little out of harmony with the wide serenities of sea and wood and sky and field as the poetry of Walt Whitman .

		One could hardly say more .

		Yet there is one great name , or , rather , one great manner , of which the reader of these pages constantly thinks , -- the name and manner of
Virgil	LOCATION	.

		For indeed these little idyllic eclogues are like
Virgil	PERSON	's , full of simple and serene landscape beauty and a spirit of quiet retrospection , ending often , like his , in the glow of sunset and the peace of nightfall .

		The Heakt of the RajXiWAt Probl , em .

		* Mr.
Parsons	PERSON	's book on '' The Heart of the Railroad Problem '' comes at a fortunate time for its popidarity ; and it is well worth the read - ing .

		The keynote may be taken from the preface . ''

		A plan was adopted for a book , to be called ♦ The Railways , the Trusts , and the People , ' which is now in the press ... For the preparation of this work the writer traveled through nine countries of
Europe	LOCATION	, and over three-fourths of the
United States	LOCATION	, studying rail - ways , meeting railroad presidents and managers , minis - ters of railways , members of railway commissions , governors , senators , and leading men of every class , in the effort to get a thorough understanding of the rail - way situation .

		He also made an extensive study of the railroad literature of leading coimtries , and examined thoroughly the reports and decisions of commissions and courts in railroad cases in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		As these studies progressed , the writer became more and .

		more convinced that the heart of the railroad problem lies in the question of impartial treatment of shippers .

		The chief complaint against our railroads is not that the rates as a whole are unreasonable , but that favorit - ism is shown for large shippers or special interests having control of railways or a special pull with the management .

		This book consists , in the main , of the broad study of railway favoritism , which was made as a basis for the generalizations outlined in the brief chapter on that subject in ' The Railways , the Trusts , and the People . ' ''

		^ Vhatever opinion of the railways a reader of this book may carry away as he closes it , he will have to say that the multitudinous forms of discrimination have been laid open to the light of day .

		As many chapters discuss as many forms as passenger rebates , direct freight re - bates , denial of fair facilities , classification and commodity rates , oil and beef , imports and exports , locality discriminations , long-haul de - cisions ,
Colorado	LOCATION	fuel rebates , midnight tariffs , terminal railroads , private cars , while one fruit - ful chapter is devot ^ to free cartage , demurrage , the expense bill system , goods not billed , and nuUing in transit .

		The history of remedial attempts runs along through the Granger Laws , the Hepburn Report , the
Interstate Commerce Act , Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	decisions , ten years of Federal regulation , the Elkins Act , the
Wiscon	PERSON	- sin revelations .

		The closing chapters are con - cerned with the possibility of regulation of rate-making , and methods for accomplishing that end .

		As the book went to press in
March , 1906	DATE	, the discussion of recent measures ends with the presentation to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the
Esch	PERSON	-
Townsend	PERSON	,
Interstate Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and
Hepburn	PERSON	bills .

		Of the more recent occurrences which • The Heart of the Railboad Problem , The History of Railway Discrimination in the
United States	LOCATION	, the Chief Elfforts at
Control	ORGANIZATION	, and the Remedies Proposed , with Hints from Other Coontries .

		By
Frank Parsons	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	: Little .

		Brown ,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		36 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, have shaped the last-mentioned bill into the Conference Bill of the two houses of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and the Act of
June 30 , 1906	DATE	, an admirable resume may be found in the weekly columns of that excellent journal , '' The Railway Age . ''

		The merits of Mr.
Parsons	PERSON	's book are in its thorough and compendious presentation of the various evils that have come to pass in the making of railway rates .

		If the treatment is open to criticism , it is along the line of the genesis of these conditions .

		In a country that is a continent , and that has grown in less than a hundred years from a wilderness to an empire , the mere physical conditions -- in both time and space -- have inevitably generated the industrial conditions that we find oppressive to-day , al - though they have grown logically out of earlier ones that were the fostering cradle of our na - tional greatness .

		It is to the credit of writers like
Johnson	PERSON	,
Pratt	LOCATION	, and
Stickney	PERSON	, that they see this ; it is likewise apparent that in their eager - ness to reform abuses Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	and Mr.
Baker	PERSON	have ignored it .

		Yet any legislation that is to accomplish permanent good must avoid the single vision of the latter , as truly as that of the enthusiastic hero-worshipper of the railroads , Mr.
Spearman	PERSON	.

		The railroad men are , it is true , the makers of rebates and all other dis - criminations ; but they are in a degree victims of growing and enlarging conditions , not only in their physical and economic , but even in their moral environment , which have helped to make them what they are .

		The words '' guilty '' and '' criminal '' must not be used too strenuously with reference to statutory guilt and crime by a public tarred with the same brush .

		On the other hand , it is satisfactory to see how com - pletely the array of facts in Mr.
Parsons	PERSON	's cata - logue of discrimination , as practised even to the present year , is enforced by the testimony that has been presented in the courts since this book went to press , and how both demolish the ab - surd statement made in Mr.
Spearman	PERSON	's popular book , '' The Strategy of Great Railroads , '' that ''
Alexander J. Cassatt	PERSON	has made unjust discrim - ination in railroad traffic a thing of the past . ''

		It is easy to see the evils ; it is more difficult to point out the remedy .

		Mr.
Parsons	PERSON	's chapter on '' fixing rates by public authority '' is very valuable .

		One by one he goes over the objec - tions to a general rate-making by some central authority , and meets them most lucidly .

		If the amendments to the
Hepburn	PERSON	bill added by the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	can be enlarged to include private cars ,
Pullmans	LOCATION	, pipe-lines , express companies , water carriers , and terminals , under the restrictions of common carriers , and the abatement of the pass evil can be reinforced by a commission with peremptory rate-making powers , Mr.
Parsons	PERSON	is of the opinion that the public would be bene - fitted , and no vested interest would suffer injury .

		Events -- and public opinion too -- have marched fast in the field of this railway question in the last few months ; and it does appear to a looker-on in
Vienna	LOCATION	that we are in a fair way to try the experi - ment .

		There can be little doubt that under the new law , which embodies Mr.
Parsons	PERSON	's sugges - tions , the best class of railway men -- the
Hills	LOCATION	,
Hughitts	LOCATION	, Fishes , MeUens -- wiU fall into line and cheerfully seek to satisfy the American pub - lic .

		For it must ever be remembered that the mere presence of the power in the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	to make a rate will act as it did between
1887	DATE	and
1897	DATE	, when it was thought that the Com - mission had such power ; the great bidk of the rates will still be made in the railroad offices by railroad experts , and the fimction of the Com - mission will be in a large degree preventive rather than revisory .

		Recent Fiction .

		* Once more Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has based the fundamen - tal situation of a novel upon a historical prototype .

		And this time , -- '' once for all , '' as she puts it , -- she makes explicit admission of the practice , and justifies it in terms that should forever silence the ill-natured criticism that has assailed `` Lady Rose 's Daughter '' and '' The Marriage of

		The artist , she insists , '' may gather from any field , so long as he sacredly respects what other artists have already made their own by the transmuting - processes of the mind .

		THE M ^ ^ lL .

		37 to a simple country girl in
Westmoreland	LOCATION	.

		He finds it beyond his power to earn a decent liying in his unappreciative provincial environment , and , con - scious of his powers if only he may have the oppor - tunity of displaying them , goes to
London	LOCATION	alone to fight for recognition and make a home for his wife and child .

		After a hard struggle , he wins his way , partly with the aid of a wealthy patron , and the sale of two pictures makes it possible to plan a reunion of his family .

		But in a moment of weakness he has made the fatal mistake of allowing his
London	LOCATION	friends to suppose him unmarried ; and when this fact reaches his wife , as it does in a roundabout way , it makes her start for
London	LOCATION	at once .

		Reaching her husband 's studio during his absence , she dis - covers evidence of what seems to her unfaithfulness ; and .

		acting upon a jealous impulse , she writes him a note to say that she has left him forever .

		Then comes a lapse of twelve years ; and when we resume the story , it is to find that
Fenwick	PERSON	has become famous , but , unable to discover the whereabouts of his wife and child , has grown embittered and morose .

		Tactlessness and an imcompromising temper have lost him nearly all his friends , and put him at outs with the oflScial representatives of art .

		The only real joy that all these years have brought him haa been the friendship of
Madame de Paatourellei	ORGANIZATION	, the daughter of his first patron : and to her he has never revealed the secret of his marriage .

		She is now set free by the death of a worthless husband , and is prepared to become something more than
Fenwick	PERSON	's friend , when the secret gets out .

		This poignant situation is succeeded by renewed efforts to find the runaway wife and child , efforts which eventually prove successful , and lead to a reunion .

		The lives of both husband and wife have been broken beyond repair by the estrangement , and Mrs. `` Ward is too genuine an artist to gloss over , in the interests of a conventional sentimentality , the essential hopeless - ness of the situation .

		It is to the child alone -- now grown to gracious maidenhood -- that we must look for whatever gleam of light is cast upon the closing chapters of the novel . '

		*
Fenwick	PERSON	's Career '' seems to us nearly if not quite the best of the author 's novels .

		Fenwick himself is anything but an agree - able or sympathetic character , but he is a real indi - vidual and not an intellectual abstraction .

		This is Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's chief triumph in her present work .

		Madame de Pastourelles , although portrayed with the most refined and delicate art , is no more remark - able than several other women of the novelist 's creation .

		Another positive merit of this novel is found in its comparative freedom from the prolixity that lies like a dead weight upon most of its prede - cessors .

		It is true that subjects are discussed -- art subjects , in this case , with the usual critical jargon ; but they are not discussed to death , and for this we may be truly thankful .

		For Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's chief de - fect hitherto has been her inability to control within reasonable bounds the reflective and philosophical tendencies which give so marked a character to her ntellectual activity .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Wflliamson	PERSON	have side-tracked , a `` r it were , the motor-car , for the purpose of writing their international comedy of manners entitled '' Lady
Bettj	PERSON	' across the Water . ''

		Lady
Betty	PERSON	is a nice English girl , who is shipped to
America	LOCATION	by her designing mother , both to get her out of her less attractive sister 's way , and to secure for her a rich American husband .

		She has a variety of interesting experiences , in
New York	LOCATION	,
Newport	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, and rural
Ohio	LOCATION	; and , as she tells of them in the first person , her comments upon American life are highly diverting .

		The following passage , which we find in the opening pages , is an example of the sort of tiling that gives the book its undeniable charm . ''

		I am never taken into family conclaves , becaose I 'm not < rat yet .

		I do n't see what difference tliat makes , especially as I 'm not to be allowed to come ont until after
Vic	PERSON	's mar - ried , becaose she was presented fonr years ago , and is n't even engaged yet ; so , for all I can tell , I may have to stay in till I 'm a hnndred , or leak out slowly when nobody is notieii ^ , as
Vic	PERSON	says girls do in the middle classes . ''

		Concerning Lady
Betty	PERSON	's romance , we will not par - ticularize .

		It begins on the steamer which takes her to
America	LOCATION	, upsets all the plans contrived for her , and culminates acceptably to most of the persons inter - ested .

		A frothy sort of cleverness is the chief attri - bute of the story , but its thin vein of wit is exhausted long licfore the end is reached , and nothing more substantial is found to take its place .

		We can say little in praise of `` My Sword for
Lafayette	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	.

		The author has a certain facility of invention , but his style is without flexibility , and his figures are rarely any - thing more than puppets .

		The present romance begins with the departure of
Lafayette	LOCATION	for the Amer - ican colonies , and ends in the diays of the French Revolution .

		The narrative is in the first person , r ^ ted by an American friend of the distinguished Frenchman , and includes adventures in
France	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	.

		The heroine dies upon the gfuillotine ; but she is never realized for us with sufficient distinctness to make the reader greatly care what becomes of her .

		Mr.
F. J. Stimson	PERSON	has put a considerable list of books to his credit since his graduation from
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	over a quarter of a century ago .

		Hi a first venture -- the amusing skit '' RoUo at
Cambridge	LOCATION	'' -- is still remembered ; and at least as much may be said for `` Guerndale , '' his first serious noveL Taking the law for his vocation , he has ever since continued to cultivate fiction as his avocation ; and his work has grown broader and stronger with the passsing years .

		He has at last produced a novel , '' In Cure of Her Soul , '' which is not only the finest thing he has ever done , but which is a really note - worthy addition to our literature .

		The very title of the book is indicative of its serious character .

		It is a study of contemporary American society , covering the period of the author 's o '' ni maturity , and dealing with the life that he has known at fiiWhand -- the social life of
New York	LOCATION	and
Newport	LOCATION	and the
Berk	PERSON	- shires , and the phases of business and politics which a lawyer comes to know most intimately in the 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, practice of his profession .

		The outline of the story is simple enough .

		It is the old story of a man and two women , of his impulsive marriage with the one and his subsequent discovery that he loves the other .

		But Mr.
Stimson	PERSON	does not work out his plan upon the usual sentimental lines .

		He appears to be enough of the old-fashioned moralist to regard a marriage as something sacred , to hold that life has a higher purpose than the realization of eager desire , and to believe that men are bound to accept the consequences of their acts , even at the cost of much self-sacrifice and sufferihg .

		He has thus weighted the novel with meaning by framing it upon high ethical ideals and a fine spirituality .

		As a study of the appalling vacuity and corruption of the pleasure - seeking wealthy classes , it is quite as good as '' The Hotise of Mirth , '' and it offers us a much more truth - ful portrayal of contemporary society , because its outlook is broad enough to include types of clean living and earnest purpose as well as types of vulgar frivolity .

		The variety of its interests is , in fact , quite extraordinary ; and however lightly a char - acter or a situation or a social problem is touched upon , we feel the presence of a controlling principle of sanity in the treatment .

		The style , moreover , is flexible enough to fit the many moods and require - ments of the narrative .

		It can be concise , vivid , and dramatic , if need be ; or it can be gravely reflective on occasion , and touched with spiritual beauty .

		The frequent use , for emotional purposes , of suggestions from
Dante	LOCATION	and
Wagner	PERSON	is most felicitous , and the fact that the author resorts to these two sources of inspiration is one of the clearest indications of the fineness of his temper .

		The book is not without its faults .

		Both
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Wagner	PERSON	are misquoted ; the passages which relate to the manipulation of certain railroad properties are too complicated to be understood by lay readers ; the construction of the novel as a whole is faulty , and the process by which the soul of the erring wife is cured is left largely to our imagination .

		In failing to work out this prob - lem psychologically , the author has missed a great opportunity , and to a certain extent disappointed us in the expectations which might reasonably be based upon the title he has chosen for his work .

		Novels which deal with the corruption of our political life are getting to be very common nowa - days , which may be a cheering indication of an aroused moral sense in the community .

		At all events , such books are to be welcomed , for the evils upon which they are based are notorious , and to realize them in the public consciousness is to take an im - portant step toward their remedy .

		An exceptionally straightforward and clean-cut book of this class is `` The District Attorney , '' by Mr.
WiUiam	PERSON	Sage .

		The hero is a young man just out of the law-school , the son of one of our '' captains of industry '' -LRB- how this title suggests to us the French analogue of chevalier d'industrie ! -RRB-

		When he learns the nature of the methods by which his father has become wealthy , he refuses to profit by them , and turns to his profession for an independent career .

		Presently he gets into politics , is nominated by the independ - ents for the office of district attorney , and , after an exciting campaign , is elected .

		Then he proceeds to attack the franchise corruptionists , and in logical succession lands in the penitentiary first a group of aldermen , then the go-between , and finally , in the face of desperate resistance , the arch-criminal , a magnate who has just bought a seat to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The whole affair goes on with the beautiful precision of clockwork , -- in which respect we fear that the story is sadly untrue to life .

		We are inclined to think , also , that the note of didacticism is at times a little too effusively sounded ; but to the book as a whole sincere praise may be accorded .

		And special praise must be given to cer - tain of its episodes -- to the vaguely-localized chapter that takes us to the South American port where one of the rascals has hidden himself , and to the final scene in the jury-room where the fate of the dis - graced senator is sealed .

		For the sake of the romantic conventions , a love-story is mingled with all this serious matter , but contributes only a slight element of the total interest .

		Frank and Jim -- otherwise
Frances Candler	PERSON	and
James Durkin	PERSON	-- are two young persons who , finding the earning of an honest livelihood a very humdrum affair , are tempted to join the ranks of the predatory , and turn their wits to account in various question - able ways .

		Having once entered upon the criminal path , they find themselves urged to still further steps , and engage in an interesting series of burgla - ries , frauds , and confidence games .

		They conveniently attribute their misconduct to '' force of circum - stances , '' and are both loud and frequent in the pro- testation that to live honestly is what they chiefly yearn for .

		But the day of reform is to be post - poned untn they have made a '' strike '' of sufficient magnitude to secui-e them a comfortable existence .

		Then they will come out into the open , and life will be all idyllic .

		Although this story is about as im - moral in its tendencies as any that we have ever read , the crimes which it deals with are so ingeni - ously contrived as to prove remarkably interesting .

		Both are experts in applied electricity , and the technical jargon of the profession is everywhere forced into the service of the narrative , and even into the characterizations .

		It is at least a novelty to read a book in which the heroine is described in such terms as the following : '' She was as fluctuant , she told herself , as the aluminum needle of a quadrant electrometer .

		No , she wa.s more like the helpless little pith-ball of an electroscope , she mentally amended , ever dangling back and forth in a melancholy con - flict of repulsion and attraction . ''

		This is the modern scientific substitute for the old - fashioned supernatural machinery of good and bad angels , as used , for example , in
Marlowe	ORGANIZATION	's '' Dr. Faustus . ''

		The title of tlxis novel is `` The Wire - Tappers , '' and Mr.
Arthur Stringer	PERSON	is its author .

		The hero of '' Breakers Ahead '' is a young En - glishman who quarrels with his father and comes to
America	LOCATION	in quest of a career .

		THE DIAI .

		39 mentary fact of his nativity with some diflficulty , for to describe a youth as • ' a prime favorite among his class-mates at college , the leading spirit of the fra - ternities , popular with soubrettes and chorus-girls , '' is certainly not to describe him as a student at one of the English universities .

		But when we have once '' placed '' him , the story of his fortunes presents no serious obstacles to our comprehension , although the plot has one veiy - weak link , and although his sec - ond wife is not very consistentiy portrayed .

		The action of the novel turns upon the fact that he takes to himself this second wife , for his deserted first wife is still living , and the fact that he believes her to be dead upon the flimsiest of hearsay evidence is the weak link to which reference has already been made .

		Otherwise , the story is exceptionally well put together , and rises steadily toward a climax of interest that proves fairly enthralling .

		And hack - neyed as the essential plot would seem to be from this bare outline , it has nevertheless features of marked originality , and gives us something more than the impression of re-reading a tale already many times told .

		The manner of its telling is matter-of-fact and effective .

		The author 's name ,
A. Maynard Barbour	PERSON	, is , we understand , the name of a woman .

		Mrs.
Ryan	PERSON	's new novel has so confused a way of introducing its characters and setting forth their relationships that we are midway in the volimie be - fore we have fairly straightened them out .

		Aside from this defect of constructive technique , we may say that the work is one of vivid dramatic quality and appealing romantic charm .

		It is a romance of
California	LOCATION	in the early days of the Crringo invasion , and is entitied `` For the Soul of Rafael . ''

		There are few subjects in American life that offer such effective material for romance as this , and few writers have been as successful in blending into a composite xmity the three elements which it offers .

		There is , first , the element of ancient Aztec tradi - tion ; then there is the element of Spanish Catholi - cism superimposed upon that heathen foundation ; and , finally , there is the element of Americanism , aggressive and irreverent , riding rough-shod over the sentiments and idealisms of the older civiliza - tion which it so rudely displaced .

		All three of these influences are given their full artistic value in Mrs.
Ryan	PERSON	's romance , an accomplishment which means wide knowledge and deep sympathy on the author 's part .

		The illustrations to the book are from photographs selected or posed for the purpose .

		Their natural and archaeological features are interesting , but the human figures they introduce do not seem either to fit naturally into their surroundings or to confirm our preconceptions of the characters they represent . ''

		The Court of Love '' is an extravaganza of the most fantastic description , and when we have read far enough to discover its character we rub our eyes and once more scan the title-page to make sure that it really is the work of Miss
Alice Brown	PERSON	.

		But suggestive as it is of another kind of '' Alice '' plunged into a new '' Wonderland , '' we hurry breath - lessly through its pages , and wish that there were more of them .

		Indeed , when its fast and furious close is reached , we are left harrassed by all sorts of cruel doubts concerning the knots that are not dis - entangled and the complications that are not cleared up .

		No outline of its plot -- if there be such a thing about it -- could convey the least sense of its bub - bling humor and joyously riotous course .

		He will get a new view , no doubt , of the work of the
Agricultural Department	ORGANIZATION	at Wash - ington , a new view of the purpose of our various Experiment Stations in the several States , and may perchance be impressed with the fact that agriculture is at last becoming a progressive science .

		Mr.

		Men have not yet learned to `` set aside the laws of Nature . ''

		Linnaeus was not an active botanist in
1700	DATE	, nor is protoplasm the '' life principle '' of anything .

		A squash may develop '' roots several thousand feet in length , '' but it must be in some '' new earth '' unknown to geog - rapher or astronomer .

		Even the '' new earth man '' may hardly persuade us that if the redwood were ''
2000	DATE	years old when came the dawn of

		On page 78 we have an erroneous statement as to the constitution of the air , and on page 80 an inaccurate and misleading expla - nation of the formation of dew .

		Mr.
Harwood	PERSON	's style is , moreover , open to criticism in many ways .

		It is , as already suggested , by far too strenuous .

		We Americans are surely interested in aU that is 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, really interesting and deserving of consideration , and a simple statement of fact should be sufficient to command attention .

		For an American , a florid or lurid presentation of a practical matter suggests exaggeration ; he becomes suspicious , if not incredu - lous .

		Mr.
Harwood	PERSON	's book , to do him justice , needs editing , at least to an extent that would have pre - vented such a sentence as the following : '' Indications at once pointed to a condition of afEairs approaching similar to that in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' etc. .

		But notwithstanding its defects , the volume offers much real information ; and while we believe that it is stUl the same old earth which must yet for long years continue to sup - port the race , yet we are glad to welcome any im - provements in culture or method that may hasten the coming of any '' new earth '' wherein may dwell not only righteousness , but industry , wisdom , and comfort and happiness for men .

		The museums J ^ ^ intelligent and studious visitor and ruins of in
Rome	LOCATION	has felt two pressing needs : ancient
Rome	LOCATION	, g ^ guide to its museums somewhat less minute and technical than the work of
Helbig	ORGANIZATION	, and a guide through the ruins of the ancient city less volu - minous and more up-to-date than
Middleton	PERSON	.

		A work in two small volumes called `` Museums and Ruins of Ancient Rome '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , with Dr.
Walter Amelung	PERSON	and Dr.
Heinrich Holtzinger	PERSON	as authors , arouses cheerful expectations .

		These are not dis - appointed so long as we have Dr.
Amelung	PERSON	as a guide through the museums -LRB- Volume I. -RRB- .

		Only the most important works are touched upon , but these are discussed by that most helpful of methods , the comparative .

		For example , in the presence of some special statue in a Roman gallery he describes sim - ilar works in other collections , or places on the page an illustration of a more complete or better render - ing of the same statue , or a more correct representar tion of an original to be foimd elsewhere .

		Before such important works as the Praxitelean Venus of Cnidos , in the
Vatican Gallery	ORGANIZATION	, we have an oppor - tunity of comparing through the illustrations the much better copy of the head -LRB- in
Berlin	LOCATION	-RRB- , and the whole of the present figure as it exists under the tin drapery which '' moral barbarism '' has wrapped about the lower limbs .

		Looking at the
Discobolus of Myron	ORGANIZATION	, we have three variations with which to compare it .

		Thus the volume becomes quite a lib - eral education in the history of antique sculpture , which is made more thorough by its Historic Index in the concluding chapter .

		The second volume , on the Ruins , is somewhat smaller and distinctly poorer than the first .

		Dr.
Holtzinger	PERSON	has not avaUed him - self of the results of the most recent excavations .

		He seems scarcely to be aware of anything that has been done since the present century came in .

		Yet these six years have been the most brilliant in the whole history of excavation .

		In the
Roman Forimi	ORGANIZATION	more has been done in this time to uncover ancient monuments and explain ancient history than in all the combined centuries before .

		The tomb of Rom - ulus and the beautiful church of
Santa Maria Antiqua	LOCATION	have indeed each the inadequate attention of one sentence .

		But concerning the wonderful
Sepulcre	PERSON	- tum , -- that primitive burial-ground which , first dis - covered in
1902	DATE	, has now opened up an earlier page in the history of
Rome	LOCATION	than ever before known , -- there is not a single word .

		The excavations of
1904	DATE	around the base of the so-caUed Column of
Phocas	LOCATION	, which revealed brick-stamps of the time of Diocle - tian , four centuries before
Phocas	PERSON	and the finding of the pontifical vases near by , are ignored .

		The base of the equestrian statue , found in
1903	DATE	, is given no significance , and the name of Domitian in connection with it is not mentioned , although the work is almost certainly his , as proved by a remarkable correspon - dence to the references in Latin literature .

		Some of the illustrations of this work are from recent photographs ; but the majority are hopelessly out of date , especially those on the northern border of the forum , which show the old tenement houses and street-car track that were demolished as long ago as
1899	DATE	.

Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which Mr.
William Z. Ripley	PERSON	, the general editor , has attempted to apply the '' case system '' to the teaching of descriptive economics .

		The method is interesting , and for two reasons has led , in the case of Mr.
Commons	PERSON	's book , to results especially fortuitous .

		Each chapter , in the first place , shows a greater intimacy with its particular subject than one author would have been able to sustain throughout the treatment of a question so comprehensive as '' the labor problem '' ; and , sec - ondly , the sum total of the opinions in the collection so discreetly compiled are far more valuable than those of any one man .

		Moreover , despite the va - riety of material in the book , a fair amount of unity is preserved through Mr.
Commons	PERSON	's introduction , which adequately relates the chapters .

		To compare in any way these chapters , varied as they are in subject matter , is obviously impracticable ; but one is tempted to recommend , as exceptionally well pre - sented , Mr.
Warne	PERSON	's `` The Miners ' Union , '' Mr.
Commons	PERSON	's `` The Teamsters of

Commons	PERSON	's work commendable , it is gratifying to turn to `` Studies in American Trade Unionism '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , edited by Mr.
Jacob H. Hollander	PERSON	and Mr.
George E. Barnett	PERSON	; for their method and results have been somewhat similar to those evinced in the volume first named .

		This latter volume consists of articles written by advanced students in
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, under the direction of the editors , each student undertaking the detailed investigation of some one carefully selected aspect of trades-unions .

		THE DTATi 41 A
$ 6j000	MONEY	ttrize book .

		These tasks were faithfully performed , and the product is a careful and concise presentation of rarious phases of the labor problem .

		The chapter on the
Knights of Labor	ORGANIZATION	and the
American Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eration is perhaps of the most general interest , and ahonld be read by all who are as yet unenlightened upon the subject of these two great organizations .

		In reading these articles , one is deeply impressed with the fact that labor unions are in these days essentially business organizations , definitely and minutely systematized .

		The consequence is a more commercial relation than formerly existed between employer and employed , and the elimination of the somewhat hypocritical '' paternalism . ''

		This , in turn , seems to bring about more open-handed dealing between the two g ^ eat forces , and the recog ^ tion that each insists upon consideration from the other .

		The authors in all cases deal with facts rather than with theories ; yet they evidently do not believe capital and labor entirely antagonistic , nor the ad - justment of their differences impossible .

		The late
William Bross	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	established a prize in connection with
Lake Forest University	ORGANIZATION	, to stimulate the production of the best books or treatises '' on the connection , relation , and mutual bearing of any practical science , or history of our race , or the facts in any department of knowledge , with and upon the Christian Religion . ''

		In
1902	DATE	, a prize of six thou - sand dollars was offered for the best book fulfilling any of the purposes described in the trust agree - ment , the manuscripts to be presented on or before
June 1 , 1905	DATE	.

		The judges were Professors
G. T. Ladd	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
A. T. Ormond	PERSON	of
Princeton	LOCATION	, and
G. F. `` Wright	PERSON	of
Oberlin	LOCATION	.

		After examination of the essays and awarding of the prize by number , the sealed envelopes were broken , and it was found that Professor
James Orr	PERSON	, of
Glasgow	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, had won the large simi on proofs of a book entitled '' The Problem of the Old Testament '' For thirty years Professor
Orr	PERSON	has been carefully gathering up evi - dence on some of the serious problems that face every thoughtful reader of the Old Testament .

		His books already published have sufficiently indicated his type of mind .

		He takes a comprehensive grasp of any subject , but maintains a prevailingly conserv - ative position .

		He states very fairly his opponent 's view of the case , but his own view is , of course , always the stronger one .

		In this formidable volume of over 600 pages -LRB- Scribner -RRB- he presents a survey of the whole case before us .

		His statements are buttressed by profuse quotations and abundant ref - erences to the critical literature of the day .

		His conclusions are always conservative , though often , we are glad to see , progressively so .

		His work is not that of a theological archaeologist who has no mind to see the new , but he finds truth worth rec - og ^ tion in the advances of modern scholarship .

		With all his generous treatment of his opponents , we are still of the opinion that the right kind of sympathy with progfressive thought would not have led him so completely to close the door to the legiti - mate results of Biblical criticism .

		With the com - mittee of award constituted as it was , this is precisely the kind of work that would be likely to capture the priie .

		There is no book in English that presents with such fulness and streng ^ th , from the conservative point of view , the problems of the Old Testament .

		-LRB- Putnam -RRB- have now appeared -- volumes dealing with the
Stuart	PERSON	, the
Tudor	PERSON	, and the Post-Saxon periods .

		The last of these -LRB- the second in chronological order -RRB- is devoted to the two cen - turies following the battle of
Hastings	LOCATION	; it bears the title '' England under the Xormans and Angevins , '' and is written by Mr.
H. W. C. Davis	PERSON	of
Balliol College	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	. ' ''

		The period ... covered by the present volxmae , '' says the author , `` possesses a dis - tinctive character and unity . ''

		At first sight it ia difficult to see in what this unity can consist ; we remember this period as one of unsettled conditions , of great conflicts in church and state and society .

		But when we look backward from
Evesham	LOCATION	to
Hastings	PERSON	, and note what the intervening years ac - complished , we realize that the author 's statement is correct .

		When
Edward I.	PERSON	ascended the throne , there was a truly English nation with a highly or - ganized feudal society and a vigorous national church .

		The principle of representative government had been recognized , courts had been established , and a common law created .

		The author 's purpose is to trace and account for these `` remarkable develop - ments . ''

		The subject is therefore treated mainly from the political side ; but the social and institu - tional phases are not neglected .

		In many instances the author 's conclusions are not in accord with cur - rent opinions , but in every case they are carefully stated and usually well supported .

		To him , the his - tory of the age does not record '' a duel between two races , '' but `` rather a struggle of native against foreign ambitions and ideas . ''

		The effect of the Crusades on
England	LOCATION	is rated very low ; the reader is left with a doubt if English society was influenced at all by these movements .

		Of the
Great Charter	ORGANIZATION	, the author says : '' In reality ,
Magna Charta	ORGANIZATION	made few lasting innovations and asserted no new liber - ties . ''

		He accuses the framers of the Charter of undue conservatism and lack of foresight .

		Still , he places a higher value on that document than certain continental historians have done .

		The book is written in a clear , easy , and entertaining style , and as a popular history it is likely to take high rank .

		nalists ; and now comes Miss
Kate Sanborn	PERSON	riding another and wholly origrinal new-old hobby .

		She has delved into the history and hunted up the surviving remnants of '' Old-tiiine Wall Pa - pers , '' and from her researches and her unique collection of photographs has made a fascinating 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, monograph , which the
Literary Collector Press of New York	ORGANIZATION	publishes in an attractive limited edition .

		Miss
Sanborn	PERSON	was born in a room whose walls were covered with one of the famous Bay of
Naples	LOCATION	pa - pers , and when she bought her abandoned farm , a few years ago , she found on its walls several quaint hand-painted floral designs , hidden under a half - dozen layers of cheap modern covering .

		So she never labored under the popular misconception that in colonial days walls were all whitewashed .

		In - stead , she was greatly surprised to find so little material on the subject of the evolution of modern wall-hangings .

		The effect of this sparsity of mate - rial is evident in the earlier chapters of the book , where interesting but disjointed odds and ends of general information and description and anecdote present an unpleasant effect of scrappiness .

		The chapters on early American papers are much better , but the chief interest of the book lies undoubtedly in its excellent reproductions of over eighty old-time papers , most of them being patterns that covered the walls of colonial or early nineteenth-century man - sions in
New England	LOCATION	.

		Some are reproduced in the original colors , and many plates show details as well as general views .

		Most of the papers shown are the panelled ones , with a different scene for each side of the room .

		Tropical views and mythological themes seem to be favorites , and the designs generally show an elaboration that is , to say the least , amazing .

		These old papers are of course rapidly disappearing , and even now
Miss Sanborn	PERSON	's collection of photo - graphs could not be duplicated .

		So her book is likely to become standard , and people who care for antiques will wish to own it .

		average reader of Mr.
T. C. Win	PERSON	- chester 's '' Life of
John Wesley	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The influence which
John Wesley	PERSON	wielded for nearly a third of the eighteenth century in
England	LOCATION	would suggest the need of just such a volume as the author has here given to the public .

		There are other lives of
Wesley	LOCATION	, representing greater labor in com - position and research than the present one , but no other presents with such vividness the personal side of
Wesley	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		The author has not attempted an elaborate study of the man and of the important movement which has grown into the world-wide ecclesiastical organization known as Methodism .

		He has told us , rather , the story of both the man and the movement from the viewpoint , not of a disciple , but of one who believes that the story is worth tell - ing afresh for popular reading .

		With a fine sense of perspective , Mr.
Winchester	PERSON	's narrative covers the years of
Wesley	PERSON	's youth , his education at Ox - ford , his experience in
America	LOCATION	, and his transition struggle between a native bent toward Calvinistic introspection and those influences from without which enabled him at last to emerge in the clear light of spiritual self-discovery and service .

		Wes - ley 's debt to
Whitfield	PERSON	, who revealed to him the possibilities of open-air preaching to the masses , was an important influence in the rise of Methodism .

		The genius of Wesley for organization and personal instruction , resulting in the formation of the '' United Societies , '' is exhibited as a potent factor in the launching of the movement .

		The author has not permitted the social , intellectual , and religious con - ditions of eighteenth century
England	LOCATION	to pass with - out adequate notice .

		He sees that those conditions furnish the natural background to a biography of
Wesley	LOCATION	.

		The last chapter , on ``
John Wesley	PERSON	the Man , '' is an especially clear and satisfactory presen - tation of the great preacher 's mind and personality .

		Modern Italian novelists .

		Dr.
Joseph Spencer Kennard	PERSON	's '' Ital - ian Romance Writers '' -LRB-
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- is an English version of a work pub - lished last year in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		It is not , as might be inferred from its title , a chronological history of Italian novels and novelists , but a study of the most important of those , from
Manzoni	PERSON	to d'Annunzio , -- a study undertaken for the purpose of showing that the `` birth of the novel was contemporary with the idea of nationality '' and that '' its develop - ment has always been simultaneous with that of the nation . ''

		Recalling some of the chief events of the past century , and examining many of the most im - portant novels published in the past hundred years , the author traces '' the parallelism and synchronism of the political and literary awakening of
Italy	LOCATION	, '' and compares that country 's '' last political changes with its last period of mental evolution and its most recent literary production , the modern novel , '' in order to show '' how this mirror of the social con - ditions of the young nation has been in turn both cause and effect of the
Peninsula	LOCATION	's intellectual devel - opment . ''

		Then , taking up the Italian novel of to - day , and studying it by means of a comparison of past and present conditions , he not only concludes that the novel of the future will be whatever Italian life shall be , but ventures to predict that '' it will be the instrument , no less than the interpreter , of
Italy	LOCATION	's progress . ''

		This hopeful view is based upon his confidence in the country 's moral improvement , and with it the development of a greater respect for women and the solution of many perplexing social problems .

		Aside from its general comments and conclusions , the book has value for the chapters on the various Italian novelists included in its survey .

		It is a pity , however , that American readers could not have been presented with a version in less '' rocky '' English than the present one .

		The purpose of the volume , as announced in the preface , is to award the honors impartially , and to frame an absolutely imbiassed and correct judgment concerning the various com - manders of the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the Potomac How impar - tially the work has been done , and how imbiassed are the author 's judgments , may be inferred from the terms used in describing General
McClellan	PERSON	's `` weakness of character , '' his '' bravado , '' his ' `` out - rageous treatment '' of General Pope , his '' imper - tinent and assinine '' letters to President

Fiske	PERSON	's career lies '' in the part he took in unfolding modern thought to his fellow countrymen . ''

		Apart from his precocitj - , the story of his early life is not unusual , and his later career was marked chiefly by the appearance of his various works .

		His significance lies in his early acceptance of the principles of evolution , which both in philosophic and in historical aspects he clearly grasped and cogently taught .

		In American history he was a pioneer , in bringing the events he described into their proper relation to the history of the world , and in presenting them as elements in the '' one increasing purpose '' that runs throughout all cosmic and all hu - man development .

		Fiske was ' * a born teacher , '' uniting accurate and varied knowledge with lucid presentation and a rare power to charm and arouse the enthusiasm of listener or reader .

Fiske	PERSON	's was a gracious and attractive person - ality .

		Of his vast scholarship , his remarkable mem - ory , his humor , and his unfailing fairness , sincerity , and integrity , Mr.

Henry D. Lloyd	PERSON	during the ten years preceding his death , and now brought together in a volimie .

		The author never having intended them for publica - tion , the addresses , as the editors remark , contain '' many defects in argument and lucidity which Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	would certainly have remedied before pub - lishing . ''

		But these defects , though numerous and ever-present , will not deter the reader who is touched with the peculiar social longings and hopes of the day ; for Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	was a social prophet of no ordi - nary - power and inspiration .

		The main thesis of the present book is indicated by the title , namely , that man is creating , out of the divine potentialities of his own nature , the social life and institutions which are , for a large body of thinkers to-day , the • ' Eang - dom of Heaven '' upon earth .

		The book is also understood to embody the author 's religious beliefs .

		One chapter sets forth that ' * social progress is al - ways religious '' ; another preaches '' the religion of labor '' ; elsewhere we find the more questionable doctrine that Gt -RRB- d is not yet , but is becoming , through the process of human social development .

		Every - where we find optimism -- evil interpreted as good ' in the making , and the future heralded as a mighty advance upon the present .

		Mr.
Leon H. Vincent	PERSON	's `` American Literary Masters '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a series of essays upon nineteen of the most famoos American writers , from

		The work is pleasing in style , and provides much systematically-ordered information .

		Although not ap - parently intended for use as a text-book , it might prof - itably be used for that purpose . ''

		Modem Love : An Anthology , '' is published by Mr.
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	.

		It is a little book of poems by -LRB- mostly -RRB- living English authors , `` chosen from fifty different volumes , '' and representing perhaps half that number of poets .

		The booklet is claimed to be '' the first anthology of love poems to be published which has avoided the insincere elaboration and hyperbole of the style of the love poems of early literature . '' ''

		Days and Deeds '' is a compilation of verse for children 's reading and speaking , and is published by the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editors ,
Burton E. Stevenson	PERSON	and
Elizabeth B. Stevenson	PERSON	, have made a classified collection of what they call `` the really significant poetry relating to Americsm holidays and to great Americans , '' and have added thereto `` an anthology of the seasons , '' and a brief selection of '' poems every chUd should know . ''

		This should prove a very useful book for schools .

		The number of special days illustrated is no less than twenty-seven , and includes even such dubious occasions as

San Jacinto	LOCATION	day , and Carnation day . ''

		It is a convenient compendium of `` the critical and explanatory helps that must otherwise be sought from many books . ''

		A series of introductions to the separate works , taken chronologically , fills the bulk of the volume , the remaining contents being chap - ters of history , biography , and bibliography , with dis - cussions of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's art , philosophy , and metrics .

		The book is prepared with knowledge and judgment , and seems to be , with the possible exception of Professor

J. F. Miiirhead	PERSON	continues to act in his capacity as editor of the '' Great
Britain	LOCATION	'' manual .

		A third edition of the
Abb	ORGANIZATION	^
J. A. Dubois	PERSON	's work on `` Hindu Manners , Customs , and Ceremonies , '' as trans - lated by Mr.
Henry K. Beauchamp	PERSON	, comes to us from the
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The translator 's introduction and
Max Miiller	PERSON	's prefatory note are both reprinted .

		To the '' Miniature Reference Library '' of the Messrs.
Routledge	PERSON	is now added '' Five Thousand Words Fre - quently Misspelt , '' by Mr.
William Swan Sonnenschein	PERSON	.

		Many proper names are included , and the little book as a whole bears the marks of very careful preparation . ''

		Early Diplomatic Negotiations of the
United States	LOCATION	with
Russia	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
John C. Hildt	PERSON	, and '' The Finances of American Trade Unions , '' by Dr.
A. M. Sakolski	PERSON	, are two recent publications of the
Johns Hopkins Univer	PERSON	- sity in the '' Historical and Political Science '' Series .

		Messrs.
Cassell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	now issue their annual volume of '' Royal Academy Pictures '' for the nineteenth time .

		The best of the eighteen himdred works exhibited this year are here in acceptable black and white , with
Forbes	PERSON	's '' Evening in the Village '' as a frontispiece in photogravure .

		A tenth edition of '' The Elements of Jurisprudence , '' by
Thomas Erskine Holland	PERSON	, is published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	at the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	, from which source we have also '' The First Year of Roman Law , '' translated by Dr.
Charles P. Sherman	PERSON	from the French of
M. Fernand Bernard	ORGANIZATION	.

		An old fashion in sensational fiction is recalled to us by a new edition of James De MiUe 's '' Cord and Creese , '' a story better worth reading than most of the more recent examples of its class .

		Even the double columns of the old familiar print are reproduced .

		Messrs.
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	first copyrighted the book in
1869	DATE	, and now send us this reprint .

		From
Messrs. Taylor & Taylor	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Richmond	LOCATION	-RRB- we have an issue of '' The
John P. Branch Historical Papers of Randolph-Macon College	ORGANIZATION	, '' having for its contents a study of the public life of
R. M. T. Hunter	PERSON	, by Mr.
D. R. Anderson	PERSON	, and a series of reprints from the '' Richmond Inquirer '' of
1821	DATE	, illustrative of the opposition to Chief Justice
Marshall	PERSON	in his native State of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		The book of ''
Chevalier Bayard	PERSON	, '' in
Sara Coleridge	PERSON	's translation , is a new '' Pocket Classic , '' and '' The Travels of Mungo Park '' a new '' Thin Paper Classic , '' in the well-known series of reprints published in
London	LOCATION	by Mr.
George Newnes	PERSON	, and imported for the American market by the
Messrs Scribner	ORGANIZATION	.

		All students of Spanish literature are familiar with the extensive collection by
Rivadeneyra	PERSON	, in 71 volumes , known as the
Bihlioteca de Autores Espanoles	ORGANIZATION	, the pub - lication of which was begun in
1846	DATE	and suspended in
1880	DATE	, shortly after the death of its founder and pub - lisher .

		No one now remains of the little group of scholars who were associated together in this most praiseworthy task of editing and publishing such Span - ish texts as were either rare or difficult of access imtil that time to the general public .

		We are particularly interested , therefore , in a prospectus recently received of a
Nueva Bihlioteca de Autores Espanoles	ORGANIZATION	, to be pub - lished by the well-known house of Bailly-Baillifere y Hijos of
Madrid	LOCATION	, imder the direction of that profound scholar and delightful writer ,
Marcelino Men	PERSON	^ ndez y Pelayo , with the collaboration of such noted specialists as R. Men ^ ndez Pidal ,
M. Serrano y Sanz	PERSON	,
A. Bonilla	PERSON	y
San Martin	LOCATION	,
E. Cotarelo y Mori	ORGANIZATION	,
M. Mir	PERSON	, and other distinguished Spanish scholars .

		It is the purpose of the
Nueva Bihlioteca	ORGANIZATION	to ofPer a continuation and com - plement to the Bihlioteca of
Rivadeneyra	LOCATION	, though not to follow too closely its plan or imitate exactly its methods , particularly in the reproduction of texts .

		In the col - lection by
Rivadeneyra	PERSON	, modern orthography is used in all texts , even those of the Middle Ages ; and in many philological accuracy is wanting .

		In the
Nueva	ORGANIZATION	, all texts preceding the classical epoch are to be reproduced with their peculiar orthography , those of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to be left to the discretion of the individual editors , and those of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to be printed according to modern usage .

		Voliuninous though the work of
Rivadeneyra	ORGANIZATION	is , there are some literary classes or periods that are but poorly represented , if at all .

		This is notably true of the literature of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		Of the classical epoch , the dramatists anterior to Lope , and those of second order , lyrical poetry , mystical literature , didactic writings and historiography , receive but scant attention .

		In the eighteenth century the drama , the novel , and scientific literature are more or less neglected , and almost no treatment is given to nineteenth-century writers .

		It is the intention of the
Nueva Bihlioteca	ORGANIZATION	to fill up these lacunse , and if the ambitious project is real - ized , the number of volumes in the collection may readily exceed the 71 of
Rivadeneyra	PERSON	.

		The scholarly treat - ment of the works already published speaks well for the rest of the series , and we feel convinced that we are greeting the best of the many excellent collections of which Spanish literature can boast .

		What some of the critics of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	are saying about Mr.
MORLEY ROBERTS	PERSON	'S unusual novel THE IDLERS FOURTH PRINTING The English Press London Literary World : '' Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	has done for the fast set of
London	LOCATION	what Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	did for the same social clasa in
America	LOCATION	.

		It is a powerful novel -- a merciless dissection of modem society . ''

		London Homing Pott : '' Mr.
Morler Roberta	PERSON	has written many excellent books , but none so good as ' The Idlers . '

		The character of Ren6e is made the occasion of one of the most vivid and tragic scenes in fiction . ''


London	LOCATION	Graphic : '' A vigorously written tale containing much of the keenest observation and very admirable char - acter drawing . ''

		St.
Jamet	PERSON	' t Gazette -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- : '' An occasionally unpleasant but decidedly readable novel of modem society .

		Con - tains sitoations which would be the finest French farce were they not treated by the aathor with a somewhat ghastly serioosneaB . ''


London	LOCATION	Queen : '' Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	indulges snbtleties , and is never afraid to call a spade a spade .

		The stoiy goes with a swing and a gaUop which carries its readers over a good many stiff fences . ''

		The
American Press	ORGANIZATION	yeu - York Sun : '' The story makes absorbing reading .

		It is full of clever irony .

		The interest is maintained and is sharp everywhere -- in dialogue , the description , and the comment .

		There is is a dramatic part that runs to tragedy and that will make the reader ■ sit up . ''

		The characters are ingeniously imagined and skilfully handled .

		They supply both comedy and tragedy . ''

		St.
Lou 14	DATE	Republic : '' There is something of the
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	about him , but he is a trifle pleasanter , and , poasibly .

		cleverer .

		Thai , too , he figures to provide always the wholesome contrast between the agreeable and disagreeable .

		His is at once a broader view than
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's , and he can occasionally see other than the ills , oddities , meannesses , baseness , foUy .

		and inconsistency of the human being .

		He is a saner philosopher and truer artist , which accentuates the piquancy of his pessimism and trenchant cleverness , when he does happen upon ills , which , by the way , is most of the time . ''

		Chicago Inter Ocean : '' An entertaining galaxy of English types , portrayed with bmtal directness ; an interesting story , full of strong situations and clever and cynical satire . ''

		yew
York Times Saturday Revieu	ORGANIZATION	- : '' Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	believes in love , in honor , even in comradeship , though he jeers at some things which wear those names .

		Because of these things and a knack that way , the story is a story for people who like their romance spiced with wit and anchored to a sense of things as they are . ''

		Boston Advertiser : `` A real story , rather ugly in spots , but vibrant with life and vigorously told .

		One may rail against some of Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	's ideas , but he will not suffer the fate of one ignored . ''

		Boston Transcript : '' The story is well told , has many dramatic situations , some brilliant satire , and also abundant humor , or it could not be from the pen of
Morley Roberts	PERSON	. ''


Philadelphia Xorth	LOCATION	A merican : '' The accomplished author of '
Rachel Marr	PERSON	, ' a great novd of genuine passion , has raked the British gilded muck heap , and found material for his practised hand . '

		The Idlers ' bristles with dramatic situations , the final scene being a tragedy of appalling intensity . ''

		NOTES 73 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 74 A POE TS ' SH RINE .

		There is no spot on earth more sacred to lovers of English poetry than that comer of the old Protestant Cemetery at
Rome	LOCATION	where the mortal remains of
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	were laid to rest nearly a century ago .

		Adonais and
Ariel	PERSON	, the poet of pure beauty and the poet of boundless love , the spirit who '' outsoared the shadow of our night '' and the '' heart whose beating blood was running song , '' -- these , of all English poets , are the ones with whom our associations are the most tender and whose memory is the dearest .

		Many are the pilgrims who have re - paired to their graves as to a shrine , whose tears have welled from a deeper source than sentiment , and whose devotion to the good and beautiful has been strengthened by the example of those lives , so soon extinguished and so futile in seem - ing , yet so potent in their sway over the emo - tions and the ideals of the ensuing generations .

		The Roman municipality has upon several occasions during recent years , actuated by a zeal for '' improvements , '' threatened to invade the resting-place of our poets .

		On one occasion , a section of the old wall of the cemetery was actually demolished for the purpose of making a new street .

		The
British Embassy	ORGANIZATION	at
Rome	LOCATION	has thus far been able to oppose successfully these attempts at vandalism , although in one instance the mischief was averted only by the interposition of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	herself .

		The house on the
Piazza di Spagna	ORGANIZATION	in which
Keats	PERSON	lived the last weeks of his stricken life has also been threatened by the '' march of progress , '' and has suffered sadly from neglect .

		About three years ago , a small company of American writers , fortuitously gathered in
Rome	LOCATION	, determined to make an effort to save the graves of the poets from violation , and at the same time to preserve the
Keats	PERSON	hoiise from disfigure - ment by converting it into a sort of museum or memorial of both
Keats	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		An inter - national organization was planned , with com - mittees in
Rome	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and
New York	LOCATION	, having for its objects the purchase of the house and the perpetual guardianship of the two graves .

		It was desired to establish in the house a col - lection of relics and a library , under the charge of a curator , and to rent the imneeded floors as 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, a means of maintenance .

		There would thus be provided in Kome a pleasant meeting-place for English and American travellers , on a spot hal - lowed by its associations with one of the poets .

		Since the organization of these committees , much effective work has been done in a quiet way , and official endorsement has been given to the plan by Their Majesties the Kings of
Italy	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, and by the President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The purchase of the
Keats	PERSON	house will require about
twenty-two thousand dollars	MONEY	, although a somewhat larger f imd than this should be raised to place the project upon a secure basis .

		One-half the purchase price has already been secured -LRB- mostly from American subscrib - ers -RRB- , and an option obtained upon the property by an atlvance payment .

		It remains only to complete the fund and obtain full possession , which must , however , be done by next
January	DATE	.

		A public appeal is now made for contributions , large or small , from all lovers of poetry who wish to become associated with this highly com - mendable enterprise .

		Subscriptions will be re - ceived by Mr.
Robert Underwood Johnson	PERSON	, 33 East 17th St. ,
New York	LOCATION	, the secretary and treasurer of the
American Committee	ORGANIZATION	.

		There seems to be little doubt that the needed amount will be forthcoming , and it should be a matter of pride with our own countrymen to see that this imdertaking , American in its conception , should owe its success chiefly to American support .

		Of all the old-world shi * ines to which lovers of poetry repair , there is probably no other that so fully meets the conditions of ideal fitness and beauty as the spot in the old Roman cemetery over which this tender guardianship is now sought to be established .

		It has been described many times , and pictured until the old Roman wall , the pyramid of Cains Cestius , the solenm cypresses , and all the other features of the scene have been made familiar ` beyond all similarly consecrated places .

		Yet it may not be amiss to quote once more the stanza from `` Adonais '' which was the first description of the spot ever penned . ''

		And gray walls moulder round , on which dull
Time Feeds	ORGANIZATION	, like slow fire upon a hoary brand ; And one keen pyramid with wedge sublime .

		Pavilioning the dust of him who planned This refuge for his memory , doth stand Like flame transformed to marble ; and beneath A field is spread , on which a newer band Have pitched in
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's smile their camp of death Welcoming him we lose with scarce-extingiiished breath . '' ''

		It makes one in love with death to think that one shoidd be buried in so sweet a place , '' was
Shelley	PERSON	's comment upon the burial-place of
Keats	PERSON	.

		A year later he slept within sight of the grave of his brother poet .

		It may not be amiss also to recall the epitaphs of the two singers .

		That of
Keats	PERSON	, as composed by Severn , reads as follows : '' This grave contains all that was mortal of a young English poet , who , on his deathbed , in the bitterness of his heart at the malicious power of his enemies , desired the words to be engraved on his tombstone : ♦ Here lies one whose name was writ in water , '
Feb. 24th , 1821	DATE	. ''

		Upon the wall near by , a medallion portrait was afterwards placed by joint English and American devotion , and beneath it this acrostic : ''
Keats	PERSON	, if thy cherished name be ' writ in water , ' Each drop has fallen on some woman 's cheek -- A sacred tribute such as heroes seek , Though oft in vain , for dazzling deeds of slaughter .

		Sleep on !

		not honoured less for epitaph so meek . ''

		For
Shelley	PERSON	's tombstone ,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	proposed a pompous legend : ''
Percy Bysshe Shelley	PERSON	, Anglus , oram Etruscam legens in naArigiolo inter Ligurnum portum et
Viam Regiam	PERSON	, procella periit
VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		Non .

		Jul. .

		MDCCCXXIJ .

		iEtat .

		Suje XXX . ''

		But his friend
Trelawny	LOCATION	adopted a simpler form , giving , besides the name and the dates , only the expressive motto , `` Cor Cordium , '' and the familiar lines from '' The Tempest '' : '' Nothing of him that doth fade But doth suffer a sea-change Into something rich and strange . ''

		It was a singular fate that spared the respec - tive companions of the two poets until they became old men , and at last brought them to rest with the friends of their youth .

		THE DIAL 5d ^ ^ t Jtefaj goohs .

		The
Early Lefe of Tolstot	ORGANIZATION	.

		*
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's life seems now so near its end , and his messages so fully delivered , that the time is ripe for a study in detail of the development of the man , and for a new emphasis upon his influences on modem society and modem litera - ture .

		To portray a life so crowded with dra - matic incidents , and to interpret a literary work so large and significant , a biographer must have a broad s ^ nnpathy ynth the larger aims of his subject and a great capacity - for details ; he must be able to construct a strong character out of many paradoxical and often unadmirable traits .

		The beginnings of such a study , with especial emphasis ujwn the biographic element , may be found in the first translated volume dealing \ ^ ` ith
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's life and work , compiled by
Paul Birukoff	PERSON	and re \ ised by
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	him - self , which has been prepared for the new '' In - ternational Edition '' of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		This biography belongs to the impersonal , editorial type , as regards its author ; he keeps in the background , and allows his subject to be portrayed , in character and acti \ aties , through joiuTials , letters , and a few published extracts .

		Mr.
Birukoff	PERSON	was a pupil of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, however , and in occasional passages , as well as in the underlying motive of his work , he shows a loving reverence for his master .

		The bibli - ogi-aphy , which is a part of the introduction to the present volume , indicates how fully the edi - tor has read and considered various estimates of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's early life and his first ventures in authorship .

		The period of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's life covered by this volmne is his boyhood and early man - hood , lea \ Tng him at thirty-four years of age .

		It may seem imwise to some readers that this fragment of such an important life-history as that of Tolstoy should have been published before the other portions of the biography were com - pleted .

		Tolstoy 's development was so unusual , yet sequential , that one might prefer to follow the traces of it in a complete circle rather than study it in segments , at distant intervals .

		Such a completion of the biography would also allow the reader to grasp the vital points in the character and genius of its subject by that concentration of interest which is often lost by the serial method .

		This single voliune , however , is far more than •

		prefatory .

		It is an exhaustive analysis of the youth and early manhood of a personality of ex - ceptional interest , with whose later years of achievement the reading-public is generally fa - miliar .

		Within this period were developed and displayed those traits which have given to Tol - stoy the high rank now accorded him as social seer and literary ai-tist .

		In youth , as in later life , he showed a character compounded of pas - sionate ardor , truthfulness , modesty , and a love of goodness which could not be submerged be - neath indulgence in e \ Tl and vice .

		In the In - troduction to this volume .

		Count Tolstoy has laid stress upon his determination to be truth - ful , -- to avow his early sensuality and vanity no less than his yearnings for the good .

		He divides his life into four periods of imequal length : his joyous childhood , his sensuous and weak youth , his quiet family life of middle years , and his last twenty years of deeper activi - ties in reform and letters .

		With earnest sin - cerity he adds : '' Such a history of my life during these four periods I should like to write quite truthfully , if God will give me the power and time .

		I think that such an autobiography , even though very defective , woidd be more prof - itable to men than all that artistic prattle with which the twelve volimies of my works are filled , and to which men of our time attribute an un - deserved sigTiificanc $ . ''

		The present volume adds few new incidents to the known facte regarding
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's ances - try and boyhood .

		There are graphic pictures at intervals , -- that of the sensitive boy just emerging from babyhood , listening to the weird tales by the blind story-teller in his grand - mother 's chamber , or companioning his father on the himt and bearing away life-impressions of his gayety and kindness .

		Prominent among those who left deep influences during the child - hood at
Yasnaya Polyana	LOCATION	was his aunt
Tatiana Alexandrova	PERSON	; of her part in his emotional de - velopment he writes : '' She taught me the spir - itual delight of love .

		She taught me this , but not in words : by her whole being she filled me with love .

		I saw , I felt , how she enjoyed lov - ing , and I understood the joy of love .

		This was the first thing .

		Secondly , she taught me the delighte of an unhurried , lonely life . ''

		Other memories were associated with his brothers ,
Nichoki	PERSON	and
Sergius	PERSON	, and with the death of his father , which first awakened a sense of religious awe in the shy , self-conscious lad .

		These more serious traite did not preclude a few boyish pranks , like jumping from a two-story window or clipping his eyebrows .

		60 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, In his later books , `` Youth '' and '' My Con - fession , ''
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	has revealed , with unsparing frankness , the depravity of his university years and his life at
Moscow	LOCATION	, with their indulgences in cards , routs , and adventures among the gyp - sies .

		At the same time , the reader is made to feel the tumultuous inner life of yearning and unrest .

		Mr.
Birukoff	PERSON	has summarized the brief period thus : '' During these three years of his life ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	tasted of everything which a pas - sionate and energetic young man could seize . ''

		Meantime , his literary tastes were seeking ex - pression , and he planned a story of gyjJsy life , or a novel , modelled after
Sterne	PERSON	's ''
Senti	PERSON	- mental Journey . ''

		These early efforts at au - thorship were not brought to fruition , and the few published tales which first won him notice among the
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	group of writers are scarcely recalled to-day .

		With his enlistment in the army of the
Caucasus	LOCATION	, in
1850	DATE	, came a crisis both in his moral and literary develop - ment .

		The scenery of the mountains and the simple life of the peasants awakened his crea - tive genius , and the resiJts were shown in '' The Cossacks '' and '' Tales from
Sebastopol	LOCATION	. ''

		Much space is given in this volume to the relations between
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	and Turgenieff , with details of their sundry meetings and correspon - dence .

		Men of common ideals and gifts , their temperaments forbade much spiritual affinity , although there was mutual admiration , and even affection , when they were separated .

		Following the two journeys abroad , and the death of his brother
Nicholai	PERSON	, -- experiences which broad - ened and deepened
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's soul , -- he put into practical experiment his theories of educational reform which had been maturing in his mind for twelve years .

		The reader will here find detailed information regarding the ten schools under
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's control , lists of the teachers , and many incidents of interest in the school - life , amplified from his articles on Education and Instruction .

		At thirty-four years of age , after many sen - timental adventures ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	loved worthily the younger daughter of a family friend .

		Dr.
Bers	PERSON	.

		The
Countess Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	has won the admiration of the world by her broad and clear intellect , her wise administrative ability , her wonderful insight into
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's character , and her pro- tecting loyalty to him .

		In ''
Anna Karenina	PERSON	'' he has used the declaration of love '' by primary letters , '' by which he expressed his own interest in the young girl , and gained her response .

		True to his unswerving honesty , he insisted that she should read all his diaries revealing his earlier irregularities .

		The struggle of heart and soul through which the maiden passed , as she saw her hero unveiled , is told with dramatic vividness , suggesting the similar motive in Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	's novel , `` The Mettle of the Pasture . ''

		With sadness but with sympathetic courage ,
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's friend accepted the past and pledged herseK to his future of repentance and achievement .

		This volume leaves the reader at the threshold of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's home-life and literary fame .

		He had already written a few novels that were known to critics and authors but were scant - ily read by the public , as `` The Snow-Storm , '' '' The Two Hussars , '' '' Family Hapjiiness , '' '' Polikushlca , '' and `` The Memoirs of a Billiard Marker . ''

		Within these forgotten studies in fiction were the germs of that moral element and denunciation of contemporary social evils on which he has '' concentrated all his powerful artistic gifts . ' '

		One more experience -- the search for and grasp of true religion -- was needed to crystallize his moral and mental enthusiasm and give peace to his spiritual unrest .

		The editor closes his work with this forecast : `` In the next volume we hope to narrate that current of events in
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's life which brought him to the mo - ment when the thirst for truth , and the suffering occasioned by not finding it , culminated , and eventually led him to the only solution , the only foundation of life , and the only guide in his further exertions -- to reUgion .

		^ ^ The attractiveness of this volume is enhanced by nearly thirty illustrations , some rare photo - graphs from early paintings of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, many portraits of his family , and a few fine views of the parks and buildings of
Yasnaya Polyana	LOCATION	, the family estate .

		The
Anatomy of Dogma	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In his book entitled '' Some Dogmas of Re - ligion , '' Dr.
McTaggart	PERSON	says : '' By metaphysics I mean the systematic study of the tiltimate nature of reality , and by dogma I mean any proposition which has a metaphysical significance '' -LRB- p. 1 -RRB- . ''

		Religion is clearly a state of mind .

		It is also clear that it is not exclusively the acceptance of certain propositions as true .

		It seems to me that it may best be described as an emotion resting on a conviction of a harmony between ourselves and the universe at large '' -LRB- p. 3 -RRB- .

		It may fairly be asked , whether reality has any other nature than its ultimate one ; and if so , how we are to know when we have reached that nature .

		Would it not be better to content • Some Dogmas of Religion .

		By
John McTaggart Ellis McTaggart	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green & Co	ORGANIZATION	,
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 61 ourselves with a more modest conception of metaphysics and dogma , frankly confessing that the '' ultimate '' nature of anything , as distin - guished from its apparent or imaginable nature , is beyond the field of human thought ?

		Nothing is more commonplace or familiar than time ; yet it is entirely out of the question to imagine the whole of time , or its limits , or its limitless quality -- if to be limitless is a quality .

		Meta ^ physics , it seems to me , finds its true scope in bridging , by means of thought , the gaps between observable phenomena ; and dogma consists of statements made on metaphysical grounds .

		It is a nice question whether any dogma , as thus defined , can be said to be knowledge .

		At first sight , it appears easy to deny it that property , confining knowledge to the results of experience -- the field of science : but an analysis of the simplest scientific proposition shows that it con - tains more than the description of immediate experience .

		The definition of religion also ap - pears to be criticisable .

		Who knows anything about '' the universe at large '' ?

		Would it not be equally rea.sonable to say that the sense of location depends upon a con ^ action of position in space at large ?

		Undoubtedly religion depends upon a conviction of harmony between ourselves and something else ; but what is that other ?

		It seems to me that the true basis of the feeling depends on our sense of worth ; there is some - thing in ourselves which responds to an eternal standard of value , which we believe can not fail .

		We may not know how powerfid the right is in the universe , but we do not believe in its extinc - tion , and we do believe that , whatever its nu - merical strength , it amounts to more than all else , because it alone has value .

		Having thus found faidt ^ \ - ith the very basis of Dr.
McTaggart	PERSON	's argmnent , we may frankly admit that his book is lucid and interesting , and that it will do excellent service in clearing away many venerable cobwebs .

		At the same time , the common man will undoubtedly protest that it is not quite fair to demolish the phrases he is accustomed to vise , and then assume that his real position is also overthrown .

		One could wax sarcastic over the expressions '' Dear Sir '' and `` Yours truly , '' employed daily in letters ; but letter-writers woidd be amused rather than wounded by the exposure of their unveracity and insincerity .

		The first chapter of the book sets forth the imjjortance of dogma ; in the second , the estab - lishment of dogma is considered at length .

		The thii 'd and fourth treat of hmnan immortality and pre-existence , and seem to me to be the best in the book .

		The conclusion is reached , that the arguments which may lead us to believe in immortality also make it probable that we have pre-existed .

		We can not give a condensed sum - mary of these chapters , which are full of inter - esting suggestions .

		Instead , we offer a rather long quotation from the close of Chapter IV. , as a good example of the author 's style , and especially for the purpose of showing that his residts are not wholly negative . ''

		Pre-existence indeed , a '' we have seen , renders more probable a plurality of future lives .

		And the prospect of a great number of lives -- perhaps an infinite num - ber , though this is not a necessary part of the theory -- gives us the prospect of many dangers , many conflicts , many griefs , in an indefinitely long future .

		Death is not a haven of rest .

		It is a starting-point for fresh labors .

		But if the trials are great , so is the recompense .

		We miss much here by our own folly , much by unfavor - able circmnstances .

		Above all , we miss much because so many good things are incompatible .

		We can not spend our youth both in the study and in the saddle .

		We can not gain the benefit both of mibroken health and of bodily weakness , both of riches and of poverty , both of comradeship and of isolation , both of defiance and of obedience .

		We can not learn the lessons alike of Galahad and of
Tristram	ORGANIZATION	and of Caradoc .

		And yet they are all so good to learn .

		Would it not be worth much to be able to hope that what we missed in one life might come to us in another ?

		And would it not be worth much to be able to hope that we might have a chance to succeed hereafter in the tasks which we failed in here ?

		... But though the way is long , and perhaps endless , it can be no more wearisome than a single life .

		For with death we leave behind us memory , and old age , and fatigue .

		And surely death acquires a new and deeper significance when we regard it no longer as a single and imexplained break in an unending life , but as part of the continually recurring rhjrthm of progress -- as inevitable , as natural , and as benevolent as sleep .

		We have oidy left j ^ outh behind us , as at noon we have left the sunrise .

		They will both come back , and they do not grow old '' -LRB- pp. 138-139 -RRB- .

		Chapter V. deals with Free-will , and offers a strong argument in favor of the determinist position .

		It seems to me that the discussion proceeds largely from a misapprehension as to what is ordinarily meant by '' free-will , '' that term being , in its common usage , somewhat of a misnomer .

		If I say my will is free , I do not mean , as the indeterminist is declared to mean , that it is dependent upon nothing ; I mean , really , that it is not free , that I control it .

		Logically , indeterminism in its literal and pure form can not be defended , and is rightly de - molished by the author ; but there still remains a practical and recognizable position , which is entirely contrary to pure or mechanical deter - minism .

		Dr.
McTaggart	PERSON	reduces this , in effect , to the feeling that our wills are true causes of phenomena , as they certainly are , whether them - selves already caused or not .

		This seems only 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, to be one aspect of the matter ; and it is pos - sible that freedom to vary experience may be the real basis of '' free-will , '' and ultimately of virtue itself .

		If this is declared to be illogical , it may be fairly replied that there is no escap - ing the paradox ; for one who declares that there is no such thing as freedom puts himself out of com-t as a judge of its existence .

		Either he is discussing something which is incompre - hensible , or he has not rightly apprehended the practical meaning of the term .

		Chapters VI .

		and
VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		treat of the idea of God , and it is excellently argued that the literal idea of an omnipotent God presents so many difficulties and contradictions that it is untena - ble .

		It is also held that a God who is the creator of all reality is hard to imagine , but that a God who is neither omnipotent nor crea - tive -LRB- except in the sense that human beings are creative -RRB- conflicts with no valid metaphysical or other doctrine .

		The principal objection one may offer to this discussion is the one already men - tioned , that much of it is really little more than playing with words .

		Thus : '' Could God create a being of such a nature tliat he could not subsequently destroy it ?

		Whatever answer we make to this question is fatal to God 's omnipotence .

		If we say that he could not create such a being , then there is something that he can not do .

		If we say that he can create such a being , then there is still some - thing that he can not do -- to follow such an act of creation by an act of destruction '' -LRB- p. 204 -RRB- .

		This reminds us of the old argument to prove that an arrow can not fly through the air , be - cause it can not move where it is , neither can it move where it is not ; and it is about as useful to the deist as the latter argument is to the physicist .

		This , however , is rather an extreme instance ; and there is much else in the chapters well worth reading .

		Chapter VIII .

		treats of Theism and Happiness , and there is a short Conclusion , in which it is held that metaphysics may yet show the way out of the fundamental difficulties encountered in the course of the dis - cussion , ending with a quotation from Spinoza : '' If the way which I have pointed out as lead - ing to this restdt seems exceedingly hard , it may nevertheless be discovered ... But all things excellent are as difficult as they are rare . ''


T. D. A. COCKERELL	PERSON	.

		Mr.
John M. Robertson	PERSON	's '' Short History of Free Thought , Ancient and Modern , '' published in
1899	DATE	, has now been re-written , and enlarged to such an extent that it fills two stout volumes instead of one .

		This out - spoken and admirable work is published by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Two New Books on
Mary Stuart	PERSON	.

		* Here and there in the history of nations a character is found around which is gathered an atmosphere of such intense human interest that the lapse of years adds to rather than weakens its charm .

		Such a character is that of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	.

		So much has been written about her , and the subject has been approached from so many different points of view , that one might have thought it impossible either to say any - thing new or to put the old facts in a light that woidd attract attention .

		Yet even within the last few years the books and articles devoted to the life and character of
Mary Queen of Scots	ORGANIZATION	would make a respectable little library ; and now we have before us two additional biographies , both of which , it is safe to say , will appeal to a large circle of readers .

		Without detracting from the merits of the books themselves , it may be said that much of their popidarity will be due simply to the fact that they tell the story of one of the most fascinating and puzzling women in the history of all times , -- a woman who , what - ever her faults -LRB- and they were serious enough -RRB- , has always held a large sliare of the world 's sympathy .

		The same qualities which won for Mary , at every stage of her life and under the most forbidding circumstances , the warm affec - tion and ardent partisanship of men and women alike , appeal to-day with scarcely diminished force .

		It is a commonplace , whether just or other - wise , that the most severe judges of women are women .

		Yet of the two books now under con - sideration , one by a man , the other by a woman , the latter is the more sympathetic , and also the more convincing .

		After reading the two , one feels that while the former presents an admirably just and impartial picture of the reign of
Mary Queen of Scots	ORGANIZATION	, the latter brings us into inti - mate contact with the woman herself , with all her weaknesses , all her faults , and all her charm .

		Despite the care and skill with which Mr.
Hen	PERSON	- derson has marshalled his facts , one lays down his two volumes with a certain feeling of dis - appointment .

		He has overloaded his pages with detail ; he has devoted so much time and thought to the background of the picture , and to the accessories , that the central figure is shadowy and lifeless .

		Miss Maccunn , on the other hand , has subordinated everything else to her main *

		THE DIAL 63 figure , and the result is a portrait glowing with animation .

		Apart from certain minor points of difference , the two biographies agree substan - tially in the facts of
Mary	PERSON	's life , as well as in the interpretation of the motives of the Queen of Scots , and of those who crossed her path for good or evil .

		But neither the presentation of facts , however skilful , nor the interpretation of motives , however subtle , is in itself potent to re-create an individual character .

		The power to accomplish that , -- to reconstruct not only the life but the personality , -- is something quite apart .

		It requires the possession of that gift of imagination which is a part of genius .

		We woidd be glad , did space permit , to illastrate this by means of quotations in the present case ; to show how
Miss Maecunn	LOCATION	has succeeded where so many have failed .

		The living
Mary Stuart	PERSON	that we meet with in her pages is not created in a moment ; her personality reveals itself gradually , as we read her story .

		We feel that the woman here portrayed , so virile , so emi - nently human , who loved and hated so vehem - ently , who sinned so grievously and suffered for her sins so intensely , is no figment of the imagi - nation , but the true
Mary Stuart	PERSON	. ''

		She unaffectedly loved the stir of camps , the fierce joy of fighting , the eager pursuit of revenge ... She never lacked dignity nor presence of mind .

		Anger she showed , and sorrow , but never vanity nor indecision , nor any of the more ignoble faidts .

		Yet it was the woman of the warmer heart , the more generous hand , the finer nature , who was to meet with treachery and ingratitude on all hands , wlule neither her caprice nor her shameless disloyalty were to deprive
Elizabeth	PERSON	of the most devoted and efficient ser \ 4ces ever rendered to a crown . ''

		Of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, we get this striking characteri - zation : '' She had , as it were , an instinct divining the thought of her people and prescient of their destiny ; she used the large full utterance characteristic of the time , she shared its audacity , its love of adventure ; she won the heart of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Miss Maecunn is equally happy in her pic - tures of the other cliaracters , large and small , who influenced
Mary	PERSON	's life .

		Darnley and Both - well ,
Murray	PERSON	and
John Knox	PERSON	, the ambassadors Lethington ,
Throckmorton	LOCATION	, and
Randolph	PERSON	, the four faithfid
Maries	PERSON	, and many others , move through these pages , not as mere wooden pup - pets , but as living men and women , with himian virtues and human vices .

		Something has been said as to the limitations of Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's book , but a wrong impression would be created if the re ^ ^ ewer failed to note its value as a contribution to the literature of its subject .

		As Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	justly says in his Preface , '' The recent concise biographies , what - ever their special merits , and the more impor - tant works lately published on special aspects of the subject , so far from forestalling , rather sug - gest the desirability of a biography dealing in a somewhat detailed and critical fashion with the main episodes of
Mary	PERSON	's career '' ; and it is just such a detailed and critical narrative that he has given us .

		He has brought together for the first time many facts that were formerly to be sought only in scattered and more or less inaccessible books or magazine articles , and he has added not a little entirely new matter , important to a proper understanding of the life of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	and of those aroimd her .

		To the historical student of the period , no portion of Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's book will be more interesting than Appendix A , in which he dis - cusses the latest phase of the Casket Contro - versy , with especial reference to Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's '' Mystery of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	. ''

		With unanswer - able logic and atlmirable good humor , he pulls to pieces Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's ingenious argument for the partial forgery of the famous
Glasgow	LOCATION	Letter , and pokes unmerciful fim at the hair - splitting reasoning by which Mr.
Lang	PERSON	upbudds his frail castle in the air .

		If the subject were not one of those fascinating problems that continue to tempt the ingenuity of scholars , no matter how exhaustively they may have been thrashed out , one would be tempted to say that Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	has finally disposed of the ques - tion of the authenticity of the
Casket Letters	ORGANIZATION	.

		We can not close without drawing particidar attention to the number and excellence of the illustrations in both these books .

		The care bestowed nowadays on the adequate illustration of books of history , biography , and other classes of literature that a few years ago could boast of nothing more attractive or iUuminating than a map or frontispiece , is one of the most striking and commendable developments in present-day bookmaking .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, the specialist , writing of a limited epoch .

		In the present study he attempts the role of the general historian .

		The results of his work must therefore be estimated by wholly different stand - ai * ds from those applied to his earlier writings .

		In short , Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's former work appealed to and met the approval of the student of history , while he now seeks rather the approval of the general reader .

		In very many respects , the author has suc - ceeded in his new field ; for the presentation of a general renume ^ into which are woven the results of monographic studies by others , and by Mr.
Rose	PERSON	as
weU	ORGANIZATION	, really constitutes a new and valuable bit of work .

		The labor of collating and determining the value of the numerous essays and articles bearing on minute points in recent history must have been tremendous in itself , and it involved a genuine historical study by the author .

		Much genius is displayed also in the clever manner in which such isolated monographic results are bound together so as to form a consecutive and attractive narrative , while wholly new impressions are received of some of the great political characters of the period .

		In clearness of presentation , Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's work is not surpassed by any general history of
Modem Europe	LOCATION	, and its general readableness is in but a few instances marred by detail , where detail was neither necessary nor useful , -- a faidt of the Introduction , which contains too much condensed food for the general reader , while for the better informed it is but a review .

		Three points upon which Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's own study leads him to new conclusions are con - nected with the Franco-Prussian War of
1870	DATE	.

		First , he is convinced that the preliminary eng-agements for mutual aid between
Austria	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	had reached a much more definite basis than has been customarily asserted , and that the two Emperors and their military ad - visers had arrived at an agreement not fully known to their diplomats and ministers .

		The positive belief that
Austria	LOCATION	woidd help
France	LOCATION	when once war was under way largely explains the seeming precipitancy of the war party in
France	LOCATION	in urging hostilities .

		Second ,
Bismarck	PERSON	has alwaj ^ s denied that he used the candidacy of Prince
Leopold	PERSON	to the Spanish throne to stir up war with
France	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	asserts that he did so use it , even against the wishes of
King William	LOCATION	, and of the Prince himself ; m short , that
Bismarck	PERSON	mstigated the candidacy and hurried it on for the sole purpose of bringing on war as rapidly as possible .

		The proof offered here is wholly inferential , and the results seem too broadly and too positively stated ; but cer - tainly the author makes the inference seem extremely probable .

		And , third , the usual story of the
Ems	ORGANIZATION	telegram -- a story originating with
Bismarck	PERSON	himself , to the effect that by changing the wording of a telegram a mildly expressed message was transformed into an offensive one , thus preventing any chance of pacific overtures -- is characterized as nonsense by Mr.
Rose	PERSON	, and his contention is supported by presenting the texts of both messages .

		There can be no doubt that the original was much more forcible , and offensive even , in language than
Bismarck	PERSON	's '' edited '' despatch .

		Stated thus briefly , these incidents may seem to have had but petty im - portance ; but they both represent the care in study evinced in this work , and are in truth of real value historically , since they offer new inter - pretations of disputed points and help to a clearer understanding of leading characters .

		The account given of the events of the war itself is clear and straightforward , but in this the author is less successful than when explaining men and motives .

		Probably greater interest will attach to-day to what the author has to say about
Russia	LOCATION	and Russian conditions .

		His account does not in - clude the recent war ^ vith
Japan	LOCATION	, nor the sub - sequent revolutionary risings .

		He wrote , in fact , before that war had taken place ; and for this very reason his estimate of the character of the Russian government , and of the leaders and the people , is perhaps more interesting than if he had had recent events to guide his interpreta - tion .

		In treating of the development of Niliilism which followed the popular discontent with the results of the war of
1878	DATE	, he offers an analysis equally applicable , if true , to the existing situation : '' The Slav peoples that form the great bulk of her -LSB-
Russia	LOCATION	's -RSB- population are notoriously sensitive .

		Shut up for nearly half the year by the rigors of winter , they naturally develop habits of brooding introspection or coarse animalism , -- witness the plaintive strains of their folk-songs , the pessimism that haunts their litera - ture , and the dram-drinking habits of the peasantry .

		The Muscovite temperament and the Muscovite climate naturally lead to idealist strivings against the hardships of life or a dull grovelling amongst them .

		Melancholy or vodka is the outcome of it all . ''

		And to this Mr.
Rose	PERSON	adds that the Russian humiliation resulting from the war , the blow to self-confidence and esteem , were revenged by revolution upon the incapable government that had betrayed the nation .

		Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's dramatic statement in support of his assumption that climate and geographical conditions are respon - sible for the people 's character and acts is
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 65 hardly convincing , and seems rather an attract - ive generalization than a sound analysis .

		But the insistence that national humiliation is the great , if not the greatest , factor in producing revolution , is a truth easily proved by a refer - ence to many other states besides
Russia	LOCATION	, and is an element in the present Russian situation fre - quently overlooked by writers and investigators .

		Until now , the greatest strength of the Russian government has been the implicit confidence of the mass of the people in their rulers .

		To-day the spell is broken ; for , as Mr.
Rose	PERSON	puts it , writing of an earlier epoch , '' The jiathetic devotion of her peasantry has not made up for the mental and moral defects of her governing classes . ''

		The dangers of historical prophecy are well exemplified in the author 's statement of reasons for the lack of any great revolution in
Europe	LOCATION	since the
Paris Conunune	LOCATION	in
1871	DATE	.

		After ask - ing `` What is the reason for this ? ''

		he answers : '' Mainly , it would seem , the enormous powers given to the modem organized State by the discoveries of mechanical science and the triumphs of the engineer .

		Telegraphy now flashes to the capital the news of a threatening revolt in the hundredth part of the ' time formerly taken by couriers with their relays of horses .

		Fully & s great is the sa ^ dng of time in the transport of large bodies of troops to the disaffected districts .

		Thus , the all-important factors that make for success -- force , skill , and time -- are all on the side of the central Gov - ernments . ''

		After acknowledging that the spread of demo - cratic and constitutional ideas has been a pre - ventative also of revolution , he adds : `` The fact , however , that there has been no wide - spread revolt in
Russia	LOCATION	since the
year 1863	DATE	, shows that democracy has not been the chief influence tending to dbsolve or suppress discontent .

		As we shall see in a later chapter ,
Russia	LOCATION	has defied constitutionalism and ground down alien races and creeds ; yet -LRB- up to the year
1904	DATE	-RRB- no great rising has shaken her autocratic system to its base .

		This seems to prove that the im - munity of the present age in regard to insurrections is due rather to the triumphs of mechanical science than to the progress of democracy .

		The fact is not pleasing to contemplate ; but it must be faced . ''

		Such an analysis is , of course , partially over - thrown by recent events in
Russia	LOCATION	; yet in the main the causes for the quiet under which
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope has rested are correctly stated , and it may indeed be asserted that revolution in
Russia	LOCATION	was largely possible because of the breaking down of centralized administrative machinery .

		Still the fact remains that Mr.
Rose	PERSON	foretold no rev - olutionary movement of magnitude in
Russia	LOCATION	, but rather desperate isolated attempts by assassi - nation to further a political propaganda .

		Cer - tainly , however , the dictimi of Mr.
Rose	PERSON	in
1904	DATE	would have met with general acceptance if it were not for the totally unexpected develop - ments of
1906	DATE	.

		The points noted and illustrations given do but scant justice to the charm and effectiveness of Mr.
Rose	PERSON	's first volume .

		It is both a contri - bution to historical knowledge and is distinctly readable ; for the author has put his personality and his enthusiasm into the work , and one feels the attraction of a keen mind absorbed in active study .

		But in all frankness it must be said that the second volume is of a distinctly lower grade than the first .

		There is in it a note of weari - ness of the task .

		It is correct and up to date , but the language is less vivid .

		Possibly the loss in charm Ls really due to the fact that the topics treated in the second volume are so recent as to permit of little but an ordinary straightforward narrative of events ; for here the materials for historical study are lacking , and here also acute and positive analysis is impossible .

		But both volimaes are always and everywhere absolutely simple and clear , so that concise and correct information on whatever of importance pertains to modem European history , within the period covered , is available to anyone .

		66 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	,
Morris	PERSON	, and Burne-Jones .

		The spiritual progenitors of these men -- Homer ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Sophocles	LOCATION	, and Mar -
cus Aurelius	PERSON	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, Byi-on , and
Wordsworth	PERSON	-- also receive attention in succinct stanzas of charac - terization .

		On the whole , the poem , which seems over-long in comparison with the '' Thyrsis '' that inspired it , is not too long for its theme , thus broadly considered , and it is executed in all its parts with a degree of finish that removes any occasion for apology .

		For , despite a certain monotony of diction , it is a very beautiful poem , informed with high seriousness , and the embodiment of ripe reflection upon the deeper meanings of art and life .

		Since Arnold is its central theme , our quotation shall be of the two stanzas that set forth his essential char - acteristics : '' O nature strangely blent ; light petulance Of airy laughter ; buoyant ease urbane Of world and youth ; the lucid lips of
France	LOCATION	; Some breath of
Byron	PERSON	's sick romantic pain ,
Dispassionate	LOCATION	, purged ; bright cynic-edged disdain Of
Heine	LOCATION	, clean , unpoignant ; peace austere ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	's high woodland peace , unrapturous , sane ;
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's grave calm Olympian ; Attic clear Vision and wistful doubt and Stoic will severe ! ''

		He saw life broken , but with steady smile , Which is the mask of men that only weep .

		Facing grey shadows , stooped not to beguile Clear courage with drugged dreams , or purchase sleep Painless for haunting inward hurt , too deep .

		Ah me !

		for song 's redemption .

		If but part He saw , and would too lightly overleap
Time	ORGANIZATION	's deep-set boundaries , buoyed by airy art .

		For his pure vision 's flaw he paid a broken heart . ''

		Mr.
Bernard Drew	PERSON	's `` Cassandi * a and Other Poems '' is a volume of verse inspired by abstract and bookish themes .

		It is coldly correct in diction , and rather commonplace in thought , although the author has caught the trick of minor verse-writing successfully enough to produce now and then a fairly acceptable piece of derivative workmanship .

		Such , for example , is this irregular sonnet on `` Twilight '' : '' O'er earth and heaven the slow long twiliglit eve Deepens and trembles through the
summer	DATE	haze ; The distant hills faint out before the gaze .

		With all the legends of the years engraven The sea sings softly in the little haven Of ancient glories bred of ancient days , And hidden channels and old ocean ways That thunderous water-surges watch and weave .

		The sinking crimson o'er the cliff-capped bay Sheds light athwart the wave ; the twinkling stars Steal slowly forth upon the path of Day ; The eastern steeds that drew Sol 's golden cars Vanish amid the shadows faint and grey Before the
Evening	ORGANIZATION	's flaming scimitars . ''

		It is the sort of verse that any person of education and sensibility can write if he wishes , verse having no originality of thought or imagery , and no individ - uality of utterance . ''

		The Cloud Kingdom '' is the realm wherein the feathered denizens of the air disport themselves and rule supreme .

		The volume to which Mr.
I. Henry Wallis	PERSON	has given this title is a collection of about thirty bird-poems , intertwining delicate fancies with graceful verse , and expressing , now the naive thought of childhood , now the more sober reflectiveness of riper years .

		The exquisite charm of this work may best be illustrated by '' The Sparrow . '' ''

		Among the carven images On God 's great house of prayer , A statue of the Virgin is .

		And our dear Lord is there .

		Close to his Mother does he lie .

		And answers her caress Witli loving little hands that try Against her cheek to press . ''

		A circling aureole has He , To tell His name to all ; A circling aureole has She Round her brows virginal ; And on this circlet that She has A sparrow 's nest is made Of hay and straw and stalks of grass From street and close conveyed . ''

		It seems as though that nest were there That He might look on it , For always is He gazing where The mother-bird does sit .

		And should her little fledglings
fall	DATE	, Most sui'ely will He know ; And of His love which blesseth all Some comfort will bestow . ''

		The mystic Dove broods over them ; And Angel-faces shine Around the Star of
Bethlehem	LOCATION	Above the Babe divine .

		About are fiends with mouths awry And twisted faces wild ; But safe from them the nest is by The Mother and her Child . ''

		The sparrows fly into the street ` Mid turmoil , sin and shame ; Unheeded by the crowds they meet .

		Who care not whence they came ; Who know not of the nest that is In the Angel-land above .

		Beside the Holy Presences , Beneath the brooding Dove . ''

		But it may be that unto some Who love each living thing .

		And smile to see the sparrows come , A happy thought they bring .

		And as to their high home they go , A child with upward glance
May	DATE	see their nest , and her face glow With Heavenly radiance . ''

		The happiest inspirations of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	and of
Blake	PERSON	are fairly matched by these tender and lovely verses .

		In graver mood is penned the song to `` The Night - ingale , '' with the first two stanzas of which we must fain be content . ''

		As one beneath the apple bloom at ease
May	DATE	read of palm trees and of orchid flowers , Or one who idles through the
summer	DATE	hours In some sweet
Devon Coombe	PERSON	-- may dream of seas That wind up island creeks to fragrant bowers
Beneath the Southern Cross	ORGANIZATION	, -- so we , the tale Hear , of the music of the Nightingale . ''

		Too partial !

		Why wiU he not come to us ?

		Wide are our woodlands , and the lanes thereby Grass-grown and lush-leaved under hedges high ; And heaths of gorse and broom are plenteous .

		Yet , when
Antares	ORGANIZATION	climbs our Southern sky .

		And sedge-birds are awake , we still must fail To hear the singing of the Nightingale . ''


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 67 There are birds arplenty in the volume of songs called '' White Poppies , '' but they are strange ex - otic creatures , mynas and bulbuls and casuareens .

		These lyrics are airy trifles , voicing the moods of an exile under
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	skies .

		The rhymes '' To Mary '' are pretty enough to quote . ''

		Could I return across the sea .

		Like some bold
Knight of Faery Whose	ORGANIZATION	wishes are his wings , and be As light as he and airy ; '' Ah , th `` n , beside the kitchen fire , Or in the shining dairy .

		Or where each happy woodland choir Of song is never chary ; '' Now , ere the
summer	DATE	yet be done .

		Or warm south winds be wary , I would out-race the setting sun Once more to see you ,
Mary	PERSON	. ''

		Other maidens , however , seem at times to occupy the poet 's fancy , as the lines called '' Orange
Blos	PERSON	- soms '' attest . ''

		As I rode out with blue-eyed Blanche , She reached her hand up to a branch .

		And plucked a bunch of orange blooms . '

		I love , ' she said , ' all sweet perfumes ; But this I love the most of all . '

		I answered , while -LRB- delicious thrall I -RRB- She pinned them to her pretty vest .

		That I should like the blossoms best Enwreath 'd for me around her hair Before a certain altar stair . ''

		But perhaps Blanche is , after all , only another name .

		for
Mary	PERSON	, and merely the tribute paid to the exi - gency of a needed rhyme . ''

		The Fading of the Mayflower '' comes to us -- ' not exactly as a voice from the grave , since Mr.
; Theodore TUton	PERSON	still lives in the honorable retire - ; ment of age -- but as a voice from a past that now ■ seems remote indeed , the past of the
New England	LOCATION	lyceum , the abolitionist crusade , and the Civil War .

		.

		It is a voice of admonition , raised in earnest protest i and with satirical accent , against the mad worship i of money which is so marked a characteristic of the : present generation .

		In a cycle of one hundred and ; fourteen sonnets -LRB- some of them slightly irregular -RRB- , ' the wTiter conti-asts the stern idealism of the puritans who founded
New England	LOCATION	with the lax degeneracy ; of their descendants .

		This is the fashion of his dis - ; course : • '' Thus , to our arbute , owe we all our East , ; And half our North , and half of half our West -- ; Until , of flowers , our
Mayflower	ORGANIZATION	is the best -- ; Except our Lord 's own lilies I We at least :
May	DATE	love it next to these I ... Or have we ceased i To pin it in onr cap • -- to manifest !

		-LRB- As by an edelweiss -RRB- a soul at rest ; But when it climbs ?

		... Alas , our sacred Beast !

		Is what we bow to !

		Much art thou adored , • ,
Grolden	PERSON	Calf I Thy wide-encroaching rule • In all our fifty commonwealths is rife !

		We dote upon thee !

		Look !

		Our golden hoard ' Out-fortunes Fortnnatus I ... He -- a fool !

		-- ■ To save his wallet , forfeited his life ! ''

		i The staccato diction here exemplified characterizes ' the work throughout .

		The homiletic value of the sonnets is considerable , and they embody much quaint information and homely wisdom , but they almost never appeal to us as poetry .

		Another poem of essentially didactic character , an ambitious poem composed in a spirit of high seriousness , is Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	's `` The Building of the Organ . ''

		In form , this work is a sym - phony in five movements and many themes .

		The themes are provided with tempo marks , in further - ance of the musical analogy upon which the poem is based .

		Mr.
E. F. FenoUosa	PERSON	, it will be remem - bered , made a similar experiment in '' The Discovery of
America	LOCATION	, '' published in
1893	DATE	, and quite recently the experiment has again been attempted by Mr.
Charles E. Russell	PERSON	in '' The Twin Immortalities . ''

		These works , as well as the one now to be consid - ered , all exemplify the aim which Mr.
Dole	PERSON	describes as that of giving '' to English verse a new medium of expression , plastic and elastic , capable of infinite variet -RCB- ' , and as well adapted to the genius of the Language as the classic Ode was to Greek in the hands of a Pindar . ''

		We have called Mr.
Dole	PERSON	's poem ambitious , and this statement clearly warrants the epithet .

		In judging * ' The Building of the Organ '' as an artistic performance , we must keep in mind the special conditions imposed by the task , one of which is that a certain bareness of diction is de - manded , for the author had ever in mind the possi - bility that his words might be sung as well as read , and , as he justly remarks , '' there are many words in English which can not be sung . ''

		It would not be fair , that is , to deal with this poem and ignore the fundamental principle of its composition , any more than it would be fair to deal similarly with
Lanier	PERSON	's '' Centennial Cantata '' or with the book of a music - drama by
Richard Wagner	PERSON	.

		With this qualification in mind , we shoidd say that Mr.
Dole	PERSON	had produced a remarkable piece of work , not subtle , allusive , or even melodious in the ordinary poetical sense , but thoughtful , finely imaginative , and stately in move - ment .

		Its general theme is peace and the brother - hood of man , and its ethical burden is of the noblest .

		We quote a fugal theme -LRB- andante moestoso -RRB- by way of illustration . ''

		Hark !

		like a golden thread of sound aerial A plaintive cadence from the Organ steals ; It trembles , rises , floats away ethereal I The Soul in silent prayer devoutly kneels I '' Then comes a change : a crash of chords rolls thundering And shakes the windows in their leaded panes ; It tJirills the throng who listen breathless-wondering .

		To hear the splendour of the sequent strains . ''

		From out the chaos of the weird prophetical Emerges like the crystal Light of Life A fervid theme , spontaneous , poetical .

		That singB of strenuous Victory won from Strife . ''

		With deeper tones the same great theme euphonions Ensues enmesht in woof of woven sounds , Thus grows the Fugue ; a splendid web harmonious With a whole world of Beauty in its bounds , '' The variety of metres employed by Mr.
Dole	PERSON	for his effects is extraordinary , and no less so the tech -
68	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, nical skill with which he uses them .

		The symphonic poem '' Onward , '' appended to the volume , illustrates upon a lesser scale the methods and ideas that are exploited in the larger work .

		About
five years ago	DATE	, we took note of '' Song - Surf , '' a slender volume of lyrics by Mr.
Cale Young Rice	PERSON	, characterized chiefly by an unpleasant turgidity of diction .

		Mr.
Rice	PERSON	now presents us with a stout and very handsome volume containing the better of the early lyrics , many new ones , and two plays in verse , ''
Yolanda	PERSON	'' and ''
David	PERSON	. ''

		His work in this larger compass and maturer form deserves far more praise than could be accorded to those first fruits , and gives us much sincere and conscientious work - manship .

		The old straining for effect is still ap - parent , although far less so than formerly , and many examples of commonplace and oddity occur , the elimination of which would have been to the author 's profit . ''

		At Amalfi '' is the poem we choose for quotation . ''

		Come to the window , you who are mine .

		Waken !

		the night is calling .

		Sit by me here -- with the moon 's fair shine Into your deep eyes falling . ''

		The sea afar is a fearful gloom ; Lean from the casement , listen !

		Anear , it breaks with a faery spume , Spraying the moon-path 's glisten . ''

		The little white town below lies deep As eternity in slumber .

		O , you who are mine , how a glance can reap Beauties beyond all number ! ''

		` Amalfi ! '

		say it -- as the stars set O'er yon far promontory .

		` Amalfi ! '

		... Shall we ever forget Even Above this glory ? ''

		No ; as twin sails at anchor ride , Our spirits rock together On a sea of love -- lit as this tide With tenderest star-weather . ''

		And the quick ecstasy within Your breast is against me beating . '

		Amalfi ! '

		... Never a night shall win From God again such fleeting . ''

		Ah -- but the dawn is redd ` ning up Over the moon low-dying .

		Come , come away -- we have drimk the cup : Ours is the dream undying . ''

		This affords a typical illustration of both the strength and weakness of Mr.
Rice	PERSON	's verse .

		It also shows how definitely he has been influenced by the method of
Robert Browning	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Edward Robeson Taylor	PERSON	's new volume con - tains the long poem `` Into the Light , '' published five years ago , a few other reprinted pieces , and much new matter .

		It is quite fitting that the trans - lator of '' Les Trophies '' should have given us a sonnet on the death of
Heredia	LOCATION
last October	DATE	. ''

		Vainly you 'll call importunate and long On him to add fresh jewels to his store .

		For muse-beloved he dwells forevermore With all the crowned ones of his deathless song .

		And in the midst of that imperial throng , Now newly splendored by his sonnet-lore , Fame gently seats him and delights to score Her beadroU with his name in letters strong ; For though he felt not passion 's noblest ire That bears the uttered thought on wings of fire , Nor made his numbers all the vastness sweep , Yet he was Art 's , and drank of her desire , Until Imagination , true and deep , Burst into beauty on his flawless lyre . ''

		A number of translations from
Leconte	LOCATION	de
Lisle	LOCATION	and other modern French poets are included among the contents of this volume . ''

		The Far Country '' is a volume of verse of un - usual quality , the work of
Miss Florence Wilkinson	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is verse of varied inspiration , giving us now an impression de voyage , now a suggestion of old-time balladry and romance , now an outpouring of deep feeling .

		A tendency toward forced forms of ex - pression and an indulgence in mere emotional ejacu - lation appear to be the most noticeable faults of what is , on the whole , a volume of quite exceptional richness and strength .

		The stanzas '' In a Ruined Abbey '' may be taken as an example of Miss Wil - kinson 's best work . ''

		The moon blows toward the broken tower , A winged sphere of fire , And through the ivy over-streaming Rose-window , arch , and crumbling choir Trembles the wind in ecstasy His fingers of desire . ''

		Where lords and ladies long ago --
Yolande	PERSON	and Mordred , -- Knelt pale before the crucifix , With bells upflung and incense shed , , Now many a pink-tipped daisy lifts Its fair unknowing head . ''

		Where scutcheons gleamed , and lance and helm , Trophies of sacred fight , And the great windows gloomed and glowed Like jewels dusky-bright -- The eternal hills look gravely through These arches of the night . ''

		A thousand memories walk tiptoe , Sainted , occult , unspelt ; An elder time 's development ; Like mists that blow and melt , So we that stray here hand in hand Have on our foreheads dimly felt The chrysmal kiss processional Of Presences that knelt . ''

		The moon shakes at the unportalled door , A sailing sphere of fire ; The shadows lie all breathlessly Still as intense desire .

		Beloved , -- thus our hearts are hushed Yet mounting ever higher , Until they mix in one clear note , -- -LRB- 0 lyric heart , to sing , to float ! -RRB-

		Heaven-smitten like a lyre . ''

		The picturesque manner of this poem is perhaps more characteristic of Miss
Wilkinson	PERSON	's verse than any other , but she has also a manner in which the reflective element is dominant , and this we may illustrate by the poem entitled '' Forerunners . ''

		There clings white brine upon the shrine Within the temple 's wave-worn glory , And white things creep in slime , and ^ eep Upon the tablet 's graven story . ''

		Soft silence reigns in these domains Where once the trumpet rang so loudly ; And pallid gleams of phosphor beams Glow where the sun once glittered proudly . ''

		Oh , love , they lie beneath no sky .

		The imitation of a Tennysonian model is auda > ciously obvious , but the poem is striking enough to arrest attention on its own account .

		The delights In her new book , `` The Garden , T ^ g ^ dm ° ^ You and I '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , '' Bar - vacation . ''

		bara '' -LRB- now identified as Mrs.
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	-RRB- has , according to the announce - ments , gone back to the methods of her first anony - Tnous success , '' The Garden of a Commuter 's Wife . ''

		But the reader looking for this may be dis - appointed , for somewhat is lacking of the freshness and spontaneity of
Barbara	LOCATION	's first appearance .

		In fact , the form in which the present book is cast , comprising a series of long letters with their equally long replies full of garden information and advice , is forced and unnatm-al .

		Nevertheless , it would be ungracious to find only faults in a book whose pri - mary object is exactly that of giving advice and information , eminently sane , and showing evidence of practical knowledge .

		The purpose of the corre - spondence is to afford opportunity for the experi - enced
Barbara	PERSON	to give of her more abundant knowledge to
Mary Penrose	PERSON	, who with her husband is having a `` garden vacation , '' camping in an old open barn in their own grounds .

		If young Mrs.
Penrose	PERSON	, an avowed novice , masters the subject with remarkable swiftness , and is able to return
Barbara	PERSON	's suggestions with what appears to be expert knowl - edge , the arrangement of the book must again be blamed .


Mary Penrose	PERSON	's `` garden vacation '' is a delightful arrangement , whereby she and her hus - band are enabled to devote to the improvement of their out-of-town-home the money that would other - wise have been spent in travelling , at the same time learning by observation and experiment the joys of an out-door life .

		There are other minor benefits that result , but the main achievement is of course the building of the garden , revising the old one , adding new beauties , and especially replacing upon a certain knoll that is an important feature of the landscape those trees , shrubs , and undergrowths that ought to be there .

		The young folks are furthered in their plans in various ways , as well as by the aid of
Barbara	LOCATION	's friendly letters ; there is '' The Man from Everywhere , '' who is superintending a piece of engineering that in the clearing away of a certain other knoll in the neighborhood supplies the mate - rials for planting that of the
Penroses	LOCATION	; there is a handy but erratic Irish gardener ,
Larry	PERSON	by name , who '' happens along , '' and when his habits become too much for him he is succeeded by a melancholy German ; and there is a visit to the seaside garden of our old friends
Martin	PERSON	and
Lavinia Cortwright	PERSON	, and a further visit in their company to a '' garden of sweet odors . ''

		A thread of romance runs through the letters , and the same spirit of sympathy with nature that has informed the writer 's other volumes is evident in the present one .

		For the sake of the garden-lover who reads to learn , it should be said that there are several excellent and suggestive lists of perennials , annuals , and roses , with explanatory notes ; but there is no index .

		Defects of the Invaluable as a historical treatise is electoral system Mr.
J. Hampden Dougherty	PERSON	's '' The of the
U.S.	LOCATION	Electoral System of the United States '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , a comprehensive study of the provision of the Constitution relating to the proced - ure of counting the electoral vote for President and Vice President .

		The author traces the history and practices of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as an electoral body , discusses the various interpretations placed on the words of the Constitution `` the votes shall then.be counted '' following the provision relating to the opening of the returns by the President of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, explains the Federalist bill of
1800	DATE	, which , although it never became law , was the source of all subsequent rules and practices , and describes the provisions of the
Electoral Count	ORGANIZATION	law of
1887	DATE	.

		He shows that the framers of the Constitution never dreamed that the counting of the electoral vote would involve any - thing more than a simple process of addition , but that in practice it has required the canvassing of disputed returns , and this in turn has necessitated the decision of such important questions as relate to the regularity of votes , the qualifications of electors , the right of a state to participate in the choice of electors , etc. , etc. .

		He very properly pronounces the Electoral Count provision as the '' weakest spot '' in the Constitution , declares that it has broken down in practice , and asserts that its continuance without change is fraught with peril to the country .

		Instead of providing in a passive way that the votes '' shall be counted , '' the Constitution should specify the canvassing authority and the method of procedure .

		The
Electoral Count	ORGANIZATION	law of
1887	DATE	, passed after a long struggle following the crisis of
1877	DATE	, is designed to provide by statute against deadlocks in the future ; but , as Mr.
Dougherty	PERSON	points out , the law is an in - strument of compromises believed to be unconstitu - tional , is cumbersome in its details , and seriously defective in that it neglects to provide how the vote of a state shall be saved from rejection when both Houses disagree .

		In the final chapter of his book , Mr.
Dougherty	PERSON	suggests an amendment to the Con - stitution providing for the direct election of the President and Vice President by popular vote , each state being allowed as many votes as it has Senators and Representatives in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the vote to be ascer - tained and canvassed by an authority duly consti - tuted by the state .

		The effect of this amendment would be to abolish the
Electoral College	ORGANIZATION	and reduce the ultimate count at
Washington	LOCATION	to a simple mathe - matical calculation , as the framers of the Constitu - tion intended it should be .

Walker Woods	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Flem	PERSON	- ing
H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		As a well-known preacker in
Scotland	LOCATION	, of most liberal views ,
Witherspoon	PERSON	was summoned by the trustees of the
New Jersey	LOCATION	college in
1768	DATE	to become its head .

		By accepting the in - vitation ,
Witherspoon	PERSON	gave the author an opportunity to make an interesting chapter on the early history of the college .

		The new president entered upon the heroic task , not unconmion in later days , of raising fimds to pay existing debts and to provide for the future of the institution .

		In this work , he visited nearly every Presbyterian congregation in the thir - teen colonies .

		He sent a vessel to
Georgia	LOCATION	to bring to a Northern market the produce which the Pres - byterians of that colony could give more easily than cash .

		In addition to financing the college , Wither - spoon did most of the teaching .

		He was professor of Hebrew , advanced Greek and Latin , Divinity .

		Moral Philosophy , and
Eloquence	ORGANIZATION	.

		During the Revolutionary War , when the college was temporarily abandoned ,
Witherspoon	PERSON	served in the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, signed the Declaration of Independence , and took an active part in the instructions to the American representatives in forming the treaty of
1783	DATE	which ended the war .

		He was also active in rehabilitating the church and in transforming it into the
American Presbyterian Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		After the col - lege was reopened , the Scoteh dominie continued as President until his death in
1794	DATE	.

		In the volume one notes a few errors , as ''
Thompson	PERSON	'' for Charles ''
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, '' the Secretary of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The bank advocated by
Morris	PERSON	could scarcely be called a `` national '' bank .

		The address to the people of
Quebec	LOCATION	is omitted from the list of papers of the
First Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		These are minor criti - cisms , and detract little from a biography which will appeal to
Princeton	LOCATION	men and to students of church historj - , as well as to those interested in the
Revolu	LOCATION	- tionary period of oxir national life .

		An American '' The Philippine Experiences of an school-teacher in American Teacher '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a
the Philippines	LOCATION	, y ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ fijg ^ ^ tj ^ g - phe author , Mr.
William B. Freer	PERSON	, describes only his own expe - riences ; he does not attempt to solve , or even to state , the various Philippine problems ; he says little in regard to the general school system of the
Phil	PERSON	- ippines ; his book is simply a description of the Philippine life of one American teacher , and an interesting one it is .

		The educational policy of the Americans in
the Philippines	LOCATION	ha `` been severely criticised , especially for the attempt to '' American - ize '' the natives in language and institutions .

		But if the experiences of the author of this book be taken as typical , it would seem that there should be no serious objection to the system .

		He claims that the use of English is justified by the fact that the natives have no common language , and that in nearly every school there will be pupils who can not understand one another ; few outside of the large towns under - stand Spanish ; so for a common language English is as good as any .

		Besides , he says , the people are i eager to learn English .

		The best part of the book is that which describes the methods employed by I the teachers .

		The supervising teachers are generally j Americans , and under their direction native teachers I gfive instruction to the children ; the instruction is I all in English , but aims at immediate practical results ; American songs are taught , American games ajfe played , and over the schools American flags fly ; the teachers not only instruct in books , but they give much needed advice - as - te ^ `` a `` itation and other practical matters .

		The church authorities , it is said , support the work .

		Incidentally , Mr.
Freer	PERSON	writes of various other aspects of Philippine life , -- the religious customs and festivals ; the different races of the Islanders ; the home-life and amusements of the natives ; native markets ; methods of transpor - tation ; characteristics of the natives , especially of the children .

		The author believes that the educa - tion now being given is a distinctly elevating force , and that the people of all races are eager for it .

		They are more willing than the Indians in the
United States	LOCATION	, and make more progress .

		Seldom is there reference to political affairs , but it is quite dear that this teacher is not an anti-imperialist , for he does not believe that the Filipinos are capable of self-government .

		Mrs.
Martha Derby Perry	PERSON	's '' Letters from a Sur - geon of the Civil War '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are her husband 's letters written home in
1862	DATE	-- 64 , when he served as assistant surgeon with the famous
Twentieth Massachusetts Volunteers	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although young and of subordinate rank , Dr.
John G. Perry	PERSON	seems to have had that in him which invited the assignment of difficult duty and the imposition of grave responsibilities .

		His brief and modest letters , supplemented by a few editorial insertions , tell a story of hardship and danger , especially in the Wil - derness campaign and before
Petersburg	PERSON	, that might easily have tempted another to essay a more ambi - tious stj ` le .

		Three very short extracts will show the book 's quality , and the writer 's . ''

		The hardest battles I have fought since joining the army , '' Dr.
Perry	PERSON	assures his wife , from a comfortless winter camp , '' have been with myself . ''

		Again : '' I doubt if our ancestors at
Valley Forge	ORGANIZATION	suffered more from cold than we did .

		I generally marched on foot so as to keep warm , and often found that I had been sound asleep while my legs were trudging along . ''

		Still again , speaking of a prayer-meeting held by employees and agents of the Sanitary Commission : ' * The effect was doleful in the extreme , and I never want to repeat such an experience while I am in the army .

		Let men pray by themselves as much as they please and read their Bibles in solitude , but not fill every man 's ears with their sins and offences . ''

		Indications of the ^ Titer 's nerve and endurance are not wanting , such as the setting of his own broken 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, leg when other surgical aid was not at hand , and his dragging the injured member about with him through days and nights of hard work and forced marches .

		Mrs.
Perry	PERSON	's experience in the
New York	LOCATION	draft riots of
1863	DATE	forms a noteworthy chapter .

		The brevity and restraint of both Dr. and Mrs.

Frederick J. Turner	PERSON	, of a number of volumes of '' Early Western Travels , '' that interesting series of reprints which we owe to the industry and enthusiasm of Dr.
Reuben Gold Thwaites	PERSON	.

		Of the three groups into which these volumes fall , one contains the writings of
Hulme	LOCATION	,
Woods	ORGANIZATION	, Faux ,
Welby	PERSON	, and
Richard Flower	PERSON	, English travellers who visited the English settlement which was established in
Edwards County	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, by
Morris Birkbeck	PERSON	and
George Flower	PERSON	in the year
1817	DATE	.

		There is considerable supplementary literar ture bearing on this subject that has not been in - cluded in Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	's monumental work ; and to these separate publications has now been added the '' Personal Narrative '' of
Elias Pym Fordham	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Mr.
Frederic Austin Ogg	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. A. H. Clark & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		Fordham was a young English civil engineer , who came over with
Birkbeck	PERSON	in the
spring of 1817	DATE	, and took charge of the equipment which was being trans - ported to the new settlement , consisting mainly of farming implements and household fxu * niture .

		Though he made an entry of land in the English Prairie , and found plenty of occupation , his stay in
America	LOCATION	seems to have been comparatively brief , and he soon returned to practise his profession in the mother country .

		The extracts from his letters and journal here presented in book form constitute an artless but convincing narrative of life in what we now call the
Middle West	LOCATION	, but was then the very ragged edge of civilization .

		He holds no brief for either side of the emigration controversy , like
Birkbeck	PERSON	or
Cobbett	PERSON	; is not blind to the crudities and graver defects of a frontier people ; but sees , more clearly than some of the older heads around him , that this is a nation in the making and that it is worth making .

		Forty-three years ago ,
Dean Alford	PERSON	und ^ fi `` re !

		^ stirred the English-speaking world with his book on `` The Queen 's English , '' which was speedily followed by Mr.
George Washington Moon	PERSON	's animated rejoinder , `` The Dean 's English '' ; and now there comes , anonymously , from the
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	, a sharply critical , but sane and good-tempered , treatise on `` The King 's English , '' which is also evoking con - siderable comment and discussion .

		Its warning examples are taken from such esteemed publica - tions as the `` Spectator , '' `` Times , '' `` Telegraph , '' and '' Westminster Gazette , '' and from the works of
Jowett	LOCATION	,
R. L. Stevenson	PERSON	,
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, and many other far from careless writers .

		Like most books on the use of language , it offers counsels of perfection ; but im - possible though it is for poor scribbling and gab - bling humanity to live up to them , they can hardly fail to effect something toward raising the standard of written and spoken English .

		Of the many de - batable questions touched on , that of Americanisms , although treated with admirable impartiality , may be selected for a word of protest .

		`` The English and American language and literature , '' we are told , `` are both good things ; but they are better apart . ''

		Is this the right view ?

		If so , place must be made for an Australian , a South - African , and an
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Indian language and literature .

		Why encourage this multiplication of languages and literatures , or try to retard the glad day , confidently predicted by some , when English shall become the world - language ?

		Characteristic and picturesque modes of expression will arise on each side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, but so they will on each side of the
Irish Sea	LOCATION	, and of the
Cheviot Hills	ORGANIZATION	, and of the
Thames River	LOCATION	; and we would not have it otherwise .

		In the literature headed by the names of Chaucer ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, Shake - speare , and
Milton	PERSON	, we must claim a place for
Bryant	PERSON	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		The style of '' The King 's English '' attracts rather than repels : it is scholarly , pleasantly allusive , and not untinged with humor .

		The authorship is open to conjecture , with such clue as is furnished by the signatures `` H. W. F. '' and `` F. G. F. '' at the end of the preface . ''

		A Book of the Riviera '' -LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
S. Baring-Gould	PERSON	, is a delight - ful work of nineteen chapters and forty illustrations , dealing with the Ligiu-ian coast between
Marseilles	LOCATION	and
Savona	ORGANIZATION	.

		This region , really so ancient , is only about three-quarters of a century old as a winter resort .

		It was rediscovered in
1831	DATE	by
Lord Brougham	PERSON	, fleeing from the fogs of
England	LOCATION	, on his way to
Naples	LOCATION	.

		Halted there by the vigilance of the Sardinian police , lest he should introduce cholera into
Piedmont	LOCATION	, he became so charmed by the climate , the sunshine , the flowers , that he bought an estate and built himself a winter residence at
Cannes	LOCATION	, then only a fishing-viUage .

		He talked and wrote about the place , and from this beginning dates the whole chain of Riviera winter resorts , with their villas , hotels , casinos , and shops , which now line the shores of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	.

		Extremely modern as these places are , both in appearance and reality , the object of Mr.
Baring-Gould	PERSON	's work is to show that they are but the modern fringe on an ancient garment , a superficial sprinkling over beds of remote antiquity .

		For example , he has less to say about Nice ,
Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	, and
Monaco	LOCATION	, as fashionable re - sorts for gambling , than about the Greek city of
Nike	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Victory -RRB- , and the
Monaco	ORGANIZATION	which was named from Monoikos , the Phoenician god whose temple The Riviera itt hiitory and charms .


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 7a anciently crowned this rock , '' assuredly the loveliest spot on the Ligurian coast . ''

		Since there is hardly a village or town in the whole region which has not treasures for the sketcher or the photographer , as well as for the pleasure-seeker , this book , with its charming illustrations from photographs , will surely satisfy the author 's purpose `` to interest the many visitors to the Ligurian coast in the places which they see . ''

		, , ... The fourth volume of Mr.
Poultnev	PERSON	More of the r ^ r > German struggle
Bigelow	PERSON	s '' History of the German for Liberty .

		Struggle for Liberty '' -LRB-
Harper & Bros.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has recently appeared .

		Another volume will bring the story down to the establishment of the present imperial government .

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	speaks in his preface of the difficulty of securing infor - mation from families possessing it , because of the fear that its publication might hinder the profes - sional career of its members .

		He has , nevertheless , brought together a vast amount of material -- the list of titles consulted occupying nearly three closely printed pages , and not including the standard works .

		The impression of the book is , however , not one of mastery of the subject-matter , rather one of con - fusion confounded .

		With a clear and orderly out - line in mind , the reader will be interested in many details .

		But often these smack of `` yellow jour - nalism , '' and almost without exception are jumbled together in a manner that affords no suggestion of a dignified historical narrative .

		The tone of the work is throughout journalistic , often hysterical ; but some later writer will doubtless find in this mass of material abundant matter for a single volume that win clearly and logically present the subject without sacrificing what has evidently been Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's paramount aim -- the readableness and popular character of the narrative .

		Development of Another student ,
M. Louise Green	PERSON	, religiout liberty Ph.D. , has been delving into the in
Connecticut	LOCATION	, records of early
New England	LOCATION	, and we have as the result `` The Development of Re - ligious Liberty in
Connecticut	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The work presents a fuU and accurate treatment of an important subject , fairly interesting at the start and much more so before the close .

		It goes into strictly church history with almost unnecessary fulness , so as to be really a history of the
Congregational Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Connecticut	LOCATION	to
1818	DATE	.

		The first chapters , on general Congregational and
New England	LOCATION	his - tory , before coming to the proper theme of the book , are largely a threshing over of old straw .

		Though such chapters were necessary , they should have been briefer , and left more space for the subject in hand -- religious toleration , and the theory of church and state .

		The treatment of this subject is admir - able , and is a distinct contribution to the history of our national development .

		The placing of the ref - erences to authorities in the appendix seems to us an objectionable arrangement .

August 1	DATE	, changed conditions and the tastes of present-day read - ers .

		Illustrations are to be nsed when called for by the character of articles -- but not , we trust , to the extent of making it a '' picture magazine '' ; and fiction , while not a leading feature , will not be disdained . ''

		A maga - zine of general interest , but of a decidedly literary character '' is the cheering definition of the aim of its publishers -- who are , of course , the Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons whose father conducted so worthily the first series of this honored and distinctively American periodical .

		With the new '' Putnam 's '' will be incor - porated '' The Critic , '' whose editor .

		-- It may be significant of the dubious fortunes of
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and of the growing impor - tance of its vigorous southern rival ,
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, that the announcement of a new
Pacific Coast	ORGANIZATION	monthly comes from the latter city .

		This is to be the '' Pacific Empire Magazine , '' and its publication is to begin
September 1	DATE	.

		As its title might imply , it will concern itself largely with the industrial and commercial development of the great and growing southwestern region of which
Los Angeles	LOCATION	is perhaps now the most vital centre and expo - nent .

		But it will include intellectual as well as mate - rial things in its survey , and will lighten its more serious contents by stories and poems , and by profuse illustrations .

		Mr.
Edmund Mitchell	PERSON	, for some years past the leading editorial writer on the

A Tale of Exquisite Imagery and Tense Dramatic Interest	ORGANIZATION	pROFESSOR
ROBERTS	PERSON	'S latest romance deals with the strenuous and adventurous life of the sailors and fisher-folk of the region at the head of the
Bay of Fundy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The winds and the waves and the salt fragrance of the sea are in its pages ; and the strength of the tides that fight the great dykes of Tantramar .

		The vehement passions of these simple people in whose hearts emotion runs riot ; and their deep natures which partake of the richness and steadfastness characteristic of the exhanstless meadows , make it a land where romance walks by day .

		The action turns upon the mystery of the heart 's wisdom in discerning truth and love where reason saw but deceit and betrayal . ''

		The Heart That Kjqows '' is a g ^ reat human story in which the author has employed to their uttermost his unique gifts of rich fancy and genius of expression as well as that craftsmanship which has had so splendid a development during the years of his successful career .

		From the Preface The plan of the book was dictated by the following considerations .

		It is notorious that English writers seldom look into a grammar or cotnposition book ; the reading of grammars is repellent because , being bound to be exhaustive on a greater or less scale , they must give much space to the obvious or the unnecessary ; and composition books are often useless because they enforce their warnings only by fabricated blun - ders against ivhich every tyro feels himself guite safe .

		NOTES 94 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 95 THE TWO LITERARY PATHS .

		Does the practice of literary art bestow upon the practitioner a franchise which in some meas - ure exempts him from upholding the conven - tional ethical standards ?

		Is the writer bound by artistic considerations alone , or should he regard also the social implications of his activity ?

		Is freedom , as to both choice of subject and treatment , so great a good in letters that it should be jealously guarded and boldly exercised by those who make the pursuit of letters the work of their life ?

		These are the questions raised once more by Professor
A. Schinz	PERSON	, in an essay on '' Literature and the Moral Code , '' which appears in the
July	DATE	issue of '' The Inter - national Journal of Ethics . ''

		His purpose is to show that the two views here suggested '' are not reducible to the same terms , to show why they are bound to clash and why there can be no reconciliation . ''

		The question is essentially that of the conflict between '' art for art 's sake '' and art considered as '' a means to an end . ''

		Broadly speaking , the former ideal is upheld by writers of the Latin race , while the latter is exemplified in English practice .

		The problem is mainly a recent one , the pro- duct of democracy ; for as our essayist hastens to indicate , the freedom of literary expression was not seriously challenged in behalf of society at large as long as education was the privilege of the few and literature coidd not hope to be - come popular in the modem sense .

		True its freedom was often challenged in the interests of dogma , and authority resorted to energetic meas - ures for the suppression of ideas that threatened to be subversive of the established order .

		But such tyranny was very different from that sought to be exercised in our own democratic age by a public opinion which , at the best , must be nar - row in its outlook , and , representing only the average thought of multitudes of commonplace minds , is little likely to be either liberal or truly enlightened .

		According to some writers , undue deference to this opinion is a serious menace to the interests of intellectual freedom , and the permanent interests of civilization forbid that it should be accorded .

		In the view of others , such deference is no more than a reasonable concession to conservatism , for imqualified truth would prove a dangerous prescription for demo - cracy in its present vulgarized and transitional stage of development .

		In his discussion of this problem .

		Professor
Schinz	PERSON	points out that it has been solved in essentially different ways by Latin and by En - glish practice .

		Taking
France	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	82 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	> for his typical cases -LRB- and what is said of these two countries is fairly applicable to other com - mimities of the same racial charaxiter -RRB- he says that '' in
America	LOCATION	there is held to be only one general public , while in
France	LOCATION	this unity does not exist ; there is more than one public . ''

		That is , the intellectual elite which created the French literature of the period preceding the Revolution has conserved its tradition ever since , refusing to temporize with the democratic demand for popular literature .

		To realize the truth of this proposition , one has only to note how the line of succession is continued from
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	and Did - erot and Beaumarchais , over to our own time through such men as
Chenier	PERSON	,
Beyle	PERSON	,
Merimee	PERSON	,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, and
Leconte de Lisle	ORGANIZATION	.

		Similarly , one might note the Italian series which includes
Alfieri	PERSON	,
Manzoni	PERSON	,
Carducci	PERSON	, and eVen d'Annun - zio .

		On the other hand , in
England	LOCATION	the sur - render to democracy was fairly complete by the middle of the nineteenth century , a surrender which the solitary isolation of Landor strongly emphasizes , while
America	LOCATION	never had an aristo - cratic literary tradition for democracy to attack .

		The consequences of this fundamental differ - ence have been far-reaching .

		During almost the whole Victorian age of English literature , writers in general submitted to the censorship of the uneducated public , choosing only such subjects , and treating them only in such ways , as would prove acceptable to the masses .

		Who - ever failed to take this coiu-se paid the penalty of neglect or of deliberate ostracism .

		English '' cant '' thus became a byword in the less tram - melled literary circles of continental
Europe	LOCATION	, and particularly among the French and Italians .

		This position our essayist exposes in a striking passage : `` The Anglo-Saxons , in trying to keep from the masses ideas which are not generally understood , admit the existence of a sphere of thought above the compre - hension of the general public .

		They thereby concede the value of an independent elite .

		It is remarkable that they pay special attention to the higher literature in
France	LOCATION	, and write about its papers and periodicals .

		But an unexpected result is that in this way the literature for the elite in
France	LOCATION	is brought before the general public in
America	LOCATION	-- for which it was not intended and is not suitable .

		Hence the severe judgments , from a moral point of view , which are passed upon products of French literature .

		Such criticism would be right only if these works had been meant for the general public . ''

		When we think of aU the restrictions that the nineteenth century has imposed upon English and American literature in the name of morality , when we take into account the stifling atmos - phere in which our poets and novelists have for the most part been forced to do their work , we can not help feeling that the French have chosen the better path , despite the licentious excesses that have marked its pursuit .

		For by means of liberty alone , even although attended by license ^ is ethical advancement possible ; and who will contend that the English-speaking world has yet reached anything like finality in its ethical standards ?

		Neither art nor morals could boast of robust health in a community which coiJd bring forth such an abortion as
Buchanan	PERSON	's despicable attack upon
Rossetti	PERSON	, or in a com - munity which found it necessary to speak with bated breath of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's supreme master - piece and look askance at its success .

		The process of recovery from this condition of artistic atrophy has now been well under way for a nimiber of years , and it is safe to predict , that the reign of taboo will not be reestablished either in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	.

		It is asking too much of literature to demand that it seek na entrance into large and important areas of the ethical province , that it leave imtouched whole groups of problems which intimately concern social welfare .

		There is no aspect of life or thought that is privileged to evade exposition and analysis , even although this artistic freedom of choice prove harmful to the moral equilibrium of some weak and imstable souls .

		Nor may we hope to see restored that artificial distinction between elite and populace which , as we have seen , still to a certain extent persists in other countries .

		Even in those countries it is fast ceasing to exist , as the surge of democracy over - whelms them .

		Art will assert its prerogative , despite the fact that its freedom may prove mis - chievous to certain of the iminformed .

		And for a time a large section of the public will indis - ieriminately assign good art and bad art to the same category , having reference only to its choice of subject , and not at all to its truth of concep - tion and nobility of expression .

		This is the penalty that must be paid for the regime of suppression .

		A great pother is being raised even now about certain daring writers who have freed themselves from the old conventional bonds ; but the sole basis of the outcry is that single fact , whereas its proper basis shovdd be their shallow insincerity and the obvious fact that their chief stock in trade is a sort of tricky audacity .

		Condemnation on these groiuids would be legiti - mate ; condemnation upon the score of their subject-matter is not .

		But the public , every section of which claims that the whole of litera - ture belongs to it , will be long in learning to - distinguish and rightly to appraise .

		THE DTAT .

		83 ^ \ it g ^ to g00ks .

		A
DiscrPLE AXD Follower of Lamb	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Elusive and elf-like , often fantastical and whimsical , but always of a gentle and ethereal beauty and a radiance of his own , the late
Alfred Ainger	PERSON	presented many points of similarity with his chosen favorite in literature ,
Charles Lamb	PERSON	.

		A quiet drollery , a way of flashing the oddest and most unexpected conceits , an unconquerable addiction to puns , a turn for neat humorous verse , a love of play-acting and play-actors , a per - ennial youthfulness of temperament , restricted literary likings , but the most exquisite taste within these limits , -- such are some of the com - mon characteristics of the two men .

		Like
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, Ainger remained unmarried ; like him , he un - complainingly assumed family cares and burdens that another might have shrunk from ; like him , he loved his friends -- and they were many -- whole-heartedly and to the end .

		With
Horace	PERSON	, whom one so appreciative of light and graceful verse must have admired , he could well have said , -- '' Nil ego contulerim jucoado santu amico . ''

		But points of difference between Ainger and Lamb were not wanting .

		Lamb was no church - man .

		He lived his religion , but shrank from professing it .

		An ardent admirer of
Priestley	LOCATION	, he was Socinian in his theology , so far as lie was anything .

		Ainger , on the other hand , though the son of a Unitarian , was strictly trinitarian in belief , and , however far from seeking the `` fat slumbers '' of the church , was loyally true to the establishment whence came his bread and butter .

		Latitudinarianism repelled him , and with dissenters he was wholly out of sympathy . ''

		A clergyman , '' he early wrote in his private notebook , `` is , at the best , a man in blinkers .

		He must not receive any lateral impressions . ''

		As became his cloth , too , he was , with all his
Ariel	PERSON	- like incorporeality , of staid and decorous mien -- excepting always those occasions of con - viviality among intimates that warranted the indulgence in harmless mirth and frivolity .

		Carlyle would never have seen in him the '' piti - ful , ricketty , gasping , staggering , stammering Tomfool '' that he fancied he saw in Lamb . ''

		La spite of all his fvm , '' we are assured , '' he made a serious impression on his contemporaries . ''

		`` A true man , '' he is pronounced by one of them , `` who might in any circvunstances be relied on to do what was right , nor count the cost -- a man • The Lifb ajtd

		firm of purpose , reverent , and lovable . ''

		Let us view him in his bodily presentment as he is pictured for us , at the age of thirty , by his biog - rapher , Miss
Edith Sichel	PERSON	: '' Pale of face , pale of hair , with eyes of a piercing blue , varying in .

		intensity according to his mood , now cool and light , now very dark and glowing , his nnder - lip protruding , as if to shoot forth some whimsy , bis fine , nervous hands often used in an expressive gesture , his form , frail yet elastic , slightly stooping as it moved forward with a distinctive striding step -- it is thus that he rises before us , a figure suggestive of the stage in its good old days , of one of the actors whom Lamb remem - bered , full of character and of erratic grace .

		His appearance was indicative of his character .

		The first word suggested by both was personality -- that force which can only be felt , not defined .

		When he came into a room , the room knew it and was changed .

		* When he left us , ' said a friend , ' we always felt as if we had been at a wedding ; we did not know what to do for the rest of the day . '

		It was part of his charm that he con - trived to unite so many paradoxes .

		Mercurial and formal , fantastic and imbued with sharp common sense , he was a strange mixture of Ariel and of an eighteenth - century divine .

		Charitable he was more than most men , and almost as prejudiced as he was charitable ; full of deep Christian humility , yet with such an eye for foUy that his tongue often dealt in mordant satire .

		A lover of the obvious , but so fastidious that he sometimes seemed capricious or unjust ; dependent on good com - pany , but also a creature of moods , of formidable silences which none could break , till some chance word that took his fancy changed the weather , and the sun burst forth again . ''

		Hazlitt , whom ^ liss
Sichel	PERSON	quotes , once wrote of Lamb : '' I will , however , admit that the said
Elia	LOCATION	is the worst company in the world in bad company , if it be granted me that in good com - pany he is nearly the best that can be .

		He is one of those of whom it may be said : Tell me your company and I 'll tell you your manners .

		He is the creature of sympathy , and makes good whatever opinion you seem to entertain of him . ''

		These words are cited as '' the best epitome of
Alfred Ainger	ORGANIZATION	's social qualities . ''

		To supple - ment all this , and to show the '' little canon '' in light and sportive vein , let us quote from two of his letters to intimate friends .

		The first extract is from a note to
Du Maurier	PERSON	, the second fro m one to a lifelong friend , Mr.
Horace Smith	PERSON	. ''

		Can you recommend any books ?

		... I have just reviewed for the Guardian the English translation of
Jusserand	ORGANIZATION	's English Novel before
Shakespeare	PERSON	.

		What an excellent and readable book it is .

		I used to say of another French critic -- '' Our T ^ gliah critics their dull wits keep strainingr .

		When -- Enter
Taine !	PERSON

		-- and all is entertaining . ''

		But the epigram would be far truer if it could be adapted to
Jusserand	LOCATION	.

		For a taste -- '' A Frenchman straTing into English fields Of letters , seldom has a locut standi .

		But if there 's one to whom objection yields ,
Tis Jusserand	LOCATION	-- he has the ' ju * errandi . ' ''

		Send this to him with my best respects . ''

		84 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, '' ... Do you want any papers or books to read dur - ing your convalescence ?

		Let me know , and I will send you some .

		I have made no jokes lately , or I would send them .

		Though I did make a happy quotation at
Marl	ORGANIZATION	- borough !

		The Head Master told me that a neighboiir - ing gentleman , who had been touring in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, gave a lecture on the subject to the boys , illustrated with magic lantern views . '

		Ah ! '

		I said , ' they used to do that in Juvenal 's day , you remember -- '' ' ... I demens , curre per Alpes Ut pueris placeas . ' ''

		But the neatest thing I ever heard was said by a member of my cloth ,
Archdeacon Burney	PERSON	, the other day '' However , not to claim too much of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	's space , and to give prospective readers of the book an added stimulus , we refrain from quoting this latter witticism -- a most brilliant one -- which may be found at page 180 .

		Like Lamb -LRB- a final parallelism -RRB- , Ainger believed in '' the sanity of genius . ''

		He once declared in a lecture on Shakespeare : '' It is owing to that surefooted step of his in things moral that he never slips , even on that most dangerous groimd ; that he leaves us in the end satisfied . ''

		Ainger has long been recognized as one of our best ethical critics of literature .

		Beauty , and all other excellence , with him , was dependent on moral health .

		Hence his pro- nounced dislike of Shelley .

		In literature , as in life , ethical and spiritual truth alone make a lasting appeal to man .

		When the dark hour comes , what else can sustain him ?

		It was char - acteristic of
Canon Ainger	ORGANIZATION	to discover rare ex - cellence in the novelist named in the following extract from a letter to Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	: '' Very many thanks for the kind thought that sent me
Mary Wilkins	PERSON	.

		I have already read two or three of her sketches , and they have a rare feeling and truth -- notably the one of the two old sisters who were taken away to a charitable ' home . '

		Perfect , it seems to me , is the treatment here -- and of a kind beyond Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	even . ''

		Sympathetic and stimulating in his criticism of favorite authors , Ainger recognized his limi - tations -- limitations which he had in part fixed of his own deliberate choice . ''

		In religious knowledge , as in all things , '' he once said '' dare to be ignorant of many things , that you may have time and heart and brain for a few things . ''

		The vagueness of philosophical ab - straction was not attractive to him , and hence
Emerson	PERSON	he found uncongenial . ''

		How , '' he ex - claimed , '' can one rise from reading
Emerson 's Conduct of Life	ORGANIZATION	without feeling , if he has a human heart within him , that if that is the whole Gospel of himianity , it were our blessedest fate to die and be at peace . ''

		These few notes will , it is hoped , call atten - tion to a book worthy of careful reading .

		Miss
Sichel	PERSON	has given a vivid delineation of a winsome personality .

		In evident sympathy with her sub - ject , she writes in a way to enlist the reader 's sympathy also .

		It was the gently feminine , not at all the rudely masciiline , that predominated in Ainger .

		Taste is the feminine of genius , as his well-loved
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	used to main - tain ; and in Ainger we discern a delicately refined taste .

		To a woman 's pen may well fall the pleasant task of teUing the story of his life and work .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		The Writings of Abraham liiNCOLN .

		* In these dignified and beautiful volumes we have in what must be their final form the writ - ings of the great War President .

		The original four volumes have been expanded to twelve ; an expansion resulting in part from the intro - duction of about twenty per cent of new material , but mainly from the use of large type , an open page well margined , thick paper of the best quality , a himdred good illustrations , portraits , and facsimiles , a few usefid notes , and in each volume a special introduction by a writer of reputation , and a poem on Lincoln .

		The pub - lishers promise for the last volume a complete bibliography and a comprehensive index .

		The arrangement of material is chronological , as in the former edition , new writings being desig - nated by asterisks .

		Diligent search has been made , during the eleven years since the earlier edition was pub - lished , for letters and speeches that then escaped the notice of the editors .

		A considerable amount of new material has been found , although , as might be expected , there is little that is really significant in these additions .

		They are inter - esting as showing more completely the working of Lincoln 's mind or the details of his life , but they are of minor importance in forming large judgments as to his character and ability .

		Yet enough that is new is brought together in this edition to make it necessary for every large library to purchase it for students of Lincoln and his times .

		And it is a beautiful memorial for the Lincoln enthusiast to have for his own .

1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL U ham , add to the value and interest of the work .

		In short , this ''
Gettysburg	LOCATION	edition '' approaches perfection in its completeness , dress , arrange - ment , and helpful apparatus .

		A few of the sig - nificant additions are : The '' Rebecca Letters '' leading up to the duel with
Shields	PERSON	; the Wor - cester speech in the
Taylor	PERSON	campaign , and an important speech before the
Illinois	LOCATION	legislature in
1837	DATE	; some important letters , among the hundreds added ; early law arguments and legal opinions , and many letters and telegrams that show Lincoln 's steadily increasing grasp of the problems of military strategy , going far to make good the claim of some caref id critics that
Lin	PERSON	- coln was his own best general .

		In going over these writings , one is struck first of all by the sudden development of Lin - coln 's mind , as well as of his literary style , when his soul was set on fire by the
Missouri	LOCATION	Com - promise and by the bold attempt of the South to carry slavery into the Northern territories .

		Before that time there had been but few marks of greatness in his career or in his writings .

		With limited education and narrow outlook , in his early life he shared the prejudices and adopted the fallacies of his section and his time .

		While he was a good politician in the local and state fields , and was always fair and manly in political management and controversy , he was then simply a high-grade politician .

		His one term in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	gave him no distinction , though he was not on the floor of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	the nonentity that so many new Congressmen are .

		He made some good speeches , and he won attention by his telling political arguments , as well as by his humor ; but there was little that showed what greatness was really in him .

		At the close of his two-years term he was ready to sink into the obscurity of a bureau position in
Washington	LOCATION	, apparently feeling no stirrings of the great genius that was latent within him ; and when he failed to get that position he went quietly about his professional work for a few years , active only as a political manager of the Whig party in
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		But the great contest between freedom and slavery woke into being the real Lincoln .

		There is a remarkable contrast between his political speeches during his Congressional term and earlier , on the one side , and the
Peoria	LOCATION	speech of
1854	DATE	and those that followed it .

		Before
1854	DATE	,
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	is mainly the politician , a shrewd manager of men through his insight into their weaknesses , but high-minded and patriotic .

		His speeches were able and interesting , but of the same class as the better political speeches of our own day .

		But the attempt of the South to seize the new Western territory for slavery I stirred his soul to its very depths ; the question became to him fundamentally a moral one , and the politician was transformed into the states - man and the prophet .

		There were disclosed power and resources that he himself had never suspected ; and it was almost another Lincoln that instantly commanded the attention of the North by his complete mastery of the subject and by the prophetic glow with which he in - vested his discussion of it .

		It is this greater Lincoln that is seen in the larger portion of these twelve volumes .

		The
Peoria	LOCATION	speech of
1854	DATE	begins in the middle of the second volume , and the Lincoln-Douglas Debate fills the third and fourth and a part of the fifth .

		Later in the fifth volimie are given the speeches at Coliunbus and
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, delivered on successive days in
September , 1859	DATE	, and the
Cooper Institute Address	ORGANIZATION	of
February , 1860	DATE	, with the accompanying speeches of the
New England	LOCATION	tour .

		In the sixth volimie we find his letter of acceptance , less than a page in length ; a mass of letters connected with the campaign and the organization of the administration ; the ad - dresses delivered on his journey to
Washington	LOCATION	; the great
First Inaugural Address	ORGANIZATION	; letters , orders , proclamations , the message to
Congress of Jidy 4	ORGANIZATION	,
1861	DATE	, opening the fateful special session of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and other papers to Sep - tember ,
1861	DATE	.

		It is an ever-new marvel how a man who grew up in the surroundings that were
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's during the first twenty years of his life , in an illiterate commimity with few books and no out - side stimxdus to seek them , with no training except self - training and no thought of forms of expression except clearness , can yet have worked out a literary style of such perfection and beauty .

		There are passages here that have never been surpassed for the perfection of the thought expressed and of the expression as fitted to the thought .

		The writings of Lincoln may well be made the object of carefid study , both in college and imiversity , and by the intelligent citizen who would drink at a pure fountain of wisdom and patriotism .

August 16	DATE	, A Critical , Account of American PAINTING .

		* Mr.
Samuel Isham	PERSON	's '' History of American Painting '' is an interesting and invaluable work , although it is not a history in the scien - tific sense of the word as understood to-day .

		It does not deal with facts , except in a very uncer - tain way , and then not as a factor in the treat - ment of the subject under consideration .

		Instead , it is a most delightfully sane , scholarly , catholic , and intelligent criticism of the work of Ameri - can painters , and as such is entitled to the very first rank in the small library of true art criti - cism .

		It is a matter for congratulation to find that we have a man so completely equipped for his task as the author of this volume shows him - self to be .

		Mr.
Isham	PERSON	was trained as a lawyer , which profession he abandoned for the less arduous if more exacting one of art , so that while he sees and feels and understands as an artist , he weighs his criticisms as a lawyer and writes with the terse pen of a jurist .

		Indeed , we regret that the volume is even called a his - tory , on its title-page ; for were it not , we would be relieved of the duty of saying anything but good of it .

		Limitations of space prevent '' our noting in detail the many serious errors in dates , confusing misprints , and misstatements of fact , which the work contains , -- for instance , the spelling of
Smibert	PERSON	's name , and the statement regarding his being the earliest painter in
America	LOCATION	; the statement about the birthplace of
Gilbert Stuart	PERSON	, and that
Ralph Earl	PERSON	was a member of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, etc. .

		Mr.
Isham	PERSON	, in his Introduction , says '' the fundamental and mastering fact about American painting is that it is no way native to
America	LOCATION	, but is European painting imported or rather transplanted to
America	LOCATION	and there cultivated and developed . ''

		How could it be otherwise , when we ourselves are European in everything from our first emigration down to the present time !

		But he explains that '' At first such art as the struggling colonies possessed came from visiting English craftsmen , usually of the most unskilfid type .

		Soon , however , they had disci - ples and rivals among the native born , of whom some of the most promising and enterprising went to
England	LOCATION	to perfect themselves .

		Two or three of these were men of quite unexpected ability .

		A recent critic has said that the best were but second-rate English painters ; but they • The History op American Painting .

		were second-rate only if
Reynolds	PERSON	and Gains - borough be placed in a class by themselves as alone jirst rate ^ The italics are mine , to show the trend of Mr.
Isham	PERSON	's independent view of the American painters , an independence which is maintained throughout , as well when treating of the living as of the dead .

		Of Copley , the first American painter to do highly meritorious work , before coming under direct European influence , Mr.
Isham	PERSON	has due appreciation , and analyzes his work with thor - oughness and justice .

		He gives a true estimate of West , placing his art exactly where it belongs without belittling his influence , attributing to him that kindliness of character which made him beloved by everyone who came in contact with him .

		I do not think he places
Matthew Pratt	PERSON	as high as his work entitles him , and ap - parently he is not familiar with
Peale	PERSON	's earlier portraits , which are much better than his later ones .

		It seems almost funny to hear
Stuart	PERSON	generalized and damned with such faint praise as , '' He was the best of all the earlier artists ^ and in fact it is only within comparatively re - cent times that we could boast of painters in any way his equals '' ; or , ''
Gilbert Stuart stUl	PERSON	holds his place among our best painters ^ and even among his great contemporaries in En - gland . ''

		That Mr.
Isham	PERSON	does not mean to place
Stuart	PERSON	anywhere but where alone he belongs , at the top , '' among the few recognized masters of portraiture , '' as the ''
Encyclopaedia Britan	LOCATION	- nica '' puts it , is shown when we come to his serious criticism of
Stuart	PERSON	's work .

		He writes : '' What the artistic effect of his stay with West was , it is difficult to determine .

		He absolutely failed to acquire any of the characteristics which might naturally be expected .

		He shows no trace of West 's handling , he got no taste for composition .

		In fact , it is a mys - tery where he gained his technique ; it bears no resem - blance to that of
Gainsborough	LOCATION	,
Reynolds	PERSON	, or , least of all , to West ... His scope was limited .

		While they -LSB- English contemporaries -RSB- covered large canvases with full-length figures and groups , using every aid of com - position and costume to produce their effects , and show - ing the result of this practice even in the arrangement of their half-length portraits ,
Stuart	PERSON	painted heads , and little beside heads ... The heads are all painted in a cool diffused light , seldom relieved by heavy shadows , or dark backgrounds .

		There is nothing striking , nothing forced ; it is only a head , a head with its ordinary light - ing and expression .

		No artifice is used to throw it into undue prominence .

		Within these limitations -LRB- and they are serious ones -RRB- they are unsurpassed .

		No one of his contemporaries had a surer feeling for the construction of a head or a surer insight into character .

		Where he acquired his technique as a painter is even more mys - terious .

		It seems to have been original with him ... He paints with an imequalled purity and freshness of color , very delicate and sure in the half-tones , varying

		THE DIAL 87 his color to suit the indlTidual , hut with a pearly bright - ness which is characteristic .

		The paiat is put on thinly , as a rule , in short , decided touches , without heavy im - pasto , ' mingled and mottled , ' as he himself says , and his execution was surprisingly sure ...
Stuart	PERSON	's style was his own .

		He did not learn it from others , and though he gave advice freely and generously , he could not teach it to any successor . ''

		It is , of course , impossible to give Mr.
Isham	PERSON	's opinions upon all the painters whose works he considers , and there are not many important names omitted ; but it seems a great mistake not to have given a full chapter at least to the minia - ture painters , who are dismissed with inadequate mention .

		Sully he commends very highly , say - ing that he • ' stands to
Stuart	PERSON	much as Lawrence stands to Reynolds '' ; but
Neagle	PERSON	and
Jouett	PERSON	receive only scant justice , doubtless from un - familiarity ^ - ith their best works .

		His account of the rise of
New York	LOCATION	to its place as the '' metropolis of the western worid , '' and of its becoming the centre of development in Amer - ican art , is impartial and just , ascribing this , very properly , to '' purely commercial reasons . ''

		It is , however , with Chapter XII. , on '' Begin - nings of Landscape Painting , '' that Mr.
Isham	PERSON	shows the real quality of his mind and his rare ability as an art critic .

		Speaking of
Doughty	ORGANIZATION	's pictures -LRB- page 213 -RRB- as '' transcripts of the na - ture he saw , small and unassuming , with no trace of foreign models , but their luminous , milky skies and violet distances have a peculiar personal charm , '' he says : '' The real founders of the school -LRB- for
Doughty	ORGANIZATION	was but a precursor -RRB- were
Durand	PERSON	and
Cole	PERSON	. ''

		Further on -LRB- p. 225 -RRB- , he writes : '' *
Durand	PERSON	's position is that of founder of the landscape school .

		Joined with him is
Cole	PERSON	, who , although a younger man , preceded him in landscape work , for
Durand	PERSON	was still an engraver when
Cole	PERSON	came to
New York	LOCATION	; and even when , ten years later ,
Durand	PERSON	turned to painting , he did not devote himself to landscape until a few years before
Cole	PERSON	's death , and then ip a style and with a feeling not at all resem - bling that of his friend . ''

		This putting of
Durand	PERSON	in his true position ahead of
Cole	ORGANIZATION	, re - versing the order that has been followed gener - ally , is a very important stand , and emphasizes again IVIr .

		Isham 's independence and discrim - ination .

		Fashion in art has no power with him .

		This is pointedly shown by his further treat - ment of
Durand	PERSON	, who is not now `` the fashion '' with some of the would-be art critics .

		He writes < p. 229 -RRB- : '' Sincerity is not the greatest of the artistic virtues , `` but no great work is without it , and it goes far to redeem what otherwise would be mediocre .

		It under - lies all of
Durand	PERSON	's work , as it did
Copley	ORGANIZATION	's , as a firm foundation .

		The portraits with which he began as painter are imlike any by his contemporaries .

		They suggest some of the early Dutchmen , men like
Moreelse	PERSON	, in the thoroughness of their workmanship and their lack of display or seeking for attention ... Like his por - traits , his landscapes were his own , and not to be mis - taken for those of any other man .

		He was too good a craftsman to tolerate any of the slipshod work of
Cole	ORGANIZATION	, -- everything is finished clearly and definitely .

		His canvases have a silvery gray tone , very true to what the eye sees on a clear
summer	DATE	day after the bright light has dulled its sensitiveness to strong color .

		His wood interiors are naturally richer but his shadows are true to the local color ... The silvery tone must have come from the fact that he worked largely out of doors , not making studies only , but painting directly on his final picture , a practice exceptional at the time . ''

		Then , following the position he has taken , he makes
Durand	PERSON	's work the canon by which to judge the works of his followers and successors .

		If space were unlimited , it would be delightful to give many extracts from this charmrag book ; to see
Inness	PERSON	,
Wyant	PERSON	, and
Homer Martin	PERSON	, as Mr.
Isham	PERSON	sees them .

		His conclusions -LRB- p. 265 -RRB- on this interesting trio are , however , all that I can give . ''

		With these three men the early American school culminates .

		If we insist on unprofitable comparisons and claim for any of our art an equality with what was best in
Europe	LOCATION	-- a real equality , not one hedged and bettered up with apologetic references to the limitations of our position -- it is these men that we must put for - ward , for the long period between the death of
Stuart	PERSON	and the rise of the present school .

		The essentials of greatness they seem to have had , -- deep feeling which took a pictorial form , ample knowledge , complete mas - tery of their material , and for each a style , personal and distinguished , which burst through that commonplace which fetters us all .

		The unprofitableness of com - parison has been admitted , yet appreciation of the stand - point from which they should be regarded and of the grounds on which supremacy b claimed for them is best gained if they are regarded in connection with the trio of gre & t Frenchmen ,
Corot	LOCATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	and
Daubigny	PERSON	.

		Thus it is possible in a way to get their bearings , to put them in proper perspective with the g ^ at world . ''

		Nothing in the volume shows Mr.
Isham	PERSON	's deep artistic sense better than the pages he de - votes to
Yedder	PERSON	's illustrations of the Rubaiyat ; his words give a deep insight into the man ; they may , indeed , be called his art-autobiography .

		But perhaps his finest chapter is that devoted to
Whistler	LOCATION	and La Farge , so incisive and broad is it in its differentiations and appreciations .

		To mural painting , which was practically un - known to our earlier artists , and is at present , as Mr.
Isham	PERSON	says , `` the most interesting and the most promising branch of our art , '' is de - voted the closing chapter of this remarkable treatise .

		In commending it , I do not mean to say that I agree with all of Mr.
Isham	PERSON	's con - clusions , for I do not .

		When he says that
Boston	LOCATION	was the centre of the intellectual life 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, of the colonies , he evidently has not been a close student of the intellectual life of the middle colonies , -- as
Philadelphia	LOCATION	was , until the
first decade of the last century	DATE	, the virtual head of the entire country , intellectually and politically .

		Or when he says that the fine
Gibbs	PERSON	- Channing portrait of
Washington	LOCATION	is the best of those
Stuart	PERSON	painted showing the right side of the face , it is clear that he does not know the superb original from life , now in
Providence	LOCATION	,
R. I.	PERSON	, which is the finest portrait painted by
Stuart	PERSON	, irrespective of subject , I have ever seen .

		Or when he says Hunt '' remains to the end an amateur , not only in the sense of loving his art but also in lacking the sure professional mas - tery '' ; or , at the close of his chapter devoted to
Sargent	PERSON	and the American painters in
London	LOCATION	, where
Sargent	PERSON	's talents are claimed to `` give him securely his position as the first portrait painter since
Reynolds	PERSON	and
Gainsborough	PERSON	, '' an ascription rather premature and open to much discussion .

		But from what has been said it will be seen that this work leaves little to be desired in the way of healthful and sound crit - icism of American painting , if it does leave the history of American painting yet to be written .

		The Oldest Text-Book of Moral - Philosophy .

		* The oldest text-book of
Moral Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	is still on the whole the best .

		Aristotle 's `` Ethics , '' despite its systematic deduction of everything from principles logically coherent and inter - dependent , does not achieve perfect scientific or artistic unity .

		Notwithstanding its excellent start , it does not leave in the reader 's mind the impression of a complete and rounded whole .

		But neither do the treatises of Spencer ,
Sidgwick	LOCATION	, or
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	.

		The systematic application of a single principle or method makes an im - pressive showing for a few introductory chap - ters .

		But the facts of man 's ethical life are too large to be swallowed by any formula .

		The progress of science , the idea of Evolution , the accumulations of experience , the enlargement of the historical horizon , have given to our modern theorists some points of view which it would be unreasonable to expect to find in the older thinker .

		But if we could not keep both , we should probably lose by substituting , for edu - cational purposes at least , their for his concrete • Aristotle 's Theory op Conduct .

		treatment of any great ethical topic such as justice , friendship , pleasure , or happiness .

		He discusses the facts ; they are preoccupied with the relation of the facts to -- Calvinism , it may be , or the behavior of the
Amceba	LOCATION	.

		The complete intelligence of
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's work is reserved for those who have the patience to trace its dependence line by line upon the dia - logues of Plato .

		But that is a counsel of per - fection .

		And meanwhile the book will continue to be expounded by men of Aristotelian rather than Platonic spirit -- by those , that is , who prefer '' common sense '' to genius touched with mysticism and aiming at edification as well as analysis ; by those who cherish the illusion of systematic method or formal completeness , and are repelled by
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's apparent dramatic aban - donment of himself '' whithersoever the argu - ment blows . ''

		This is presumably the temper of Mr.
Thomas Marshall	PERSON	, the latest exponent of Aristotle 's '' Theory of Conduct . ''

		He seems to have studied Plato mainly in the spirit , if not ex - clusively in the writings , of the utilitarian and rationalist
Grote	PERSON	.

		And his chief concern is to minimize , when he can not wholly explain away , the sm-vivals of Platonic mysticism and absolu - tism in the philosopher of his preference .

		He interprets
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's constant appeals to the quod semper. , quod ubique , quod ah omnibus to mean that there is no standard of right con - duct except the normal sentiment of the society in which the agent happens to live .

		Having thus attributed an ethical philosophy of pure relativity to
Aristotle	LOCATION	, he is genuinely surprised and grieved to find him elsewhere maintaining a theory of '' natural justice , '' and suggests that the '' confusion twice confounded '' is perhaps due to the blunders of the students who reported the master 's lectures -LRB- pp. 300-302 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	's interpretation is doubtless the natural expression of his temperament and phi - losophy ; but it seems to be confirmed by a whole - some aversion to the sentimental Hegelizing Platonism of the English Universities , as exem - plified , for instance , in the commentary on the '' Ethics '' of Professor
Stewart	PERSON	, and in his recently published '' Myths of Plato . ''

		Objec - tive philology ought to transcend these anti- theses -- but it never will .

		All men are either Platonists or Aristotelians in some sense , if not in that intended by
Coleridge	PERSON	.

		Acute but matter-of-fact minds will continue to misappre - hend
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's real meanings , because of their aversion to the '' Plotinists '' ; and sentimental Platonists will continue to view both

		Apart from this general criticism , there are few exceptions to be taken to Mr.
^ Marshall	PERSON	's book .

		Translations of the '' Ethics '' and phi - lological commentaries exist by the score .

		He has undertaken to present it in a '' readable shape , '' by means of a free but accurate para - phrase accompanied by prefatory introductions and expository resumes for each important chap - ter and division of the work .

		There is perhaps some illusion in the expectation that the general reader will find these 578 large pages more readable than the 350 small pages of
Welldon	ORGANIZATION	's translation .

		But Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	is justified in the claim that he will find them more intelligi - ble if he really wishes to understand
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's meaning .

		The quotation in the foot-notes of the original Greek for all crucial texts and sig - nificant phrases need not interfere \ d \ h the pleasure of such a reader , and adds immensely to the value of the book for the student -- to whom , after all , it must make its chief appeal .

		* Wise advocates of the claims of the physical in education do not fall into the error of making the body all-important , but rather show that body and soul are so intimately linked that an education for spiritual ends must begin with the body , and never at any time ignore its interest .

		Such an advocate of the sound body is Mr.
Stuart H. Rowe	PERSON	, whose '' Physical Xatiu-e of the Child '' is just appearing in its second and revised edition .

		The writer evi - dently draws upon a wide experience of the most enlightened investigation of the bodily welfare of school-children : he recognizes that no one vice or defect is the cause of physical evils in schools , for example , the favorite scapegoat of ' * over-study '' is reduced to its proper place in the ranks along with * ` lack of proper food , outdoor air or sleep , baths , irregularity of habits , unhygienic conditions of home , school , or person , '' and half a dozen other fruitful causes of exhaustion and breakdown in schoolchildren -LRB- p. 71 -RRB- .

New York	LOCATION	:
A. G. Seiler	PERSON	.

		I of the contents of the book , we note the matter of I deafness .

		Investigation shows that at least one child out of four has defective hearing , usually with - out knowing it himself , and almost always without \ its being detected by either parents or teachers ; this sensory defect is enough to cause first the ap - pearanc-e , and later the actual existence of dulness , while in nine-tenths of the cases the whole evil might be averted by seating the child in a more favorable place , or by obtaining slight medical or surgical aid .

		Matter of no less vital importance is contained in nearly every chapter , and particularly in those upon Sight .

		Nervousness , Fatigue , Disease , and Growth and Adolescence ; this last chapter is to be reconunended especially to parents .

		We are surprised to find only slight mention of the school physician -LRB- p. 161 -RRB- .

		One of the strongest impressions made by the facts presented is a con - viction of the need of such an officer ; the plan has been tested by thorough experience in
Europe	LOCATION	, par - ticularly in
Grermany	LOCATION	, and our situation and problems in this respect are not widely different .

		The fuU benefit of modern knowledge concerning the relation of physical welfare to mental development can be realized only when teachers and parents are equipped with the intelligence available in such a book as this of Mr.
Rowe	PERSON	's , and when in addition the best pro- fessional knowledge and skill are directed inunedi - ately to the problems of the school through some such agency as the school physician .

		The style of the work is clear and straightforward .

		There is a good index , and an excellent list of lit - erature for further study of the subject .

		We heartily agree with Superintendent
Maxwell	PERSON	's praise , cited in the preface to the second edition , and wish that every teacher and parent might read the book .

		Professor
O'Shea	PERSON	's new book , '' Dynamic Factors in Education , '' is also really a treatise upon the physical nature of the child , in two aspects , those of motor activity and fatigue , which form the topics of the two parts .

		The author 's aim , as stated in the preface , is to show '' that in the early years at least , motor expression is essential to all learning '' ; and to discuss the nature and causes of fatigue , and its effects upon mind and body -LRB- p. ri . -RRB-

		.

		He adds that he has kept especially in mind '' those who are charged with the immediate care and culture of the young , and has aimed to avoid technicalities and all pm-ely theoretical discussion . ''

		Now it is not given to many men who are occupied with advanced work , to be able to write successfully for the comparatively uninitiated ; moreover , as Professor
O'Shea	PERSON	himself more than once points out , much of the matter under discussion is still in an unsettled condition , and therefore unfit for popidar presentation .

		The result is that the book seems poorly suited for the use either of the practical teacher , for whom it is annoimced , or the professional student .

		In spite of the author 's resolution to the contrary , it is burdened with meth - ods of investigation , where results alone should be given .

		This is particularly true of
Chapters XII	ORGANIZATION	.

		90 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, and XIII. ; a conspicuous example is the insertion of a half - page cut of a `` tone-tester , '' which is harely mentioned in the text and contributes nothing to the intelligibility of the discussion .

		Again , the terminology and style are in many cases far too technical for the average teacher ; this is most marked in
Chapter VI.	LOCATION	, where the comparatively simple fact that all voluntary action grows out of random motor impulses is rendered difficult by technical phrase - ology and incompletely interpreted data .

		The habit of technical scholarship is strong upon the author , leading to the frequent inclusion of references and allusions quite unsuited to the express aim of the book ; such are the constant citation of original in - vestigators whose names must be entirely without interest or value to the average teacher .

		The larger number of the references in Chapter XII .

		are of this nature .

		While the book is thus of limited value for popu - lar use , it can not be expected , in view of the author 's declared purpose , to be a work for scholars .

		The summaries of data make no pretension to complete - ness .

		Much elementary matter is included , as , for example , the discussion of the eye in Chapter XIV. , and of the nerve-ceU in Chapter XII .

		As we un - derstand the author 's position , moreover , there is no intention of propounding anything new either in methods or results .

		The work is not free from questionable statements .

		We are told that '' One knows what a thing is after he has reacted upon it , not before .

		The mission of eye and ear is to give us second-hand or inferential knowledge , to reinstate former experience '' -LRB- p. 32 -RRB- .

		As a matter of fact , eye-and-ear knowledge are no more second-hand and no less '' dynamic '' than other knowledge ; the eye moves in perception with a swiftness , complexity , and ceaseless activity which no other sensory appa - ratus can equal .

		Again , it is said that '' the aesthetic characteristics of things always demand relatively great coordination and attention to minute details '' -LRB- p. 72 -RRB- .

		Is it not true , rather , that the aesthetic quality is found only in a contemplation which loses the details in a single unified view ?

		On page 79 , after pointing out , most commendably , certain limi - tations upon the value of manual activities , the author says : '' A boy who is to be a carpenter should continue in all stages of his educational course to make manual training of this sort his most important occupation . ''

		We can not too strongly dissent from this , as implying a false view of the end of educa - tion ; surely the boy who is to be a carpenter needs preeminently an intellectual and spiritual culture in his school-days which will save him from the greatest disaster that can befall him , namely , being a car - penter and nothing more , -- neither citizen nor man , nor intelligent parent , nor in any sense a full human being .

		Dr.
Seeley	PERSON	's little book entitled `` Elementary Pedagogy '' contains much valuable information and advice for young students of teaching , and will no doubt be of use to many of those for whom it is avowedly written -- those who are not advanced in educational thought , but are attacking pedagogy for the first time .

		Dr.
Seeley	PERSON	's ideas are always sane and practical , and no one need hesitate to follow him , always of course with intelligent choice and adaptation .

		The time is probably past , however , when the whole field of '' pedagogy '' can be dealt with even in the most elementary manner in a single volume of three or four hundred pages ; the attempt results inevitably in superficial treatment , omission of essentials , and lack of unity and coherence .

		The successive chapters are not bound to each other by any manifest scientific order and progress ; in some cases the sequence seems fortuitous -- particularly in the case of '' Elective studies , '' which comes be - tween '' Who can be educated '' and '' The gaining of knowledge . ''

		Some subjects are dealt with in widely separated chapters : actual method in teach - ing , for example , is treated more or less directly in Chapters VII. , VIIL , XIV. , and
XVI	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of the chapter headings do not seem to fit the content of the chapter : under '' The Process of Education '' we really find the process of instruction ; under '' Educational Limitations , '' after the limitations of original ignorance and of dulness , we have such topics as '' Self-employment , '' '' Self-control , '' '' Ad - vantages of superior education , '' -- none of which seems to be '' educational limitations . ''

		We empha - size these points because one of the important qual - ities of a book for the young student of education is clear logical unity and order .

		The author seems to have gone beyond the legiti - mate bounds of quotation .

		The whole book abounds in quoted passages , the most extreme case being Chapter III. , where out of a total of less than thir - teen pages we find four of direct and three of in - direct quotation .

		It is beyond the power of any writer to unify a discussion consisting so largely of the ideas and words of others .

		We can not help feeling that Dr.
Seeley	PERSON	's argu - ment for the existence of a science of education really proves at most that there is scientific study of education , -- a proposition which few would deny .

		The question whether education or pedagogy occu - pies a domain and deals with a subject sufficiently unified and coherent to form the matter of a science is not touched in the argument ; and this is the real question as to a science of education .

		Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	is peculiarly fitted to write upon the subject of his recent book , '' The Principles of Teaching . ''

		With an unusually broad knowledge of child-psychology , he combines a large and sane conception of education as a process leading from nature up to cultiu-e and social character . ''

		Educa - tion , '' he says -LRB- p. 21 -RRB- , `` should at times stimulate and favor inborn tendencies , at times inhibit them , and , most frequently of all , direct and guide them . ''

		On a later page -LRB- p. 39 -RRB- the author again sets forth the just conception of the place of inborn tendency and activity : '' Nothing really counts except as it in - fluences the pupil 's own responses .

		That the teacher
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 91 must educate pupils by means of their own activities does not , however , mean that what a pupU does of his own accord is right . ''

		And again we find a gentle correction of what some have heralded as the true '' new education '' : '' The child who sits quietly ab - sorbed in solving a problem is more active and more truly active than his neighbor who is jumping up and down with glee at getting the answer '' -LRB- p. 40 -RRB- .

		The book is just what it calls itself , and not an attempt to treat the principles of education ; the author recognizes the separate functions of the educational statesman , as we should call him , whose work is to plan curricula and school systems , and the teacher , wliose work is to execute intelligently and faithfidly the plans thus made .

		Nevertheless , Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	continues , rightly , `` It is not wise , however , to study the Sow of teaching with - out any reference to the What or the Why '' -LRB- - p. 2 -RRB- .

		The book is built in accordance with these ideas , in - cluding first a very brief outline of accepted ideals as to the end of education , then a fuller treatment of the basis of education in natural tendencies and impulses of all kinds , and of the methods of cultivat - ing and guiding these potentialities toward the desired end .

		The most striking qualities of the work are rich - ness of content and balance and sanity of treatment .

		The author is at once psychologist versed in the processes and achievements of advanced investiga - tion , and educator familiar with schools , teachers , and pupils , as they actually exist .

		To richness and balance we may add concreteness and clearness .

		The style is everywhere plain and direct , -- a vital necessity in any work which is to have a wide use - fvdness .

		The treatment of instinct and capacities , on pp. 21-35 , is particularly good in this respect , -- for example : '' Teaching little girls to be attentive to their dress and appearance is much the same as trying to teach an infant of six months to walk . ''

		And again : • * Thus , the tendency of a child to chase and torment a kitten may be inhibited by giving the child no kitten to play with , or by teaching him early to stroke and feed the kitten , or by beating him in case he does pull its tail and throw stones at it . ''

		The author has that knack of uniting illustra - tion and proof which is so great a virtue in exposi - tion and argimaent ; thus he clinches the truth that interest and easiness have no necessary connection by the statement : '' A tug of war , and putting up the heavy dumbbell the fiftieth time , are indefinitely painful , but may be very interesting '' -LRB- p. 57 -RRB- .

		In addition to illustrative matter in the main dis - cussion , the author has included many pages of exercises , designed to stimulate and guide the stu - dent in fxirther reflection upon the various topics .

		Of these he says in the preface : '' They aim to test and increase the student 's knowledge of principles ; to insure the habit and power of application of gen - eral principles to the particular problems of the school room ; to give training in judging theories , methods and devices '' -LRB- p. vi . -RRB-

		.

		Where room is wanting for half the praise we should like to offer , it seems invidious to include adverse criticism , especially as we do not believe the book has any really dangerous faults .

		However , we may mention one or two points in which it seems to us to be susceptible of improvement .

		First , it seems to leave something to be desired in manifest logical progress and unity ; it is not made clear just why certain topics are treated , or why they foUow in the given order ; we believe the right subjects have been chosen , and presented in the right order , but it would be helpful to the young student to have more light upon the reasons for the choice and arrangement .

		The treatment of Correlation -LRB- pp. 127f . -RRB-

		seems to us to stick fast in the prevalent false view that studies are to be hooked on to each other by some scheme or set of artful devices ; when the trnth is , rather , that all studies should grow out of a common root , and so need no artificial bonds .

		Practice is , however , so hopelessly in arrears at this point that theory may well fall into despairing silence .

		On the whole we do not know any single book more to be recommended for giving young teachers a scientific conception of their work .

		All teachers and students of education may well rejoice in its publication , as adding to the dignity and scholarly rank of the teaching profession .

		Chapter * on Professor
Walter Frewen Lord	PERSON	's
19th century	DATE	'' Mirror of a Century '' -LRB-
John Lane	PERSON	noveiuu .

		Q ^ ^ ^ oeg ^ j ^ j ^ g ^ jf undertake to re - flect the hundred years recently closed , but presents a series of thoughtful essays on thirteen -LRB- the author says twelve -RRB- English novelists whose works are regarded as constituting a looking-glass wherein maybe viewed the life and aims and ideals and achievements of the nineteenth century in
England	LOCATION	.

		The novelists selected are , in their order ,
George Eliot	PERSON	, Mr.
W. E. Norris	PERSON	,
Jane Austen	PERSON	, the
Brontgs	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Lord Lytton	PERSON	, the
Kingsleys	LOCATION	,
Lord Beaconsfield	LOCATION	,
Anthony TroUope	PERSON	, and
Charles Reade	PERSON	.

		In temperament the author resembles
Trollope	PERSON	, who , he says , `` had the settled mind -LRB- my own , so I can understand it -RRB- .

		He loved things as they were ; and loved to make the best of them . ''

		But even after this avowal of par - tiality for the chronicler of Barsetshire , one is astonished at having him called `` the most popular novelist of the nineteenth century , '' -- and this too in a volume that includes a hearty eulogy of
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		The mere record of book-sales and of republication , at home and abroad , tells a different story .

		In dis - praise of one whom Mr.
Lord	PERSON	regards as
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	's opposite , he writes : `` Exalted rank , like high char - acter and lofty aims and noble achievements , must all be attacked and denounced , and until life is re - reduced to a desert of colourless drudges Mr.
Thackeray	PERSON	will continue to disapprove . ''

		This is obviously severe .

		In treating
George Eliot	PERSON	, the 92 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, essayist says that philosophers , '' who have so often told us all about life and man and woman and con - duct , have nothing in common with the -LSB- i. e. this -RSB- great novelist . ''

		Many other disputable assertions might be quoted from these chapters , which are probably all the more enjoyable because they arouse occasional dissent .

		They show wide reading , skill in interpreting and comparing , a wholesome enjoy - ment of what is good in fiction , and they tend to whet the reader 's appetite for a fresh assault on last century 's favorites in novel-writing .

		More than this , now and then a page has something of the geniality of the imperishable '' Hours in a Library '' ; and what higher praise cotdd an essayist desire ?

		In the minds of students of history , A genial work in j ^ e honored name of Mr.
Thomas English	PERSON	history , tt i i • i i i .

		i Hodgkm has always been associated with
Italy	LOCATION	and
Western Europe	LOCATION	during the early Middle Ages .

		It is with some cm-iosity , therefore , that we approach a book by the same writer which undertakes a survey of English history from the earliest times to the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the period which has been assigned to Mr.
Hodgkin	PERSON	in the series known as `` The Political History of En - gland , '' edited by Dr.
Hunt	PERSON	and Mr.
Poole	PERSON	.

		Logically , Mr.
Hodgkin	PERSON	's volume constitutes the first instal - ment of the series , but its publication has been de - layed .

		After a brief introductory chapter upon the '' Prehistoric Fore-world , '' the author develops the general history of
Britain	LOCATION	imder the Romans , and tells of the Anglo-Saxon conquest , of the conversion of the English , of the coming of the
Danes	PERSON	, and of the invasion of William the
Norman	PERSON	.

		The book closes with the death of Harold at
Hastings	LOCATION	, at which point Professor
G. B. Adams	PERSON	, in the next volume , takes up the story .

		It is characteristic of this series that in it political history shall be emphasized .

		It is therefore very proper for Mr.
Hodgkin	PERSON	to be as cautious as he is when speaking of social and consti - tutional questions , and to afford them comparatively little space in his text .

		On the other hand , his narra - tive of the hegemonies of the early period , his ac - count of the conversion of the English to Christianity , and his portraiture of the great men , lay and reli - gious , who built up the English nation , gives oppor - tunity for Mr.
Hodgkin	PERSON	's delightfully happy power to tell a somewhat dry story in such a way as always to hold the reader 's interest .

		It is in the chapters devoted to
Roman Britain	LOCATION	that Mr.
Hodgkin	PERSON	is at his best ; but it is not alone in his account of the Roman occupation that we appreciate the worth of his deep learning in the historical and archaeological materials of the Continent , for throughout the book he charms the reader with happy parallelisms be - tween things and events in the distant island and in the greater Roman world .

		This richness of sug - gestion and allusion seems to be the element of greatest origfinality in Mr.
Hodgkin	PERSON	's volume , which is in no sense a rival of the works of
Seebohm	LOCATION	, Mait - land , or Vinogadoff .

		Well fulfilling the purpose for which it is intended -- an account of the political history of the period -- it presents a clear and in - teresting narrative , the fruit of a broad and , let us say , genial scholarship .

		It is to be regretted that our own An unhappy generation has very little opportunity to judge of the works of the artist who in the last generation worked hardest for the cause of high art in
England	LOCATION	.


Benjamin R. Haydon	PERSON	was among the first to recognize and acclaim the transcendent merits of the Elgin Marbles ; he was ever ready to help promising students with advice and instruction ; he attacked the abuses of his pro- fession with a severity that frequently recoiled on his own head ; he not only advocated schools of de - sign but assisted in their establishment ; and through his lectui'es and writings he undoubtedly helped to raise and educate the taste of the people .

		Both his ambition and his talents turned him to historical painting on large canvases ; but poverty drove him to porti-aits as pot-boilers , and even these did not suffice .

		He was always in the grip of the money - lenders , was several times imprisoned for debt , and finally ended his own life in despair .

		Fortunate indeed is it that he could not foresee that his cheer - ful dreams of a future place in the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	for the big pictures that had been neg - lected in his lifetime would fail of realization .

		Although several of his pictures have become the property of the nation , some have been loaned to provincial museums , one is in a lumber-room of the
Victoria	LOCATION	and
Albert Museum	PERSON	, but not one is at present hung in the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of his own favorites , however , '' Christ 's Entry into Jeru - salem , '' found its way to
America	LOCATION	and is now in the cathedral at
Cincinnati	LOCATION	.

		But
Haydon	PERSON	, unhappy in so many ways , was nevertheless fortunate in his domestic relations and in his group of close friends .

		Mr.
Paston	PERSON	's book on ''
Haydon	PERSON	and his Friends '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is , for all its sorrow and tragedy , bright - ened by the record of many joyous days and hours , and is altogether a fascinating biography , Among
Haydon	PERSON	's intimates were
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, Sir
George Beaumont	PERSON	, and
Miss Mitford	ORGANIZATION	.

		Although they had never met ,
Elizabeth Barrett	PERSON	was his correspondent , and with her clear sight and passionate sympathy she seemed to understand him as few others could .

		After read - ing the autobiography which
Haydon	PERSON	left behind unpublished , and analyzing the causes which drove the artist to self-destruction , she exclaimed , `` Tell me if Laoco5n 's anguish was not as an infant 's sleep compared to this ! ''

Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- disclaims all intention of entering upon psychological deep seas in the discus - sion of the feminine side of Parisian life .

		The story of the fashionable Parisienne and her frocks , the author thinks , is best told by '' snap-shots of the inner courts of Vanity Fair . ''

		The inner courts first con -
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 93 sidered are the '' ateliers '' from which the frocks emanate , and anyone interested in those sanctuaries will lea -RSB- * n many interesting secrets about ' * Worth and the old masters , and
Paquin	PERSON	and the new schooL '' Rather shockingly interesting some of the facts are , to be sure , and rather depressing , when one comes to consider the trend of them .

		The descriptions of Parisian life -- the art of dining '' le sport , '' the round of social events in
Paris	LOCATION	and the other cities to which the Parisian toilets annu ^ dly transport themselves , -- apparently prove that so - ciety is founded upon chiffon .

		The descending scale through which this society passes is fairly in - dicated by the title of the chapter on ''
Cannes	LOCATION	and the world ; Nice and the flesh ;
Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	and the devil . ''

		Mrs.
Brainerd	PERSON	takes the matter seriously , and implies that a new philosophy of clothes should be written by a • ' feminist of genius . ''

		The question seems to be whether
Paris	LOCATION	is frivolous because dress there is so extravagant , or whether dress is extrav - agant because
Paris	LOCATION	is so frivolous .

		None but a philosopher can solve so profound a problem ; but when the right man -LRB- or woman -RRB- comes there will be an American chapter in the answer , for in this preliminarj - volume it is written that Americans give the largest orders to the masters of dress , and that each year American women '' grow more ardent in their worship of the Vanities . ''

		The advantages of ^ considerable popular as well as popular election historical interest is Mr.
Greorge H.	PERSON	of u. s. Senator * .

		Hay nes 's volume on `` The Election of Senators `` in the '' American Public Problems '' series -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		The author reviews the steps by which the framers of the Constitution came to adopt the present method of choosing Senators , discusses the early methods of procedure followed by the legislatures , analyzes the
Congressional	ORGANIZATION	statute of
1866	DATE	which was designed to establish uniformity of practice through - out the country and which is still the law on the sub - ject , points out the defects of the existing method , traces the growth of the movement for popular election , reviews the argmnents for and against the proposed | change , and sets forth his own views in support of the proposition that popular election has substantial advantages over the existing method .

		In one form : or another , he says , the legislatures of thirty-one States -- more than the full two-thirds prescribed ' \ by the Constitution -- have commimicated to Con - gress their formal approval of the proposed change , and the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	has passed a ; resolution on five different occasions proposing an amendment to carry out the popular demand , but each time the measure has been blocked by the stolid resistance of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Meanwhile , the legisla - tures in many States , through the ingenuity of primary election schemes , have gone far toward relegating the choice of Senators to the people , con - trary to the spirit of the Constitution .

		The grounds upon which the framers relied in support of choice by the legislature , as ^ Ir .

		Haynes shows , have for the most part become obsolete .

		The decisive advan - tage of popular election , he thinks , would be found not so much in its effects upon the national govern - ment as upon the individual States ; by tending to divorce national from local politics , by promoting ' reform in the representation of the
State	ORGANIZATION	legislatures , by improving the character of the legislatures , by preventing serious interruption of
State	ORGANIZATION	business , and by doing away with dead-locks , it would insure a fuller representation of the States in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

George W. Alger	PERSON	's overttrain in critical studies of American problems , btuinei , life .

		`` The Moral Overstrain '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , is peculiarly applicable and suggestive .

		The essay which gives the book its name deals with a 1 question ever present in the financial world -- the overburdening of the moral strength of clerks and others employed on salaries remarkable for their meagreness , by permitting them to handle large sums I of money .

		The newspapers are fuU of the results I of this overtaxing of the moral nature , which , the I author suggests , should be as much the subject of 1 remedial legislation as the length of a work-day or the safeguarding of machinery .

		The moral over - strain of the capitalist is the subje < : t of the essay on `` Unpunished Commercial Crime , '' the trend of which is easily imagined , although the special treat - ment win repay careful reading .

		`` Sensational ; Journalism and the Law '' has a distinct message I both for the class of newspapers referred to and to the courts of law to whose laxness much of their power for evil is indirectly due .

		The other essays , `` Criminal Law Reform , '' `` The Citizen and the Jury , '' '' Some Equivocal Rights of Labor , '' and '' The Literature of Exposure , '' are interesting and often stimulating .

		One feature of the book which recommends it is that in almost every case the lawyer-author has a remedy to suggest for the evil he exposes .

		Moral overstrain is one of the most prominent features of American life to-day , and Mr.
Alger	PERSON	has touched many vital points of it in these studies .

McClure	ORGANIZATION	,
Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- The attempt of the author has been to trace American political corrup - tion to its sources in six
States	LOCATION	, which he considers typical of our whole country ; and in them we see clearly the workings of '' The System '' -- that • ' ■ reorganization of the political and financial powers of a State '' from which all present evils flow .

		Mr.
Steffens	PERSON	has a great many interesting things to tell us about this '' system , '' as it influences the politics of
Missouri	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, and
New Jersey	LOCATION	; and the story of the struggle for self-government in these States is effectively and forcibly presented .

		A g ^ phic discussion of affairs so corrupt , and at the same time so vitally affecting all American citizens , can hardly fail to arouse a 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, curiosity to know more of the true condition of affairs , political and financial , among even phleg - matic readers .

		It is unfortunate , however , that Mr.
Steffens	PERSON	, with so commendahle a purpose , should pdopt in his writing a tone of arrogance and a dis - inclination to restraint in his use of the picturesque .

		It is difficult at times to overlook this fault , and to keep in mind that the author 's ohject is truth rather than sensationalism .

		The stories pur - port to be , and in most cases distinctively are , the histories of typical workers in various American vocations , at the same time being the life-stories of average representatives of foreign nations in Amer - ica .

		As literature , the volume has but slight value ; nor is this value enhanced by the fact that many of the stories are printed with the grammatical and linguistic imperfections of the writers or tellers .

		NOTES 121 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 122 THU EDICT OF OYSTER BAY .

		The amusing antics of tlie spelling reformers have sporadically occupied the attention of the public for a good many years , but there has been no particular reason to take them seriously .

		They were displayed by a coterie of zealots , and although they found an occasional imitator whose defection from the cause of good taste was a matter for regret , it was fairly evident that the walls of conservatism had not suffered a serious breach .

		But Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's mischievous sub - sidy of the movement considerably changed the situation , since money will gain adherents for the most pernicious sort of propaganda , and now that the President of the
United States	LOCATION	has given his official sanction to the assault upon ortho - graphy , it is time to sit up and take notice .

		Cer - tainly , no one who resents this ill-considered meddling -- this attempted use of a monkey - wrench upon the delicate mechanism of a watch -- can be justified in holding his peace .

		It is unfortunate that money shovdd be put to such uses as this ; it is also unfortunate that the word of an individual , because he happens to hold exalted public office , should for that reason alone -LRB- sinc `` no other is in this case think - able -RRB- exert a widespread influence .

		But these facts , however unfortvmate , must be reckoned with , and we apprehend no little harm from the recent edict of Oyster Bay .

		The mere fact that the President 's messages will hereafter be couched in mutilated English does not in itself count for much , for frequent and voluminous as those messages are , they will be chiefly circulated through the agency of newspapers that will spell them in orthodox fashion .

		Kor do we antici - pate any headlong rush on the part of publishers to adopt the new spellings , for to do so would rather seriously jeopardize their practical inter - ests .

		A few -- a very few -- among respectable periodicals have for several years been printing such weird symbols as '' thru '' and '' program '' and `` catalog , '' but they have not been flattered by imitation , and have only succeeded in mak - ing themselves rather ridiculous .

		The chief practical menace of this new official pronouncement is directed toward our public school systems .

		These are often under the con - trol of men who are only too prone to favor any change that is tagged as a reform , and who are only too often incapable of understanding that this particidar '' reform '' has any other aspect than that of a time-saver .

		The mischief that coidd be done by a city board of school trustees , or even by a single school superintendent , is enormous , and we counsel the friends of English imdefiled to be everywhere watchful on behalf of their children , lest these be made the inno - 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, cent victims of a policy of false educational economy .

		The impetus given by the recent presidential ukase to this demoralizing move - ment will be at once felt at many points , and some of them will be those points of least resist - ance that in any such case yield to comparatively slight pressure .

		Now is the time for defenders of standard English to be everywhere on the alert , for , lacking due vigilance , some of their strategic positions will surely be lost by default .

		There is little use in presenting again the old array of arguments for and against spelling reform .

		The only plea that is or can be urged in its behalf is the narrow utilitarian plea of an economy of time -- for children learning the use of their mother-tongue and for foreigners making their acquaintance with English .

		There are so many causes of waste in our elementary education that this particular economy is sug - gestive of saving at the spigot while the bung - hole remains wide open .

		Besides , the economy is largely illusory .

		A child learns spelling either by visualization of the word-symbol as a whole , or by an arbitrary memorizing of the literal series .

		He does not learn to spell by the appli - cation of phonetic rules .

		We have in mind a high-school girl who the other day was asked to write the sentence : '' My uncle sprained his ankle . ''

		She wrote it as follows : '' My unckel sprained his ankle . ''

		She was the perfect type of the constitutionally bad speller , and the most logical system of orthography imaginable would not help her case .

		Having made the most of their plea for time - saving , the spelling reformers devote the rest of their energy to a series of disingenuous attempts to weaken the considerations urged against their hobby .

		For example , they discover that some erratic writer of the past occasionally used a cer - tain spelling which happens to fit in with their notions , and present this sporadic instance as a sufficient warrant for our setting estabKshed cus - tom at defiance .

		Or they parade a few stock words , such as '' island '' and '' rhyme , '' which happen to be misleading as regards their origin , and then triumphantly declare the entire argu - ment from etymology to be overthrown .

		To such childish tactics are the reformers reduced in their effort to make a display of logic , and to make the worse appear the better reason .

		But argument upon any subject is futile un - less based upon some sort of agreement concern - ing the meaning of terms and the desirability of ideals .

		The case against arbitrary spelling reform is emphatically a case in which a com - mon imderstanding between conservatives and radicals is impossible .

		They do not speak the same tongue .

		How can a man to whom words are mere counters , having no more character than Arabic numerals , enter into the feelings of a man to whom they are aesthetic and emotional symbols , having physiognomy and life , conse - crated by associations , and appealing in covmt - less subtle and undefinable ways to faculties deeper than the logical intelligence ?

		Let us take an example , the first that occurs to us , the words of Kent at the moment of
Lear	ORGANIZATION	's supreme agony .

		`` Vex not his gost : O , let him pass : he hates him That would upon the rack of this tuf world Stretch him out longer . ''

		To the spelling reformer , our resentment at this desecration is nothing more than a display of unreasoning prejudice in behalf of an artificial convention .

		How much deeper the feeling really is we shall not attempt to explain , for he would not understand our language .

		The particular list of three hundred '' sin ^ - plified spellings '' which are hereafter to grace the literature that proceeds from the
White House	ORGANIZATION	doubtless represents , in the eyes of the reformers , a very moderate step toward the realization of their dull pedantic ideal .

		They have enough of the wisdom of the serpent to know that the dear public must be led by de - grees to take their medicine , and that the dose must be well sugared by sophistry and smooth palaver .

		But they make it quite evident that the bottle is capacious , and may be trusted in the future to provide longer and more nauseous draughts .

		Hamlet 's words are clearly to the point : '' Thus bad begins and worse remains be - hind . ''

		Since aprinciple is at stake , and not a few forms of special usage , the list in question need not be examined in much detail , although cer - tain features may be worth a brief consideration .

		A large proportion of the recommended spellings give the forms now generally accepted in this country .

		To some of these , such as '' judgment , '' '' license , '' '' synonym , '' and '' anti- toxin , '' there is no serious objection .

		Of others , such as the words terminating in '' or , '' '' ize , '' and '' er , '' it must be said that American ad - herence to these forms has become so general that there is little use in trying to escape them .

		The preterite terminations in '' t '' must be held objectionable , although they have a legitimate use in poetry , where they help to a more imme - diate consciousness of the rhyme .

		The termi - nation '' gram , '' while perfectly proper in such trisyllabic words as '' epigram '' and '' mono - gram , '' becomes highly mischievous in '' pro-

		THE DIAI .

		105 gramme , '' for the simple reason that for most people it at once changes the word to '' program , '' transforming a mouth-filling spondee into an insignificant trochee .

		As for the terminations in '' log , '' they are utterly abominable .

		This miserable truncation may satisfy the ear , but to the eye , looking for the equivalent of the Greek logos , it is an impardonable offence .

		Some - tlung similar must be said of the terminations in '' gog . ''

		To sacrifice the good old English guttural in such words as '' though , '' '' thorough , '' and `` through '' is asking too much of our lin - guistic conscience , and we must reject the atro - cious `` thru '' for the additional reason that it does not spell '' through , '' even phonetically .

		The distinction between the vowel sounds '' u '' and '' ou '' is evident to any delicate ear , but the spelling reformers do not care much for delicate susceptibilities of any sort .

		Nor can we be reconciled to the suppression of the diphthong '' ae '' in such words as '' aesthetic '' and '' arch - aeology . ''

		On the other hand , the chemists are welcome to their '' glycerin '' and '' gelatin , '' and they may even have their '' stdfate '' and '' sul - fur '' if they will put them ^ lves under bonds to keep the latter spelling out of literature , for we shall still insist upon writing '' A fiery Deluge , fed With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum 'd . ''

		We must take no chances with
Milton	PERSON	I Let us not forget , in our zeal for progress , that
England	LOCATION	is still the mother-coiintry of our speech , that sacred heritage which it is our solemn duty to transmit to our descendants in unim - paired richness of expressive quality .

		Let us remember also that to teach our children an orthography that is likely , in the slightest degree , to make difficult their access to English books , would be a grave dereliction from our duty toward them .

		The doctrine of the spelling re - formers wUl never be acceptable to the cultivated English intelligence , and the attempt to ignore this fact , to create a distinctive American form of our common speech at the cost of an estrange - ment from the major part of our common litera - ture , argues something dangerously close to depravity .

		Rather shoidd it be our aim to do everything possible for the preservation of the threatened solidarity of intellectual interests among all the English-speaking peoples , to make concessions , even if they seem made to irrational prejudice , and to hold fast to the determination that no clique of doctrinaires shall be permitted to weaken our sense of the historical develop - ment of our language or of the unity of ova literature .

		The CUL.T OF the Cha-Jent .

		* Few things about which everyone has heard are so little understood as the cha-no-yu , or tea ceremonies practised by the Japanese .

		The out - ward forms have been described often enough .

		Foreign sojourners in
Japan	LOCATION	have even taken courses of instruction in making tea according to the prescribed ritual . ''

		Most interesting , '' is the usual comment of those who have thus endeavored to acquire the novel accomplishment . ''

		A curious custom , '' sagely remarks the ordi - nary observer . ''

		Childish '' is the scoffing verdict uttered by the superior person , who sees in it unmistakable evidence of littleness of mind , and rests secure in the consciousness of being above such petty t rifling .

		Some , even , of those who shoidd know better are wont to disclaim against what they characterize as `` the perverted aestheti - cism of the cha-jin . ''

		It is this aestheticism that furnishes the ma - terial for the charming group of essays Mr.
Okakura Kakuzo	PERSON	has put forth under the cap - tion of '' The Book of Tea . ''

		To some extent the title is misleading , for it suggests a treatise upon tea culture , the various kinds of leaf and their preparation for market , when in fact it is a searching inquiry into the nature of art ap - preciation .

		Some other designation , as , let us say , ''
Teaism	PERSON	, the Religion of ^ stheticism , '' or `` Tlie Philosophy of Cha-no-jTi , '' would seem better adapted to bring the book to the atten - tion of those to whom more especially it is ad - dressed .

		Yet who can tell ?

		It is not a book of the hour , but one which , if the fair flowers of literature stood less chance of being choked out by weeds , should find an ever widening cir - cle of appreciative readers .

		So , let it be hoped , one name may prove as fit as another .

		To all but the initiated , the char-no-yu cere - mony has been overlaid with a veil of mystery .

		It is related of
Rikiu	LOCATION	, the greatest of the tea masters , that in answer to one who would pene - trate this ved , he said : '' There is no particular secret in the ceremony save in making tea agree - able to the palate , in piling charcoal on the hibachi so as to make a good hre for boiling water , in arranging flowers in a vase in a natural way , and in making things appear cool in sum - mer and warm in winter . '' ''

		Who on earth does not know how to do that ? ''

		replied the in - quirer . ''

		Well , '' was
Rikiu	PERSON	's happy retort , `` if • The Book of Tka .

		By
Okakura-Kakuzo	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Fox , Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, you know it , do it . ''

		In one of his poems he asserts that Cha-no-yu means no more than to boil water , make tea , and drink it properly .

		As used by him there is a world of meaning in that last word .

		The truth is , the tea ceremony was contrived to bring together men whose art ap - preciation had reached the stage of connoisseur - ship , and to bar out those not fitted to associate with them on terms of intellectual equality , not , however , in a spirit of snobbishness , but because of the futility of scattering pearls where Circe 's herd may come .

		The standard of taste set up by the cult is most exacting .

		Its cardinal principles are sim - plicity and purity .

		Restraint is its watchword , -- ultra refinement its goal .

		Excess in any direction is foreign to its spirit .

		As practised by the gentle Rikiu it became a protest against extravagance whether in art or in living .

		Dis - carding highly decorated utensils , florid paint - ings , and apparel of bright hue , he preached , less by precept than by example , the gospel of a return to the simplicity of primitive conditions .

		If the heart and soul of the user were pure , the commonest bowl from the kitchen would serve .

		In this doctrine lies the secret of the cha-jin 's preference for such things as the rude pottery of antiquity , and the masterpieces which , under the semblance of rudeness , in reality attain the ultimate possibilities of the potter 's art .

		The preference for paintings done in Chinese ink with a few strokes of the brush , as compared with more elaborate productions in which color is used , goes further back and finds its root in the abstract philosophy of the Zen sect of Bud - dhists .

		But underlying everything is keen de - light in the beautiful and thorough appreciation of artistic quality .

		The few brush strokes must be done with consummate skill .

		Boldness and strength must be combined with exquisite ten - derness and softness ; each stroke must be f idl of life , -- firm , graceful , and with the utmost nicety expressive of the painter 's thought .

		Works of art of every description , architecture , sculpture , landscape gardening , the arrangement of flowers , poetical composition , even conduct , must stand the test of the application of these and cognate ideas to pass muster beneath the critical scrutiny of the tea-man .

		Mr.
Okakura	PERSON	's essays are conceived and carried out in the true spirit of the cha-jin .

		So light is his touch , so exact his choice of words , so concise his expression , so xmobtrusive his statements , that one hardly realizes , at first reading , the breadth of scholarship that forms the background of his work .

		There is the same facility in the use of English that distinguishes his previous books .

		Felicities of phrase meet the eye on every page .

		Occasionally , but only occasionally , is there a tendency shown to indulge in epigram for its own sake .

		And once the omission of the definite article comes near mak - ing nonsense of a clever comparison .

		These lapses may be taken as necessary to make the book conform to the Taoist and Zen conception of perfection , which , as our author tells us , '' laid more stress upon the process through which perfection was sought than upon perfec - tion itself . ''

		An unfortunate misprint on page 42 , by which the name of the
Shogun Ashikaga	LOCATION	-
Yoshimasa	PERSON	is metamorphosed into
Ashikaga	LOCATION	-
Voshinasa	LOCATION	, can hardly be explained upon the same theory , and should be corrected in future editions .

		The message of the book is an uplifting one , much needed in this twentieth century world , dominated as it is by sordid ideals and in dan - ger of being engulfed in the quicksands of vulgar materialism .

		Few of us there are who would not be better for accepting Mr.
Okakura	PERSON	's invitation : '' Meanwhile let us have a sip of tea .

		The afternoon glow is brightening the bamboos , the fountains are bubbling with delight , the soughing of the pines is heard in our kettle .

		Let us dream of evanescence , and linger in the beautiful foolishness of things . ''

		* Despite the general intellectual complacency of the present generation , there seems to be little reason to question that , like our forbears , we display the defects of our qualities .

		For a ma - terialistic folk we are interested beyond doubt in an unprecedentedly wide range of things spiritual and mental , but we are on the whole surprisingly insensitive to the requirements of exactitude in our forages after knowledge into the realms where information about these matters is to be sought .

		We crave insight into the mysteries of heaven above and earth below , yet we are prone to confuse theory with fact and desire with re - ality at the behest of any puff of popidar preju - dice or any gust of sentiment .

		In short , we exhibit the psychological paradox of a sincere and vital concern for the deep and baffling prob - lems of life combined with a vigorous indisposi - tion to face the rigors of the discipline and • The Subconscious .

		THE DIAL 107 training necessary to attain our ostensible goal .

		Nowhere is this tendency more vividly expressed than in the current interest in the subconscious .

		Contemporary occultism , which in one or an - other form flourishes like the green bay tree among us , has taken the subconscious into its most intimate bosom .

		Telepathy , mind-reading , veridical and prophetic visions are one and all explained by reference to this subterranean region in which are wrought out , according to this sect , the varied marvels for which the upper plateaus of mental life afford no explanatory clue .

		Even orthodox religious thought has shown a kindly disposition toward the possibil - ities of the new applicant for favor .

		Much of the miraculous in experience and scripture can seemingly be given a rational setting , if we are at liberty to accept certain of the prevalent teachings about the subconscious .

		Even in the more pretentious undertakings of philosophy and psychology the subconscious has from time to time receive !

		a dignified and cordial welcome .

		In its less worthy expressions this tendency has appeared in the form of a fondness for raw hy - potheses and un verifiable amateur speculations .

		Professor James has tellingly characterized cer - tain of its manifestations as the '' tumbling ground for whimsies '' of every sort .

		In view of the extant situation it is certain that Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	's latest book will meet with a warm and weU-deserved welcome .

		The author is thoroughly posted on the details of the subject with which he deals , he has the scien - tific temperament and sound scientific training , added to which he writes in a smooth and finished style which renders his text as agreeable to read as it is easy to foUow .

		For the psychologist the main value of the work will be in the compendi - ous account which it furnishes of a large and significant group of related phenomena and its able exposition of a definite and frank attitude toward these phenomena .

		This attitude may be designated as that of impersonal empirical sci - ence .

		Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	, differing in this par - ticular from most of his predecessors in this field , has no ulterior interests to subserve by the establishment of his own view concerning the subconscious .

		On the contrary , he leaves to their fate any secondary inferences and implica - tions which may be found to flow from the con - clusions he reaches .

		For the la -RCB- * man , on the other hand , and especially for the layman pre - disposed toward occultism , the book should prove a most illuminating and sobering influence .

		It sets forth in a thoroughly intelligible manner ihe essential facts bearing on the issues at stake , and builds on the exposition thus accomplished a sane and conservative interpretation .

		It wiQ perhaps clarify further discussion if we say at once that Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	adopts a view of the nature of the subconscious which is much less radical than that commonly urged by its popular expounders .

		There are , to be sure , several theories in vogue at present , and all in more or less good repute , psychologically speak - ing .

		There is , in the first place , the theory of the subliminal seK , which has enlisted under its banners not a few of the most acute investiga - tors of these regions .

		In the creed of this theory the conscious waking mind with which we get along for the most part in the world of every - day life is only a portion of our total psychic endowment .

		In addition to this we have another and in many particulars much more interesting self which comes to light only in moments of a peculiarly propitious kind , when all the auspices are favorable .

		These are the moments of in - spiration , of clairvoyant trance , and similar sublimated experiences .

		These are the circum - stances under which real genius expresses itself , thereby revealing the puerile limitations which characterize the accomplishments of the rank and file of ordinary mental performances .

		Another and opposite view maintains that all the alleged phenomena for which there is to be found warrant of a reasonably scientifio kind are to be explained on the ground of cerebral action following the general laws of neural habit .

		This is in substance the old-fashioned '' unconscious cerebration '' pruned of certain of the mystical implications of that doctrine .

		This theory is espoused by a few of the careful stu - dents of the subconscious , and is probably ihe conviction of the majority of psychologists who have given no extended study to the phenomena in question .

		It represents the attitude of ultra - scientific conservatism .

		Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	's view , while distinctly dis - claiming sympathy with the customary formu - lations of the subliminal self theory , and inclining definitely toward the alternative view above designated , nevertheless presents the sit - uation with a slightly different emphasis , and begets in his readers a different mood , if not a different conviction , as regards the subconscious .

		At all events , this has been his effect upon the reviewer .

		He marshals in a telling array all the facts which portray the background phe - nomena of consciousness as contributing essen - tially to the efficacy of the operations of the central portions occupying the foreground .

		The vague sensations of our total organism , which 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, constitute so large and ordinarily so unsuspected a part of our sense of personality , our inherited automatic and reflex acts , which only now and then intrude upon our notice , our acquired habits , which become all but unconscious when - ever they approach perfection , the astonishing disclosures of logical and intellectually adequate achievements -LRB- e. g. , the subconscious perform - ances of mathematical prodigies -RRB- which now and again burst out unexpectedly upon us , indicating that somewhere other than in our usual con - sciousness operations of a coherent kind have been in progress -- these and dozens of other similar illustrations are ranged side by side to exhibit both the degree to which our introspec - tively verifiable mental activities are supple - mented by others of a kind not fairly to be called conscious , and the manner in which the former shade off imperceptibly into the latter .

		It is thus the Junctional continuity of the con - scious and the subconscious upon which Pro- fessor
Jastrow	PERSON	chiefly dwells .

		If it be added that the author asserts that in his judgment all mental processes of every kind are accompanied by neural processes , the general temper of his attitude will perhaps be sufficiently clear .

		The plan upon which the volume is organized is simple and natural .

		An opening series of chapters describes certain of the principles of normal psychology which are most pertinent to the understanding of the operations of the sub - conscious .

		This is followed by a group of chapters upon the abnormal variants of conscious process in so far as these are relevant to the main subject of the book and in so far as they fall short of actual insanity .

		The final portion of the book is devoted to an exposition of the theoretical deductions which the author advances on the basis of the preceding parts of his work .

		In the early chapters the reader is introduced to an account of the function of consciousness and the peculiarities of attention and volition which follows closely the orthodox contemporary view .

		On this foundation the author proceeds to exhibit the play of subconscious factors in common everyday affairs .

		In connection with his sketch of abnormal processes , dream phe - nomena are subjected to an effective analysis which leads up to a description of the dissoci - ated consciousness of which psychologists have heard so much in recent years .

		This is the form of experience which furnishes the most substan - tial support for the theory of the subliminal self with its corruscation of related doctrines .

		As has already been mentioned .

		Professor Jas - trow does not regard the facts as justifying the belief in a secondary personality in any basic way severed from the self of the familiar sort .

		His general conception of the status and nature of the subconscious was described in an earlier paragraph .

		It is not feasible within the limits of a brief notice such as this to convey any satisfactory impression of the wealth of illustrative material which the author has gathered , partly from clas - sical sources , partly from records and observa - tions of his own .

		Suffice it to say that every position of consequence adopted in the book is buttressed by formidable arrays of illustrative facts .

		The defenders of the subliminal self are sure to maintain that their doctrine is given an un - duly cavalier dismissal , and were it the author 's purpose to present the controversial aspects of his subject this contention could no doubt be upheld .

		On the merits of the issue it is to be observed that everyone is agreed that under certain conditions a measure of disintegration or dissociation occurs in the fabric of personality as this is revealed in memory , in temperament , and character .

		When these rifts become suffi - ciently deep and permanent , one group of ob - servers maintains that the dissevered members are essentially two -- or more -- personalities , and should be so designated .

		The other party to the controversy insists that the schism is never complete enough to warrant the postulation of an entirely distinct personality .

		Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	's attack upon the strong - hold of the subliminal self is from the flank rather than from in front .

		He does not contend that the facts are incapable of interpretation in the manner of the theory at stake .

		He simply points out that the hypothesis is not the simplest one adequate to the facts , and that it consequently flouts the scientific law of parsimony in expla - nation .

		Moreover , he insists that the general implications of the doctrine considered from the standpoints of biological evolution and of logical coherency with itself are full of contradictions and confusions .

		The reviewer can not exhibit the details of the case , but it appeals to him as distinctly worth while to call attention to the existence of expert opinion inhospitable to the subliminal seK , so widely has this doctrine in one form or another possessed the popular im - agination .

		In conclusion it may be said , as indicative of the perplexities which surround the author of a book such as this , that one of the chief virtues of the accomplishment from the point of view of the general reader is likely to be felt as a
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 109 shortcoming from the side of the psychological specialist .

		Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	has a genius for metaphor , and he has allowed it full play throughout the whole of his text .

		The result is that his pages are always picturesque and in - teresting , but the psychologist sometimes wishes he would speak the language more technically , so that it might be less doubtful at crucial points just what he intends .

		This will perhaps be fairly regarded as carping .

		But a little less yielding to the passion for apt figure would have resulted in considerable condensation without detracting seriously from the value of the ex - position .

		Nevertheless , we must be sincerely grateful for an admirable achievement in a field calling loudly for such a piece of work .

		* Among the names of great men of the present age that of General
Porfirio Diaz	PERSON	looms large .

		On the first of
December , 1904	DATE	, he took the oath of office as President of
Mexico	LOCATION	for the seventh time , and began a presidential term to which he had been popularly elected for six years .

		Reaching the chief magistracy of his country by means of a successful revolution in
1876	DATE	, he has since -LRB- with the exception of four years , 1880-84 -RRB- held the office by repeated elections thereto .

		His greatness consists , how - ever , not in his being a little more successful and longer-lived than other Spanish - American dictators , but in the success that has crowned his efforts to regenerate his country .

		During the twenty-five years of his occupancy of the presidential chair he has wielded a power as ab - solute as that of any European monarch , yet he has used that power for the good of the land -- for the establishment of a benevolent paternal - ism ; and has possessed the love and affection of his subjects to an extent perhaps beyond any ruler in history .

		He has meanwhile lived the life of an unostentatious private gentleman in his capital , attending to his official duties much as a business man or banker in a large city would attend to his .

		He has succeeded in re - moving

		in name only , and dictatorial in fact , yet thor - oughly adapted to the needs of the people and capable of establishing peace in a hitherto dis - tracted country .

		By clear-headed statesmanship he has lifted the country from seemingly hope - less bankruptcy and restored its credit .

		He has developed its resources , carried to a successful conclusion some of the most gigantic schemes for public improvements , and has established systems of public instruction surpassed nowhere dse in the world .

		Here , then , is a worthy subject for the bio - grapher .

		It is true that recent books upon Mexican subjects pay their meed of praise to the wonderful man who has brought order out of chaos in the neighboring republic ; and the popu - lar magazines give occasional notices of the work he is doing .

		Perhaps the biographer is waiting for the completion of his career when his life can be viewed in its proper perspective , the per - manence of his institutions tested , and the question answered whether the benevolent pater - nalism he has substituted for a former military absolutism can survive him .

		But although
Diaz	PERSON	is six years past his three score and ten , he exhibits no decay of powers , and the world may have to wait many years to view his career in its completeness .

		No one could attain to a position of such unique character as that of
Porfirio Diaz	PERSON	in any Spanish - American country -LRB- in
Mexico	LOCATION	perhaps least of all -RRB- without a career of more than ordi - nary interest .

		The bare official record of the military and other public services of Diaz , fur - nished by the
Under Secretary of Naval and Military Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, covers seven octavo pages and exhibits him as peculiarly a man of action .

		Mrs.
Alec-Tweedie	PERSON	has written several books of sight - seeing in strange lands , and her desire to find a subject for another volume first turned her attention to
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Six months in that country in
1900	DATE	resulted m ''
Mexico	LOCATION	as I Saw It , '' a book which won the admiration of the President because of the good it foimd in
Mexico	LOCATION	to ex - ploit .

		Four years later Mrs.
Alec-Tweedie	PERSON	was invited to revisit
Mexico	LOCATION	as the guest of the President , and then received his consent to write his biography .

		Her time was well spent in col - lecting the materials for this task , in which she was assisted by the President and his accom - plished wife .

		The President placed his private journals at her command , and thus gave her the very best opportunity that could be had for writing an account of his military career .

		She was given access to official reports which ex - plained many of his public acts .

		Her intimacy 110 THE DlAl .

		-LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, with the President and his charming wife enabled her to write intelligently of the private life of the President , and to describe his activity in the discharge of official and semi-official duties .

		All of these valuable materials were taken back to the author 's
London	LOCATION	home , and there the book was written early in the following year .

		It is impossible to appreciate the life of Por - firio Diaz without knowing something , indeed without knowing a great deal , of the history of
Mexico	LOCATION	and comparing its past conditions with the present .

		Mrs.
Alec-Tweedie	PERSON	has been able to draw upon the observations made with her former book in view , to supply this needed set - ting for the biography .

		It may be that her book is overloaded with matters somewhat indirectly related to her subject , but that can be accounted no fault .

		The numerous illustrations also are not in every case strictly relevant to the text .

		But all add to the richness of the book , which rises to the distinction of being the first adequate biography of the greatest man

		The Gkeek World uni > eb Roman Sway .

		* How many of us found our early travels in Greek history abruptly terminated with the death of Alexander the Great , as if the route were sud - denly broken by some unbridgable chasm or unscalable cliff !

		It is true that we heard of vague and shadowy creatures , known as diadochi , some - where over the cliff , and in our Latin work we read the alliterative line recording the fact that captured
Greece	LOCATION	took captive her savage con - queror ; but that Greek history really continued , that Greek people went on existing otherwise than as entities to be governed , we were never encouraged to realize .

		From one point of view there was a justification for the sudden and arbi - trary interruption , inasmuch as the great world - message of Hellenism found early utterance , and the post - Alexandrian period served mankind not so much by evolving a new message as by trans - mitting the old .

		Plutarch in his Pythian treatise contrasts the majesty and glory of that oracle when it swayed the decisions of nations by its po - etic vaticinations with its degradation in his own day when it talked in vulgar prose and was con - sulted about cattle and drains ; and this may be taken to symbolize the general change in
Hellas	LOCATION	, which in its golden age had generated those '' im - * The Silver Age op the Greek World .

		By
John Pentland Ohic & iGro Press Mahaffy	ORGANIZATION	, C.V.O. ,
D.D.	LOCATION	, D.C.L.
Chicago	LOCATION	: The University of perial spirits who rule the present from the past , '' and in the Roman age was producing , in its best influences , a cosmopolitan humanitarianism and genial refinement , in its worst , political servility and intellectual stagnation .

		The great Greek seal on what this world of thought inherits is the seal of the earlier generations .

		And yet
Greece	LOCATION	between the death of
Alex	PERSON	- ander and the Roman conquest is worth knowing , as is also the Greek world under Roman sway .

		We have the after-history of the Macedonian empire , which may be said to have contributed to the history of modern government the impe - rial or monarchic system , which was passed on to sequent centuries by the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	, -- a contribution of tremendous moment , if not of unmixed benefit .

		Then in the Roman period we have an exceptional opportunity to observe the interaction of a subjugated nation with supe - rior intellectual endowments and a conquering nation with more effective political instincts and organization .

		Again , we must not forget that these centuries transmitted from the previous age the glorious heritage of thought and culture of which we have spoken , and it is worth while knowing the people to whom fate intrusted this precious charge .

		Occasionally , too , the fire flickers up from the ashes on the olden altars and there appears a writer , a sculptor , or a coin - engraver in whom we discover the glow , albeit an after-glow , of the marvellous Hellenic genius , -- such , for instance , as appears in the work of the king of biographers .

		Furthermore , there is the thought that we are dealing with the gen - tile soil on which the seeds of Christianity fell to rise in triumphant growth and overspread the world ; and countless blunders of the most fundamental sort would have been avoided in the writing of European history , as well as in the making thereof , if more had been known about the seed-time of Christianity .

		Overlying all else is the fact that here we have a troubled age so like our own that the modern reader will sometimes wonder whether he is not dealing with to-day in the thin disguise of a Graeco-Roman yesterday .

		The great initial factor in the political rela - tions of
Rome	LOCATION	and conquered
Greece	LOCATION	is that
Greece	LOCATION	needed a ruler , but that
Rome	LOCATION	had not been trained to rule .

		One moment the sym - pathetic student of the earlier decades of our period is fiercely aroused by the incapacity , or worse , of a Roman governor , the next , he is brought back to a pitiful sobriety by the greater incapacity of the Greeks to rule them - selves .

		The city of the Tiber had arrived at its
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 111 proud position as mistress of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	world rather by muddling through her prob - lems of growth than by pursuing a broad-based deliberate policy of intelligent expansion .

		Ac - cordingly it was natural enough that her first years in
Greece	LOCATION	should be replete with regret - table errors or even deplorable crimes .

		Right - eous rule , after all , seems to be almost as largely a matter of habit as is efficient rule , and other nations than
Rome	LOCATION	have shown slowness in ac - quiring the habit .

		Howbeit , even these early years of misrule were better than anarchy , a fact that one must keep constantly in mind in weighing such a caption as '' The Roman Con - quest a Disaster to Hellenism . ''

		Then with the imperial system of provincial government came a fimdamental improvement , when the great ^ aa ; Romana made the world orderly if not progres - sive , and prosperous if not happy .

		It is easy to talk about '' the political boa-constrictor '' and its strangling embrace ; but the decadence of Greek cidture had begun two centuries before the Roman conquest threw its coils about the Hellenic world .

		It can scarcely be questioned that Hellenism both survived longer and exer - cised a wider influence as a result of the Roman dominion .

		While Roman Hellenism was not
Periclean Hellenism	PERSON	, it was at any rate
Hellen	PERSON	- ism as opposed to barbarism , and the world would have been poorer had
Greece	LOCATION	been left to its de - clining fate .

		For this work of rescue
Greece	LOCATION	offered requital in strange coin , and
Rome	LOCATION	became Greek .

		With this phase of the question , however , everybody is familiar .

		We have all read of the influence of Greek cooks and Greek scvdptors , Greek valets and Greek tutors , Greek actors and Greek architects , Greek vice and Greek philosophy , Greek drinking and Greek literature ; nor does this jumble of words represent imf airly the irregular but all-pervading sweep of the Hel - lenic reaction .

		Rome was to transmit her own wonderful achievement in law and political or - ganization ; but on the remainder of her glorious bequest is the stamp of another genius .

		Geographically this Greek world had grown to remarkable bounds .

		Bactria and
India	LOCATION	saw Hellenistic kingdoms fall after an ephemeral existence ; but an unmistakable imprint was left on the coins , the plays , and the architecture of these lands .

		Down in the Libyan desert , here and there , were colonies of soldiers , whose wives in many instances came from the old Greek home , whose children were taught by the old methods and read the old literature .

		In
Syria	LOCATION	, too , and Palestine there were flourishing Hel - lenic polities , and over in the
Crimea	LOCATION	were isolated settlements keeping alive the torch of Hellenism to throw at least a tiny beam on the darkness of surrounding barbarism .

		And so we might wander about in Greek company almost anywhere between the Pillars of Her - cides and the fabled ramparts of farther
India	LOCATION	:
Greece	LOCATION	had been transformed from a place into a civilization .

		This civilization was represented by people who were living and thinking , even if their thoughts were not original , nor their life replete with the highest activities .

		For the public life we may repeat our author 's quotation from Plutarch : '' For see , if we eniunerate the great - est blessings which polities enjoy -- peace , lib - erty , material prosperity , populousness , harmony -- as far as peace is concerned , the communities have nothing to desire from their politicians , every Greek , every barbarian , war has departed from us and vanished ; as regards liberty , they have as much as the rulers accord to such com - munities , and perhaps as much as is good for them . ''

		For private life there is no safe and convenient sxmimary , save that it was a restlesa age when men looked forward with uncertainty and backward with regret .

		That it was a period of great viciousness would be an unfair deduc - tion , although the deduction is drawn by one learned German historian ; it is much more pro- bable that there was a premium on the average decent man who was courteous to his neighbors and in general steered rather closely to the mean .

		While the circle of activities was not large , the activities themselves were not necessarily ignoble .

		There was much more education , much more reading , more interest in sculpture , more literary chat and other recreations of a refined sort than one commonly associates with the life of the period .

		Furthermore , there was not a little pro- ductivity in literatiire and plastic art , even if there was a dearth of greatness in these fields ; but we may not allow ourselves to follow this tempting vista .

		We must add , however , that the old religion had lost much of its vitality in the development of a spirit of toleration and eclecticism ; these cosmopolites had begun to feel that a new religion might be after all an old friend in a new guise , or even a new friend more valuable than the old .

		As a matter of fact , in the general restlessness many new religions were being welcomed with open hands .

		In the first century before the Christian era , and par - ticularly in the century immediately sequent ,
Isis	ORGANIZATION	and Mithra were worshipped to an extent only revealed by recent studies , and with rites 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, and ceremonies so strikingly akin to many fea ^ tures of Christian usage that no reader can escape the significance of the similarity .

		In connection with other systems of religion or phil - osophy a mystic asceticism had already invaded many parts of this troubled world .

		These and other allied symptoms make it perfectly clear that we have reached the period when the field was ready for the seed of some great religion which should combine mysticism and ethical doctrine , which should give the world '' morality suffused with emotion . ''

		Here , then , we have the fulness of time for Christianity , and our period shades off into other phases of the pro- gress of mankind .

		Since the appearance of Droysen 's '' Ges - chichte des Hellenismus , '' in
1836	DATE	, there has been no lack of German publications on post - classical
Greece	LOCATION	; but readable works in English have not been numerous .

		Accordingly Pro- fessor
Mahaffy	PERSON	has performed during the last thirty years a real service , which the English - reading public has been glad to acknowledge .

		Nor has his helpfulness been in any way lim - ited to popularizing the result of German or other investigation , for he has been a pains - taking searcher as well as a ready interpreter .

		His '' Greek Life and Thought from
Alexander	PERSON	to the Roman Conquest '' appeared in
1877	DATE	, to be followed thirteen years later by his '' Greek World under Roman Sway . ''

		The '' Silver Age of the Greek World '' is intended to replace the latter work , now out of print , '' in a maturer and better form with much new material super - added . ''

		Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	's books are always agreeable reading , -- '' easy and pleasant '' is the phrase that presents itself immediately to one 's pen , -- and from their perusal much instruction is to be gained as well as much information .

		His well-known fondness for drawing parallels between the period under treatment and our own day never loses its attractiveness , nor indeed its usefidness , -- jpace the school which denies the existence of analogies in history , -- and only the length of this notice enables us to refrain from quotation .

		One might enumerate many other merits ; but it may be more usef id to touch upon a few groimds for difference .

		Surely the old name , which is placed at the head of this review , should have been retained for the new edition , inasmuch as it was accurately descrip - tive , whereas most of us think of the Silver Age of the Greek World as falling decidedly earlier .

		The expectations aroused by the preface are rather satisfactorily met , although we shoidd have welcomed more new material .

		For in - stance , a brief chapter on art , including the lesser arts such as coin-engraving and gem - cutting , might well have been included .

		Even if no new chapters had been added , there should have been inserted about three good maps .

		Furthermore , an air of finality in statement does not always carry finality of conviction , and this latter finality we not infrequently miss , as we also miss a comprehensively unifying exposition that should set the whole period before the reader with the compelling hand of a great mas ter .

		One may admit the difficulties appurtenant to the nature of the subject and still demand a more satisfactory treatment .

		Any discussion of differences about particular minor conclusions we must forego , and , in any case , such differ - ences are as often an indication of an author 's soundness as of his error .

		We have said that Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	is an eager and earnest scholar and a charming writer , and that his works are well worth reading ; but we can not escape the thought that in the present instance a good book might have been better .

		However , '' The Silver Age of the Greek World '' has come from the author 's hand when his advanced age is crowded with honors , and will doubtless hold its place with British and American readers through many years .

		Such a prediction does not imply that a new treatment by Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	or some other historian will not be needed in the near future , for discoveries throwing light on our period are following one another in thick succession .

		In - deed , there is probably no other segment of Greek history for which research will do so much , and it is pleasing to know that the research is being prosecuted most zealously .

		Buried remains of public and private buildings on the sites of centres of population , ruins of villas in the rural parts , inscriptions , coins , even mummy wrappings and heaps of discarded papers , are contributing to the thrills of the excavator and the subsequent solid knowledge of the student .

		Mr.
Punch	PERSON	speaks somewhere of '' a nice fat book , tastefully presented , '' and we should like to borrow the phrase .

		Four hundred and eighty - two rather thick pages imply the fatness , and the remainder of the description is equally perti - nent .

		The plain brown cover , bearing a beauti - fid head of Alexander with the horn of
Ammon	PERSON	, induces a favorable attitude before one opens the book .

		Inside , one finds an easily legible type and the signs of good workmanship , al - though in too many instances the proofreader 's eye has failed him .

		An index of twenty-two pages , trustworthy as far as tested , adds materi -

		The English version , which is carelessly made , is the work of Miss

JOrn Uhl	PERSON	'' -RRB- the strongest work that German fiction has produced since the two great masterpieces of the veteran
Paul Heyse	PERSON	.

		It is a work which , in con - struction , characterization , and deep ethical interest , is nothing less than masterly ; it holds the attention by strictly legitimate means , and leaves us with the feeling that we have been brought into close relations with a group of real men and women , sinning and suffering in accordance with the sternest verities of human existence .

		years .

		Ulrich , in the meanwhile , knowing nothing of his friend 's guilty relations with the widow of the slain , offers himself to her in marriage , and is accepted .

		They have been united for some time when
Leo	PERSON	returns to his home , and at this point the story opens , for all that we have thus far related transpires gradually as we pursue the fortunes of the two friends .

		Here , then , is the situation .

		Leo is all the time conscious of the dark shadow of guilt that separates him from
Ulrich	LOCATION	.

		The latter , wholly unsuspecting , seeks to reknit the old relations , yet must defer to the stubborn fact that his wife had been made a widow by the deed of his friend .

		And now for a word about the woman ,
Felicitas	PERSON	, as the author has ironically named her .

		She is a beauti - ful animal , made dangerously seductive by the pos - session of a high degree of intelligence , essentially selfish and shallow , yet capable of feigning the utmost humility and the deepest emotion .

		Her old passion for her husband 's friend is revived upon his return , and he , while vainly believing himself to be forever freed from its bondage , finds himself slowly yielding to the subtle influences with which she in - vests his life .

		The substance of the book is the struggle between these two charaeters -- her strug - gle to bring him back into the old sinful relation , his to banish her from his thought , and purify his soul by repentance and expiation .

		The issue comes near to being a tragical one in the sense of the theatre ; in the psychological sense it is tragical throughout the course of the narrative .

		It is morally refreshing to find the problem of sin and its atone - ment handled in this virile fashion .

		For once we have a book in which sin is envisaged in aU its hide - ousness , and not glossed over with sentimentalisms about the weakness of poor human nature , or even made alluring of aspect , as is frequently the modem novelist 's fashion .

		We have not often had read to us a sterner lesson of the way in which our sins pursue us , of how retributive justice abates to the sinner no jot of the suffering that the moral order of the world decrees for him .

		Here is a book which makes our admired English and American novelists of the day -LRB- with two or three exceptions -RRB- seem no more than artificers of puppets , pulling their strings for our entertainment .

		It is a tonic book , calculated to impress uncomfortably the easy-going conscious - ness , yet a work of such varied interest and artistic skill that it can hardly fail to attract a host of readers .

		Whenever a new translation of a novel by
Sefiora Baz	ORGANIZATION	^ n is published , someone seems to find it neces - sary to introduce the author in terms that would make of her one of the greatest of modem writers .

		In the case of '' The Mystery of the
Lost Dauphin	LOCATION	, '' for example , we are bidden to think of her as supe - rior to
George Eliot	PERSON	and comparable with Tourgu ^ nieff .

		This is all very unfortunate , and does much injustice to an estimable writer whose fluent and industrious literary activity deserves a reasonable meed of praise , but not such eulogiums as these .

		A more possible comparison would be with
George	PERSON	114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, Sand , although the Spanish woman could not fairly be accorded more than a fractional measure of the distinction achieved by that prototype .

		This par - ticular version of the imagined history of the Dau - phin has a romantic atmosphere of hopeless unreality , and arouses only a languid sort of interest .

		The German watch-maker
Naundorff	ORGANIZATION	is the particular pretender whose claims are here espoused -- whether with real or only assumed seriousness we are unable tp say .

		He figures as a person of incredible suffer - ings and superhuman magnanimity , and the history of his fortunes fairly reeks with sentimentalism .

		The love interest is provided by his daughter -LRB- the image of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	-RRB- and a young French noble who woos her before he knows anything of her exalted lineage . ''

		Bembo : A Tale of
Italy	LOCATION	'' is the legend upon the title-page .

		To be more specific , we wUl say that the tale is of
Galeazzo Maria	PERSON	Sf orza , tyrant of MUan , who met a just death at the hands of three assassins the morning after
Christmas , 1476	DATE	.

		In its essence as a work of art , however , the tale is purely imaginative , for its central figure is a creature of the author 's own fancy , projected upon the background of renais - sance splendor and corruption .

		This figure is of a saintly chUd , a spiritual being all song and religious rapture , who journeys to the court of
Milan	LOCATION	charged with a self-imposed mission to preach the gospel of sweetness and light and love .

		Every student of renaissance history knows that the period was one of strange contradictions , of sensibility and bestiality conjoined , of mysticism and materialism , of indul - gence in the most violent passions and devotion to the most exalted ideals .

		It is , then , only one con - tradiction the more to find the child-rhapsodist of our author 's creation taken to the heart of the court which he comes to chide , and made the tyrant 's own confidant and minister .

		Under this gentle influence , saintliness becomes the fashion , and the most besotted lives exhibit tokens of grace .

		This condition of things does not last , of course , and the end is tragedy -- not merely the righteous tragedy of the despot 's taking-off , but the well-nigh intolerable tragedy of the child 's starvation in a dungeon .

		Mr.
Capes	PERSON	has produced in this moving and opulent work something that comes near to being a masterpiece .

		He has entered into the inmost spirit of the age , embodied its form and pressure in firmly-moulded types , and robed them in a garb of richly-embroidered diction .

		His style recalls , now that of
Browning	PERSON	, now that of Sir
George Meredith	PERSON	, yet we should be less than fair in describing it as imitative of anybody .

		And what a pleasure it is to come upon a new work of fiction that has style of any sort !

		To turn from this creation to Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's mechanical fabrication , `` The Flower of
France	LOCATION	, '' is to make a descent indeed .

		It is melancholy to contrast this version of the story of the
Maid of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	with what might have been wrought out of the same theme by the author of ''
Bembo	PERSON	. ''

		We need not waste much time upon a production that exhibits such appalling vulgarisms as `` won out '' and '' downed all opposition , '' and is cheaply senti - mental or sensational from first to last .

		Mr.
Mc	PERSON	-
Carthy	PERSON	bases his narrative chiefly upon Dom
Gregory	PERSON	's supposed paraphrase of Alain Chartier 's lost rhyming chronicle , and makes Lahire , next to the Maid herself , the most conspicuous figure in the romance .

		A clever woman who uses her talent perversely is about what we have learned to think of the writer who calls herself ''
Frank Danby	PERSON	. ''

		Her new novel is entitled '' The Sphinx 's Lawyer , '' and from its dedication to one who '' hates and loathes '' both book and subject , we are led to anticipate no very agreeable offering in the pages that follow .

		Not to put too fine a point upon the matter , the writer has sought , in the name of sentimentalism , which she prefers to call pity , to glorify the character of the late Oscar Wilde .

		This she attempts in a curiously original manner .

		In the book he is named
Algernon Hazeltine	PERSON	, but appears only as a memory .

		His life has ended in disgrace long before the novel begins , but a widow has been invented for him -LRB- the '' Sphinx '' of the title -RRB- , and a little coterie of de - voted friends who hold his memory sacred .

		Among these friends is the hero -LRB- if we may so style so sorry a specimen of humanity -RRB- of the present narrative , a lawyer by profession and a degenerate by nature .

		During the course of the novel , he is to a certain extent redeemed by the love of the pure and beau - tiful woman who becomes his wife , which seems to suggest as a moral the notion that no man can be quite hopelessly depraved .

		One does not often , even in the modern novel , find himself in company quite as disagreeable as that with which this book is peopled .

		Another novel of almost equally unpleasant char - acter is Miss
Edith Rickert	PERSON	's `` Folly . ''

		Thus appropriately named is the heroine , a woman who abandons her husband to spend with a lover of for - mer days the last months of his plague-stricken life .

		The lover is a poet , whereas the husband is only a country squire of stolid respectability , which we presume the writer holds a sufficient artistic justi - fication for the conduct of her heroine .

		So we are whisked away from
Surrey	LOCATION	to the obscure Spanish town where the poet has hidden himself in his mortal agony .

		After his death , Folly tries to patch up her shattered life by engaging in philanthropic activities , and in the end becomes reconciled to her deserted husband , who receives her with no word of reproach .

		This is one of those books that deliberately enlist our sympathies on the side of wrong-doing , yet maintain throughout a hypocritical pose in defence of morality , which assume that any aberration may be justified by passion and assured of a comfortable forgiveness after all is said and done .

		In `` The Sin of
George Warrener	PERSON	'' Miss Van Vorst depicts for us with remorseless truthfulness a type of woman who certainly exists , although for the honor of her sex we may hope that she is not of frequent occurrence .

		She is the woman of absolute selfishness , unconscious in her depravity because she
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 has no standards of thought or conduct , caring only for the tawdrj ' aspects of life , who finally drags her - self and her husband into the abyss of misery .

		In other words , the story is the old pitiful one of a poor woman 's effort to ape the ways of the wealthy , and of the sacrifices -LRB- merging into crime -RRB- made by her husband for the furtherance of her ignoble ambition .

		It is a hateful theme , and no touch of its sordidness and vulgarity has been spared us by the writer .

		This unflinching realism , combined with a certain forcefulness of presentation , impels a reluctant sort of admiration f '' r the book , despite a diction that is slovenly to the point of exasperation .

		By way of evidence that women 's novels are not always disagreeable , we have Mrs.
Hutchins Hap	PERSON	- good 's '' The Eternal Spring . ''

		Turning to this book from the three just described is like escaping from the malaria-laden atmosphere of a swamp to the pure air of the uplands .


Barry Carleton	PERSON	, having forsaken that '' aggregation of about two million more or less interesting and lawless citizens '' which is
Chioago	LOCATION	, goes to
Italy	LOCATION	for a period of relief from the nerve - racking life that he has been living .

		He seeks an old friend in a Florentine villa , a widow whom he had once loved and for whom he fancies himself to retain the old feeling , and receives a warm welcome .

		But the fancied love is soon replaced by a real one , for among the guests at the villa is a young woman who looks '' exactly like a
Lippo Lippi Madonna	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Lest the romantic consummation should be too quickly reached , the author casts a shadow over this joung woman 's life -- the terror of a possible hered - itarj - taint -- for she has been brought up to believe that her father had died insane .

		As a matter of fact , he had died as the result of a duel in defence of his outraged honor , and the pleasant invention of insanity had been devised by the selfish widow as a means of protecting her own reputation .

		When this is made clear to the heroine , the scruples that have halted her decision disappear , and she yields to
Carleton	PERSON	's solicitations .

		The story is told with fresh - ness and charm , in parts almost with distinction .

		The parts of the simple plot are nicely adjusted , and there is an effective dramatic climax in the scene that forces from the reluctant mother the unpala - table truth .


Helena Richie	PERSON	was a woman who claimed the right to happiness without taking account of the social cost .

		Selfish , not in the narrow sense , but in the broad sense which may be so plausibly defended , she had not learned the lesson that no one may live for himself alone without working mischief to society , and that personal happiness is too dearly bought at the cost of those principles of conduct upon which social welfare depends .

		Her awakening was to a realization of the implications of her self-regarding conduct , and to a sense of her guilt , with the conse - quence that her steps were at last directed to the stony path of penitence and renunciation .

		It is a story as old as Christian civilization -LRB- and older -RRB- , but it needs often to be told anew , and more than ever in such an age as ours , marked by moral flabbiness , and dangerously inclined to urge excuses for what - ever the individual finds it pleasant to do .

		It is a story that has seldom been told as appealingly and with such conscience-searching effect as in `` The Awakening of
Helena Richie	PERSON	, '' Mrs.
Deland	LOCATION	's latest and best novel .

		The scene is Old Chester , in which retreat Mrs.
Richie	PERSON	lives a secluded life , believed to be a widow .

		In point of fact , her husband is not dead , although he has been drinking himself into the grave for a dozen or more years .

		Moreover , the re - puted brother who makes her occasional visits is not her brother at all , but an old-time lover .

		The chief agency in her awakening is an orphan boy of Old Chester , whom she takes into her charge , and to whom she becomes passionately devoted .

		The awakening proceeds still further when she hears of the death of her dissolute husband , and discovers that her lover is disinclined to fulfil his old pledge of marriage , now that a legal union is made possible .

		The final stage of the awakening comes when her history is disclosed to the village clergyman and physician , and with the disclosure the startling knowledge that they no longer consider her a fit peison to have charge of the child .

		The pathos of the situation is now strained almost to the point of becoming intolerable , but her contrition is so genuine that she is at last permitted to take the child with her when she leaves Old Chester to seek a new home .

		This is the bare outline of a very beautiful and im - pressive story , made out of comparatively simple materials , but having in it the essence of spirituid tragedy .

		The child , with his quaint conceits and theological conundrums , is simply adorable , and the book exhibits no greater triimaph than that of his delineation .

		The depiction of the recalcitrant lover , also , is altogether admirable for its truth to life and its justice to his character .

		The clergyman , and the physician , too , are delightfully human and genuine .

		As for the erratic youth who takes his own life when he tiiscovers that his idol is of clay , we feel that he is a comparative failure , artistically speaking ; he arouses so little of our sympathy that his demise is hardly a cause for regret .

		Another woman 's novel , far above the average of excellence , a leisurely story written with singular nobility of temper and inspired by a very fine ideal of conduct , is '' The Invisible Bond , '' by Miss Kin - kead .

		It is a story of the
Kentucky	LOCATION	which the writer knows so well , of the society whose traditions of gentle breeding and honorable obligation have been her birthright .

		It is essentially the old story of a man and two women , the wrong woman whom he marries , and the right woman who is the true com - panion of his soul .

		But the situation involves us in no sophistical paltering with right .

		The man accept * the consequences of his mistake , not indeed without a struggle , for he is a human being , but with the conviction that the moral law is inexorable in its demand for the sacrifice of individual happiness .

		In the end , the death of the woman who has wronged him loosens '' the invisible bond , '' and he is free to follow the dictates of his desire .

		This sweet and 116 TUt DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, wholesome tale , although by no means devoid of dramatic excitement , has nevertheless a tranquiliz - ing effect upon the mind ; it seems somehow to have a life apart from the sickly everyday world , and to breathe an air of its own , pure and uninfected by the malaria of most current fiction .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's ''
Coniston	ORGANIZATION	'' is clearly marked for the distinction of a `` best seller , '' and , as such , is fated to suffer both extremes of injudicious criticism .

		The thoughtless section of the public , looking at the immediate vogue of such a novel , and finding that everyone is reading and talking about it , is sure to acclaim it as a masterpiece and praise it with an extravagant array of terms .

		Thoughtful but over - fastidious readers , on the other hand , outraged by such excessive laudation , are equally certain to ex - aggerate its defects , and visit it with too severe a condemnation .

		In a case like this , the middle course is the fair one , and a sober estimate will give the book due recognition for its idealism , its close obser - vation , and its genuine human interest , while not ignoring its incoherent structure , its superficial char - acterization , its long-windedness , its affected pose , and its slovenly diction .

		As popular fiction goes , ''
Coniston	ORGANIZATION	'' is certainly a story of remarkable effectiveness , and there is more of sincerity than of insincerity in the art by which the effects are reached .

		It is clearly a localized novel , based upon recogniz - able conditions and personalities ; but the author protests against being taken too literally , and has doubtless blurred many details in order that his picture might not be too definitely ascribed to a particular locality .

		Nevertheless , the average reader can hardly help fixing
New Hampshire	LOCATION	in his mind as the scene of action , and , if familiar with the political history of that commonwealth , will doubt - less be able to name the prototype of the political boss with whose career the story is chiefly concerned .

		The figure of
Jethro Bass	PERSON	is typical of the corrupt and masterful politician everywhere , and he is real - ized with singular vividness in these pages .

		As the leading figure in a popular novel , it was necessary that he should be sentimentalized , and this Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	has done , perhaps overdone .

		Jethro 's affection for his adopted daughter may be allowed as genuine , but his gnawings of remorse when he realizes her condemnation of his practices must be set down to the account of dramatic artifice rather than to that of creative characterization .

		And we are not exactly satisfied that the young woman 's happiness should result from a corrupt bargain be - tween the boss and the representative of the railway interests .

		The situation is cleverly managed , but it puts a severe strain upon our sympathies . ''

		In the Shadow , '' by Mr.
Henry C. Rowland	PERSON	, is a novel that opens in an English country house , then takes us to the island of
Hayti	LOCATION	, and eventually comes to a tragic ending in
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		This variety of stage-setting is made possible by the fortunes of one
Aristide Dessalines	PERSON	, a Haytian negro , who is the hero of the romance .

		He is a man of wealth and education , an Oxford student , something of a religious enthusiast , and a welcome guest in many English homes .

		His ambition is to become the leader of his people , and , when the time seems ripe for the effort , he equips himself for the enterprise , and makes an armed descent upon the Haytian coast .

		The enterprise failing , he becomes a fugitive , goes to
South Carolina	LOCATION	, hides in a swamp , and be - comes a victim of the negro-baiting mob .

		It W ^ ill be seen from this brief account that the story is not devoid of action , yet its chief interest , after all , is psychological .

		The author has given us a study of the negro mind and temperament , based upon the theory that he is by race incapable of real civilization , and that whatever external marks of civilization he may acquire are but the merest veneering of the primitive brute nature .

		This view is here presented in a form far too exaggerated to win the acceptance of any reader not hopelessly prejudiced in advance .

		We simply refuse to admit that the magnificent specimen of cultivated manhood who appears in the opening chapters can be one and the same person with the cowering wretch who makes his exit from the stage at the close of the book .

		The boy '' who has it in him '' is the subject and hero of Mr.
Richard Barry	PERSON	's ''
Sandy	PERSON	from the Sierras . ''

		At the age of twelve ,
Sandy	PERSON	throttles a black snake with his hands , and some score of years later he throttles an iniquitous political combina - tion and elects an honest man to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		These episodes delimit his career as far as recorded ; between them lies the boy 's varied experience as country school-teacher , newsboy , law - yer 's clerk , star reporter , amateur detective , and machine politician .


San Francisco	LOCATION	is the scene , and the author has a better command of journalistic slang than of literary English .

		There is a young woman involved , of course , and
Sandy	PERSON	wins her by an original plan of campaign .

		The never-ending procession of '' Zenda '' romances is now recruited by `` The Colonel of the Red Huz - zars , '' a romantic invention by Mr.
John Reed Scott	PERSON	.

		The Kingdom of
Valeria	PERSON	is the scene of the action , and is represented as a first-class power , instead of being tucked away among the convenient recesses of the
Balkans	LOCATION	.

		The princess is of the usual type , but the American hero has the advantage of actual kin - ship with the royal family , and does not have to depend for advancement upon an accidental facial resemblance or mere physical prowess .

		The open - hearted enthusiasm with which he is accepted , upon his arrival in
Valeria	LOCATION	, by both King and Princess , is really touching .

		He at once replaces the wicked heir presumptive in royal favor , and is made a colonel , a marshal , an archduke , and several other things without the least difficulty .

		The Princess is particularly generous , for the fact that she detects him in the act of placing a surreptitious kiss upon the cheek of the English ambassador 's fair daughter does not in the least check the ardor of her love .

		But the wicked heir presumptive has several cards up his sleeve , one of them being an American adventuress suborned to appear at the court of

		THE DIAL 117 eria and claim the hero for her husband .

		This makes trouble for a time , as do certain annoying attempts at assassination , but the villain is duly unmasked and discomfited .

		The adventuress is managed very ingeniously .

		As she pretends to be the archduke 's wife , he gives orders that , since her claim makes her a subject of the king , she shall not be permitted to leave the capital , and she appeals in vain to the good offices of the American ambassador to secure her freedom .

		Finally , there is an intimate inter - view between the adventuress and the heir presump - tive , of which the king , the archduke , and the princess are concealed witnesses .

		Thus does con - spiracy get its deserts and rirtue its reward .

		The story is a capital one of its kind .


William Morton Payne	PERSON	.

		Briefs ox Xett Books .

		Two book * on a timelu and vital tubject .

		In consequence of the unusual in - terest in insurance questions pro- duced by the revelations lately made concerning irregular management of some of the greater companies , a large popular literature on the subject is being brought into existence .

		There was already in printed form probably a more extensive set of authorities on the subject than on almost any other technical question of business , finance , or economics .

		This literature , however , consists largely of works of reference dealing with the subject from a mathematical or technical standpoint .

		Most of the additions which are now being made are of popular character intended for the instruction of the average man unlearned in higher mathematics or in the minuter details of finance and banking .

		Their value must be judged , therefore , very largely by the standard which the new movement has set up for itself .

		Examples of the recent effort to supply read - able material on life insurance are found in Mr.
Miles M. Dawson	PERSON	's '' ' The Business of Life Insur - ance '' -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- , and in the smaller volxmie `` How to Buy Life Insurance '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- by ' • Q. P. '' Both these books are intended for general informa - tion and not for the use of specialists , Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	's being written for '' the great public composed of persons , nearly all of whom purchase insurance on their lives '' ; while the other volume is written '' from the point of view of the policyholders , actual or prospective . ''

		Of the two books , Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	's -LRB- more than double the bulk of the companion work -RRB- goes far more thoroughly and scientifically into the subject in hand .

		He explains with much clearness the technical terms of life insurance , such as `` premium , '' `` surplus , '' `` reserve , '' `` loading , '' and the like , giving a systematic and careful analysis of the problems surrounding each of these features of the business .

		Very much the same ground is covered in '' How to Buy Life Insurance , '' but in a far less inclusive and thorough way .

		The latter volume includes some matter not given by -RSB- SIr .

		Daw - son , much of this being a kind of homily on the virtues of saving , with advice on how and when to save .

		The parting injunction of both books is em - phatically in favor of the purchase of life insurance as a means of protection , but not as a means of sav - ing .

		Both volumes unqualifiedly favor the plain and simple forms of life insurance , free of extraneous features intended to mislead the policyholder into the notion that he is getting much more than he put '' in .

		`` Straight life insurance , '' with dividends anno - ally declared and annually taken , are found to be far more favorable to the policyholder than any other type of protection .

		`` How to Buy Life In - surance , '' as a practical guide to the policyholder desirous of figuring out for himself the real cost of his insurance and of choosing between rival com - panies , ought to be found of substantial value by the busy man , because of the comparative tables and specimen blanks given in the appendix .

		These could be considerably improved upon in certain respects , but they are a distinct advance over what has been furnished by most other books on the sub - ject .

		It should be said of both these works that they hardly live up to the object they set before themselves .

		Both are at certain points unconsciously technical and obscure , requiring study in order to work out their meaning .

		This is particularly true of Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	's book , which in its later pages drifts very far away from the ideal set in its earlier chap - ters and evidently adopted by the author .

		It tends , in places , to become distinctly a specialist 's book .

		There is less to said on this score of `` How to Buy Life Insurance , '' but that work , nevertheless , as already suggested , must be found wanting in that it occasion - ally mistakes preaching for clear and plain exposition .

		It is not too much to say that both volumes will find a distinct place , and will be of service in educating the public to a better knowledge of a business whose nature has too long been misunderstood by the aver - age man , and which so readily lends itself to frauds and impositions upon the public .

		When a man has written a bo < A A Southemer ' t which , within three or four years of its first appearance , has passed into its fifteenth edition , it is safe to say that he can not write otherwise than interestingly , and that anything that comes from his pen is sure of a large and im - mediate reading . ''

		The End of an Era , '' which has earned the happy recognition just mentioned , was written from a wholly new point of view , and from it Mr.
John S. Wise	PERSON	has told a story of the Civil War as it unfolded itself before the eyes of a remarkably observant lad , who had the good fortune to be the son of one of the most eminent men of the
Virginia	LOCATION	of that day , and to be one of that immortal band of the cadets of the
Virginia Military Institute	ORGANIZATION	whose experience has never been paralleled in history .

		Many of the qualities which rendered '' The End of an Era '' so absorbing and so valuable , are to be found in Mr.
Wise	PERSON	's new book , '' Recollections of Thirteen Presidents '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, To these are added others which give to the con - servative reader a series of shocks not unlike those received from a too-close proximity to a • well-charged electric battery .

		To understand it fully one must have either from experience , or trustworthy hearsay , a large familiarity with the life of the Old Dominion , and the spirit which governed the men of a past generation , and one must understand a vast deal of the politics which have made possible such a change • in party affiliation as that to which Mr. Wise con - fesses .

		The book opens with a child 's recollections of an old friend and neighbor ,
John Tyler	PERSON	, in just defense of whose policy is given this passage : '' How can a man be a traitor to piincxples he nsTer es - poused ?

		Tyler never was a Whig .

		He never pretended to be anything but a Democrat .

		He was not nominated as a Whig , but as an Anti-Spoils Democrat , in coalition with Whigs and other disaffected Democrats , the object being to attract still other Democrats to the coalition in numbers sujfficient to defeat the organization Democrats who adrocated the doctrine ' To the Victors belong the Spoils . '

		... It was demanding too much of Tyler to insist that , upon other ques - tions about which he had never agreed with Whig doctrine , lie should abandon the convictions of a lifetime , and approve measures merely because General
Harrison	PERSON	, if he had lived , • would have registered the dictates of tiie Whig autocrat -- Clay . ''

		Because of a thousand things the chapter on
Jefferson Dayis	PERSON	is the most interesting in the book .

		Opinions concerning this man h9 , ve varied , and will vary , from those that regard him as the highest embodi - ment of all the South fought for in the heroic past , -4 o those of men in whose eyes he was a traitor sec - ond only to
Judas	LOCATION	, -- and it may well be that the historian of a dispassionate future may find in Mr.
Wise	PERSON	's sympathetic sketch of his '' Lost Leader '' some things which had otherwise not been known .

		It is certain that he strikes a true note when he says : '' It is all easy enough now to see that
the Nation	ORGANIZATION	is greater and more prosperous than either could possibly have been if two nations had been formed from it .

		But much of its great - -
Bess	PERSON	is the residt of the great war , and it would not have achieved it if the war had not happened .

		It is easy , too , to moralize now about the way the conflict might have been avoided but for the ambitious designs of this man or that , or this - set of men or that .

		Undoubtedly it might have been avoided if men had been angels .

		But the quarreling over the thin ^ that led to the war had gone on so long , and had been so acrimonious , that a good blood-letting was the only way to put an end to it . ''

		ft is hardly conceivable that any American can agree with all of Mr.
Wise	PERSON	's views of the men who have stood at the head of the Republic .

		To some of the opinions he sets down , it is to be devoutly hoped that he alone holds fast .

		The taste displayed is often a bit more than questionable , and there are many signs of hasty and ill-considered • wrriting .

		It can , however , never be called a dull book , or one lacking in a fine sense of patriotism .

		Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	's `` From a Cor - nish Window '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is not an imitation of Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's recent book of almost identical title , except that both books are reflective and discursive , and both authors are interested in poetry and philosophy and education .

		and are appreciative readers of Plato .

		The Cor - nishman 's volume is somewhat arbitrarily divided into twelve chapters named after the twelve months .

		Cornish matters , so far as treated at all , are more particularly discussed in ``
August	DATE	'' and `` Decem - ber '' ; the other chapters handle at random literature and life and politics and education .

		The writer 's unenthusiastic estimate of '' our modern bards of empire , '' whom he finds lacking in high seriousness and any recognition of the human soul , is to be noted with approval .

		In the sober month of
November	DATE	he indulges in reflections on this human soul 's ultimate destiny , but offers an argument for believing in its immortality which can hardly be taken seriously .

		Much as Othello declares to lago that he who is robbed without knowing it is not robbed at all , so Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	would have us all believe heartily in a future existence and get what comfort we can from the belief , since if we are cheated we shall never know it .

		This reasoning will be persuasive when irredeemable paper money circulates at par , but not before .

		A new view as to the essential ele - ment in poetry -- : or rather , perhaps , a restatement of
Emerson	LOCATION	's theory -- is contained in a discussion of Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's scanty yield of verse , so '' harsh and crabbed . ''

		Why , asks the essayist , do we reckon Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	a poet , and why do we place
Coleridge	PERSON	alongside of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	, yet feel no impropriety ?

		`` Because , '' he replies , ``
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Meredith	PERSON	both have a philosophy of life : and he who has a philosophy may write little or much .

		... Poetry -LRB- as I have been contending all my life -RRB- has one right background and one only : and that background is philosophy .

		You say
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Meredith	PERSON	are masculine .

		I ask , Why are they masculine ?

		The answer is , They have philosophy . ''

		Despite occasional dull pages in these random out - pourings , our popular story-teller '' Q '' is worth reading in his more serious moods .

		^ , A stout volume on '' Reconstruction Beconstruction in in
South Carolina	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
John S.	PERSON
South Carolina	LOCATION	.


Reynolds of the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	Lib - rary , comes to us from the
State Company	ORGANIZATION	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
S. C. Evidently	ORGANIZATION	interest in
South Carolina	LOCATION	history is not waning .

		The colonial and revolutionary his - tory of the
State	ORGANIZATION	has been thoroughly written by competent historians , there is at least one good ac - count of the
State	ORGANIZATION	before
1861	DATE	, and the present volume covers completely its political history from
1865	DATE	to
1877	DATE	.

		Beginning with a rather brief sketch of the provisional government set up by President
Johnson	PERSON	, the author next exhibits in detail the work - ings of the administrations of the `` carpetbagger '' Governor
Scott	PERSON	, of Governor
Moses	PERSON	the `` renegade secessionist , '' and of Governor
Chamberlain	PERSON	the '' re - form '' Republican .

		One chapter is devoted to the
Ku Klux	PERSON	trials , another to the disgusting story of the '' public frauds , '' and two chapters to the elec - tion of
Hampton	LOCATION	in
1876	DATE	, the bargain with the
Washington	LOCATION	administration , and the overthrow of the rule of the '' carpetbagger '' and the negro .

		Mr.
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119
Reynolds	PERSON	has unusual qualifications for writing the history of that chaotic period ; he was an observer - of much about which he writes , he knew many of the leaders of the opposing forces , and he is familiar with the periodical and pamphlet literature from which the history of the Reconstruction must largely be drawn - It is much to be regretted that he did not see fit to indicate for the benefit of other students the sources from which he drew his information .

		This defect is partiy remedied by the reprinting of numerous documents which are of value in throwing light on obscure conditions of the time .

		Another ■ objection to the writer 's method is that he packs his volume with lists of names most of which have no great significance .

		This , again , is offset by the numer - ous sketches of the local leaders of Reconstruction .

		Nowhere else can be obtained the information here found in regard to the character , motives , etc. , of the radical and democratic local politicians .

		Though the work is mainly political , there are pregnant para - graphs scattered throughout the book relating to the military rule , the '' Black Code , '' freak legislation , negro mUitia , educational matters , riots , election methods , tax payers ' conventions , and other social and economic matters .

		The printing is well done , but the index is inadequate .

		The writer 's temper is singularly placid , and , though he considers the * ' reform '' Governor
Chamberlain	PERSON	a hypocrite and fraud , he is at pains to point out the virtue * of a number of • * scalawags '' and '' carpetbaggers '' whose merits have heretofore been obscured by the faults of their fellows , and whose fate it has been to suffer for the misdeeds of others .

		THnitv Parish , ^ hc task Undertaken eight years ago iWrtr York , from by the venerable Rector of
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	J * J5 to is6i .

		Church ,
New York	LOCATION	, of editing the documentary history of his parish from the earliest times to the year
1862	DATE	and the beginning of his rectorate , is now completed .

		Part IV .

		of ' * A His - tory of the
Parish of Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	in the City of
New York	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- has appeared , and the set of four octavo volumes , beautifully printed and richly illustrated with photogravure portraits , views , and facsimiles of docimients , is not likely to be surpassed in outward appearance by any parochial history in
America	LOCATION	.

		The first three vol - umes received due notice in these columns as they successively appeared ; and were recognized as a contribution to colonial state , and municipal history , hardly less than to ecclesiastical , diocesan , and paro - ■ chial .

		The fourth volxmie is , however , more ex - clusively parochial than any of the others .

		If the purpose of the editor and compiler , as stated in his introductorj ' chapter , '' has been rather to present the material for a history , than to give a popular narrative , '' his purpose has been fulfilled .

		The pres - ent volume is made up chiefly of letters , of excerpts from the minutes of vestrj - meetings , of details of special services held in
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	; matters not lacking in antiquarian interest , but of littie interest to the general reader .

		The period covered by the
Arutipput of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		present volume extended from
1825	DATE	to
1862	DATE	, and in - cluded the rectorate of the Rev. Dr.
William Berrien	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	in those days was decidedly provincial , in striking contrast with its metropolitan character since
1876	DATE	.

		It is remarkable that in the early for - ties , under the conditions which then existed , the parish should have accepted as the design for a parish church building , and should have erected in accordance with that design , one of the few really good -LRB- architecturally -RRB- buildings in
America	LOCATION	.

		Yet of this important incident in parochial hiBtorj '' , as of some others , the notice taken in this volume is inadequate and disappointing .

		Some day the his - tory of this remarkable parish will be resumed to embrace the most brilliant period of all , -- the pres - ent rectorate , that of the distinguished editor of this series .

		In this latter period the parish has been engaged in far better things than pamphlet wars , and warding off repeated attacks upon its own integrity and that of its possessions ; and lias been wholly given to all good works .

		When the time shall come for the history of this period to be written , let us hope that the historian will go back over the con - tents of this fourth volume , and , using the material therein collated , wiU place it in its true historic perspective and in its proper relation to the times now present .

		Mr. A -
C. Benson	ORGANIZATION	's volume on Wal - ter Pater , in the `` English Men of Letters '' series -LRB- MacmUlan -RRB- , besides being a sympathetic study of a kindred spirit in literature , strikingly shows the infection that is so readily caught from any prolonged reading of the works of a pronounced stylist .

		This imitation , un - conscious no doubt , and hence the more sincerely complimentary - , is manifest on almost every page .

		We open the book literally at random , and at the top of the left-hand page read this , in criticism of * ' Apollo in
Picardy	LOCATION	'' : '' The study is full of beauty from end to end , beauty and strangeness side by side .

		Yet it is hard not to feel a sort of distem - pered , almost riotous , fancy at work under it all , and there is a cloistered horror about it that reminds one of the old monastic legend of the monk who goes late into the dark church to recover a volume that he had left there , and finds a strange merry thing , in the habit of a priest , leaping all alone in unholy mirth before the altar . ''

		But this Pateresque flavor makes the book all the more enjoyable to the lover of Pater .

		We regret , but are not surprised , that the biographer has found so littie , compara - tively , to say about his hero as a man and a human being ; nearly all that there is to record having to do with the writer and thinker .

		His works are taken up chronologically for brief description and criticism , and thus the mind and heart of our Cy - renaic philosopher are laid open to us .

		Sometimes we may refuse to endorse Jtlr .

		Benson 's opinion -- as when he deplores the introduction of alien epi - sodes in ''
Marius	PERSON	, '' since to him they have the effect of pictures hong upon tapestry -- but these com - 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	^ ments contribute to our entertainment and to the value of the book .

		The final chapter , `` Personal Characteristics , '' by including an account of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's mode of work and remarks on his literary style , manages to spin itself out to forty-three pages ; but one might wish that the author , largely dependent as he must be on others ' remembrances of Pater , had drawn more freely on Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	's recol - lections .

		On the whole , however , the book is to be counted among the best of this excellent series .

		British ^ ^ ^
Auckland Calvin	ORGANIZATION	's volume on `` The influence Making of Modern Egypt '' -LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		jg ^ review of English administration in
Egypt	LOCATION	beginning with the occupation in
1882	DATE	, first regarded as temporary , and ending with the conclusion of the Anglo-French Convention of
1904	DATE	by which
France	LOCATION	withdrew her opposition to English occupation of the country .

		It differs from
Lord Milner	PERSON	's '' England in
Egypt	LOCATION	'' in being more of a consecutive narrative of incidents , but at the same time lacks the brilliancy of style that characterizes
Lord Milner	PERSON	's essays .

		The narrative constitutes a story of splendid achievement , -- of financial chaos , administrative confusion , and industrial stagnation transformed into order , system , and progress .

		The story of this almost marvellous transformation is a remarkable tribute to the patience , sagacity , and perseverance of
Lord Cromer	PERSON	, who , almost alone of all his early associates and subordinates , still remains at the head of the Egyptian administration after twenty years of service .

		The secret of his success , says the author , has been , not so much his extraor - dinary capacity for labor , his patience , or his ad - ministrative skill , as his insight into native character and his sympathy with the Egyptian .

		He has habit - ually looked at all questions as much as possible from the point of view of the Egyptian himself , and consequently has been able to acquire a larger share of native confidence than is usually accorded a foreigner .

		Lord Lansdowne , in a recent tribute to
Lord Cromer	PERSON	, declared that under his guidance
Egypt	LOCATION	had advanced by rapid strides along the path of financial and material prosperity .

		Altogether he said there was no more remarkable episode in recent history than that which concerns the establishment and the gradual development of British influence in that country .

		, Mr.
Robert C. Witt	PERSON	's '' How to Look Art principleg _ , .

		„ i i - i i • t - `` defined for the at Pictures , first published in En - uninitiated .

		gland in
1902	DATE	, has now been long enough before the public to prove its value and to ensure a welcome for the American edition just issued by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		While it is true that the art of seeing pictures is not contained in rules or formulae , and that books alone can never teach aesthetic appreciation , nevertheless a book which takes up pictures from the craftsman 's point of view , so to speak , -- which describes some of the artistic principles of light and shade , composition , color , line , atmosphere , etc. , -- can not fail to illu - minate with a new light works of art which other - wise would remain obscure to the uninitiated .

		It is quite possible to look at famous pictures without seeing them ; to be conscious that some wonderful power lies hidden there , but not to know the charmed word to release it ; to be bored when we know we ought to be enchanted .

		But once attain even a slight knowledge of the means by which the great artists produce their effects , once become interested in the secrets of their beauty in form and color , -- and enjoyment is sure to follow hard upon under - standing .

		A book like this may and does help us in taking the first steps towards attaining the power to see pictures in the fullest sense of the word , -- the power to decide for ourselves which are the worthiest of our admiration .

		With growing powers of appreciation wUl arrive that whole-hearted en - joyment that gives painting , and indeed all art , its fascination for most of us .

		The suggestions and principles offered by continual references in the text to the world 's masterpieces are to be highly com - mended to the foreign traveller and to the student of pictures from their pictorial side rather than frocn their historical or archaeological interest .

		There are thirty-five full-page illustrations , covering the long stretch of time from
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	to
Whistler	LOCATION	and
Sargent	LOCATION	.

		Under the careful editorship of Pro- ?

		FS ' : ^ net f ```` `` or
F. H. Hodder	PERSON	, of
Kansas University	ORGANIZATION	, the series of interesting travel narratives issued by the
Arthur H. Clark Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		has been increased by the publication of '' Audubon 's Western Journal , '' which affords a most entertain - ing recital of just such experiences as most Forty - niners must have undergone in their overland journey to the far West , together with trustworthy comments upon natural featm-es of the country and social peculiarities that only the appreciative artistic or observant scientific eye could see .

		Although Mr.
Audubon	PERSON	intended his notes for publication , this is their first appearance in print , and we are grateful to Miss
Maria R. Audubon	PERSON	for the very excellent biographical memoir of her father which accompanies them .

		The introduction by Professor
Hodder	PERSON	is a clear , concise , and consequently valuable , outline of the course taken by Audubon and his adventurous gold-seeking companions , enriched by the writer 's extensive knowledge of the history and geography of the region through which the travellers passed .

		Without some such introduction the journal , although full of interest because of its incidents , reflections upon personal mishaps , and close observations , would lack historical perspective and the connecting links that make it now seem a continuous narrative in - stead of the chance jottings in a series of note-books .

		Some of the other features contributed by the editor are slight changes in spelling to conform to present - day usage , a first-class map to illustrate the direction of the journey , annotations here and there to explain obscure references , and a very comprehensive index .

		On the whole the volume leaves nothing to be wished for , either in the editor 's or the publisher 's field .

		L.H.D. , LL.D .

		For a great many years Professor
Peck	PERSON	has been a close and keen observer of the course of American politics .

		He has not only observed , but has preserved a wonderful mass of contemporary newspapers , cartoons , books , letters and other inter - esting memoranda .

		`` Twenty Years of the Republic , '' from the Cleveland-Blaine campaign of 18 '' l to the present day , is written in the spirit of a man who is giving rein to a favorite hobby .

		It reveals not only the wide and mature point of view of the trained scholar , but also the many little touches , the anecdotes , the i -RRB- ersonal peculiarities , the seemingly trivial incidents which go so far toward making history , but which are so easily and quickly forgotten .

		Such a history is very valuable , both now and in the future .

		It will charm the cursory reader , and be a book of importance to the student .

		Mr.

Dickens	ORGANIZATION	is intended as a general justification of that author , and of the whole of the gigantesque English humor of which he was the last and not the least gigantic survival .

		The author compared the immense achievement produced by the optimism of
Dickens	PERSON	in the realm of reform with the small results produced by the pessimistic methods of later days .

		He treats each of the novels in turn , and he devotes the latter iwirt of his book to a general estimate of the influence of

Thomson	ORGANIZATION	,
m.d.	LOCATION	, ll.d .

		The object of this book is to acquaint the general reader with the remarkable discoveries of modem physiological science , of the specific relations of certain areas on the surface of the brain to special mental functions , and to point out the direct bearing of these now scientifically demonstrated facts upon the great question , whether the brain is the source of thought or instead the instrument of the thinker , just as the hand is .

		It has been the aim of the author , both to steer clear of technical terms as far as possible , and equally so from all metaphysical discussions , for the subject deals only with a thing of physics -- the Brain .

		BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR .

		Again the deluge I The
summer	DATE	is over , and the wonter of the reviewer s discontent lies in the near future .

		The machinery of book - making is once more in full running order , and the long lists of announcements which we dis - close elsewhere bear witness to the touching confidence of the guild of authorship , and to the undaunted faith of the publishing profes - sion that somehow , somewhere , all these new books will find their purchasers , and possibly even their readers , in sufficient numbers to justify the cost attendant upon their produc - tion .

		As in past years , we now once more seek to indicate a few of the noteworthy books that are already well on their way toward pub - licity .

		We confine our attention to the depart - ments of biography , history , and beUetristic literature in general , making no attempt to illustrate the special categories that constitute the greater part of the entire list .

		There is no sort of book more satisfactory to the serious reader than a good biography .

		Given a life that is worth recording , and a treatment that is sympathetic without resorting to exaggei * ation of praise , the product of this reaction can hardly fail of success .

		It may fall far short of the ideal perfection of a
Boswell	PERSON	or a
Lockhart	LOCATION	, and still prove a cause of sin - cere gratitude to many readers .

		Among the works of this class at present heralded .

		Miss
Elizabeth Bisland	PERSON	's '' Life and Letters of
Laf	ORGANIZATION	- cadio Heani '' must surely take a high place .

		So romantic a career and so rich a jjersonality as
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's are not often to be found for treat - ment , and his letters will be certain to illumi - nate his books in many imexjjected ways .

		We may also look forward with much interest to Mrs.
PenneU	PERSON	's jwrtraiture of
Charles Godfrey Leland	PERSON	.

		Sir Henry Ir \ ` ing is the subject of two forthcoming biographies , one by his inti - mate business associate , Mr.
Bram Stoker	PERSON	, the other by Mr.
Percy Fitzgerald	PERSON	, that veteran chronicler of the English stage .

		We await with special interest Mr.
H. C. Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	's life of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, because we know something of the conscience and intelligence which for several years the author has brought to bear upon its 152 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, preparation .

		In the way of modem literary biography , no announcement is more promising than that of Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	's life of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	.

		This , we may be assured , will turn out to be a temperate and balanced study , free from the extravagances of
Whitmania	LOCATION	, yet fully conscious of the extraordinary vitality and vis - ion displayed in
Whitman	LOCATION	's work .

		Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	, who is to give us a
Dickens	PERSON	and a
Kingsley	LOCATION	, will entertain us if he does not in - struct .

		As examples of autobiography , we must single out the '' Reminiscences '' of Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	, and the '' Reminiscences of My Childhood and Youth , '' by Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	.

		We are particularly impressed by the unusual number of French memoirs included in the announcements of the present season .

		An inspection of our historical list empha - sizes more than ever before the fact that im - portant works of this class are published nowadays in instalments , whether they are in - dividual performances or coiSperative enter - prises .

		All that may now be done is to report progress upon works already in part before the public , and to note the beginnings of new under - takings .

		It seems that we are soon to welcome Part IV .

		of
Blok	ORGANIZATION	's '' History of the People of the
Netherlands	LOCATION	'' ; three volimies of the '' His - tory of

Andrew Lang	PERSON	's '' History of
Scotland	LOCATION	'' ; no less tlian six addi - tional volumes of '' The
American Nation	ORGANIZATION	, '' as edited by Professor
Hart	PERSON	; two new volumes of Mr.
Doyle	PERSON	's '' English Colonies in
America	LOCATION	'' ; and the second volume of Dr.
Hill	PERSON	's '' History of Diplomacy . ''

		Two new enterprises of special interest are '' A History of

F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	and Sig .


G. Tomassetti	PERSON	, and Sig .

		P. Molmenti 's '' History of
Venice	LOCATION	'' translated by Mr.
Horatio F. BrowTi	PERSON	.

		The category of literarj ^ history and miscel - lany offers us many titles , but few of outstanding importance .

		We may mention Professor Sey - mour 's '' Life in the Homeric Age '' and Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's '' Homer and His Age '' as an example of coincidence .

		We may also men - tion Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's '' Memories and Thoughts , '' the '' Letters Personal and
Liter	PERSON	- ary '' of ''
Owen Meredith	PERSON	, '' the `` Early Essays and Lectures '' of Canon
Sheehan	PERSON	, '' The Text of Shakespeare , '' by Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	, Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	's '' The Poetry and Philosophy of
George Meredith	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Herbert Paul	PERSON	's '' Stray Leaves , '' Professor
A. S. Cook	PERSON	's '' The Higher Study of English , '' Professor Gay ley 's '' The Plays of Our Forefathers , '' and the `` Addresses of John Hay . ''

		We also note with great sat - isfaction that the second volume of
M. Jusser	PERSON	- and 's '' Literary History of the English People '' is at last , after many vicissitudes , ready for English publication .

		From the hundreds of novels already an - nounced , most of which are likely to appear during the next few weeks , the task of selection is difficult .

		As far as it goes , the following list will be found fairly representative of the present-day activity in English fiction : '' Sophy of Kravonia , '' by `` Anthony Hope '' ; `` The Call of the Blood , '' by Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	; '' The Mirror of the Sea , '' by Mr.
Joseph Con	PERSON	- rad ; '' Sir
Nigel	PERSON	, '' by Dr.

F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	; '' The Amulet , '' by ''
Charles Egbert Craddock	PERSON	'' ; and ''
Bob Hampton	PERSON	of
Placer	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	.

		There is promise of entertainment , at least , in this selec - tion of books , although the best of them can hardly expect to be more than '' a novel of the year . ''

		Of far more lasting value , no doubt , is the translation of Senator Fogazzaro 's '' II Santo , '' a novel that has already attracted the attention of the intellectual world everywhere , and is now just ready for the American market .

		We wish that it were possible to close this prospectus with the promise of some good poetry , but we have scanned the lists in vain .

		We note one encouraging sign , however , the sign of a renewed attention to the poetic drama .

		An unnamed dramatic poem by Mr.
Stephen Phil	PERSON	- lips is to appear , and Mr.
Percy Mackaye	PERSON	, a
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 163 young American of considerable promise , is to give us a ''
Jeanne	PERSON	d' Arc '' and a '' Sappho and Phaon '' -- both works in verse , and both in - tended for actual performance .

		Any indication of a narrowing of the breach between closet drama and acting drama must be welcomed by aU who have the interests of the stage at heart .

		A PAGE FROM PASCAL .

		Among the manifestations of pure genius , not the least remarkable is the famous achievement of the boy
Pascal	PERSON	.

		Denied access to mathematical works until he should have well grounded himself in the lang ^ ges , the t `` elve-year-pld child was one day surprised by his father in the act of demonstrating , with the aid of a charcoal diagram on the floor of his play-room , the thirty-second proposition of the first book of Euclid -LRB- the exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of the two interior and opposite angles , and the three angles of a triangle together equal two right angles -RRB- .

		In secret , and in his hours of recreation , the boy had thought out the mathematical axioms , and had invented such terms and definitions as he required to push his geo - metrical researches to the point where he was caught eating of the forbidden fruit from the tree of knowledge .

		It is a familiar truth that the development of the individual is an epitome of the development of the race ; but most of us have this truth forced home rather by a humiliating sense of painfully working out the beast and letting the ape and tiger die , than by the proud consciousness of rapid intellectual pro- gress in early chddhood from aboriginal feebleness of mind to a Newtonian or Keplerian quickness of apprehension and power of reasoning .

		To travel unassisted , in a few years of chUdhood .

		the long path of man 's slow and arduous advance in mathematical science diuing some hundreds -LRB- or shall we say thous - ands ? -RRB-

		of centuries , was the astonishing performance of
Blaise Pascal	PERSON	; and the father 's sudden discovery of what his boy had achieved may well have sent him into those tearful raptures with which he hastened away to surprise and bewilder his old friend Le PaiUeur .

		Whether or not
Stephen Pascal	PERSON	and his friend were acquainted with
Plato	PERSON	, does not appear ; but had they been , they might have recognized in the lad 's early inclination a veritable Platonic yearn - ing for that knowledge which is '' the tiu ` ning round of a soul from darkness visible to the upward path of truth and being . '' ''

		This mathematical science , '' says
Socrates	PERSON	in the '' Republic , '' '' appears to me to he a study which leads naturally to reflection , and is of the kind which we are seeking , but has never been rightly used ; for it is really of use in drawing us toward being . ''

		And elsewhere : ''
Geometry	ORGANIZATION	will draw the soul toward truth , and create the spirit of philosophy ... '' All this is perhaps somewhat forced and fanciful , but to the age of
Descartes	LOCATION	and Spinoza it was a not unf amihar way of looking at mathema - tics ; and something like this Pythagorean belief in the mystic virtues of number and calculation seems really to have taken possession of the thoughtful child .

		Indeed , his sister , Madame P ^ rier , tells us -LRB- to use her very words -RRB- : '' Comme il trouvait dans cette science la v ^ rit ^ qu'il avait si ardenmient re - cherch ^ e , il en dtait si satisfait qu 'd y mettait son esprit tout entier . ''

		The significant fact , however , and to us the regret - table fact , in
Pascal	LOCATION	's development is that he so early gave over `` watering and nourishing the rational principle in his soul '' -LRB-
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's woi-ds once more -RRB- , and chose to ciu-b his reason , to consecrate his ener - gies to the cause of rehgion , to devote a part at least of his splendid intellectual powers to the sterilities of theological controversy , and by a harsh asceticism and rigorous self-discipline to bring to an early end the life that might have counted for so much more even than it now does coimt for in the history of human progress .

		Pure as were the motives that decided him , at the age of thirty-two , to join the
Solitaries of Port Royal	ORGANIZATION	, one can not but feel that there was something of intellectual recreancy in his thus seeking repose and safety for his soul to the suppression of his reasoning faculties .

		To be sure , every thoughtful person arrives sooner or later at the perplexing and humbling consciousness of the slippery elusiveness of truth in the grasp of reason .

		We learn , after baffling endeavors to prove the con - trary , that truth may lie neither in affirmation nor in denial , neither in the proof nor in the disproof of a proposition ; or , rather , it may lurk bewilderingly in both -- may , so to speak , enjoy a vigorous vitality in two mutually destructive statements of the case .

		As
Pascal	PERSON	himself says in the twenty-fourth chapter of his PensSes , `` There are , then , many religious and moral truths which seem repugnant , but which all have their place in an admirable order .

		The source of all heresies is the exclusion of some of these truths ... And it commonly happens that , unable to conceive the inter-relation of two opposing truths , and believing that the avowal of one carries with it the denial of the other , they -LSB- the heretics -RSB- adopt the one and exclude the other . ''

		Yet all this does not excuse the rationalist for giving up the fight .

		The boimds of the domain of thought are to be enlarged by him if by anyone .

		But in deploring
Pascal	PERSON	's early retirement to the quiet of the cloister , we must not overlodk the effect on his delicate organization of that narrow escape from a frightful death which probably hastened his relinquishment of worldly pursuits .

		It was but natural that he should ask himself whether the in - terests that had hitherto engrossed him were worthy of an immortal soul that had once been aroused to a sense of the stupendous mysteries of existence .

		At the same time , in devoting himself more to the things of faith than to those of reason hp - ` Hlade a curious attempt to silence the protests of the latter by devising a sort of mathematical demongtration of 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, the reasonableness of a belief in God .

		Either God is , he said , or He is not : human reason is powerless to determine which .

		Therefore nothing is left but to weigh the chances for and against .

		On which side shall I stake my fortunes ?

		But must I stake them at all ?

		Can not I put the question quite out of my thoughts ?

		No ; each act of mine implies a cer - tain solution of this unique problem .

		It is all too clear that I must act one way if there is a God , another way if there is not .

		Therefore I must lay my wager on one side or the other .

		Let us examine the conditions of the bet .

		In this game , as in every game of chance , there are two things to consider -- the degree of probability , and the magnitude of the risk .

		Since the question transcends reason alto - gether , we can affirm no more probability on one side than on the other ; hence the two probabilities may be held to cancel each other , and naught but the naked hazard remains .

		On one side we have the finite to lose , on the other the infinite to gain .

		But the finite , whatever its magnitude , is as nothing compared with the infinite .

		Then in reality we risk at the utmost only an infinitely small on the chance of gaining an infinitely great .

		The demonstration is conclusive , and we must lay our wager on the side of God 's existence .

		Curiously enough ,
Pascal	PERSON	, with all his logical acuteness , has here overlooked the fact that this demonstration proceeds on the gratui - tous assumption that a belief in God is necessary to our participation in the benefits accruing from His existence ; whereas it is just as conceivable that those benefits are bestowed on the faithless and faithful alike , even as the rain falls equally on the unjust and on the just .

		The issue of this struggle between worldly culture and ecclesiastical restraint is the less to be regretted for the fact that to it we probably owe the `` Pro- vincial Letters , '' which effected far more for French prose than did the author 's previous mathematical and physical researches accomplish for science , while at the same time these letters inflicted a castiga - tion on the Jesuits from which that order has not yet ceased to smart .

		Their wit and satire , even to - day , when the questions at issue are dead and buried , afford keen enjoyment .

		Besides the '' Letters , '' we owe to the Port Royal period the fi'agmentary Pensees , which are really preliminary notes for an intended vindication of Christianity .

		As the earlier work had been an assault on dogmatism , so the latter struck a blow against rationalism .

		Despite its lack of form and method , it made an impression when published , and still impresses .

		It is one of the books that demand a reading . ''

		You may not cease to be a skeptic after reading
Pascal	PERSON	, '' says Sainte-Beuve ; `` but you must cease to treat believers with con - tempt . ''

		Much beyond this the free-thinking reader will probably refuse to accompany Pascal . ''

		Drown your reason with holy water , '' he seems to command us , '' silence the voice of protest with masses , or perish with the beasts of the field . ''

		We reply , says one noted free-thinker ,
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, as the old Duchess of
Marlborough	LOCATION	replied to her doctor 's declaration that she must be blistered or die , -- `` I wo n't be blistered , and I wo n't die ! ''

		It is not unpleasant to note , in
Pascal	LOCATION	's last years , a brief falling from grace and a temporary yielding to the seductions of secular science .

		Dm ` ing a severe attack of toothache , which rendered sleep impossible , he amused himself with working out a certain prob - lem having to do with the properties of the cycloid .

		These frivolous midnight diversions he would have kept from the jjublic had not a friend persuaded him to let the mathematical world profit by his discovery .

		He accordingly offered a prize of sixty pistoles for the best solution of the problem ; but no competitor , in the judges ' ojiinion , showed himself worthy of the prize -- perhaps not having enjoyed the stimulus of a toothache .

		Those who are versed in such matters maintain that from
Pascal	LOCATION	's solution there was but a step to the dift ` erential calculus : so near did that toothache bring him to thinking the thoughts of
Newton	LOCATION	and
Leibnitz	PERSON	before them .

		Of the lessons to be learned from the life of this man who was from first to last so fascinated by the eternal riddle of existence , and who was in his per - son an incarnation of one of the everlasting antino - mies , one of the most important and most obvious is this : we do not see things as they really are unless we see them clothed in beauty -- as we long ago learned from high authority .

		Pascal 's morality was distorted .

		Turning morbidly ascetic , he hated inno - cent pleasures , viewed the natural impulses as sinful , inculcated a mode of life that would make celibate monks and nuns of us all , pushed delicacy to the extreme where it merges into pruriency , repulsed the love of sisters and friends as taking him from the service of a Being who , after all , may be in no crying need of human ministrations , consecrated poverty instead of seeking to lessen it , abandoned the intellectual pursuits for which he was so nobly gifted because the problems of science had nothing to do with the dogmas of theology , and as a fitting sequel to it all tortured himself into a premature grave . ''

		As he brings the heart into hopeless con - flict with reason , '' writes
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, who has already been quoted ; '' as he manages at once to exaggerate the baseness and the grandeur of human nature ; as he urges alternately with extraordinary keenness two aspects of truth , and is forced to make them contradictory instead of complementary ; as his moral position is on one side pure , elevating , and a standing rebuke to all the meaner tendencies of his generation , and yet , on the other , becomes mor - bid , perverse , and impracticable , because he has separated life into its incommensurable elements , -- - he leaves us not a final solution but a problem : How to form a system which shall throughout be reason - able and founded upon fact , and yet find due place and judicious guidance for the higher elements , which he has really perverted in the effort to exag - gerate their importance ? ''

		Thus the problem presented proves to be the same old problem that has for ages perplexed those who would be Greeks and Hebrews at one and the same
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 155 time , the problem that furnished
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	with the theme of his best-known book , the problem that baffles us to-day and wiU continue to puzzle and fascinate the thinkers of the world for many a long age to come .

		But perhaps the best of all that
Pascal	PERSON	has to offer us , and the mosrlikely to prove fruitful , is the picture he presents of an earnest soul fired with the passion for perfection .

		The grandeur and the pathos of this hopeless aspiration move us deeply .

		Probably more need the stimulus than the warning of his example ; for warning it unmistakably con - tains . ''

		Aspiring to be angels , men rebel . ''

		Aiming to be divine , they become less than human .

		Losing sight of the golden mean , departing from the Greek soimd-mindedness or temperance -LCB- sophrosune , to attempt a transliteration -RRB- , they commit all sorts of wild and foolish extravagances .

		And , curiously enough .

		Pascal stands convicted out of his own mouth , as might be shown by more than one citation .

		For a single instance , in chapter eight of the Pensees we read , '' C'est sortir de rhumanit ^ que de sortir du milieu : la grandeur de I ` ame humaine consiste a savoir s ' y tenir . ''

		The leading article in your issue of
September 1	DATE	, on '' The Edict of Oyster Bay , '' pleases me by the force and brilliancy of its presentation of the '' stand pat '' side of the spelling contest now raging .

		The writer quotas a passage from
Milton	LOCATION	which he assumes would be spoiled by changing his spelling of '' Sulphur , '' and adds : '' We must take no chances with Milton ! ''

		Must n't we ?

		Have n't we ?

		I have before me a photo - graphed facsimile of MUton 's handwriting , dated '' Jan ' y 10,1639 , '' and it contains this famous sentence : `` If vertue feeble were , Heaven it selfe would stoope to her . ''

		Would not The Dial '' take chances with

		I think it would take at least four chances .

		THE DUTY OF SCHOLARS TOWARD SPELLING REFORM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial. ; Allow me to thank you for your thoroughly sensible words on the ill-considered entrance of the President into the field of '' spelling reform . ''

		The five hundred most learned linguists and litterateurs of the English - speaking world , if it coidd be ascertained who they are and if they could agree among themselves , could not get the foUowing of the masses of educated men in any extensive and abrupt alterations of the natural current of linguistic evolution .

		How much less is such a fol - lowing to be expected for a self-constituted group of men only a small fraction of whom have any claim what - ever to exceptionally high standing in either of the fields of linguistics and literature ?

		The attempt to influence school boards to foist their arbitrary lists upon helpless children should be resisted with the utmost energy by every means at hand .

		These self-constituted reformers are powerless to introduce anything save disorder and additional labor , and all who are interested in keeping the language in the true path of gradual evolution , where it may yield automatically to the stimulus of the slowly improving taste of successive generations , should set themselves firmly against this unauthorized and impertinent interference .

		CESAR 'S `` THRASONICAL BRAG . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dl \ l. -RRB- When I was a boy I read in one of those school his - tories that shape the juvenile mind that
Julius Csesar	PERSON	announced to the Roman senate his victory over Phar - naces at Zela by the memorable concatenation of the alliterative phrase , '' Veni !

		Vidi !

		Vici ! ''


Richard Grant White	ORGANIZATION	got off a joke at the now current pronunciation of Latin , that it turns the majestic sonority of those high - sounding dissyllables into the faint utterance of '' wany , weedy , weaky , '' which is a poor brag .

		But however `` weaky '' this may sound , the Romans may have done what the Spaniards do in their strongly Latinish lan - guage : in their regiUar conjugations , except the one cor - responding to the Latin first , they accent in the first and third persons of the perfect tense the final syllable .

		Try it , and you restore the sonority .

		Then I found in '' As You Like It '' sarcastic
Rosalind	PERSON	dealt the conqueror a stroke , saying , '' TTiere was never anything so sudden but the fight of two rams , and
Caesar	PERSON	's thrasonical brag of ' I came , saw , and overcame . ' ''

		The great dramatist seems to have liked to refer to this phrase : not only is it in both
Latin	LOCATION	and English in the ridiculous letter of Armado in '' Love 's Labour Lost , '' but in '' Cymbeline '' the queen says proudly , '' A kind of conquest
Caesar	PERSON	made here , but made not here his brag of ' came ' and ' saw ' and ' overcame . ' ''

		De Quincey admires
Jidius Caesar	PERSON	, but contributes a rather contemptuous kick when he says of a later emperor , '' In one sentence of his dispatch , Aurelian aumed at a contest with the great
Julian	PERSON	gasconade of Veni-Vidi-Vici .

		His words aire , ' Fugavimus , obsedimus , cruciaoimus , occidimus .

		^ '' With such testimonies agadnst the great founder of the
Romain Empire	PERSON	, I let the imputation lie in mind without further thought , until one day when I suddenly said to myself , '' I know
Julius Caesar	PERSON	too well to believe that story : brag wais foreign to the habit and poUcy of the great soldier . ''

		1 thought of his History of the Gallic War , in which he tells of his blunders , -- for instance , the surprise by the
Nervii	LOCATION	, -- as coolly as if he were telling of Cyrus or Lysander of bygone centuries .

		How eaisy it woidd have been to comment on his own prompti - tude m rallying his forces , and his personal valor in taking sword and shield to fight in the ranks !

		And in the treatise on the Alexandrian War , published now as coming from him -LRB- probably made from his notes by Aulus Hirtius -RRB- , the battle of
Zela	PERSON	, the one saiid to have been annoimced so laconically , is not spoken of with any flourish of gratulation .

		Indeed ,
Colonel Dodge	ORGANIZATION	, in giv - ing a military elucidation of the mamceuvres of the battle , uses five times as mainy words as the historian does .

		Besides , considered ais something to convey news , the 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, so-called dispatch of three woi-ds would have been empty , absurd , even silly ; and Csesar never was silly .

		Who started the story ?

		Was it done by an ancient writer ?

		I observe that
Mommsen	PERSON	and most careful writers on Roman history do not speak of the words as a dispatch or official utterance .

		Canon
Liddell	PERSON	says , '' The victory gained by
Caesar	PERSON	was announced at
Rome	LOCATION	in the famous dispatch , '' etc. .

		Merivale rather dis - credits the story , saying , '' The boastful phrase in which , according to the story , the Arictor amiounced it to the senate . ''

		I turned to the ancients .

		Perhaps someone else may have found more than
I. Naturally	ORGANIZATION	, I turned to the profuse anecdotage of
Valerius Maximus	PERSON	; but in vain .

		Suetonius , great gatherer of gossip , tells us that when
Csesar	PERSON	had ended his wars he held five triumphs .

		He says , '' Among the pageantry of the Pontic triumph , a tablet with this inscription was carried before him -- Veni ,
Vidi	PERSON	,
Vici	PERSON	, -- not signifying , as did other mottoes , what was done , but the speed of the victory . ''

		Plutarch 's story implies a time for the origin of the phrase later than any possible dispatch : perhaps it arose in the familiarity of a conversation .

		Plutarch says , '' When he gave
Amantius	PERSON	, a friend of his at
Rome	LOCATION	, an account of the action , to express the promptness and rapidity of it he used three words -- I came and saw and conquered -- which having in Latin all the same cadence , carry with them a very suitable air of brevity . ''

		This evidently was before the triumph .

		Is this '' thrasonical brag '' or gasconade ?

		Plutarch speaks not of parade , but of an expression in friendly intercourse .

		Notice that whoever depreciates his ad - versary depreciates his victory , and removes his story from the realm of boasting .

		The boaster tells of the strength and valor of his opponent : the greater he makes the difficulty of his achievement , the greater he makes the courage , power , and persistence of himself as conqueror .

		If Csesar had set out to brag of liis suc - cess at Zela , he would have given as many details as in his story of the battle with Ariovistus , or have spread it out as
Bunyan	PERSON	enlarges on Christian 's sword-and - shield fight with ApoUyon .

		The brevity of the historical account in the Alexandrian War and the contemptuous brevity of the tliree words show that Csesar thought the thing hardly worth speaking of .

		But the passage from Siietonius -- what of that ?

		In that we see not Csesar the man as we know him else - where , Csesar the high-minded thinker and doer , but Caesar the politician and the head of the state .

		It was the duty of the general in a triumph to appear as the representative of the state and of its glory and power .

		He was officially a braggart , and must make the most of the occasion to please the populace .

		He was a the - atrical character , with face painted red .

		I can well conceive of Caesar as riding up the Capitoline Hill in a chariot , to dismount and offer sacrifice to a god in whom he did not believe , while saying to himself , '' What a bore this is !

		Five days of such vanity !

		What fools these Romans are !

		I prefer to be at my desk , but must yield to these throat-splitting , ear-rasping crowds ! ''

		Such a soliloquy represents to us the
Caesar	PERSON	that we know everywhere else , the man of business , too clear-sighted and great in spirit to overvalue his accomplished deeds , pushing toward his ends , evading and avoiding crowns on the Lupercal , that he might be the foremost man of all the world and found the Empire .

		The Story of a Broken IjIFE .

		* The life-story of that brilliant but erratic genius ,
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, whose sun of promise rose so bright and had so dire a setting , is presented to us in a handsome and dignified volume by Mr.
Robert Harborough Sherard	PERSON	, who , as he tells us , enjoyed the famous aesthete 's intimate friendship for sixteen years before the gloomy end of the unfortunate man 's meteoric course .

		Although the book is confessedly an apology or defense , and promises at the outset to refute many cal - umnies and to effect noteworthy results in clear - ing from the foul aspersions of malignity a name still dear to hundreds of faithful disciples , yet there is , fortunately , a wise avoidance of unsa - vory details regarding the events that clouded
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's closing years and led to his tragic end .

		His trial and imprisonment for an unnamable offense are , of course , involved in the narration , but are treated with commendable reserve , so that the merely prurient reader vnH find nothing in the book to pay for the trouble of perusal .

		Into this forbidding portion of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's life , which we feel has been made too much of already , we do not propose to go , only noting briefly the biogi'apher 's contention that the unhappy man was dealt with with needless hardness and sever - ity , owing in part to the popular clamor against him ; and that an understanding of '' the dismay - ing problem '' of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's conduct is to be sought in a study of his unfortunate heredity and in the occasional `` epileptiform fits '' which made him for the time being morally irresponsible and rendered him a more proper subject for restraint in an asylum than for the severities of a prison cell .

		In tracing
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's ancestry , and in noting therein the emergence of traits characteristic of the decadent poet , Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	has been indus - trious and has labored not in vain .

		A
Lombroso	PERSON	would welcome his findings as a contribution to pathological psychology .

		Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	's story of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's prison life is full of pathetic interest .

		Its chief significance for many readers will be found in the fact that it gave rise to what are perhaps the best of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's literary productions in prose and verse -- '' De Profmidis '' and '' The Ballad of Reading Gaol . ''

		Of the latter , the biographer well says that it would be worth while to go to jail to write so great a poem .

Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's poems , this and * The Life op Oscar Wilde .

		THE DIAL 157 the noble ode to
England	LOCATION	, `` Ave Imperatrix , '' seem most likely to give him a permanent place in English literatvire .

		Included in ^ Ir .

		Sherard 's account of the poet 's prison-life is a curious chap - ter which , we are asked to believe , was '' written by one of the warders in Reading Graol '' ; and , to make it still more convincing , a footnote adds that the express condition on which the chapter was contributed '' was that it should be printed exactly as it stood in the manuscript , with no al - teration of a single phrase or word or expression . ''

		Suspicion of even a comparatively innocent lit - erary fraud may be unworthy the high-minded critic , but svirely never turnkey wrote like this turnkey .

		In general style and vocabulary , and even in the details of pvmctuation and the use of capitals , the warders nari-ative approaches wondei-fidly near to Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	's ovra high standard .

		Let us quote a single paragraph , and then , non-committally , leave the matter for those to puzzle over who choose . ''

		His gentle smile of sweet serenity was something to remember .

		It must have been a smile like tbis that
Banyan	ORGANIZATION	wore as he lay in
Bedford Gaol	ORGANIZATION	dreaming his wonderful dreams .

		It must have been a similar smile that illumined the noble face of
St. Francis of Assisi	ORGANIZATION	when he spoke of ' his brother the wind and his sister the rain . ' ''

		Turning ^ rith relief from
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's later to his earlier life , we find in Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	's pages rather full biographical and psychological sketches of his parents -- the famous but somewhat coarse - natured
Dublin	LOCATION	surgeon Sir
William Wilde	PERSON	, and the brilliant but ill-balanced Lady
Jane Francesca Wilde	PERSON	, the ' • Speranza '' of contempo - raneous literary fame .

		Their second son , Oscar -LRB- whose full name has the high Celtic flavor of
Oscar Fingal O'Flaherty Wills Wdde	ORGANIZATION	, some of his college poems being signed with the startling array of initials ' •
O. F. O. F. W. W.	PERSON	'' -RRB- was bom in
Dublin	LOCATION	in
October , 1854	DATE	, and not , as stated in the ' • Dictionary of National Biog - raphy , '' in
1856	DATE	.

		The child was , says Mr.
Sher	PERSON	- ard , a disappointment to his eccentric mother because he was a boy , and '' for a long time after his birth he was treatetl as a girl , talked to as a girl , dressed as a girl . ''

		This injudicious early training extended through his boyhood , which was passed amidst the most luxurious and in - dulgent siuTOundings in the fashionable life of
Dublin	LOCATION	.

		As an example of the boy 's extrava - gant mode of life , his biographer says : '' He must , in his opulent days , have spent many hundred poimds a year in cabs .

		He used to take a cab by the day , and the first address he gave to the driver was a florist 's shop , where he fetched for himself a buttonhole flower costing half a guinea , and another costing half a crown for his cabman . ''

		It was probably this early fondness for button - hole flowers which later led to the exaggerated descriptions of his use of the sunflower and the lily as parts of his personal adornment .

		At the age of eleven the lad was sent to school at
Ennis	LOCATION	- kiUen , where , it is recorded , he made rapid pro- gress in some branches , but was a '' great dvmce in the mathematical class . ''

		He already '' showed that fondness for distinguished attire which ever marked him in life ... He was always very well dressed , and wore his hair long . ''

		At the age of seventeen he was sent to
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	, where he remained but a year , going then to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of his entrance into the great English imiversity , he says in * • De Profundis '' that * ' the two great turning-points in my life were when my father sent me to
Oxford	LOCATION	, and when society sent me to prison . ''

		The two events seem thus curiously related in
Wilde	LOCATION	's mind ; and this may perhaps account in a measure for the antipathy with which he was regarded by a portion of the British public .

		His biographer has some extraordinary comments on this point , from which we will print a few sentences . ''

		It is possible that when he wrote those lines he was tliinking that if he had never been sent to Oxford the extraordinary latent madness which had brought him to the terrible place where he sat might never have been roused into fatal activity .

		For there is no use denying it :
Oxford	LOCATION	, which is the finest school in the world for the highest ctilture , is also the worst training-ground for the lowest forms of debauchery ...
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	produces side by side the saint , the sage , and the depraved liber - tine .

		She sends men to Parnassus or the public house .

		... It is very possible that if Sir
William Wilde	PERSON	had not sent his second son to
Oxford	LOCATION	, but had left him in
Ireland	LOCATION	, where certain forms of perversion are unknown , Oscar would now be living in
Dublin	LOCATION	, one of the lights of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	, one of the glories of
Ireland	LOCATION	, a scholar and a gentleman of universal reputation ... The man who approaches the study of this extraordinary degeneration of character in a scientific spirit , and with - out bias , can not fail to feel the greatest suspicion that
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	was to a very large extent a victim of the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	educational system , of the Oxford environment . ''

		How much of exaggeration and how much of truth there may be in this biting arraignment is not for us to say .

		Passing quickly over the many interesting chapters regarding WQde 's Oxford life , we note the influence upon him of
John Ruskin	PERSON	, whom he heard in a course of lectures on Art at the vmiversity .

		Wdde '' soon began to show his taste for art and china , and his rooms were quite the show ones of the col - lege .

		... It was here that he made his well - known remark , ' Oh , woidd that I covdd live up to my blue china , ' '' -- a rather fatuous aspira - tion in the light of his subsequent disastrous fad - ore to live up to any standards in his private life .

		158 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, At
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	,
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	wrote poems that were published in various magazines , and thus entered upon that literary career which was to continue until his death .

		Going to
London	LOCATION	, he assumed that affectation of dress and manner , that stilted and absurd pose , which brought him into ridi - cule and contempt with the British public .

		But at the same time it brought him into notice ; and this Avas what the young man most desired .

		We are told that ''
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	has been heard to explain that the rea - son why he assumed that costume which it pleased him to describe as the ' festhetic costume ' was merely to attract attention to his personality .

		For months he had tried in vain to find a publisher for his collected poems , and having failed to do so because he was an unknown man , he determined to make himself known , and hit upon the device of appearing in public in an extraordinary dress .

		He adopted as the ' aesthetic cos - tume ' a velvet coat , knee-breeches , a loose shirt with a turn-down collar , and a floating tie of some unusual shade ; and he not imf requently appeared in public carry - ing in his hand a lily or a sunflower , which he used to con - template with expressions of the greatest admiration . ''

		Whether or not as a result of this masquerading ,
Wilde	PERSON	did succeed in finding a publisher for his poems , which appeared in a volume '' issued in the best style '' in
London	LOCATION	in
1881	DATE	.

		With all their faults , the marks of youth and immaturity , the poems showed unmistakable signs of origi - nality and strength ; it is seldom indeed that so much of merit is seen in a volume of poems by so young a man .

		The book was received with a curious mixture of jeers and praise by the reviewers , but was '' commercially a great suc - cess , '' and this '' pleased
Wilde	PERSON	very much , '' as he appears now to have been in very strait - ened financial circumstances , Avhich contrasted strangely with his early habits of reckless indul - gence .

		The volume was promptly reprinted in
America	LOCATION	, where it had rather more of a literary success than in
England	LOCATION	; and this fact , and the hope of making money by lecturing , seem to have led
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	to plan a trip to
America	LOCATION	, where he arrived late in the year
1881	DATE	.

		He came here with a fairly good reputation as a poet , and a rather vague one as '' the apostle of aestheticism '' which
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	himself probably did not take too seriously , his statement being that he came to expound `` a philososophy of art , '' and that '' aestheticism '' was to be taken as a '' study of truth in art . ''

		His first experience was in
Chickering Hall	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, where he lectured on '' The Renaissance . ''

		Again he was successful '' from a commercial point of view , '' as his biographer tells us ; and his success led to an arrangement with the well-known manager and celebrity-hvmter .

		Major Pond , for a series of lectures in the larger cities of this comitry and
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	's chapters on this episode in
Wilde	LOCATION	's life are full of interest , espe - cially for American readers .

		In
Boston	LOCATION	, where he went directly from
New York	LOCATION	, he had an amusing encounter with some
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	students , in which
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	seems to have had decidedly the best of it .

		Just before the lecture opened , the students , to the number of sixty , appeared in the hall dressed in an extravagant burlesque of the '' aisthete 's '' costume , each bearing a lily in his buttonhole and a huge sunflower in his hand , and paraded solemnly to the front seats that had been reserved for them in the crowded hall .

		The effect was of course ludicrous , but the joke lost something of its point when the lecturer ap - peared clad in conventional evening clothes , and proceeded with his lecture in apparent uncon - sciousness of the prank that had been attempted by the fun-loving students .

		From
Boston	LOCATION	,
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	made a long jump to
Omaha	LOCATION	, where he lectured on '' Decorative Art , '' startling his audience by denouncing American furniture as '' not honestly made , and out of character . ''

		His visits to
Denver	LOCATION	and
Louisville	LOCATION	are briefly noted , but it is surprising to find no mention at all of his trip to
California	LOCATION	, although this afforded some of the most interesting of his American experiences , and a memorable evening of '' high jinks '' given him by the
Bohemian Club	ORGANIZATION	in
San Francisco	LOCATION	is even yet spoken of as amons : the more notable entertainments in the history of that famous club .

		Returning from
California	LOCATION	, -- bringing with hmi the character - ization , which he used with considerable itera - tion , • • '
California	LOCATION	is beautiful , it is
Italy	LOCATION	without her art , '' -- Wilde stopped in
Chicago	LOCATION	, in the
spring of 1882	DATE	.

		Of his stay here , one inter - esting incident , relating to a since famous but then obscure artist -- the scidptor
Donoghue	PERSON	-- must be quoted from Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	's narrative . ''

		On his arrival in
Chicago	LOCATION	, he received a letter at his hotel from a young Irish sculptor who told him of the misery in which he was living , and begged him to come to the garret which was his studio and look at his work .

		Wilde set out directly for the address given , and after a hazardous excursion into the slums of
Chicago	LOCATION	found
John Douoghue	PERSON	's abode .

		He stayed vsdth him a long time , he praised his work , he comforted him , he told him the great consolation of V Art pour I ' Art , and he did not leave him without commissioning him to do a piece of work .

		The next evening ,
John Donoghue	PERSON	, sitting in the audience in the crowded lecture hall , sud - denly heard
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, in the course of his lecture , reproach the fashionable men and women who were listening to his words with the fact that a yoimg sculp - tor of imdoubted genius who was living in their midst was being allowed to die of hunger and neglect .

		He went on to describe his visit to
Donoghue	PERSON	's studio ; he
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 159 spoke of the beautiful things he had seen there , of the beautiful things this yoimg man could do , of the honor he could bring to the city of
Chicago	LOCATION	if only people would encourage his efforts .

		The consequence was that the next day
John Donoghue	PERSON	was everywhere discussed in
Chicago	LOCATION	; people flocked to his studio ; commissions poured in .


John Donoghue	PERSON	's artistic career was assured .

		He came to
Europe	LOCATION	, he studied , he prospered . ''

		Another ease in which
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	endeavored to help a desen-ing friend had a less happy ter - mination , though one not imusual , perhaps , in similar attempts to assist struggling but some - times peevish children of genius .

		The reference in this ca.se we take to be to the English poet
Kennell Rodd	PERSON	.

		Wilde made great efforts to find an American publisher for this young man 's poems , and at last succeeded , he himself writing a preface for the book .

		But when it ajipearetl , it represented such astonishing ideas of '' -LCB- esthetic decoration '' ' in its make-up that the author felt himself aggrieved , and , holding Wilde respon - sible .

		\ s-rote him a bitter letter putting an end to their friencLship .

		Wilde 's visit to
Walt Whitman	PERSON	is interest - ingly described . ''

		WUde was distressed by the poverty of
Walt Whit	PERSON	- man 's appearance , his shabby attire , and especially by the untidiness and squalor of the one room in which the American poet lived .

		The place was littered with great heaps of newspapers , strewn all over the room , and over them was so thick a coat of dust that it was im - possible for the visitor to find a clean spot where he could sit down .


Walt Whitman	PERSON	, primeval , natural , aboriginal , would feel little sympathv for the dandified Hellene . ''

		Wilde 's lecture-trip extended to the largest cities of
Canada	LOCATION	and
Xova Scotia	LOCATION	, from whence he returned to
New York	LOCATION	with a '' substantial sum of money '' as the residt of his year 's work in
America	LOCATION	.

		He soon went back to
London	LOCATION	, and not long after went to
Paris	LOCATION	, where consid - erable portions of his future life were passed , and where he died in poverty and obscurity , at the age of forty-six .

		Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	's account of this strange and broken life is fidl and inter - esting , although it suffers from the extravagant tone of eulogy and admiration which colors it throughout .

		It is to be taken , as we said at the outset , as a defense and an apology ; and taken thus , it well repays perusal .

		The volume is admirably printed , and is supplied with a good index ; while the bibliography , showing a surprising number of titles in pro.se and verse , Avith translations into French .

		German , Italian , Spanish , Russian , Swedish , and Polish , gives a new sense of the brilliancy of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's talents as a writer , mingled with regi-et and pity for his downfall as a man .

		The Evol , tjtiox or our Xatioxality .

		* Making a virtue of necessity , the earlier vol - umes of '' The American Nation '' series very suc - cessfully covered in short compass long periods of time : for the whole narrative history of the colonies , from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century , is contained in only six volumes .

		It is with joy that we now find , in what may be called the
second quarter	DATE	of this cooperative series , that to the same number of volumes is allotted the historj - of only those two genera - tions which extended from the Peace of
Paris	LOCATION	in
1763	DATE	to the close of the War of
1812	DATE	.

		In this way , each \ vTiter is allowed far greater opportunity for the elaboration of his subject , and those are pleased who regret to see anytliing overworked -- even a good book .

		There are certain general principles which one should always bear in mind when one wishes to understand and appreciate any work upon the Revolutionary epoch .

		The course of events indeed proved that separation from the mother country must be a condition precedent for the establishment of a national government .

		But for many years , in all the English colonies , there had been developing those habits of self-govern - ment and those principles of political action without which independence would have been vain and the document of
1787	DATE	a lifeless paper .

		At that time , moreover , the necessity of inde - pendence was by no means obvious .

		W hen we recall that in the early years all the colonists , and to the very end a large and respectable minority of them , professetl their belief that colonial life might still find ample expression within the British Empire , we are always eager for any new light which may explain how words of loyalty changed into deeds of war .

		Fuially , the degree to which the tendency towards unity , but little effective in the
seventeenth century	DATE	, had developed before
1787	DATE	, and the relative weight of it as contrasted with the provincial or state feeling , were matters of dispute , and the discussion has yielded groimd only through absorption into the larger question of State as against National sovereignty .

		160 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, veloped in the earlier volumes of this series .

		With '' The Preliminaries of the Revolution , '' the solution of the second and third problems is taken up by Professor
G. E. Howard	PERSON	.

		Prd - fessor
Howard	ORGANIZATION	reviews first the educative and unifying efPects of the French war , refers to the prophecies of independence made by foreign statesmen or by travellers in
America	LOCATION	, and then treats in considerable detail the topic about which there has been most disagreement among writers , that is , the influence as a cause of the
Revolution of England	ORGANIZATION	's commercial policy to - ward the colonies .

		The course of two centuries had developed a large body of laws , which were designed to regulate the economic activities of all parts of the empire .

		Allowing full weight to the argument that
England	LOCATION	's course was more enlightened and her code less severe than those of other nations .

		Professor
Howard	PERSON	nevertheless holds the view that '' the primary cause of the American Revolution must be sought in the character of the old colonial system . ''

		The author is thus led to a review of the commercial legislation of
England	LOCATION	, which , if it involves a repetition , in part , of matter found in previous volumes , justifies this by the clearness of the treatment .

		As one might expect in such a work , the discussion is largely external .

		The history of the system as it actually worked is still to be quarried from the manuscript archives of the colonies and from the materials in the
British Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	; and these two classes of sources seem to have been little used by Pro- fessor
Howard	PERSON	.

		Worthy of special notice is Professor How - ard 's handling of the law of
1764	DATE	, known as the '' Sugar Act . ''

		This statute , which Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	-LRB- for example -RRB- entirely neglected , links the parlia - mentary legislation of the Revolutionary period to the former code .

		A full realization of this reduces somewhat the cataclysmic importance usually ascribed to the Stamp Act , and shows that the latter aroused such violent opposition largely because its burdens were to fall upon a people already enraged and fearful of com - mercial ruin .

		The fall of
Grenville	PERSON	's ministry , the author remmds us , was i '' i no way due to the Stamp Act , nor did Rockingham himself at first consider it of prime importance .

		After discussing this topic and the unhappy inventions of
Charles Townshend	PERSON	, Professor
Howard	PERSON	turns aside to speak of the attempts to secure Anglican bishops in
America	LOCATION	.

		Another chapter tells of the settlement of the Western country , after which we are brought back to the narrative of constitutional and political development -- the Conunittees of Correspondence , and the coercive legislation of 1773-74 .

		With chapters upon the meeting of the first
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the appeal to arms , and the loyalist side of the argument , this volume comes to a close .

		The main causes of the Revolution , in the author 's mind , were economic and political , working throughout a long period of time ; but he stresses also the too much neglected side of social change . ''

		The conditions were favorable to the rise of a more united and a freer society in
America	LOCATION	; but this was hindered by the inertia of a colonial sys - tem which the American people had outgrown . ''

		Hardly any book in the series is more attrac - tively written than '' The American Revolution , '' by Professor
C. H. Van Tyne	PERSON	, which covers especially the years 1776-1783 .

		To recount merely the campaigns of the Revolution demands either large space or very careful condensation ; and the author has chosen and successfully exe - cuted the latter plan , reinforcing his text with maps and charts of peculiar excellence .

		By thus carefully compressing the story of battles and marches , Professor Van Tyne gains space for touches of personal description , -- as in the simple and impressive sketches of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Jefferson	PERSON	, -- and for summaries of arguments like that which he gives of Paine 's '' Common Sense . ''

		For his treatment of the loyalist posi - tion , Professor Van Tyne is able to draw on the results of his own special researches in that field .

		The intensity of party strife is much emphasized , as is also the importance of the diplomatic activities of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		One topic , it seems to us , is handled somewhat less skilfully .

		In neither this nor the succeeding volume do we find a worthy explanation of the establishment of the government under the Articles of Confederation .

		Perhaps this is due to faulty linking between books each of which has strong individuality .

		In contrast with this , only praise can be given to the thoroughness with which Professor Van
Tyne	PERSON	has worked over the story of the erection of the
State	ORGANIZATION	govern - ments .

		The result of this , in the author 's mind , is to establish the undoubted sovereignty of the States .

		He points out that the very federal activi - ties of the Congi-ess , so often brought forward to argue the residence of sovereignty in that body , on the contrary were so exercised as to show that the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	itsejf made no such pretense .

		This States-rights interpretation of Professor Van Tyne draws from the editor of the series the explanation that '' it is no part of the scheme of the series to adjust the conclusions of the individual writers to the editor 's frame of mind . ''


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 161 The conclusions of the next volume , '' The Confederation and the Constitution , '' are doubt - less more in accord with those of the editor ; for the author , Professor
A. C. McLaughlin	PERSON	, sympathizes with the nationalist sentiment of those early years , represented in the Conven - tion by such men as King and
Wilson	PERSON	.

		Of the doctrine of the indi \ ` isibility of sovereignty , out - line < l by Calhoim and accepted by most modem publicists .

		Professor
McLaughlin	PERSON	speaks some - what disrespectfully .

		* ' To discuss metaphysical sovereignty is to get lost in mazes of intangible argument and of more impalpable assertion . ''

		The last seven chapters of this book give , how - ever , the best general account that is now avail - able , in anything like the same space , of the Convention of
1787	DATE	and of the adoption of the Constitution by the States .

		Written with that freshness and firmness that come from direct and intimate contact with the sources , they shoidd make this volume a boon to students , especially to college classes .

		The first part of the work is taken up with the story of the negotiations for peace .

		To the course of the American commissioners in break - ing their instructions , the author gives a quali - fied approval , holding that '' while
Vergennes	LOCATION	was not altogether frank , and was considering the interests of
Spain	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, he was not deliberately , treacherously , and maliciously plotting , as has sometimes been charged , to cramp and belittle the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		As to the economic and social conditions of the times -- finance , commerce , paper money , and the
Shays Rebellion	ORGANIZATION	, -- Professor
McLaughlin	PERSON	's treatment is clear and fidl .

		To one point , not always emphasized , we must call attention -- the fact that when finances were at their worst and the governments in theii '' greatest exigencies , the people generally were rather prosperous than otherwise . '

		* The trouble was not poverty , but commercial confusion , vicious politics , and a natural disinclination to pay taxes . ''

		Against such human failings , even the influence of
Washington	LOCATION	woidd not avail .

		There are two chapters upon the development of the Western coimtry ; but they must now be passed by , and our appreciation of this excellent book must close with the quotation of a single paragraph , in which Professor
McLaughlin	PERSON	pre - sents the central thesis of the whole work . ''

		The political task that confronted the people when independence from
Great Britain	LOCATION	was declared was in its essence the same that had confronted the British ministry ten years before -- the task of imperial organiza - tion .


Britain	LOCATION	had been able to find no principles that snited the colonists or that in the long ran suited her - self .

		The learned
Mansfield	PERSON	or the faithful GrenviUe could do no more than assert the sovereignty of Parlia - ment and declare that all power rested at
Westminster	LOCATION	.

		The Americans were not content with this simple dec - laration of law ; they insisted on other rights , on an imperial order in which not all legislative power was gathered at the centre .

		AVhen at length independence came , when the colonies were states , and especially when the war was over , what was
America	LOCATION	to do ?

		Could the Americans , who had scolded
England	LOCATION	so roundly and broken away from her control , find imperial organi - zation themselves without giving up all they had con - tended for ?

		Could they reconcile local liberty with central authority and real unity ?

		The work was a momentous one , of great significance to mankind , and it must be done , if at all , by a distracted country emerg - ing from civil war . ''

		The next three volumes of the series describe the life of the
United States	LOCATION	under the Consti - tution to the administration of
James Monroe	PERSON	.

		The first of these is ' • The Federalist System , '' by Professor
J. S. Bassett	PERSON	, to whom , for this work , the
John Marshall Prize	ORGANIZATION	in
American History	ORGANIZATION	has recently been awarded by
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		For
Washington	LOCATION	's two administrations and the single term of
John Adams	PERSON	, Professor
Bassett	PERSON	has almost the same space at his command as that taken by Dr.
Schoider	PERSON	for the same period : but the book , while scholarly and inclusive , lacks somewhat the verve of Professor
McLaughlin	PERSON	's and Pro- fessor Channing 's volumes .

		The principal facts of these twelve years were the successful establishment of the government under the Constitution , the organization of the Republican party on the basis of popular gov - ernment , and the poKcy of neutrality in foreign affairs .


Hamilton	PERSON	for the first ,
Jefferson	PERSON	for the second ,
Washington	LOCATION	and
Adams	PERSON	for the third of these accomplishments , are the figures which at once become the chief actors in the drama .

		The whole epoch , indeed , brings out sharply , and often in a most unpleasant manner , the facts of personality .

		Before long the country was divided by faction , and the political billingsgate became so merciless that one is reminded of the expression of a colonial governor , -- `` If you throw enough mud , some of it will stick . ''

		But more important and enduring facts were the building of a wonderfid financial machine by the genius of the brilliant Secretary of the Treas - ury , the devious twists and turns of plots in the western and southwestern border , and the loom - ing up of the slavery question .

		To his discussion of these leading topics .

		Professor
Bassett	PERSON	adds chapters on '' The Republican Court , '' the state of society , and economic conditions .

		The latter 162 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, part of the book treats of the quarrel with
France	LOCATION	, the
Virginia	LOCATION	and
Kentucky Resolutions	ORGANIZATION	, and the fall of the Federalist party .

		Professor
Channing	PERSON	modestly refers to his book , '' The Jeffersonian System , '' as a '' sketch , '' and gracefully acknowledges Professor
Henry Adams	PERSON	's masterpiece as the foundation of it .

		But the source material is so much Professor
Channing	PERSON	's own , and the book is so pervaded with a humor just touched with cynicism , that this volume impresses one as more `` original '' than most of the series .

		While Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	may rejoice to have such a redactor , Professor Channing 's views are entirely indepen - dent , and indeed his criticisms constitute one of the most valuable features of the work .

		He tries to hold to a compromise point of view between Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's lack of sympathy and the opposite tendency of
Schouler	ORGANIZATION	's second volume .

		Some parts of the story , indeed , even Professor Channing hardly makes interesting ; the account of the Tripolitan war suggests a pious duty per - formed .

		But this is notably exceptional .

		The book opens with the scene at the inau - guration , '' doubly interesting , indeed , because probably in the whole country there could not have been found three men who more thoroughly detested and distrusted one another than
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	,
John Marshall	PERSON	, and
Aaron Burr	PERSON	. '' ''

		It would have been interesting to have heard what
Marshall	PERSON	said to himself as he held out the
Bible	LOCATION	on which
Jefferson	PERSON	swore to ' preserve , pro- tect and defend the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	. ' ''

		To
Jefferson	PERSON	, in the matter of removals from office .

		Professor Channing ascribes greater moderation than has sometimes been awarded him .

		Indeed , while no laudatory biography is attempted , the book is in a way a rehabilitation of
Jefferson	PERSON	-- `` an idealist , '' says Professor Channing , '' who was in politics from a sincere desire to save the nation from those whom he termed monocrats and monopolists . ''

		Of the measures of his presidency the piece de resistance was the
Louisiana Purchase	LOCATION	, the strange stroke of chance which caused or helped cause the volte-face of Federalists and Republi - cans , and which always reminds us of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's description , in the essay on the
Earl of Chatham	LOCATION	, of the two great English parties .

		When we find
John Breckenridge	PERSON	, who introduced
Jefferson	PERSON	's Kentucky Resolutions of
1798	DATE	, maintaining that foreign territory could actually be admitted into the Union as a State or any number of States by treaty , we feel that verily things were marching to the tune of '' The world turned upside down . ''

		Professor
Channing	PERSON	passes from the political and diplomatic sides of this main achievement of the third president to recall to us the influence of
Jefferson	PERSON	's scientific turn of mind , which led him to suggest and provide for the exploration of the new acquisitions .

		He then takes up slavery , the Chase impeachment , and
Jefferson	PERSON	's reelection .

		There follows a clear statement of what the author calls '' in its various ramifica - tions ... probably the most complicated his - torical problem in the annals of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		This , the
Yazoo	LOCATION	affair , of course brings to the front the unique figure of
John Randolph	PERSON	of
Roanoke	LOCATION	, whose ugly countenance and flash - ing invective stand out vividly in Professor Channing 's pages .

		In this chapter also is pointed out the beginning of that rift in the Republican party which left
Randolph	PERSON	in opposition to
Madi	PERSON	- son and to everything that
Madison	PERSON	wished .

		The next dramatic episode appeared in the mysterious conspiracy of
Aaron Burr	PERSON	.

		Here Professor
Channing	PERSON	has availed himself of Dr.
McCaleb	PERSON	's working-over of the materials , but he does not accept the latter 's conclusions in their entirety .

		He thinks that
Burr	PERSON	at one time did meditate the severance of the West from the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, and that his designs on
Mexico	LOCATION	were an opportunist variation of his plan .

		It is strange how many and how different men were concerned in one way or another with this discreditable affair , -- the eccentric
Blennerhassett	PERSON	, the im - suspecting
Jackson	PERSON	and Clay , the arch-deceiver
Wilkinson	PERSON	, who '' sold his alternate oaths to either throne , ''
John Marshall	PERSON	, with partisanship regrettably displayed , and lastly the irate Presi - dent , for once vexed out of his customary self - possession .

		The remaining eight chapters , which consti - tute somewhat less than half the book , are devoted to a thorough , clear , and interesting account of the causes of the War of
1812	DATE	.

		The influence of the wars in
Europe	LOCATION	upon the commerce of the
United States	LOCATION	, the principal neutral country , the commercial policy of the European nations at that day , the ideas that then prevailed as to citizenship , expatriation , search and impressment , the decisions of the prize courts , finally the mediocre character of the representatives sent to the
United States	LOCATION	by foreign powers -- all these points are taken up and explained .

		Then follows the narrative of the outrages which so incensed
America	LOCATION	, and of the continued attempts of the executive to avoid war .

		This topic is carried over into
Madison	PERSON	's admin - istration to the declaration of hostilities ,
June , 1812	DATE	, with chief emphasis upon the diplomatic side .

		In the opening chapters of President
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 163
Babcock	PERSON	's volume , '' The Rise of American Na - tionality , '' the same period is gone over again , but with more reference to internal politics .

		Party factions , as before , the American hunger to possess the Floridas , and the other problems of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	and
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	; the composi - tion of the new
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, called in extra session in
November , 1811	DATE	, and the sharp break with old traditions which the younger members brought about , -- these movements , and the last phases of unfortunate diplomacy , carry the reader to the beginning of the war .

		American accounts of the War of
1812	DATE	have often been marred by one or the other of two opposite evils : -- over-patriotic apology , or in - discriminate ridicule .

		From a scholarly writer of the present day we expect neither .

		Instead , President
Babcock	PERSON	gives three chapters to the war , one to the Canadian campaigns , one to the fighting at sea , and one to the coast campaigns .

		While not sparing ^ ^ go ^ o ^ Ls criticism , either of the government or of individuals , the author is upon the whole sympathetic , and endeavors to be just to everyone .

		The story of action is so calmly presented as sometimes to be cold ; the connection , for example , between the bombard - ment of
Fort McHenry	ORGANIZATION	and the hymn of
Francis Scott Key	PERSON	might at least be noticed .

		It is in the discussion of politics that the author is at his best .

		He has given considerable space to the lack of financial and moral support which characterized
New England	LOCATION	during the struggle , and to the disaffection which was most patently expressed in the
Hartford	LOCATION	Convention .

		The journal of the
Convention	ORGANIZATION	, when published , * ' was found to contain nothing treasonable , but it was always suspected that this journal reflected neither the temjjer nor the decisions of the con - vention . ''

		President
Babcock	PERSON	is of the opinion that the danger to the coimtry has been under - estimated . ''

		Had
Jackson	PERSON	been defeated at
New Orleans	LOCATION	, or had news of the failure of the nego - tiations at Ghent been received , the overthrow of the government at
Washington	LOCATION	and the establishment of a
New England	LOCATION	confederacy , and possibly an alliance with
Great Britain	LOCATION	, would seem to have
Ijeen	PERSON	ine ^ ` itable .

		The news of peace and of ^ • ictory saved
Madison	PERSON	, and per - haps the Union . ''

		After an interesting account of the peace negotiations , and of the treaty which decided practically none of the important issues on which the war was fought , the latter half of the book deals with the results of the war , -- of which we shall say more below .

		The closing chapters proceed with the further diplomatic business with
England	LOCATION	and with
Spain	LOCATION	, and finally the author siuns up the early work of
John Marshall	PERSON	as
Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	, emphasizing Mar - shall 's conversion of his associates to such an extent that '' if the court were Republicanized its practice became Federalized or perhaps Mar - shallize < l. '' Whether * ' the
United States	LOCATION	in full nationalism found itself , '' depends on the point of view ; certainly a fresh and important start was made towards nationalism ; but the fact was to be bitterly questioned in the years to come .

		If the problem of imperial organization was not yet finally solved , the war had nevertheless brought about mighty results .

		In its handling of these .

		Professor
Babcock	PERSON	's work can not be considered by itself , but must be regarded as the conclusion to the whole group which we have had under review ; while the results of the war must be looked at in the light of the whole preceding history .

		In his opening chapter , the author points out that all the quarter-century between the peace of
1783	DATE	and
Madison	PERSON	's inau - guration had only served to show that the
United States	LOCATION	had not become really independent of Euroj -RRB- e , because economically , if not politically , they were still in the position of a colonial sys - tem .

		From this embarrassing situation they were set free by the W ^ ar of
1812	DATE	, through which they attained '' an independence which was not merely recognized but respected , a sovereignty which was at once dynamic and efficient . ''

		After the war , the countrj ' suffered no more from the old irritations which had fixed her gaze upon the sea .

		The questions of neutral rights , impressments , etc. , faded into the backgrovmd . ''

		The new world was to be a domestic world .

		Its questions would be too big for the states to solve alone ; national settlement and national action would be re - quired on such issues as the currency , banking , the tariff , internal improvements , public lands , the extension of slavery , immigration and the development of the West ... All but unconsciously the nation at the close of the war heard and obeyed the call to face about . ''

		Into these questions of the future , the realign - ment of parties , the
Second Bank	ORGANIZATION	, the new tariff , westward migration and internal improvements , the succeeding chapters of this volume enter ; but these topics may with more propriety be considered in connection with their larger de - velopment in the volumes to follow .

		In conclud - ing our reriew of this group of fine volumes , we think it not out of order to express the hope that the last volimie of the series , which is ad - vertised to be a general index , may include an index to the bibliographical material appended to the several volumes .

		This will increase yet more the usefxdness of '' The American Nation '' series .

		164 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, A Brief Biography of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	.

		* '' English Men of Science '' is the general title of a series of small volumes , edited by Dr.
J. Reynolds Green	PERSON	, and published at a very mod - erate price .

		While they are larger and more elaborate than the '' Beacon Biographies '' of
Messrs. Small	ORGANIZATION	,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, they share with these -LRB- so far as the examples before us show -RRB- the good qualities of readability , reasonable brevity , and attractive form , together with an excellent portrait of the subject of the biography as a frontispiece .

		The appearance of a small work on
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	might not seem to call for special comment ; but when we learn that the author is Professor
J. Arthur Thomson	PERSON	, we look forward to a combination of wisdom and style which will remove it far from the multi - tude of horrid little pot-boUers ; and we are not disappointed .

		Just as Professor
Poulton	PERSON	's small volume on ''
Charles Darwin	PERSON	and the Theory of Natural Selection '' -LRB-
1896	DATE	-RRB- has had an influence quite out of proportion to its external preten - sions , so we may expect that
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	on
Spencer	PERSON	will long remain one of the most frequented sources of information about the English phi - losopher .

		It would be absurd to give a summary of a summary ; the more so , since the facts j ^ resented are not new .

		It will better serve the reader 's purpose to offer a few characteristic quotations , sufficient to show the flavor of the book .

		What could be more charming , and more true , than the following from the Introduction ? ''

		The story of
Spencer	PERSON	's life is neither eventful nor picturesque , but it commands the interest of all who admire faith , courage , and loyalty to an ideal .

		It is a story of plain living and high thinking , of one who , tliough vexed by an extremely nervous temperament , was as resolute as a Hebrew prophet in delivering his message .

		It is the story of a quiet servant of science , indifferent to conventional honors , careless about ' getting on , ' dis - liking controversy , sensationalism , and noise , trusting to the power of truth alone , that it must prevail . ''

		Another aspect of interest is that
Spencer	PERSON	was an arch-heretic , one of the flowers of nonconformity , against theology and against metaphysics , against monarchy and against molly-coddling legislation , against classical edu - cation and against socialism , against war and against
Weismann	PERSON	.

		So that we can hardly picture the man who has not some crow to pick with Spencer ... '' In an age of specialism he held up the banner of the
Unity of Science	ORGANIZATION	, and he actually completed , so far as he could complete , the great task of his life -- greater than most men have even dreamed of -- that of apply - ing the evolution-formula to everything knowable .

		He influenced thought so largely , he inspired so many dis - ciples , he left so many enduring works -- enduring as •

		seed-plots , if not also as achievements -- that his death , writ large , was immortality . ''

		It is characteristic of
Spencer	PERSON	, that his first bias in favor of Evolution was the result of read - ing the chapter in
Lyell	LOCATION	's '' Principles of Geo - logy '' devoted to a refutation of that doctrine .

		He did not perceive how it might have come about -LRB- those were pre-Darwinian days -RRB- , but it was clearly more congruous with the order of Nature than special creation , which he later characterized as '' a pseudo-idea '' -- a `` mere verbal hypothesis , '' meaningless even to those who professed to believe in it .

		Spencer 's ponderous Autobiography has been adversely criticised by those who are little com - petent to appreciate its meaning ; in the work before us we find what seems to be a juster estimate . ''

		Some one has called autobiography the least cred - ible form of fiction ; but that is not the impression which
Spencer	PERSON	's gives .

		His self-analysis is candid and con - tinuous ; he is always revealing his feet of clay , and that with a self-complacency which is unintelligible to those who do not understand the impersonal scientific mood which had become habitual to Spencer .

		He almost achieved the impossible , of looking at himself from the outside . ''

		Huxley wrote an autobiography in a score of pages , and he never wrote anything better ;
Spencer	PERSON	occupied over a thousand pages with his account of himself , and he never wrote anything worse .

		Dictated in outline in
1875	DATE	, it was elaborated piecemeal in small daily instal - ments , after the most serious of the many breakdowns in health had precluded more difficult work .

		Naturally enough , therefore , the Autobiography is often prolix and lacking in proportion , often slack in style , and , it must be confessed , tedious .

		Little details in a picture may be essential to the effective impression , but
Spencer	PERSON	often wearies us with trifling incidents whose narration has no excuse except as happening in a great life .

		Yet , if we lay the volimies aside , bored by their monumental egotism , we return to them vdth sympathy , and are won again by their imaffected frankness and candid sincerity . ''

		Using the Autobiography as a basis , but '' exercising the right of private judgment , '' Professor
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	proceeds to an analysis of
Spencer	PERSON	's character and work , -- his physical , intellectual , and emotional characteristics , his achievements and their effect upon mankind .

		All is so well presented , and is so significant in relation to the thought of our day , that one is tempted to class the book among the compara - tively small nimiber of those which '' everybody '' should read .

		THE DIAL 165 The Xew Order ix Finaxce .

		* Although the political campaign of
1896	DATE	is now a decade past , each year brings its group of new books upon finance .

		Very different in tone , however , are the books of the last few years from those that were issued in the days of the silver contest .

		Then , the battle raged about the question of the money stand - ard ; while the works now appearing deal with the principles and history of our financial system , and with proposed changes and reforms .

		The four books assigned for review in this article may be arranged under the division suggested above .

		Mr.
Conant	PERSON	's two-volume work upon `` The Principles of Money and Banking '' falls under the first caption .

		Professor
Wildman	PERSON	's `` Money Inflation in the
United States	LOCATION	, a Study in Social Pathology '' is classed as historical , and Professor
Cleveland	LOCATION	's `` The Bank and the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	'' and Mr.
Lawson	PERSON	's `` Frenzied Finance '' are forced into the category of reforms .

		The book on '' Frenzied Finance '' hardly belongs to a discussion of monetary subjects , for it is a polemic upon the doings of industrial corporations engaged in taking to themselves the resources of the earth .

		Coming in the same express packages with the others , and having now resided upon the shelves of the reviewer in the company of the three books first named , ' • Frenzied Finance '' is admitted into the privileges of review with the more dignified treatises upon phases of the money question .

		This concession may affect the '' rotundity '' of the article , but ''
Fren	PERSON	- zied Finance '' will be disposed of in the process .

		The largest of the books on money published for many a year is Mr.
Conant	PERSON	's '' Principles of Money and Banking . ''

		Filled to half of their bulk with quo - tations , the two volumes have the appearance , upon first glimpse , of being inflated ; yet a careful reading increases the admiration for the skill with which the well-selected quotations have been woven into the book .

		Like many writers , Mr.
Conant	PERSON	has accepted the definition of intrinsic value as the real test of a commodity money .

		By this limitation , a treatise on money would be confined to gold coin ; whereas popular usage invariably forces the consideration of other forms of currency .

		Indirectly , the author recognizes this fact by making a distinction between scientific and popular points of view .

		It is just this that determines the ability of the economist to come in touch with real industrial life .

		If the economist is to define economic tools in language that does not touch the facts , he never can come in close contact with the people .

		The definition selected by our author is the easiest way out of a difficult matter .

Seligman	PERSON	, in his recent `` Principles of Economics , '' uses the term `` money '' in the wide • The Pbikciples op Money axd Bajtkxsg .

		sense of popular usage -LRB- p. 451 -RRB- .

		The same prac - tically may be said of Professor
Kinley	PERSON	's definition -LRB- p. 70 `` Money '' -RRB- .

		Aside from the question of definition , the book proceeds to the discussion of money and banking principles with a clearness and breadth of view that is really refreshing in these days of marginal utilitj - .

		Here and there is to be noticed an antiquarian tendency to delve deep into the historical details of some ancient bank or money issue quite out of relation to the bigger principles of modem money and banking .

		In Volume I. , the chapters upon '' How Credit Influences the Value of Money , '' '' The Relation of Money to Prices , '' and the `` T > T -RRB- es of Currency Systems '' are valuable contributions to much discussed questions that show clearly the influence of an actual banking experience upon the application of theory to practice .

		The opening of the chapter upon the
Quantity Theory of Money	ORGANIZATION	gives the reader the impression that here at last we are getting somewhere in this quantitative discussion : but the chapter closed with distinct dis - appointment to at least one reader who stiU had the feeling that the real point had not been touched .

		The volume upon Banking is the best of the two .

		The chapters upon Credit , Cash Reserves , The Function of the Banker , The Influence of the Discount Rate , The Origin of Crises and the Management of Crises , are especially valuable .

		The reviewer does not wish to leave the impression that he is an ingrate , for he feels under great obligations to Mr.
Conant	PERSON	for his book .

		What was once scattered and almost unattain - able in small libraries has been brought together in an attractive , new , and forceful way , which leave * the professor of economics deeply indebted to the author .

		With Mr.
Wildman	PERSON	's book on '' Money Inflation , '' this review turns to an old phase of the money question under a new dress referred to by the author as psychological .

		It is the question of economic distress , its resultant influence upon the minds of the men who live in a community so affected , and the nature of the thought and legislation put forth by them as a remetly for the economic conditions .

		Professor
Wildman	PERSON	shows conclusively the close relation between economic conditions and the atti - tude of men toward monetary legislation ; but the use of the two introductory chapters on ''
Psycho	PERSON	- logical Basis of Popular Movements in General '' and ''
Particular Psychological Forces Effective	ORGANIZATION	in a Movement for Currency Legislation '' gives the reader the impression of a discovery in economics .

		The points emphasized by Professor
Wildman	PERSON	were strongly put by Professor Sumner in his ''
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	'' and `` Finances and Financiers of the American Revolution , '' and also by Professor Tur - ner in the '' Significance of the
Frontier	ORGANIZATION	in
American History	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Not that the author has not done well to repeat the positions of his predecessors , but that the force of the points made is likely to be lost in a too extensive use of psychological terms and in separating their treatment from the actual events dealt with so interestingly in the last seven chapters of the hook .

		166 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, In pointing out slowness of mind , undeveloped powers of analysis , as the reasons for acceptance of money fallacies by people of rural districts , Professor
Wildman	PERSON	places the authors of vituperation during the campaign of
1896	DATE	in an almost inexcusable posi - tion .

		When such unenlightenment exists , there is but one policy to follow -- that of education .

		On the other hand , Professor
Wildman	PERSON	has not over - looked the advocacy of a money fallacy because it was productive of gains to leading citizens .

		This fact is clearly shown in the issue of bank notes during the land speculation period -LRB- 1815-1840 -RRB- , and the opposition of the
Middle West	LOCATION	to the
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- ond
Bank of the United States	ORGANIZATION	.

		The continuance of a frontier in the
United States	LOCATION	meant that a con - siderable propoi ` tion of the population was isolated and likely to be affected by emotional tendencies , while the numbers under similar conditions created a solidarity of interest which in time took the form of a political movement and the demand for redress from the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		Willingness to yield on financial legislation has kept the
United States	LOCATION	in the boiling pot of money fallacy almost from the beginning .

		All this , and much more , has been clearly brought out in this book , which is well worthy of commendation to the inquiring student .

		The period of credit expansion is not limited to the days of wild-cat currency alone .

		Each decade sees it in some form .

		To-day the expansion of bank credits for speculative purposes has been repeatedly referred to in the comments and writings of bankers and trained observers .

		Increase of deposits through the medium of loans and discounts beyond the point of conservative banking is a matter of common occurrence in every large city .

		The third book in our present group is a protest against banking on inadequate capital and reserves .

		Professor
Cleveland	LOCATION	subjects the banking equipment to thorough analysis and criticism .

		In his opinion , too much of banking capital is tied up in slow assets , and too little atten - tion is paid to the maintenance of redemption equip - ment .

		The elasticity of note issue is a small question in these days of commercial paper , as compared with the elasticity of loans and discounts .

		In the words of Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	, a bank should have a cajiital equipment '' large enough to protect its credit and to meet all commercial demands of its customers for money without calling in its loans . ''

		In fact , it may be held that too much attention has been paid to the security of notes at the expense of soundness of bank credit .

		It is rather refreshing to note the courage with which this author accepts the American system as an outcome of evolution , and as especially adapted to American needs .

		He argues strongly against the present vicious system of helping the banks by Gov - ernment aid in periods of financial flurry , maintain - ing that the receipt of Government funds can not increase the elasticity of banking paper , since such fimds are soon absorbed in business .

		Instead of the
Independent Treasmy	ORGANIZATION	checking the national money supply , Mr.
Cleveland	LOCATION	holds to the opposite view .

		Not for a moment is the reader allowed to think that the system in the
United States	LOCATION	is a per - fect one , for the author devotes a number of chapters to reforms of the monetary system .

		Most authori - ties regard the Independent Treasmy as unsatisfac - tory and even dangerous .

		Professor
Cleveland	LOCATION	has at least raised the question of examining both sides of any proposal to establish central banks with branches .

		The use of the word '' system '' is about the only connecting link between the first three books and the last one considered in this article .

		But Mr.
Law	PERSON	- son 's system has no reference to the monetary system of the
United States	LOCATION	, but rather to that industrial system which has taken to itself the business of a great industry and out of the profits secured the control of railroads , insurance companies , and banks .

		The character of the book 's contents are known to most readers , so that any review of them to-day is unnecessary .

		However , it should be said that Mr.
Lawson	PERSON	's prediction came nearer to the truth than the most suspicious supposed .

		It is not always true that a man 's words are justified so thoroughly as those of Mr.
Lawson	PERSON	.

		The book is bombastic at times ; nevertheless it did a great service in pointing out so clearly the way the game was carried on .

		The story of his wonderful joui-ney across two continents , in the face of obstacles of every kind ; of the building and equipment of his boats ; of his voyage out into the unknown ; of his discov - ery of the American coast ; and of his death , worn out in the service of his adopted and ungrateful country , on the little island that now bears his name , is all admirably told by Miss Laut .

		She gives us a picture of the brave and tii-eless Dane that one would not willingly have missed .

		The story of Benyowsky , the Polish pirate , furnishes one of the most extraordinary incidents of a romantic period .

		Sent as an exUe to
Siberia	LOCATION	, he drew his fellow-prisoners into a plot to escape ; by a daring piece of forgery they were transferred to
Bolcheresk	LOCATION	, the capital of
Kamchatka	LOCATION	, as the most promising point from which to escape the country ; here arms and supplies were obtained and secreted , the fort was surprised by a clever ruse , a vessel seized , the Polish flag run up to the mast-head , and
Benyowsky	PERSON	and his wild crew set forth on a melodramatic voyage to the
South Seas	LOCATION	, or some equally vague destination .

		Benyowsky finally came to grief in a characteristically wild attempt to conquer Mada - gascar and set up an independent government .

		In telling the story of this engaging buccaneer , Miss Laut finds opportunity for a very interesting descrip - tion of Bolcheresk , its Cossack garrison and its extraordinary medley of squalor and luxury .

		From an historical point of view , perhaps the most valu - able chapter in the book is that which deals with the voyage of the ''
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	'' and
Robert Gray	PERSON	's discovery of the greatest river of the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast .

		The world was long ago made familiar with the explorations of
Drake	ORGANIZATION	,
Cook	PERSON	, and
Vancouver	LOCATION	, but little has been known , and less understood , of the exploits of the Bostonian navigator .

		Miss Laut has gathered together the scattered fragments , and out of them has woven a connected story .

		The useful - ness of her book has been heightened by the addition to each chapter of brief bibliographical references , and its attractiveness is increased by a number of weU-selected illustrations .

Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Government ^ ^ '
William B. Weeden	PERSON	, author of and the States '' War Government , Federal and in the Civil War .

		^ ^ ^ ^ „ -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , tells us that his book is a '' Study of the Interplay of the
National Union	ORGANIZATION	and the State Commonwealths '' during the CivU War .

		Four States --
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.


New York	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and
Indiana	LOCATION	-- are selected for the study .

		In nine chapters , the author discusses the problems , political , executive , and administrative , with which the
State	ORGANIZATION	and Federal authorities were confronted ; the conflict of
Federal and State	ORGANIZATION	activities ; the
Northern	LOCATION	opposition to the war ; the draft ; and the various mistakes and some of the good measures of the
Washington	LOCATION	authorities .

		The field is ah inter - esting one ; the author lived through the period of which he treats , and has had access to the records , published and unpublished ; but it can not be said that the work is a success .

		It brings out little that is new , and is not nearly so clear and satisfactory as Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	's briefer treatment of the same subjects .

		Mr.
AVeeden	PERSON	has several handicaps , chief among them being a lack of the historical attitude of mind .

		He begins with certain assumptions and goes on to prove certain theses , rejecting all that conflicts with his views , which appear to be those of the heat and passion of 1861-1865 as regards Northern Demo - crats , though he has forgiven the Southern '' rebel . ''

		In his opinion ,
the Union	ORGANIZATION	, or
American Nation	ORGANIZATION	, is not a thing of slow evolution , but dates even back of the
1789	DATE	beginning ; the theories of to-day are projected back of
1861	DATE	, and this is justified by say - ing that the Constitution of
1865	DATE	was the same as that of
1789	DATE	and therefore the
Union	ORGANIZATION	was the same , etc. .

		The author seems not to have the slightest con - ception of what was meant by the theories of
State Rights	ORGANIZATION	and Secession , and of the distinction between the two .

		To him , the views of
Calhoun	PERSON	and
Seymour	PERSON	were identical .

		Though widely read in political sci - ence , Mr.
Weeden	PERSON	seems to suffer from a certain vague-mindedness , an inability to grasp fundamental principles ; and in consequence his theories are con - fused and contradictory .

		In fact , he seems to have adopted as scientific principles the heated patriotic editorial arguments of the war time .

		As an old soldier , Mr.
Weeden	PERSON	has great respect for the '' rebels , '' but those '' abortive and mischievous crea - tures '' the Northern Democrats or `` copperheads '' -- how he despises them !

		The Radicals as com - pared with them , were , as he says , as `` Grabriel and
Michael	PERSON	arrayed against Satan and Moloch . ''

		Lincoln is criticised severely -- the old New En - gland criticism ; and while also praised , it is the praise of one who does not understand .

		The author believes that the patriotic enthusiasms of
1861	DATE	placed at
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's disposal resources with which he might have made a quick end of the war ; instead , the administration put on the dampers , and uselessly prolonged the struggle .

		Curiously enough , this is precisely the same criticism now directed against
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	by ex-Confederate wiseacres ; and one criticism is worth about as much as the other .

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	was working , in
1861	DATE	, with the light of
1861	DATE	, not of
1906	DATE	.

		The author 's dislike of those on the other side and his failure to appreciate their position , his inability to recognize and understand the principle of evolution in human affairs , and his twentieth century criticism of nineteenth cen - turj ' deeds , are defects that mar a work which otherwise might have been of considerable interest and value .

		168 THE DlAl ^ -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	^ The hioaraphv ^ ^ ^ `` ninety-nine years since
Montagu	PERSON	of a famous
Pennington	PERSON	, Mrs.
Carter	PERSON	's nephew bluestocking .

		g ^ jjd executor , published the `` Memoirs of the Life of Mrs.
Elizabeth Carter	PERSON	. ''

		This work , which must have been Miss
Alice C. C. Gaussen	PERSON	's chief source of information in writing her book , '' A Woman of Wit and Wisdom '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , is not men - tioned in the acknowledgments at the end of her preface .

		Her volume is handy and attractive , and shows evidences of zeal and industry ; and interest in the accomplished woman who first popularized
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	for English-speaking readers , and who was pronounced by
Johnson	PERSON	the best Greek scholar of his time , may be expected to win for the book a considerable number of readers .

		But whether Eliz - abeth
Carter	PERSON	's life was too uneventful to supply material for a volume of 250 pages , or whether her latest biographer has failed to make the most of the lady 's voluminous letters and other memorials , certain it is that '' A Woman of Wit and Wisdom '' contains passages remarkable for neither wisdom nor wit .

		Platitude and padding have not been excluded .

		In - accuracies have crept in .

		For example , we read that the
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	'' brought her in
1000	DATE	^ , '' and that it '' made her independent and enabled her to pass every winter in lodgings in Clarges Street . ''

		The translator 's receipts actually fell short of the amount here named , but even 1000 ^ is hardly an indepen - dent fortune .

		As a matter of fact , Mrs.
Elizabeth Montagu	PERSON	in
1775	DATE	settled an annuity of lOOZ .

		on her friend and fellow-bluestocking , and it is probable that Dr.
Carter	PERSON	provided also for his daughter at his death , as he had looked out for her in his lifetime .

		-LRB- Let it here be recalled that `` Mrs. '' in
Elizabeth Carter	PERSON	's case was a courtesy title only . -RRB-

		Among other matters for criticism may be noted Miss
Gaus	PERSON	- sen 's excessive praise of Xenophon as a general and a philosopher , in her comments on the
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	.

		After speaking on an early page of '' the mushroom growth of a new language filled with phrases which nobody could have understood when she -LSB- Mrs.
Carter	PERSON	-RSB- was young , '' the writer is guilty of the following , as faulty in syntax as it is objectionable in vocabulary : '' With grim humour he would allow an importunate fair one to pass , knowing that her farther progress was barred by a solid barrier of high seats that no persuasion could move , and that impeded by a train and veU it would be impossible to negotiate . ''

		We wish
Miss Gaussen	PERSON	had made it plain which house lived in by her heroine was known as the Vinegar Bottle .

		Good portraits enliven the volume , but no index consummates the whole .

		Freedom of the ^ he
Toppan	ORGANIZATION	prize of
Harvard Uni	ORGANIZATION	- eariv `` press in versity was awarded in
1897	DATE	to Mr.
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Qy , Je
Augustus Duniway	PERSON	for a mon - ograph entitled '' The Development of Freedom of the Press in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	. ''

		It is now reprinted in the series of '' Harvard Historical Studies '' -LRB- Long - mans ,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		After a preliminary chapter on the control of the press in
England	LOCATION	, the author trans - fers his investigations to
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and traces in chronological order the events which marked the decline of authority over the press in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		He shows that censorship was due primarily to the union of church and state , whereby the state assumed the task of suppressing heresies and seditions .

		That the Puritans in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	should adopt a censor - ship of the press , whUe disavowing the authority of the church , is attributed to the power of imitation and established custom . ''

		For the preventing of irregularities & abuse to the authority of this country by the printing presse '' was sufiicient warrant for controlling the printer -- a control which , however ^ was never enforced as rigidly in the colonies as in the mother country .

		A most interesting part of the study is that devoted to the numerous local contests - between the '' patriots '' and the colonial authorities in the inauguration of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		After the establishment of Independence , censorship was assumed by the state only in the protection of the individual from libel .

		Here the author traces the gradual changes in public sentiment which led ultimately to more tolerance of the press and to the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	libel law of
1827	DATE	.

		* ' The passage of this act , '' concludes Mr.
Duniway	PERSON	, '' marked the removal of the last substantial legal restriction upon the freedom of the press in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	. ''

		Abund - ant footnotes , with references and appendices , attest the scholarly investigation , the authoritativeness , and the excellence of this study of the early press in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		In '' How Ferns Grow '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- Miss ^ FernBook .


Margaret Slosson	PERSON	gives us the latest word concerning this most fascinat - ing group of flowerless plants .

		Miss Slosson argues , somewhat by way of apology , that since the frond or leaf of the fern plays so important apart in classi - fication and identification , it would seem well that the various stages along which the leaf comes to maturity , or perf ectness of form , were more minutely known .

		The growth referred to in the title has reference , accordingly , to the leaf alone , and '' How the fern frond grows '' would appear to have been a preferable inscription .

		The volume consists largely of illustrations -- full-page , sometimes double-page , plates , half-tone reproductions of photographs repr ^ senting more or less perfectly the fern-leaf 's progress toward completion .

		Eighteen species only , chosen from the flora of the northeastern
United States	LOCATION	, are thus delineated .

		The text in each case includes a formal description of the species concerned , a setting - f orth of the facts of distribution and synonymy , and such notes explanatory of the plates and figures as seem necessary to bring out the results of the investi - gation .

		Miss
Slosson	PERSON	has conscientiously followed her subject , and some of her discoveries no doubt thi'ow light upon the phy tology of the gi'oup -- upon the affinities of so-called genera , for instance , a subject on which any light is especially welcome .

		The work is , of course , almost purely technical , and makes but small appeal to the interest of the general reader .

		events , or life-stories of interesting personalities .

		Among these may be counted '' Doctor Quintard , Chaplain
C. S. A.	PERSON	and
Second Bishop of Tennessee	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		a small volume prepared by the Rev.
Arthur Howard NoU	PERSON	, and published by the Uni - versity Press of
Sewanee	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		The book contains a plain narrative of Dr.
Quintard	PERSON	's four years of very active service in the Confederate army -- a double activity , in fact , for the good doctor ministered both to the bodies of the soldiers as army surgeon and to their souls as chaplain , and in both capacities did most efficient service .

		He was , withal , an exceedingly attractive and lovable man , and was on terms of intimacjr with a large number of the generals and leading men of the Confederacy ; he is thus able to take his readers behind the scenes and show them both the personalities of the leaders and the condition of feeling in the South at different stages of the war .

		This is done only incidentally , but is the more valuable for this reason .

		The story of Dr.
Quintard	PERSON	's arduous and successful episcopal labors after the war .

		given in the two closing chap - ters of the book .

		wUl also prove interesting to other readers besides those of his own church .

		The cloudy architecture of the sky .

		Lovers of nature and of art will find a new field of exploration opened to them in Professor Clay don 's '' Qoud Studies '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Those who find aesthetic enjoy - ment in the beauty of form , light , and color of the heavens , or who seek to portray this element of the landscape with brush or pencU , will find here a scien - tific treatment that will widen the horizon of enjoy - ment and tend to bring accuracy and order where art is often weak and vague .

		A study of the clouds in our best art galleries wUl reveal the misconceptions under which many artists labor as to the architecture of the sky .

		Not only the nature-lover and the artist , but the meteorologist as well , will find much of value and interest in this book .

		The author employs the international code of cloud nomenclature , but urges its extension to include the manifold varieties that occur in nature , many of which he describes in his text .

		The book is illustrated with over sixtj - full-page plates , and contains practical suggestions for study - ing the sky and measuring the altitude of clouds , a valuable chapter on cloud-photography , and a bibli - ography .

		The Sources of
Tyndale	ORGANIZATION	's Version of the
Penta	ORGANIZATION	- teuch , '' by Mr.
John Roth well Slater	PERSON	, is a doctoral dissertation issued from
the University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author 's main conclusion is that Tyndale '' kept constantly before him the Hebrew text and Luther 's version , with the Septuagint and Vulgate within easy reach , and fragments of the Middle English archaisms running through his mind as he worked . ''

		A series of passages in seven parallel columns serves to bear out these contentions .

		The first volume of Mr.
Russell Sturgis	PERSON	's '' History of Architecture '' is nearing completion , and wiU be pub - lished in the early autumn by the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		An important feature of this work will be the careful study of the climatic influences on architecture and of the relation of the domestic to the monumental archi - tecture in various countries -- a field which has been somewhat neglected by architectural writers .

		The first volume will deal with the architecture of
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Western Asia	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	,
Etruria	LOCATION	, and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		An important new library edition of the works of
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	is an interesting autumn announcement of Messrs. Little ,

Sept. 16	DATE	, ANXOLTXCEMEXT IjIST OF FALL , BOOKS .

		Nearly 1700 titles of new books , representing about sixty American publishing houses , are given in the classified list below as the prospective output for the coming season .

		These announcement lists , carefully prepared from the earliest and most authentic sources especially for our pages , have for many years been a special feature of
The Dial	ORGANIZATION	; and their usefulness and interest , both to the book trade and the book public , have long been recognized in a way to justify the labor and space required for their presentation .

		They not only show at a glance what books are coming out in any depart - ment of literature , but make a complete showing of the principal publishing activity of the year .

		The present list is the largest , with one exception , we have ever presented ; indicating a healthy activity in the publishing trade .

		All the books entered are presumably new books -- new editions not being included unless having new form or matter ; and while no attempt has been made to include titles as titles merely , regardless of their significance or interest to our readers , yet it is believed that no really important book is missing from the list .

		Some of its more interesting features are conamented on in the leading editorial in this issue of The Dial .

		1906 -RSB- THE DIAL 1 '' 6 KEEPING UP WITH THE MAGAZINES without giving all one 's time to them is a task of ever-increasing difficulty .

		CThis is decidedly the magazine age .

		The number , variety , and high quality of our periodicals are nothing less than amazing .

		The master-minds of the world go to their making , -- the greatest of living thinkers , workers , story-tellers , poets , and artists .

		One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand .

		By limiting oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year , all but a very small portion of the field is overlooked .

		C.The only sensible plan is to buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the things one wants most to see .

		This plan has been made practicable by What 's in the Magazines , a monthly publication which renders the mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy every-day reader .

		Each issue presents a bird 's - eye view of the maga - zine-contents of the month , .

		with the aid of which one may gain in ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as though he had personally examined a copy of each .

		C .

		It is not a mere list of contents ; neither is it a complicated and confusing library index .

		Everything is arranged and classified , simply but exactly ; whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ - ers or merely looking out for good things in general , the arrangement is equally convenient .

		C .

		It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine - land , -- a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell ; and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person .

		We could fill A genuine inspiration .

BOSTON	LOCATION	190 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, KEEPING UP WITH THE MAGAZINES without giving all one 's time to them is a task of ever-increasing difficulty .

		CThis is decidedly the magazine age .

		The number , variety , and high quality of our periodicals are nothing less than amazing .

		The master-minds of the world go to their making , -- the greatest of living thinkers , workers , story-tellers , poets , and artists .

		One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand .

		By limiting oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year , all but a very small portion of the field is overlooked .

		C.The only sensible plan is to buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the things one wants most to see .

		This plan has been made practicable by What 's in the Magazines , a monthly publication which renders the mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy every-day reader .

		Each issue presents a bird 's - eye view of the maga - zine-contents of the month , with the aid of which one may gain in ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as though he had personally examined a copy of each .

		C .

		It is not a mere list of contents ; neither is it a complicated and confusing library index .

		Everything is arranged and classified , simply but exactly ; whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ - ers or merely looking out for good things in general , the arrangement is equally convenient .

		C .

		It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine - land , -- a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell ; and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person .

		We could fill many pages of A genuine inspiration .

		BRIEFER MENTION 212 NOTES 212 LIST OF NEW BOOK 212 '' ACCORDING TO MEREDITH . ''

		The above i.s the title of a singularly clever and well-written story published in a recent number of '' The Fortnightly Review , '' and based upon Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's suggestion , reported some two years ago in one of the
London	LOCATION	news - papers , to the effect that marriage for a limited period was among the possibilities of the future .

		Mrs.
Lowndes	PERSON	, the author of this story , was evidently horrified by the suggestion , and her fancy readily evoked a tragic situation made to arise from the literal application of such a plan of limited marital tenure .

		We are not now par - ticularly concerned with this startling proposi - tion , nor do we profess to understand why Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	made it , or with what qualifications it was advanced .

		We shoidd be inclinetl to regard it as a forecast rather than as a plea , although it is possible that Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's strong indi - vidualism and love of liberty may have led him to consider favorably so radical a transforma - tion of one of the most fimdamental of social relations .

		At all events , he is a man whose ideas must be reckoned with , even if they run counter to our dearest prejudices ; and we make free to borrow the title of the story , not for the purpose of taking up its special theme , but merely as a peg upon which to hang a few obser - vations upon Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's general attitude toward his feUow-men and the world in which they live .

		We have been led to this subject by i * eading Mr.
G. M. Trevelyan	PERSON	's extremely interesting little book on '' The Poetry and Philosophy of
George Meredith	PERSON	, '' which has come to our desk among the recent importations of the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		The writer belongs to the younger generation of thoughtfid Englishmen to whom Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's message , ignored by his con - temporaries , now comes as a vitalizing influence , and who are determined to repair the neglect which the poet 's fame has hitherto suffered .

		He writes as an enthusiast , although admiration does not often blind his judgment , and he ex - pounds the poet 's doctrine in an engaging man - ner , citing chapter and verse whenever needed to illustrate the points at issue .

		No one , we shoidd say , coidd fail to be interested by this sympathetic and intelligent exposition , and even 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, those who are well acquainted with the poet are likely to find it illuminating .

		Mr ,
Meredith	PERSON	is essentially a poet of the positive scientific spirit , of temperamental opti - mism , and of the joy of earth .

		We should really write
Earth	LOCATION	with a capital , as Mr.
Trev	PERSON	- elyan does ; for to this poet she is the spiritual mother , the source of all man 's strength , the true inspiration of all his highest endeavor . ''

		He builds the soaring spires , That sing his soul in stone -- of her he draws Though blind to her , by spelling at her laws , Her purest fires . ''

		Through him hath she exchanged For the gold harvest-robes , the mural crown , Her haggard quarry-features , and thick frown Where monsters ranged . ''

		And order , high discourse .

		And decency , than which is life less dear , She has of him : the lyre of language clear , Love 's tongue and source . ''

		Thus man repays to her his debt , and in close communion with her works out the secret pur - pose for which she created him .

		And in the end , if he has known and loved her aright , he may ask the question that really needs no answer : '' Into the breast that gives the rose Shall I with shuddering fall ? ''

		Clearly , this is no philosophy of despair , nor is it a philosophy of the sensual gratification which certain dull soids imagine to be all that woidd remain to us were we to part company with their metaphysical idols .

		The deepest wis - dom of Goethe is thus expressed anew for us : '' We do not get to any heaven by renouncing the Mother we
spring	DATE	from ; and when there is an eternal secret for us , it is best to believe that
Earth	LOCATION	knows , to keep near her , even in our ut - most aspirations . ''

		What truth and inspiration there is in this sentence , and in the following verses which may be taken as its complement I '' She can lead us , only she , Unto God 's footstool , whither she reaches .

		Loved , enjoyed her gifts must be ; Reverenced the truths she teaches . ''

		And foremost among those truths is the moral responsibility of the individual , the realization of the law that man must be '' Obedient to Nature , not her slave ; Her lord , if to her rigid laws he bows ; Her dust , if with his conscience he plays knave , And bids the Passions on the Pleasures browse . ''

		A nobler scorn of the life of self-indidgence has never been breathed , a finer lesson of the ethics of self-sacrifice has never been read , than comes to us in the song of
Camilla	LOCATION	, who in `` Vittoria '' is the mouthpiece through which
Mazzini	PERSON	speaks . ''

		Our life is but a little holding , lent To do a mighty labour .

		We are one With heaven and the stars when it is spent To serve God 's aim : else die we with the sun . ''

		This may fairly be set beside the austere message of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Super FlimiinaBabylonis , '' a poem also kindled at
Mazzini	ORGANIZATION	`` s altar .

		Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	sounds the note of exultant individualism , strong to achieve and equally strong to endure , in verses that remind us of
Henley	ORGANIZATION	's defiant challenge to adverse circum - stance . ''

		Ay , be we faithful to ourselves : despise Nought but the coward in us !

		That way lies The wisdom making passage through our slough .

		Am I not heard , my head to
Earth	LOCATION	shall bow ; Like her , shall wait to see , and seeing wait .

		Philosophy is Life 's one match for Fate . ''

		Of all cowardice , the most abject is that which tries to shuffle upon environment the responsi - bility for a man 's acts , and of all hypocrisy the most contemptible is that which would make of cowardice a virtue . ''

		I am not of those miserable males Who sniff at vice , and , daring not to snap , Do therefore hope for heaven .

		I take the hap Of all my deeds .

		The wind that fills my sails , Propels ; but I am helmsman .

		Am I wrecked ' ?

		I know the devil has sufficient weight To bear : I lay it not on him , or fate .

		Besides , he 's damned .

		That man I do suspect A coward , who would burden the poor deuce With what ensues from his own slipperiness . ''

		We may suffer for our follies , but we may also profit by them .

		Let us refrain , above all , from the folly of seeking forgetfulness as an anodyne for the pangs which come with memories of the past . ''

		If I drink oblivion of a day , So shorten I the stature of my soul . ''

		All experience is good , if only we know how to make use of it .

		Again we seem to hear the voice of Goethe . ''

		The inspired prophet of sanity , '' this is what Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	repeatedly calls our poet , happily quoting him to the effect that '' our civilization is founded in common sense , and it is the first condition of sanity to believe it . ''

		This principle is what saves him from being an extremist , and preserves his balance in all sorts of intellectual contortions .

		It is the solid cornerstone of his faith ; for faith , as Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	urges , is acceptance as well as hope -- acceptance of the unalterable laws of nature as science reveals them , no less than hope of a better future for the race , a future to be realized by the applica - tion of man 's intelligence to the hard conditions under which he lives .

		Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	will have none of the old antithesis between faith and reason , for he sees the credo quia impossihile
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 195 doctrine to be the nonsense that it is .

		There is legitimate scope for faith , no doubt , beyond the borderland of the realms which science has re - claimed by conquest ; but only a pseudo-faith will flout the dictates of reason , or seek to but - tress its soaring spires with the fantastic sup - ports of the unregulated imagination .

		Mean - while , beset by many dangers , and far from certain of its goal , life has to be lived , and we must adopt some sort of attitude toward it .

		Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's attitude is thus described in pictur - esque metaphor by this his latest critic : '' A wary but a cheerful and kindly Odysseus , he steers us , ' compact of what we are , between the ascetic rocks and the sensual whirlpools ' ; he can listen unboimd to every song of the Sirens , enraptured , but resolute by the rudder ; and the one-eyed Polyphemus of despair is left cheated and shouting after the white track of his departing vessel . ''

		THE ROOT IDEAS OF FICTION .

		The making of categories is one of the pet amuse - ments of philosophers , and it is rather astonishing to note the variety of their views as to the root ideas or essential facts of the universe .

		It might be worth while to apply their methods to Fiction , and , without any pretense at philosophic accxiracy , try to draw out the basic facts on which literature is founded , -- stop the kaleidoscope , as it were , and examine the few scraps of human experience out of which the colored confusion of fictional life is woven .

		The first root idea of Fiction , then , is Identity .

		Of course personality , in the wider sense , is a pre - dicate of everything in literature , from the lyrist 's strain of passion to the clashing figures of the dramatist or the more complex web of the narra - tive artist .

		All that happens must happen to or be caused by personality .

		But it is a more con - fined idea of personality -- the Me as opposed to the Not-Me -- which I refer to as Identity .

		Literature dallies with this fact in a hundred forms .

		Take the idea of twins , or what might be called divided personality .

		From Plautus to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and Molifere , and down the line , this idea has been a most prolific som-ce of plot and situation .

		The double or echoing personality is nature 's variant on the twin theme .

		Classic literatiu-e does not deal largely with such creations , but in the folk-poetry and wonder-fiction of the Middle Ages they are common enough .

		Spenser 's
Duessa	ORGANIZATION	is a false double of
Una	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dickens 's '' Tale of Two Cities '' and Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's `` My Double and How He Undid Me '' are two modern instances of the use of this theme .

		Then there is the idea of a double identity of the Soul -- of a shadow character capable of being projected , usually to plague the real one .

		Calderon 's
Embozado	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	's
William Wilson	PERSON	,
Stevenson	PERSON	's Dr.
Jeykll	PERSON	and Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	, are embodiments of this thought .

		A second phase of this root idea is the confusion of personality .

		This is identity in disguise -- as in acting , in girls masquerading a `` men , in people assuming some other character than their own .

		This set of situations has been a veritable gold - mine to poets and romance writers .


Charles Lamb	PERSON	complained that every one of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's come - dies has a girl-boy in it .

		But princesses attired as pages trip up and down the whole field of romance .

		Tasso and Spenser have women warriors who are only revealed when some imlucky stroke of a sword smites their helmets apart and lets the long hair ripple down .

		Edgar in ''
King Lear	PERSON	, '' and Hugo 's Tribonlet , are instances of disguise of character .

		The little play of ''
David Grarrick	PERSON	'' gives an ex - ample of a person acting a part , and in Peg Wof - fington we have a character assuming to be her own portrait .

		Again , there is the transference of personality , as in the legends of the
Were Wolf	LOCATION	, or in many witch-stories where those possessed persons turn themselves into cats or dogs .

		Reincarnation would seem to be a magnificent basis for plot , but I can recall only a few instances of it in literature --
Poe	PERSON	's '' Tale of the Ragged Mountains , '' and '' Phra the Phoenician '' of the younger Arnold among them .

		Even the epics and dramas of
India	LOCATION	deal but spar - ingly with this idea .

		The domination of personality , as in hypnotism , witchcraft , dealings with the devil , have gfiven a good many situations to literature .

		There is
Joseph Balselmo	PERSON	's relations to his mistress in
Dumas	LOCATION	, the trances of
Trilby	ORGANIZATION	, the ballad-stories of the revenges of witches on lovers or rivals ,
Faust	ORGANIZATION	's subjugation to Mephistopheles .

		The imposition of a false j -RRB- er - sonality is a great source of comic plot , as in the story of '' The Sleeper Awakened '' in '' The Arabian Nights , '' the
Christopher Sly	PERSON	framework of `` The Taming of the Shrew , '' and Moli ^ re 's '' M ^ decin
Malgrd Lui	PERSON	. ''

		In all these situations , the character changes , or seems to change , while the world i-emains the same .

		Essentially of the same kind are the plots which turn on rejuvenations -- obtaining the
Elixir of Youth	ORGANIZATION	, drinking of the
Fountain of Life	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		The suspension of personaUty , as in a long sleep , has given rise to some good plots .

		There are '' The Seven Sleepers of
Ephesus	LOCATION	'' and '' Rip Van Winkle . ''

		Here the character remains the same , whUe the world changes about it .

		Everlasting identity , as in the legend of the Wandering Jew , has exercised a deep spell on the hiunan mind , but it is not capable of much variation , though something of the same nature is bodied forth in the popular imaginations which describe Babarossa sitting clothed and armed in his rock cave ready to issue forth when his time shall come again , or
King Arthur	PERSON	in his temporary sleep at
Avillion	LOCATION	.

		The modern theories of heredity have brought forward the inheritance of character as a literary 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, subject .

		Ibsen 's '' Ghosts '' is the most pronounced embodiment of these theories .

		It may almost be said that every German novel is an educational treatise .

		Since ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	'' set the fashion , the Germans have hardly been able to write a novel which does not deal with the devel - opment of a character by training and environment .

		This subject is to them what the eternal theme of three -- husband , wife , and lover -- is to the French .

		Yet they derive it from the French , through
Rousseau	PERSON	and our old friend
Telemachus	PERSON	.

		Surprises , detections , unravelments , recognitions , revelations , -- all these have to do with identity .


Coleridge	PERSON	said that the Qi ^ dipus of Sophocles and '' Tom Jones '' had the best plots in the world .

		This is hardly so , but they both deal with revelations of identity .

		So do
Poe	PERSON	's detective stories , and the superb novels of
Wilkie Collins	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	has patented a plot of surprise which is mighty effective .

		There are more kinds of disguises of personality than one .

		There is the material disguise , as where Odysseus returns to
Penelope	PERSON	's court in the rags of a beggar ; or where
Rosalind	PERSON	sallies forth in doublet and hose .

		And there is the mental disgvuse of drunkenness or madness .

		Herakles is hilariously disguised in the Alcestis of
Euripides	LOCATION	.

		Falstaff goes through life in a disguise of sack , a dozen different characters peeping forth through the thick fumes that envelop him .

		The two most magnificent mad - men in literature are
Don Quixote	PERSON	and
King Lear	PERSON	, and it is a question whether they are not both of them more inspired than crazy .

		Intoxication is a kind of cheap exaltation , and the primitive races all consider a madman inspired .

		Personality at meridian , personality inspired , personality as genius , ought to be a fascinating theme for literature , and I can not recall that anybody has made much of a fist at it .

		Chateaubriand and
Lamartine	PERSON	and
George Sand	PERSON	were always attempting it , but their geniuses are weak-kneed and boneless creations .

		Poe has hints of this theme throughout his work , and in one or two of his stories quite hits the mark .

		A recent novel , `` The Divine Fire , '' does very well indeed .

		In real life , the inspirer of personality often takes a supposedly outward form .

		Numa has his Egeria ,
Socrates	PERSON	his Daemon .

		The idea of an
Egeria	ORGANIZATION	has taken firm root in the poetic mind , and it has been embodied for all time in
Dante	LOCATION	and
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	.

		The hero of one of Du
Maurier	PERSON	's novels has an Egeria in a lady from Mars who dictates novels and poems to him in his sleep .

		One can not say anything about the novels , but the poetry is atrocious .

		Character 's collusion with the Not-Me , or Person - ality vs. The World , is the root idea of many of the noblest masterpieces of literature .

		Wherever a noble dreamer or enthusiast shatters himself against the inexorable fact , this idea is at work .

		Prometheus ,
Hamlet	LOCATION	, the
Marquis of Posa	ORGANIZATION	,
Brand	ORGANIZATION	,
Shelley	PERSON	's cloud characters , Hugo 's Galley Slave , -- these and myriad other beings of the same blood testify to its power .

		Personality misunderstood , loneliness , misanthropy , - are other forms of the same theme .

		Shakespeare 's Timon ,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's Alceste ,
Byron	PERSON	's
Childe Harold	PERSON	, are figures of a kindred group .

		Personality in antithesis is a minor variant of this last type .

		Don
Quixote	PERSON	and
Sancho	PERSON	,
Walter Shandy	PERSON	and My Uncle Toby , give in little the idea of the heroic struggler and the resisting world .

		Evil identity , bad intellect dominant , is another type , and , after the group I have just named , is probably the most prominent in literature .

		lago ,
Richard	PERSON	,
Don Juan	PERSON	,
Mej	PERSON	^ histopheles , -- one could call an endless roll of these Satanic stars .

		Milton 's Lucifer is on the whole too noble to be named with them .

		He is a great and rebellious son of God , and belongs rather with Prometheus and Hamlet .

		Animal identity -- or , rather , the casting of human personalities into animals -- has been a great cause of good writing , from ^ sop and the Indian origi - nals of Pilpay tlirough the French beast-epic of Reynard the
Fox	ORGANIZATION	, down to the stories of Uncle Remus .

		• I do not know whether the reverse has ever been distinctively and definitely tried , -- I mean the clothing of beasts in men 's skins .

		Of course such a process is glimpsed at in almost every work of literature .

		We always have men resembling lions or wolves or foxes , and women who carry with them the stamp of tigers or antelopes or snakes .

		Lastly , we have intellect identifying itself with nature -- the human personality projecting itself into the world .

		This is the main source of mythologies and folk-lores .

		In older literature this projection was a definite one ; the god or nymph or naiad sat visibly enthi'oned on cloud or tree or wave .

		Modern landscapists , either in words or colors , have changed all that .

		They give a sense of identity or personality to ocean or desert or storm , but they do not embody these aspects of nature in human form .

		Theirs is a deeper and subtler manner of myth-making , but it is also more vague and uncertain .

		The poet or painter who uses it asks a great deal from the reader or spectator .

		This difference in method probably explains the preponderance of landscape in modern literature and our apparent greater enjoyment of natural aspects .

		The Greeks loved nature as much as we do , studied its appearances as deeply ; but when they brought it into art , they dealt with it in brief : their mythological figures were hieroglyphics -- a sort of shorthand which saved a great deal of writing .

		We have to use a cloud of words to give the same impressions .

		I have probably not touched upon half the ways in which the mysterious thing I have called Identity enters into Fiction .

		And 1 have not even named the other roots of Fiction whose innumerable runners send vigor and virtue up to build the great trunk and the commingling intricacies of branch and foli - age of the tree of Literature .

		As I conceive it , these other roots are Hunger , Love , and Death .

		Anyone who desires can easily take the clue of one or the other of these essential ideas and trace it through the maze of Fiction .

		THE DIAIi 197 COMMUNICA TION .

		ANOTHER PHASE OF THE `` SPELLING REFORM . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Your recent editorial article , with which I am in hearty sympathy , regarding the latest move in the '' re - form '' of our spelling , omits one phase which to my mind deserves attention .

		Careful examination of the three himdred words recently recommended by the President for modification shows that some of them , such as `` homonym , '' are already in common use by practically everyone ; a sixth of the words are technical or else rarely needed in the vocabulary of a man of ordinary culture ; seventy-four merely insist on - t for - ed to indicate the past tense of verbs , an extension of a change already accepted through custom in many similar words ; and a majority of the remainder suffer such changes as are insignificant in proportion to the blare of the announcements .

		But together with these '' reformed '' words , at least some of which everyone already uses , are for some reason included a number of words which , besides being distasteful to many -- am I not safe in saying to most ?

		-- people who have respect and feeling for the lan - guage , are also illogical and mischievously absurd . ''

		If , '' the argiiment seems to run , '' you spell ' dactyl , ' then you mvDit use ' thru , ' ' tho , ' ' thoro , ' and all the entire list . ''

		This is '' advancing abreast of popular sentiment '' with a vengeance !

		Usage in
America	LOCATION	probably has already decisively chosen '' honor , '' leaving to a few old-fashioned folk , and for peculiar shades of meaning , the vowel that still is pronoxmced in the last syllable ; but the monstrosities ' thru , ' ' tho , ' and their kin , are abortions from the mind of the zealot .

		I never knew a person to use these spellings unless he first had been indoctrinated by a missionary .

		I have failed in this part of the world , too , to find any '' popular sentiment '' demanding the abbreviated , or any other , spelling for '' hematin , '' `` colter , '' `` eponym , '' and `` etiology . ''

		Those who are so acute as to have discovered this '' popular sentiment '' should also have discovered that Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	and Professor
Skeat	PERSON	are not the only author - ities on the English language : other men , just as learned , just as conscientious , and just as sincere , are opposed to all this movement , which by some is irreverently called meddling .

		Where specialists and lovers of the language have not yet found an agreement , it would at least be modest for mere money and power delegated for other purposes to refrain awhile from casting their '' slight weight '' with either side .

		Everyone who has attended a meeting of spelling reformers has found it inspired and conducted by men who show every evidence of being consecrated to a '' cause . ''

		They speak of this and that '' step in the programme '' -- may I indulge in the luxury of a final - me once more before it is forbidden ?

		-- as if every move were advancing a definite and thoroughly conceived propaganda .

		This seems to begin with the fostering of a movement to secure a uniform system of phonetic nota - tion for dictionaries and language books , which , every - one agrees , is much to be desired .

		But so far , after many attempts and years of study and discussion , the learned societies of this country and of
England	LOCATION	have not been able to invent such a system that is generally acceptable .

		To secure this system of phonetic notation seems to be the first step , the second -- but by what logic it appeareth not -- being the '' reforming '' of the much-discussed twelve words .

		How far the propa - gandists see , and plan to lead us , apparently is disclosed more and more each year . ''

		Accept this insignificant change , '' they plead or urge or bully , -- for , by another inexplicable connection , to withstand is to be denounced as an enemy to progress and democracy of all kinds ; but accept them on your peril .

		Agree to drop the '' e '' in '' abridgement , '' and you are heralded as a reformer ; moreover , like the good-natured chess-player , by accom - modatingly yielding a pawn you find yourself committed to a well-planned campaign -- I see they have so far left us the `` g '' -- that ends only with the loss of the game .

		So long as this is the attitude of the enemy -- enemy not of us personally but of the venerable mother-tongue -- we must not only admit , but even emphasize , that , as the '' reformers '' have asserted , there is a '' moral question '' at stake in the matter , but it is not perhaps the one they at the time had in mind .

Hans Breitmann	PERSON	' and ' Romany Rye . ''

		*
Three and a half years ago	DATE	, after a long life spent in going to and fro in the earth , in meeting with all sorts of adventures , in making all sorts of acquaintances , in searching after divers kinds of rare and out-of-the-way knowledge , and in writing more than half a hundred books on widely varied subjects , not to mention a midti - tude of shorter pieces ,
Charles Godfrey Leland	PERSON	set out on the greatest of all conceivable adven - tures , the `` Adventure into the Unknown . ''

		But though he has departed -- vanished into the ''
Ewigkeit	PERSON	`` of his own ''
Hans Breitmann	PERSON	's Barty '' -- he has left not a few warm friends and admirers to keep his memory green ; among whom attention is now called to his niece , Mrs.
Elizabeth Robins Pennell	PERSON	, by the appearance of her two - volume biography of her uncle .

		Having enjoyed during her adult years a very close intimacy with this remarkable man , Mrs.
Pen	PERSON	- nell writes with a rare understanding of his character and genius , and seems to have pre - sented us with the true
Leland	PERSON	, so far as one mortal may penetrate the mystery of another 's individuality .

		The '' Memoirs , '' written by Mr.
Leland	PERSON	himself , and bringing his life down to 1870 , have served as an important source of information , supplemented by private papers left to her at his death , and by letters to and from a great number of persons in different parts of the world .

		Thus , not a little of the charm of
Leland	LOCATION	's personality breathes in the pages of his biography ; and though the work can not rival or displace the '' Memoirs , '' it is a worthy tribute and will be received as the defi - nitive and authoritative life of this highly inter - esting and attractive man .

		Mrs.
PenneU	PERSON	is imbued with something of her late xmcle 's love of Gypsy lore , witchcraft , sorcery , demonology , popular superstitions , tinkers ' - talk , fortune - telling , crystal-gazing , voodooism , and kindred branches of unpolite learning .

		In fact , she has given more space to these matters , to the '' Romany '' side of her hero , than most readers woidd have demanded .

		But let them thank her for having conscien - tiously translated the Romany talk , what there is of it .

		Of '' Shelta , '' or tinkers ' - talk , we learn from her pages just enough to awaken curiosity .

		the Rye , '' even for the years preceding his rather late acquisition of Romany , seems not always quite appropriate .

		A preliminary defi - nition of the word as meaning , among Gypsies , a superior person or gentleman , might have been welcome to the uninitiated .

		A quotation from Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	's opening pages is here in place . ''

		His interests were wide and varied , and only a writer as many-sided could do full justice to all his intellectual adventures .

		There were so many subjects he mastered of which my knowledge -- if I have any -- is slight , that I can only hope to show what they were to him and how he was influenced by them .

		One other explanation I ought to make .

		If I have less knowledge than my task demands , on the other hand , no such fault can be found with the sympathy and affection I bring to it .

		I had a friend in my uncle -- or in < The Rye , ' as I must be allowed to call him .

		For it was the name by which I knew him best , -- not knowing him really until he had become ' The Rye ' for every Gypsy on the English roads and every Gypsy scholar the world over . ''

		To those who think of Leland chiefly as the author of the '' Breitmann '' jingles , his many - sidedness must come as a surprise .

		He himself was displeased and hurt that so many knew him only as ''
Hans Breitmann	PERSON	, '' whereas the best of his energies had been most generously spent in the cause of industrial art education .

		Some of the book-titles from the four-page bibliography at the end of Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	's work may serve to illustrate the variety of
Leland	LOCATION	's interests and pursuits .

		His first book was on '' The Poetry and Mystery of Dreams . ''

		Later in the list come '' The Book of Copperheads , '' `` Legends of the Birds , '' '' The Music Lesson of Confucius , '' `` The Egyptian Sketch-Book , '' `` The Minor Arts , '' '' A Dictionary of Slang , '' '' A Manual of Mending and Repairing , '' '' Have You a Strong Will ? ''

		and last of all , `` The Alternate Sex . ''

		The very variety of his tastes was against his producing any one work of lasting renown .

		Life to him was a joyous journey through wonderland , mystery lurking behind every way - side hedge and strange adventure awaiting one beyond the brow of every hill .

		Through it all , his appetite for work was insatiable .

		Even reading gave him little pleasure except as sug - gesting themes for books and articles .

		Those who had not this love of hard work were to him incomprehensible creatures .

		He failed to per - ceive how fortunate it is for the workers that so many are content to be drones .

		If all were writers , where would be the readers for so many books ?

		Both
Rachel	PERSON	and
Bernhardt	PERSON	were , like all Jews , immensely talented and quick to feel what took with the public ; but though great as actresses , they belonged to the second class .

		Read what
Heine	PERSON	says of
Rachel	PERSON	, how severely he blames her want of all sold ; and yet as a Jew he would fain praise her .

		I saw
Rachel	PERSON	for the first time in
1847	DATE	.

		I was then twenty-four , and I never shall forget how , while I appreciated her mere skill and cleverness , I was , I may say , disgusted at her tricks of the stage and utter want of soul .

		Her great dodge was to work herself into a spasm of passion , and then in a second cast herself into a statuesque attitude of utter calm and exclaim in an icy voice , '
Monsieur	PERSON	, ' or * Mon Seigneur . '

		And then all
Paris	LOCATION	, from
Dumas	PERSON	down , went mad with applause ; but it was so transparently tricky that I could only laugh . ''

		In the French Revolution of
1848	DATE	the young
Leland	PERSON	took an active part .

		From a letter de - scribing scenes in
Paris	LOCATION	at that time , a lively passage calls for quotation . ''

		Whack !

		hurrah !

		guns and drums , fusillades and barricades !

		We dined under a
Monarchy	ORGANIZATION	, supped under a Regency , went to sleep under a Provisional Grovernment , and woke imder a Republic -- not to mention two hours when we had just no Government at all ... We had a Review with nearly 350,000 soldiers the other day , and all
Paris	LOCATION	is overrun with penny papers , newsboys , and newswomen , who make such a row night and day that the city has become in - sufferable ... Every night at all the theatres the entire audience sing the songs of the revolution and amuse themselves in a free and easy way which would do honour to the Bowery , so that even I -- quiet and sober citizen -- have been inspired with their enthusi - asm .

		I really begin to think of addressing the opera audience on the American Constitution -- the price of provisions -- electromagnetism -- and matters and things in general .

		You will find the report of the speech the next day after never in the columns of the `` Constitutionnel ' -- Vive la bagatelle ! ''

		Some of
Leland	LOCATION	's pereonal and literary lik - ings and dislikings , especially the latter , are amusingly characteristic of the man .

		In a new poem of
Swinburne	LOCATION	's he finds '' more of the strength of poison than of muscle . ''

		Of
Emer	PERSON	- son , whom he early met at an ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	''
Saturday	DATE	dinner , he says in his impublished memoranda : ''
Emerson	PERSON	dabbled with mysticism and paddled in metempsychosis , and shirked pantheism , as did
Carlyle	PERSON	, while using it as a garment , and exalted Goethe ; but would have died of blushes and sunk into his boots be - fore Greek fleshliness .

		So he once said to me , and that rather rudely and uncalled for , that '
Heine	PERSON	was a quack and charlatan in literature , ' which , considering that I had translated the two principal works of
Heine	LOCATION	, I thought very unkind . ''

		Of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, whom he admired in gen - eral ,
Leland	PERSON	has a good story to teU .

		`` When my book on the Gypsies appeared , I , knowing that it would interest him , gave him a copy , in which 1 had written a short complimentary poem , and , mindful of the great and warm gratitude which he had declared regarding my brother Henry , I asked him if he would not write for me a few original verses , though it were only a couplet , in the copy of ' Leaves of Grass ' which he had sent to my brother .

		His reply was a refusal , at which I should not have felt hurt , had it been gently worded or civilly evasive , but his reply was to the effect that he never did anything of the kind except for money .

		His exact words then were , < Sometimes when a fellow says to me , ''
Walt	PERSON	, here 's ten or
five dollars	MONEY	-- write me a poem for it , '' I do so . '

		And then seeing a look of disappointment or astonishment in my face , he added : < But I will give you my photograph and autograph , ' which he did . ''


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	is called by
Leland	PERSON	`` the Prince of Prigs . ''

		A stem encounter with Car - lyle is graphically reproduced .

		One would like to know
Leland	PERSON	's opinion of Sir
Richard Bur	PERSON	- ton .

		Why did they never meet and become fast friends ?

		Or did they meet and fail to hit it off ?

		The two have points of striking simi - larity .

		As was once said of
Leland	LOCATION	-- to quote Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	's version of the remark -- he had '' something of
Burton	PERSON	in his delight in natural himian beings other than the ordinary frock - coated , tall-hatted , high-heeled English types . ''

		And yet , Romany enthusiasts though they both were , they seem never to have cooperated in their researches in Gypsy lore .

		The too short-livecl
Rabelais Club	ORGANIZATION	, of which
Leland	PERSON	was the chief founder , is now remem - bered by few .

		But his boyish enthusiasm for whatever he undertook , and at whatever time of life , is a perennially joyfid thing to contem - plate .

		He exclaims in a letter : '' I want the Rabelais to corruscate -- whizz , blaze and sparkle , fulminate and bang .

		It must be great and wise and good , ripstavering , bland , dynamitic , gentle , awful , tender , and tremidous . ''

		The reader , if critically inclined , wiU note
Leland	PERSON	's divided allegiance between '' Gypsy '' and ''
Gipsy	LOCATION	'' -- which may partly explain why we fail to find
Burton	PERSON	among his intimate friends , as
Burton	PERSON	cherished a pet abhorrence for the spelling ''
Gipsy	LOCATION	, '' and for all who gave it their covmtenance .

		The letter of
Leland	LOCATION	's beginning '' My Dear
Walter	PERSON	, '' and printed with letters to
Besant	PERSON	, though , as Mrs.
Pennell	PERSON	says , manifestly written to some other
Walter	PERSON	, may have been addressed to the writer 's friend Pol - lock ; at any rate , the suggestion is here offered in passing .

		The publishing of memoirs and letters has gone to great lengths in these latter days ; but this life of
Leland	LOCATION	bi-ings to the reader no un - pleasant consciousness of the fact .

		As a com - 200 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, panion and supplement to the '' Memoirs '' of
1893	DATE	, it helps to furnish a full-length portrait of an unusually interesting man .

		The many portraits and other illustrations -- especially the facsimiles of
Leland	LOCATION	's illustrated letters -- scat - tered through the volumes add much to the book 's attractiveness .

		The two portraits of Leland himself , one taken in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in his prime , the other shortly before his death in
Italy	LOCATION	, show us unmistakably the same man , and yet so strangely different !

		The 36-page index , and the bibliography already mentioned , are manifestly the products of scholarly care and painstaking thoroughness .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		Two
Famous Exglish Rivers	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The charm of landscape often lies less in the actual view than in its associations .

		The Thames and the Tiber seem more beautiful than similar streams with lesser histories .

		England 's
Avon	LOCATION	is a pretty river , but in itself is not much prettier than
Michigan	LOCATION	's
Kalamazoo	LOCATION	, which in parts it resembles not a little .

		Taking up the companion volumes , '' In Thamesland '' and '' The Idyllic Avon , '' we know that we shall meet with poetry , history , and romance in their enticing pages .

		The natural scenery is indeed beautiful , as the copiously illustrated pages of both books prove ; but after all , what is the actual compared with our dreams ?

		What visions are conjured by the mere utter - ance of these two historic names -- visions of that wonderful past in which aU the men were brave and all the women fair !

		These square walled-in gardens -- how can we do otherwise than fill them with pretty ladies in high-waisted bef rilled frocks , with courtly-mannered men in brightly colored coats and gaily flowered waist - coats , knee-breeches , and periwigs ?

		These velvety lawns of vivid green -- who shall explain their secret ?

		Only the English gardener knows it , and his explanation is far from poetical : `` We mows 'em and we roUs 'em for a thousand years , and the rain on 'em does the rest . ''

		It is impossible to think of
England	LOCATION	without its principal river .

		To know it well is to know a great deal of English history .

		It laves and cuts in twain the burliest city in all the world ; it bears a vast commerce from
London	LOCATION	to the sea ; years agone , kings and princes and the fairest women in the land rode upon its tide in functions of state or in the idle pose of pleasure .

		Take almost any view-point -- for example ,
Richmond Terrace	LOCATION	, only a few miles from the great city -- and we behold no end of interesting things . ''

		Elizabeth and Leicester once enjoyed the rapture of the same beautiful landscape that enchants us to-day .

		To the left , and below the terrace of the Star and
Garter	DATE	, a modern hostelry which occupies the site of the structure where Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	died , one sees
White Lodge	ORGANIZATION	, sometime the residence of the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	, of the Battenbergs , and of other members of the royal household .

		Beyond is
Ham House	ORGANIZATION	on the banks of the Thames in the dull little village of
Petersham	LOCATION	, where
Charles I.	PERSON	took refuge in his flight .

		On the opposite , the north bank .

		Pope 's villa peeps out its ruddy turrets from a dark green foliate mass .

summer	DATE	's day .

		Behind us is old
London	LOCATION	, and all around the ancient town of
Richmond	LOCATION	, the fashionable resort of the great courtiers and fine ladies of many splendid days ago . ''

		Or , let us pause in our Thames journey at
Oxford	LOCATION	.

		Let us make the rounds of its ivied college buildings in the companionship of some old and enthusiastic alumnus ; let us absorb his affection for his alma mater and his joy in everything , from
Gothic	LOCATION	facade to a turf six hundred years old , and we shall not care to dispute with him that
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is the stateliest intellectual monument in the world .

		The beau - tiful
Saxon	PERSON	, early
Norman	PERSON	, English , Gothic , and Italian structures have been faithfully pre - served through all necessary alterations and additions ; they still glorify her past , while serving to make the Oxford of to-day larger and grander than before .

		At
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, as elsewhere , one continues to feel the powerful personality of that great ruler and wonderful woman , Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	.

		Ox - ford , and indeed all
England	LOCATION	, were in bad plight when
Elizabeth	LOCATION	ascended the throne .

		But her advent heralded a new and glorious era .

		She encouraged learning by choosing for her ser - vice eminent and hopeful students like Sir
Thomas Bodley	PERSON	.

		The Bodleian Library , oldest public library in
Europe	LOCATION	, is his monument .

		He was followed by a long line of eminent scholars , each in his turn carrying on the

		THE DIAL 201 prosperity .

		Archbishop Laud re-cast its stat - utes and built
Convocation House	ORGANIZATION	,
Oxford 's Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		The city became in spirit the Royalist capital of
England	LOCATION	, and later , during the civil war , an actual court and fortress .

		Memories such as these are aroused through - out the hundred and forty-eight miles of this journey down the
Thames	LOCATION	, from its source near
Crickdale	LOCATION	to
Putney	LOCATION	Bridge in
London	LOCATION	.

		But after aU , in the opinion of our guide through
Thamesland	LOCATION	, the dominating fact of the Thames , dwarfing its natural beauty and unrivalled his - torical associations , is that
London	LOCATION	stands upon its shores -- majestic
London	LOCATION	, that world within a world , not only appalling in extent , but with an antiquity and a history such that no street can be found in it of which something of interest has not been recorded .

		Yet a first view of the Thames from a
London	LOCATION	window or street is quite likely to be a disappointment .

		It seems scarcely a river at all , but a smooth-banked park rivu - let , with a picturesque swagger , a smug compla - cency , tj ^ ically British .

		But there are times and places fit for first meetings with localities , as with persons .

		Walk half-way across TTest - minster Bridge , and turn to look back on the view of the river embracing the noble
Houses of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	,
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Victoria Embankment	PERSON	with its
Somerset House	ORGANIZATION	and
Cleopatra	ORGANIZATION	's Needle .

		Thus
Wordsworth	PERSON	saw ^ it at four o'clock in the
morning	TIME	, from the top of a coach on its way to
Dover	LOCATION	; and here his magnificent lines will start into memory : '' Earth has not anything to show more fair : Never did sun more beautifully steep In his first splendour , vaUey , rock , or hill ; Ne'er saw I , never felt , a calm so deep !

		The river glideth at his own sweet will ; Dear God !

		the very houses seem asleep ; And all that mighty heart is lying still . ''

		Compared with the Thames , the
Avon	ORGANIZATION	is an insignificant river , yet to many it is dearer than the larger stream .

		If Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	is the dominating personality ' of the Thames story , the Avon too has its hero -- a certain poet and actor whom
Elizabeth	PERSON	sometimes siunmoned to her court to amuse her with his latest play .

		The thought of
Avon	ORGANIZATION	is linked so inseparably with thoughts of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Stratford	LOCATION	, that in taking up '' The Idyllic Avon '' it is a surprise to find only about forty of its two hundred and sixty pages given to these matters .

		The
Avon	LOCATION	has fifty miles to travel after it leaves
Stratford	LOCATION	, before it empties into the Severn .

		Even at
Welford	LOCATION	, only five miles below
Stratford	LOCATION	, a resi - dent , we are told , being questioned as to his knowledge of Shakespeare , replied : '' Oh , ah !

		I 've heard on him ; he 's a bloke as keeps a museum at
Stratford	LOCATION	. ''

		For the local people ,
Stratford	LOCATION	is not so much the town of Shakespeare as the market-town of
Stratford	LOCATION	.

		There are numbers of persons living within a dozen miles of it who have never been there , and when they do go it wiU be to buy , sell , receive , or deliver something , or to hire a servant or be hired , and not to worship at the shrine of the great poet .

		The town was there before
Shakespeare	PERSON	, and it maintains locally a primal importance to which the fact of its having supplied the circumstances into which Shake - speare was bom is accidental .

		At the present time ,
Stratford	LOCATION	does not differ materially from other market-towns in
central England	LOCATION	, except - ing that on account of its many visitors it is a little more smartly kept .

		And , since so much has been written about Shakespeare and
Strat	PERSON	- ford by abler pens than
Air	ORGANIZATION	.

		Grarrett 's , it is perhaps quite as weU that his trip on the Avon deals rather with idyls of other towns and peoples .

		The voyage begins near the mouth of the Severn , at
Tewkesbury	ORGANIZATION	.

		This furnishes occa - sion for a fairly good resume of the last battle in the Wars of the Roses ; also for a history of
Tewkesbury Abbey	ORGANIZATION	, and some very charming pictures of it .

		At Pershore Town is another
Abbey	LOCATION	, whose bells ring a chime at the hour , and after the stroke of every third hour a tune -- the air of one or another of fourteen old songs or hymns ; they repeat the melody four times , so that some minutes of the next hour have passed before they cease .

		The ostler at the inn or the man in the street unconsciously whistles the tune of the day as he goes about his business .

		Besides its chimes ,
Pershore	LOCATION	is noted for its fruit , especially its plums . ''

		There are many plantations of plum-trees in and about the town , and the prosperity of the place greatly varies with a good or bad plum year .

		They say that if you meet a Pershore man in a good gardening season and ask him where he comes from , he replies , *
Pershore	LOCATION	; where 'd you think ? '

		But to the same question , when the season is a bad one , he grumbles out the reply , * Pershore , -- God help us ! '

		... In a place the size of Pershore everybody is supposed to know everybody else ; but such knowledge can , after all , be but partial , and the estimation one makes of another is probably in some cases mistaken , notwithstanding the great facilities afforded to everybody to discuss every other person 's business .

		That is nothing , or nothing but very com - monplace ; but what is something is the sunniness and simplicity of this little town , and the genial , friendly nature of its inhabitants . ''

		It is in pictures such as this -- pictures of 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, English country life , its simplicity and friend - liness , -- that the book makes its strongest appeal to the reader .

		These are days in which it is well to be reminded that the essence of human life consists in things simple and commonplace , -- the gathering in of the last sheaves of the har - vest , and the driving in of the plough into the stubbles ; the milking of kine and the feeding of pigs ; the picking of fruit and the digging up of potatoes ; -- the homely primary duties of man .

		The eighty-seven illustrations from Mr.
Gar	PERSON	- rett 's own camera are charming , and the two maps are excellent .

		It is pathetic that a man who can make such good pictures and write pretty good prose should be tempted into mak - ing such very bad verse .

		There are about thirty '' Songs and Ballads '' scattered through the text , which we wotdd gladly pass over in silence .

		But since the author calls attention to them both on title-page and in preface , they can not be ignored .

		Here is one , entitled '' The Storm on the River . '' ''

		Now the daylight Turns to greylight , And a cold gust sends a shiver Through the river reeds and rushes , and stirs the wait - ing trees ; Clouds so dun , now Hide the sun , now There are rain-drops on the river , And the echo of the thunder rumbles loud along the breeze . ''

		Be not sad , oh .

		For this shadow -- Change of shine to showery weather ; The cloud is needful to the earth , as to our life its pain ; There 's a warm rift In the storm-drift .

		Showing sun and cloud together .

		And the wasting of the river is replenished by the rain . ''

		But Mr.
Garrett	PERSON	's temptation to '' drop into poetry '' on slight occasion should perhaps be forgiven for the sake of the book 's merits in many respects .

		Moreover , it is a beautiful specimen of the publishing art , the cover de - sign -- a view of the
Stratford	LOCATION	church where
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is buried -- being as lovely as it is appropriate .

		It is closely modelled upon the type of '' Who 's Who in

		A few American names are found in the list , but their selection has not been made upon any rational basis .

		A great variety of statistical and other information is given in the preliminary pages .

		The Story of our Great Declaration .

		* Significant of the thorough investigation and scholarly results characterizing modern Ameri - can historical composition is a volume of more than five hundred pages devoted to an intensive study of the
Declaration of Independence	ORGANIZATION	.

		That one incident in the comprehensive annals of the nation 's history should be given so much time and space in the hurrying present may appear over-refinement to the hasty traveller , but that the final word has been said on one topic will be a satisfaction to the sojourner in the land of letters .

		Other volumes devoted to this subject , notably those of
Sanderson	LOCATION	,
Michaels	PERSON	, and Fried - enwald , have set forth the lives of the signers , the statements made in the document , and the picturesque elements of the occasion .

		This writer is concerned with collecting every scrap of information concerning the inception of the idea of '' • Independency , '' the passing of the motion by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the penning of the Declaration , and the reception of the action of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	by the people of the
States	LOCATION	.

		It is one of those abnormal books in which the space devoted to notes is larger than that given to the text ; yet by placing the notes after the text , the attention of the reader is not imduly distracted .

		Another device likely to prove of benefit to investigators and students is the designation by an initial letter of the library or collection in which the document or book quoted was found .

		The growing sentiment for Independence is traced rapidly through Seventy-Four , the year '' in which the people for the first time recog - nized that the cause of
Boston	LOCATION	was a common cause '' ; through Seventy-Five , '' when war had become a reality , '' to the beginning of Seventy - Six .

		Subsequently , Independence itself is fol - lowed through the the initial steps and the postponement , through the drafting of the Declaration , and through the battle-royal be - tween pro- and anti-Independents in
New York	LOCATION	and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	.

		The actual signing is next critically examined , and the public opinions of the action are collated .

		A chapter follows on the '' fireworks , '' or celebrations throughout the States , with a final chapter on the later history of the engrossed copy of the Declaration and the various copies made by
Jefferson	PERSON	for his friends .

		The author approaches with confidence the crux of whether or not the Declaration was signed generally on
July 4 , 1776	DATE	.

		He analyzes the old dispute , and finds that

		He even ventures to impeach

		No doubt , as the author points out , this ancient dispute originated in a con - fusion between the signing of the original copy and the engrossed copy .

		One coidd wish that as much analysis and thorough investigation had been given to the many stories connected with the signing as related by
Jared Sparks	PERSON	, by

		It woidd seem that

		Mr.

		Mature Judgments on Xapoleow .

		* In reading the volume in the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	Modern History '' which expresses the maturer judgment of English historical scholarship upon the work of
Napoleon	PERSON	, one is reminded , by way of contrast , that a century ago Englishmen -- even sympathizei 's with the French Revolution like
Wordsworth	PERSON	-- failed to note any charac - teristic of the new regime except the absence of political liberty .

		General
Bonaparte	PERSON	appeared to them an upstart tyrant , and the subservience of the French seemed odious .

		They ignored the positive elements of his work , which
Lafayette	LOCATION	, an equally ardent apostle of freedom , indicated so weU in a public letter without being vmf aitb - fid to his early ideals .

		This letter was written to
General Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	, to explain why
Lafayette	LOCATION	voted against the project of the consulship for life .

		In it he says : '' We have seen since the 18th Brumaire in the consular power a restor - atory dictatorship , which , under the auspices of your genius , has accomplished great things , -- less great , however , than would be the restoration of liberty . ''

		It is the attitude of
Lafayette	LOCATION	, rather than that of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	, which is assumed in the volume on Napoleon in the ''
Cambridge Modem History	ORGANIZATION	. ' '

		Its breadth of view is also emphasized by the association in the group of writers , with several of
England	LOCATION	's most distinguished histor - ians , of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	scholars like Professor Pariset of the
University of Nancy	ORGANIZATION	, Professor Guilland of Ziirich , General
Keim	PERSON	and Dr.
Pflugk-Harttung	PERSON	of
Germany	LOCATION	, and Professor Stschepkin of
the University of Odessa	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the assignment of topics to their European associates , the editors of this important series have been especially happy .

		Professor
Pariset	PERSON	's description of the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	impresses one as a piece of work which could be written only by a man with a native 's experience of the operation of French administrative machinery .

		Dealing with such matters is largely a question of pro- portion and emphasis .

		The foreign scholar , with his array of '' sources , '' is often led to measure the importance of an institution by the number of coliunns filled by its provisions in the colleo - tion of laws .

		In Professor
Pariset	PERSON	's treatment there is not much that is new , but the exact func - tion of such a body as the
Council of State	ORGANIZATION	is better explained than is commonly the case .

		And this is not the only example which might be cited .

		Must it not be refreshing also to read a Russian 's account of that much described episode , the retreat from
Moscow	LOCATION	?

		The division of the subject-matter into topics has been accomplished satisfactorily .

		How vast this subject-matter is , one realizes when one notes ^ he condensed treatment of important topics , althoilgh the volume contains nearly eight hun - dred pages up to the bibliographies .

		Each writer seems to have planned his work well in relation to other parts of the book .

		In a few instances , however , all that is said in various places upon a particular subject does not amount to a sufficiently complete statement of it .

		This 18 true of the rupture of the Peace of
Amiens	LOCATION	.

		It is questionable whether , in his discussion of the
Continental System	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Rose	PERSON	should not have included an explanation of the consequences of the Embargo , instead of merely referring to the treatment of this subject in a previous vol - ume of the series .

		While depending upon one another in this way , the authors have not sacri - ficed their personal attitude .

		For example , in fiealing with the
Copenhagen	LOCATION	affair Dr.
Rose	PERSON	writes as a sympathetic critic of the policy of
Canning	ORGANIZATION	, but Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	refers to the plan adopted and carried into such terrible effect in terms which would be expected from persons who regard the exigencies of naval strategy as superior to considerations of national honor or public right .

		Among the questions given an exceptionally clear treatment in the light of the results of recent investigation is the significance of Ville - neuve 's failure in

Napoleon	LOCATION	's rear , and the hopeless unseaworthiness of the flotilla , that dictated the abandonment of ' the immense project ' '' of an invasion of
England	LOCATION	.

		From Dr.
Rose	PERSON	's treatment of the
Continental System	ORGANIZATION	, it appears that his opinion has changed in regard to the aim of the British Orders in Council of
November , 1807	DATE	.

		In his book on the '' Revolutionary and Napoleonic Era , '' pub - lished twelve years ago , he declared that '' the chief aim of our Orders in Council '' was '' the monopoly of the ocean commerce of the world . ''

		In his biography of Napoleon he stiU speaks of them as ' ' harsh and high-handed . ' '

		In the present volume his attitude is much more favorable to the British case . ''

		The facilities , '' he argues , '' granted to neutrals were clearly of such a kind as to disprove the charge that
George III	PERSON	.

		's government deliberately sought to ruin neutral conmierce .

		On the contrary , it sought to attract neutral ships to British harbors , but only on conditions which contravened
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's de - crees .

		The aim clearly was not to ruin neutral commerce , but to make the
Continental System	ORGANIZATION	odious to neutrals . ''

		In his discussion of
Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	's policy at the beginning of the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	, Professor Guilland ignores one or two elements of the situation .

		It is obvious that if the new government was not to share the discredit of the Directory it must recover the position guaranteed by the terms of the treaty of Campo Formio -- the '' natural limits '' securely flanked by French domination in
Holland	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	.

		No magistrate , not even a
Washington	LOCATION	, could have persuaded the French in
1800	DATE	to give up the power they had enjoyed so recently .

		The '' elevation of war into a sys - tem , '' to quote Professor
Guilland	PERSON	's words , may have been
Napoleon	PERSON	's later policy ; but at this time , even if he were following his inclination , he was also attempting what was unavoidable .

		The most masterly handling of a complex diplo - matic situation is to be found in Dr.
Ward	PERSON	's two chapters on the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		The editors have not called their volume '' The Napoleonic Era , '' or '' The
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	and the Empire , '' but simply ''
Napoleon	PERSON	. ''

		This implies that in reading the chapters there shall appear one after another the lines of a consistent por - trait , and that in this personality shall be found the real unity of the treatment .

		This promise is fulfilled .

		The outlines of the picture are peculiarly clear in the closing pages of Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	's admirable chapter on
St. Helena	LOCATION	, in his reflections upon the significance of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon 's work , and of the attitude of the peoples of
England	LOCATION	and of
Europe	LOCATION	toward him .

		Henry
E. Bourne	PERSON	.

		The prevailing interest in matters relating to the South American republics is shown not only in the de - scriptive articles regarding them in various magazines , but in forthcoming books as well .

		Prominent among these is a new work by Mr.
Percy F. Martin	PERSON	, F.R.G.S. , entitled '' Through Five Republics of
South America	LOCATION	, '' the five being
Brazil	LOCATION	,
Argentina	LOCATION	,
Chile	LOCATION	,
Uruguay	LOCATION	, and
Venezuela	LOCATION	.

		The volume will contain valuable statistical tables , with pictures and maps , and will treat of the man - ners , customs , and life of the people , as well as the rail - way , financial , commercial , and sociological conditions .

		THE DIAL 205 Recext Americax Poetry .

		* Blank verse is the most difficult of English verge - forms , and we rarely find it worth while to illustrate the work of our minor poets by extracts of that de - scription .

		But we find in Mr.
Robert Cameron Rogers	PERSON	's newvolume `` The Rosary and Other Poems '' a group of four classical idyls in blank verse that are distinctly out of the common , and that yield such lines as these spoken by '' Blind Polyphemus . '' ''

		And Zeus grants one delight ; -- when day is gone , When night blinds all , my sight comes back to me ; And I can see , as last I saw , the day -- The great blue , breathing deep -- the black-ribbed slag That Titans flung from
Etna	ORGANIZATION	's forge to cool Amid the breakers , and away , beyond , The coast of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Again I see The hazy hills where graze my brothers ' sheep .

		The olive trees that bow themselves and peer Down grassy gullies , and the timid joy Of almond trees in bloom .

		When morning comes The ewes unbidden crowd about my knees .

		And with blind hands grown gentler than of old I milk them one by one ; then pasturewards I follow them who one time followed me . ''

		There is a Landorian touch of divine simplicity about these new `` Hellenics '' which gives them a marked dis - tinction .

		But the talent of -RSB- VIr .

		Rogersis for the most part lyrical , and a very charming talent it is .

		This last half of `` A Riding Song '' is a memorable strain . ''

		Then ride , for dawn is swift and sure .

		And an ebb must always be ; The magic moon will but endure One hour more up from the sea .

		The gold of a year of sun 's too poor To buy that hour of me ! ''

		Though it has no thread in the loom of the past , Though a futxire has been denied , Though I may not hold it , riding fast , And it die , die , die , as we ride ; The rim of the moon has touched at last .

		And here is the ttum of the tide .

		0 , never for me a moon shall rise To shine as this moon has shone .

		Like a bark aflame , hull-down , it lies , Like a spent flame sunk it has gone .

		To shine , where a haunted flood-tide cries To the coasts of Avalon . ''

		This lyric illustrates both the free swing of the poet 's verse , and the out-door quality which is one of its chief characteristics .

		Mr.
Dodd	PERSON	's volume , `` A Modem Alchemist , '' opens with a suggestion that should be taken to heart by those readers who ever seek to find the singer in the song , and whose interest in verse par - takes more of personal curiosity than of literary appreciation . ''

		Friend , if yon read , read wisely , nor believe Grief 's name is graven here because I grieve , Nor when I sing love 's passion deem that I ELave felt each worded rapture sigh for sigh !

		Life I interpret as I may , but keep Myself a secret where all secrets sleep . ''

		By way of a supplement to this finger-post of warn - iag , we may quote '' Love and the Poet . '' ''

		A maiden loved him , wooed him with her eyes ; He felt their limpid blueness like a dream .

		So rhymed of love with a divine surprise !

		Love -LRB- not the blue-eyed maiden -RRB- was his theme . '' '

		O luring lips ! '

		he sang , who knew them not ; ' O burning kisses ! '

		But his soul was strong .

		Silent , aloof , a sentinel of thought , Dwelling a hermit on the heights of song . ''

		In this volume also , as in the one preceding , we note the Landorian inspiration , and this time it is expressly and gratefully acknowledged in these lines on '' The Pentameron . '' ''

		O breath of something from beyond these hills , Some higher heaven whence the essential sweetness Comes down to us imperfectly in gusts , Striking a faintness of pure ecstasy Through the minutest fibre of our beings !

		Such breaths come seldom to the innocent .

		How seldom to the wordly !

		and , alas .

		There are who have not known them , nor shall know .

		To me one full intoxicating pang , Whereat my spirit cried out for painful bliss .

		Thou hast sent down to me , O Landor , one For which I thank thee not in words but tears ! ''

		Mr.
Dodd	PERSON	has the command of tragic pathos , a qual - ity exhibited most remarkably , perhaps , in '' What the Coroner Found , '' a poem that inevitably recalls
Rossetti	PERSON	's `` Jenny . ''

		We must quote two or three stanzas , although they suffer sadly by being wrenched from their context . ''

		Dead -- '
Nell	PERSON	' is dead ; fraQ siren of the streets .

		Love-starved , with lips reddened to summon shame ... To-morrow 's tale is written .

		Vulturous sheets Which lend the fallen miserable fame Will mark the spot , counting the tale well told .

		But '
Nell	PERSON	' is dead ; poor '
Nell	PERSON	' was overbold . ''

		She has forgotten pain ... I must go down To where she lies , and elbow past the men Who press about her staring at the gown Stained with new blood , go down to her ... and then , O then perhaps I shall return and know Why life yields unto death .

		'T is better so .

		206 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, '' 'T is better so : death quiets life .

		This night So much the still face of a courtesan Has taught me , showing strangely calm and white Under its rouge , peaceful and strangely wan , As if tired into silence .

		Death , through her .

		Invokes the incense of a worshipper . ''

		There is stufp in these poems -- deep thought and deep feeling .

		And conjoined with them is a delicacy of touch that shows the artist keeping the upper hand of his emotions .

		Let us close this review with the exquisite lines upon '' The Debutante . '' ''

		Her name 's not Amaryllis , though she seems To shepherd with her eyes a flock of dreams ; And yet , it may be , when their tale is told -LRB- Poor sheep , poor silly dream-sheep pastured far Along faint hills lit by a maiden star ! -RRB-

		She will desert them for the Fleece of Gold . '' ''

		Many Moods '' was the title given to a volume o # his poems by the late
J. A. Symonds	PERSON	. ''

		Many Moods and Many Minds '' is the caption under which Mr.
Louis James Block	PERSON	has made his latest collection of miscellaneous pieces .

		Mr.
Block	PERSON	has paid loyal devotion to the muse for many years , and the present volume exhibits him as a very thoughtful poet , with many forms of technical ex - pression at his command .

		It seems to us that he is best when his form is simplest , as these stanzas fi'om '' In the Afternoon '' may serve to illustrate . ''

		Gifts have the gray hours brought , Gray hours of the afternoon .

		Soft lighted hours , whose sun Faces the lampless moon . ''

		Not the wild blooms of youth .

		Not passion 's golden flowers .

		But blossoms wan of hue , Plucked in life 's gentler bowers . ''

		Sweeter is rest and calm Than ecstasy 's fierce pain , And sweeter this sad bliss Than all youth strove to gain . ''

		The calm of twilight descends Unvexed of sunset , and gray .

		Star-crowned , and bringer of dreams , Day 's shadow , dearer than day . ''

		As an example of Mr.
Block	PERSON	's more stately meas - ures , we quote his fine sonnet on '' The Arbitration Treaty . '' ''

		Yet the world moves ; although the bitter Past Lingering enthroned demands to be obeyed ; Across the seas the nations war-arrayed Still stand at gaze , and hearken for the vast And harsh call unto strife , the thunderous blast Of trumpets while the fields are sore dismayed ; In
Time	ORGANIZATION	's great balance such rule duly weighed Has been found wanting , its sure doom forecast ; '' For two strong peoples shape the newer thought .

		With joined might invoke the reign of peace .

		Seeing each man 's fatherland is where is sought Some nobler hope for true life 's bright increase , And of one blood is goodness , and release From world-care by the whole world 's toil is wrought ! ''

		Two interesting experiments in music are found in this volume .

		One is a transcription of
Gillet	PERSON	's '' Loin du Bal , '' which seems to us to have a higher artistic value than the composition which evoked it ; the other is a symphony in verse , in the ortho - dox four movements , entitled '' From Over-Man to Over-Soul , '' which suggests the similar poems of Mr.
Charles E. Russell	PERSON	, reviewed by us last year . ''


Dexter `` Wallace	PERSON	, '' we are given to understand is a pseudonym .

		His book of verse , '' The Blood of the Prophets , '' is a collection of poems inspired by passionate indignation , but too rugged in diction to deserve much artistic consideration .

		Their indig - nation is directed toward the mammon-worship of our time , and the '' Ballad of Jesus of
Nazareth	LOCATION	, '' which fills half the volume , is a plea for the spirit of Christianity as opposed to the practice of
Chris	PERSON	- tendom . ''

		Samson and Delilah '' expounds a similar parable with equal effectiveness .

		We quote a stanza from the '' Ballade of Dead Republics . '' ''

		Tell me ye King-craft of to-day Where is
Athens	LOCATION	, who made men free ; Then sank into stupor by the way .

		Subdued by the Spartan tyranny ?

		And
Rome	LOCATION	that staggered to death , perdie , Stabbed by the sword of
Hannibal	LOCATION	, And bled by patrician infamy -- The Dragon of Greed destroyed them all ! ''

		This is technically the best poem in the book .

		Others suffer from over-vehemence of expression , as in this description of '' The perjured
Marshall	PERSON	, who with sorcery Planted the jungle of unequal laws , '' or of '' this huge reptile , now a nation 's Fear , '' which is the author 's pleasant way of referring to Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	.

		But such excesses as these may almost be condoned for the sake of the author 's denuncia - tion of the Philippine iniquity , and of his stanch adherence to the fine older ideals of the Republic , so shamelessly flouted in these decadent days .

		When a man styles himself a minor poet , criticism is disarmed .

		In such case is Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, who has been told , he says , that his readers could forgive him everything but his poetry , and who nevertheless makes bold to collect his fugitive pieces into a volume called '' Bird and Bough , '' with the following felicitous motto from
Bunyan	PERSON	: `` Some said ,
John	PERSON	, print it ; others said , Not so . '' ''

		The Cardinal Flower '' is pretty enough for quotation . ''

		Like peal of a bugle Upon the still night .

		So flames her deep scarlet In dim forest light . ''

		A heart-throb of color Lit up the dim nook , A dash of deep scarlet The dark shadows shook . ''

		Thou darling of
August	DATE	, Thou flame of her flame , ' T is only bold Autumn Thy ardor can tame . ''

		One merit Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	may and does claim un - reproved for his songs , that '' they keep closer to our wild nature -- to the birds , the flowers , the seasons -- than most of our minor poetry has done . ''


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 207 There are no daisies and nightingales in his song , but instead arbutus and columbine and hepatica , the crow , the bobolink , and the bluebird .

		`` My Lady of Dream , '' by Mr.
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	, is a volume of lyrics of which '' The Tryst with His Love '' may be taken as an example . ''

		When the wings of the tvrilight-legfion And the ghosts of the sanset pale , I float in the nebulous region Of a spirit-haunted vale : By the maige of a mystical river I make of my love a lyre , For she is a reed a-quiver , And I am the wind , her desire . ''

		This is charming , if ineffectual .

		It must be admitted that the author does better with the stately move - ment of the sonnet than with the freer utterance of the song .

		He has not the gift of liquid melody , whatever others he may have .

		The present volume includes a number of sonnets , and one curious ex - periment in the form of a two-octaved sonnet .

		This we quote as perhaps the most satisfactory poem in the collection .

		It is entitled `` Imperial Inventress . '' ''

		guardian of the sought-f or sacred fire ; Mother of splendors springing from the mind ; Imperial Inventress , let me find Melodious solace great as my desire !

		Grant me to waken thine impassioned lyre To most mellifluous music , and unbind The bands of silence ; oh , once more be kind E'en unto me , the least among thy choir !

		O
Breath of Godhead	ORGANIZATION	, voicing mysteries That mortal men , unheeding , seldom hear .

		Fain would my spirit bend a reverent ear To feast upon thy heavenly harmonies !

		Come through the sunset gates , or on the breeze Memnonian , murmur to me , spirit clear ; Breathe solace and dispel this life-long tear By mystic music sweeter than the sea 's !

		Give to this essence flaming seraph wings , Or bam it , incense-like , to thee and thine , Upon thy alter with its purging fire ; Strike thou at last from out these trembling strings Apocalypses of the inner shrine -- O Breath of God !

		make of my soul thy lyre ! ''

		Fifteen years ago , Mr.
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	pub - lished '' Short Flights , '' a small volume of songs and lyrics .

		Since then , the author has become widely known as a writer of acceptable fiction , but it appears from his new volume of '' Poems '' that he has not meanwhile forsaken the muse .

		We find in these pieces a graver and more reflective note than in the earlier ones -- the natural mark of a maturer experi - ence and a widened outlook .

		`` A Prayer of the Hill-Country '' shall be taken for our illustration . ''

		Lift me , O Lord , above the level plain .

		Beyond the cities where life throbs and thrills .

		And in the cool airs let my spirit gain The stable strength and courage of Thy hills . ''

		They are Thy secret dwelling-places , Lord I Like Thy majestic prophets , old and hoar .

		They stand assembled in divine accord , Thy sign of ` stablished power forevermore . ''

		Here peace finds refuge from ignoble wars , And faith , triumphant , builds in snow and rime , Near the broad highways of the greater stars .

		Above the tide-line of the seas of time . ''

		Lead me yet farther .

		Lord , to peaks more clear .

		Until the clouds like shining meadows lie , Where through the deeps of silence I may hear The thunder of Thy legions marching by . ''

		Nature , art , and patriotic sentiment are the chief elements of Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's inspiration .

		The metrical diversions of a score of years -- mostly bits of verse -- are collected into a volume called '' At the Gate of the
Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Harry Lyman Koopman	PERSON	.

		Neatly epigrammatic couplets and quatrains abound ^ as this on
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's great lyrical drama . '' '

		Unbound , for who would bind it ? '

		the perplexed And sneering critics of the poet cried .

		Whose son saw
England	LOCATION	's scholarship divide Over a doubtful conuna in the text . ''

		`` Shelley 's Birthday -LRB-
August 4	DATE	, 2792 -RRB- '' may be set beside the above quatrain to illustrate Mr.
Koopman	PERSON	's more serious manner . ''

		I stood before the open gate of birth , Where souls unborn await their doom to earth .

		Forth from the throng there burst a soul of flame , * Mine hour of birth , O Lord , the stars proclaim I ' To whom then gravely He : ' Yea , now at last The world is fit thy lot therein to cast .

		Bat , through thy haste , a thousand years ago Men called thee
Shelley	PERSON	in that life below . ' ''

		Conventional verse of a rather commonplace kind , devoid of anything like originality and not notice - ably felicitous in diction , makes up the volume called `` Words of the Wood , '' by Dr.
Ralcy Husted	PERSON	BelL `` Dreamland Voices '' is a specimen well above the average . ''

		Now sings the mated bird .

		Scarce knowing why he utters golden mirth ; The thrilling leaves are stirred With melodies of bird and sky and earth . '

		* From far-off fields of sleep I hear the drowsy phantom voices rise ; There are no winds to sweep The misty murmur-echoes from the skies .

		`` Serene soft stars eclipse Their fall - `` yed gaze with lids of love half closed ; The g ^ reat world gently dips Beneath a sea of azure , opal-rosed . ''

		The half-wake grasses droop Where pools of moonlight lie between the trees ; And tall night-shadows stoop Like timid silence shrinking from the breeze . ''

		A `` Threnody '' lamenting the passing of the ancient gods , one of the poems included in a slender volume by Mr.
Lewis Worthington Smith	PERSON	, closes with this appealing stanza : ''
Platsea	PERSON	's soil is sacred as of old ; In Salamis the white spray flashes still ; But nevermore in prophecy is told Apollo 's promise or dark
Hera	LOCATION	's will .

		The winds may pluck the reeds for music mellow , Or buoyant lift some song-bird 's throat of yellow ; But not again the god 's deft fingers straying Shall charm the fawns and dryads with his playing .

		My steps from sea to height are longing-led ; The ancient gods are dead ; sweet Pan is dead . ''

		Another poem yields these couplets on Sir
Francis Drake	PERSON	: 208 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, '' Brother of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
England	LOCATION	's strength and will , As he was
England	ORGANIZATION	's heart and mind , I fill One brimming beaker to the sword that hung Close at thy side , the ready hands that flung The power of
Spain	LOCATION	upon the tumbling seas With careless laughter as of kings at ease ; One brimming beaker as the pledge goes round And in our ears the world-wide surges sound . ''

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	has a fondness for long and swinging measures , as in the poem '' Southern Stars . '' ''

		The earth rolls onward night by night through wondrous ' arcs of sky ;
Aldebaran	ORGANIZATION	, the
Pleiades	LOCATION	, and
Sirius	ORGANIZATION	go by .

		The Great Bear ,
Draco	LOCATION	,
Perseus	LOCATION	, and
Cassiopoeia	ORGANIZATION	keep Their silent watch of centuries , though I should wake or sleep ; But on my little spot of earth there may not come to me The vision of the
Southern Cross	ORGANIZATION	above the Southern sea .

		`` Job saw Arcturus , Plato watched the marshalled host go by ; Their spirits thrill to meet my own from out the
midnight	TIME	sky .

		Chaldean shepherds lost in awe are with me as I gaze ; Upon us falls the reverent hush of wonder and amaze ; But I may never share the joy , the rapture fine and free , Of those who watch the Argo breast the glowing Southern sea . ''

		Altogether , this little book seems to be worth while .

		We note in one instance the detestable malformation '' thru '' : is not even poetry to be spared this dese - cration ?

		A lyric and a sonnet shall be our illustrative ex - tracts from '' The Moods of Life , '' a volume of verse by Mr.
William Francis Barnard	PERSON	.

		The lyric is '' Pioneers . '' ''

		Too full of freedom 's passion to endure The heavy bonds of custom , age on age , Men rise up , having strength and courage sure .

		And would in time 's adventurous tasks engage .

		* ' Alien in settled lands .

		Earth 's titans these .

		Whose mighty strength must find fit deeds afar ; In curious search they sail o'er all her seas , Asking no guides save sun , or moon , or star . ''

		And where they pause , enamored , for a time .

		They hear their hearts within , that long to go ; Which will not let them rest in any clime As long as worlds lie wide , and far streams flow . ''

		They toil up mountains , pierce great pathless woods , They cross the deserts waste , then hasten on .

		Taming the earth for following multitudes , They face the beckoning sunset , and are gone . ''

		The subject of the sonnet is '' The Graves of
Shelley	PERSON	and Keats '' in the Protestant Cemetery at
Rome	LOCATION	. ''

		Is this where Death his jealous state doth keep Over two glorious ones , who early passed Out of the ways of song and into the Vast , Out of being into sealed sleep ?

		Is this the spot where Joy lies buried deep ; Where Hope and Love are hushed ; where prisoned fast , Young power and high desire are cold at last .

		Moving no more ?

		I smile , and can not weep .

		Ye trees ; grey pyramid clearing the blue air Within whose shade the flowers with beauty bent .

		Grow thickly ; ivied walls ; and lingering wind ; Green grass , and sunlight ; is there otherwhere Fitter for poets on whose heads were spent The scorn and maledictions of
Mankind	LOCATION	? ''

		The defect in the third and fourth lines is unfortu - nate , particularly in view of the obvious remedy , which is nothing more than shifting the superfluous '' and '' of the one to its proper place at the begin - ning of the other . ''

		Mystery of the West , '' by Mr ,
Henry Nehemiah Dodge	PERSON	, may be described as a sort of sectional epic of the discovery of
America	LOCATION	.

		Beginning with
Leif	PERSON	and ending with the chained
Columbus	LOCATION	, the history is unfolded episodically , with lyrical interludes .

		We quote the verses called '' Too Soon the Light . '' ''

		Blow , night winds , blow your kindly , mystic veil Athwart the rift made by the
Norseman	ORGANIZATION	's prow ; Let
Vineland	LOCATION	slumber yet awhile in peace , Lulled by her guardian ocean 's melodies .

		Hide once again this earthly paradise .

		Whose waters flow unvexed , whose limpid streams Leap in sweet Freedom 's haunts , where fearless drink All her wild creatures , in her love secure ; Whose forest wilds , untouched by the woodman 's axe , In their primeval glory undefiled .

		Murmur their joy unto caressing winds .

		Too soon the light !

		the world is moving slow ; These shores be for its riper heritage ! ''

		This poem was written for the Phi Beta Kappa Soci - ety of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		It is supplemented by '' Com - ing of the
Nations	ORGANIZATION	, '' a series of lyrical outpourings supposed to express the feelings of the various na - tionalities that have come to people the new world .

		From Miss
Alice Wilson	PERSON	's '' Actaeon 's
Defense	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Poems , '' we select this love-sonnet for its note of sincerity and quiet charm . ''

		By all the ways of life I come to thee : Along the highroad of my common day In the full glare of trials that betray The frailties of my nature ; I come to thee Along the woodpaths of my fantasy Where once my virgin spirit loved to stray In lone delight ; and when I climb to lay My burst of rapture near eternity ; I come through vales where vespers have been ringing , What time my heart is touched with solemn grace ; And last , with spirit ` neath its sorrow stinging , I reach thee in its secret mourning place .

		Thou my horizon art , my life enringing And o'er it like a star is set thy face . ''

		We do not quite understand how a '' burst '' may be laid , but the poem as a whole is acceptable .

		As the title would indicate , classical themes are some - times chosen by
Miss Wilson	ORGANIZATION	for treatment .

		We strongly suspect that she imagines '' Iphigenia '' to be accented upon its third syllable , and
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's tolerance of this fault is hardly enough to excuse it .

		Old clothes , old furniture , and old fashions are the chief themes of Miss
Ellen Brainerd Peck	PERSON	's '' Songs by the Sedges . ''

		A neat example is `` The Spinet . '' ''

		On the tinkling notes , and faint , Of the spinet old and quaint , Once pretty hands oft lightly strayed , Coaxing gentle melodies , From tiie slender ivory keys .

		In days when dainty tunes were played .

		THE DIAL 209 '' In froek of dimity bedight .

		Of a fashion then the height .

		Perchance , some maid , demure and slim , Practiced here a canzonet , Or a gracefol minuet , In studied measure , queer and prim . ''

		Now untondied the keys lie hid ; Silence sleeps beneath the lid .

		And the voiceless spinet seems Haunted with refrains of song .

		That to other days belong And eloquent of olden dreams . ''

		Miss
Peck	PERSON	has a pretty fancy and a light touch , which are just the qualities needed for this sort of reminiscent verse .

		Miss
Coletta Ryan	PERSON	is the author of '' Songs in a Sun-Garden . ''

		She cries : '' Oh , let me sing I The sun , tie birds , the grief-defying trees Are joyous minstrels , playing with the breeze .

		Through field and forest gleeful echoes ring -- Oh , let me sing I '' But we doubt if the permission should be granted , in view of the rather futile character of the outpour - ings that foUow .

		* • A Lover 's Song '' is one of the few things afforded by this volume that are reason - ably acceptable . ''

		She is more golden than the golden sun .

		More silver than the silver moonlight 's glow ; More fair , more rare , more holy than the one I taught my heart to worship long ago ! ''

		She is more starry than the stars that fall Speechless beneath her beauty .

		In her eyes I see my bride , my heaven , and my all , -- My light , my love , my deathless Paradise . ''

		This is all very well , but it seems to be a little hard on the one of long ago , now so completely supplanted .

		Of • ' The Dream Child , and Other Verses , '' by Miss
Norma K. Bright	PERSON	, we can only say that they have neither melody nor felicity of phrase , that they are often rude and sometimes even ungrammatical in construction .

		Ambition , for example , is thus apostrophized : ' * Thou Spirit that fleeth so swiftly before me , How long have I thee pursued I Over meadows of green have I weariedly chased thee , But thou seem ` st ever my grasp to elude . ''

		We have small sympathy for the Czar of
Russia	LOCATION	in his present predicament , but even he deserves a better fate than to be made the victim of such verse as the following : '' A man is a man and a king ; As much a monarch as you !

		With a soul to dare and to do !

		Would you trample him low ?

		Have him bend and bow at your beck ?

		Put your foot , at will , on his neck ?

		The spirit cries ' justice ' loud ; What !

		Do you merely smile grim ?

		Smile as at childish whim ?

		Then zealously flee from him ? ''

Frog	ORGANIZATION	' * Own Book .

		The last ten years have witnessed a marked increase in the output o ^ books of natural history , nature books , and not a few excellent tales of unnatural history masquerading in the borders of the arid regions of pure -LRB- and , alas , too often dry -RRB- science .

		Publishers have awakened to the fact that there is a .

		growing demand for books in this field .

		The introduction of high-grade instruction in the natural sciences in the secondary schools , and the development of nature study in the graded schools , have created an intelli - gent constituency of no mean proportions , in whom natural history works of high standard conmmnd a quick appreciation .

		Not every candidate for favor has deserved success .

		Some have not reflected the essential scientific experience or training , and have consequently failed to develop the subject with due regard to proportionate values of its various phaseSi Others have sacrificed fact for effect , or have cov - ered too large a field in too superficial a manner ; while a few do not rise above the monotony of a mere clerical compilation .

		In the main , however , a high standard of scientific acctiracy has been attained , and improvement in form and in illustration has been marked in the general level during the past decade .

		The latest number in that series of high ^ grade works , '' The Nature Library '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Miss
Mary C. Diekerson	PERSON	's '' Frog Book , '' reaches the high-wat `` r mark of general excellence .

		The scope of the work is not too g ^ eat for the space allotted ; the treatment is scientific , thoroughly modern and up-to-date , reflecting current university standards .

		The iUnstrations are ample and in the main well chosen .

		The subject is treated comprehensively , and the matter is sufficiently va - ried to maintain the interest of the reader .

		Above all , it is no clerical compilation made for the market ^ ' but rather an enthusiastic recital of close and critical personal observation told without striving for effects The selection of material and the completeness and comprehensiveness of the treatment are commend - able .

		Little attention is paid to structural or ana - tomical matters .

		The introductory chapter deals with the distinction between batrachians and fishes and reptiles , development and metamorphoses , clas - sification , phylogeny , hibernation , poison , voice , color change , behavior , and distribution of the
Batrachia Salientia	LOCATION	, or frogs and toads .

		A well worked out key is provided for the identification of the North American species , and all technical terms are fully illustrated .

		The remainder of the book is given up to a detailed account of about sixty frog ^ , tree-toads , and toads , of this continent .

		Each is described briefly in the matter of color , measurements , and external characters , and a more or less extended account of its natural history follows .

		An extensive bibliography of scientific works and articles in jour - nals , dealing with the classification and natural hie - torj ' of these interesting animals , is appended .

		The 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, illustrations are plates by the color-printing process , in which the colors are portrayed with excellent gen - eral efBect and considerable fidelity to the actual colors in nature .

		There are also over three hundred well-executed half-tones from photographs by the author , -- frogs and hop-toads galore , front , rear , and side-view , in the water and out .

		In fact , there are almost too many toads for the best literary effect !

		The final plate , whose legend runs '' The bullfrog -- independent , self-composed , alert , '' is the embodi - ment of batrachian complacency .

		The subject of the portrait is evidently well pleased at the publicity he seems destined to acquire .

		`` Intermittent ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ '' ^
Rickett	PERSON	's `` Personal bwsu '' of Forces in Modern Literature '' -LRB- Dut - criticism .

		^ ^ j professes to be '' concerned rather with the ' personal equation ' of the writers discussed than with the purely literary aspects of their work .

		- .

		.

		The guiding principle in the selection of names has been to exhibit as great a diversity of tempera - ment as possible '' -LRB- p. vii . -RRB-

		.

		The writers considered are
Newman	PERSON	and
Martineau	PERSON	, representing the moral - ist type ;
Huxley	LOCATION	, the scientist ;
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, and
Rossetti	PERSON	, the poet ;
Dickens	PERSON	, the novelist ; Ha z - litt and De Quincey , the vagabond .

		There is an '' outline scheme of reading for students , '' and a drawing of the young
Rossetti	PERSON	, made by himself .

		As a matter of fact , the title \ i justified only by a few personal anecdotes that preface each lecture .

		For the rest , the book is devoted to somewhat dis - cursive literary criticism of the usual kind .

		Mr.
Rickett	PERSON	quotes from
Martineau	PERSON	the following sen - tence , which fairly represents our experience with this volume -LRB- p. 31 -RRB- : '' True criticism seems to me the recorded struggle of the reader 's mind into closer relations with an author whose intermittent bursts , helpful as they are , still do not enable him clearly to see his way . ''

		Mr.
Rickett	PERSON	has , we think , indulged himself too far in the method of '' intermittent bursts '' ; he leaves with us no impression of a well-considered singleness of aim .

		His style is choppy and disquiet - ing ; he does not permit us , in
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's phrase , '' to sail before the wind over the surface of an even - rolling eloquence . ''

		The eccentric paragraph divi - sions contribute not a little to this effect , and for these the '' colloquial form '' adopted by the writer is not an excuse .

		Many of the '' intermittent bursts , '' however , really show a sense of values and a preci - sion of imagery . ''

		The curative influence attributed to ' light rays , ' from which heat rays have been excluded , suggests an analogy with the influence of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's work .

		The ' heat rays ' of poetry find little place in his calm , meditative muse ; all that can fever or distract has been eliminated .

		What remains is a beneficent focus of cool light '' -LRB- p. 109 -RRB- .

		De Quincey 's literary style is '' like the purple haze of a
summer	DATE
evening	TIME	, through which we dimly apprehend the shape and contour of the scenery surrounding , all things taking on a strange hue and unsubstantiality '' -LRB- p. 209 -RRB- .

		There are a few errors in matters of fact .

		The '' Apologia '' was not New - man 's first book published after his conversion -LRB- p.l5 -RRB- ; nor was it the gifted author of '' Dodo '' who con - tributed the life of Rossetti to the '' English Men of Letters '' series -LRB- p. 223 -RRB- .

		And what , finally , is a '' liberal .

		High Anglican '' ?

		The progress of ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ Summer of
1904	DATE	the Govern - ctviiization in ment of the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	ap -
Central Africa	LOCATION	, pointed a commission of three to study the prevailing administrative system in
Central Africa	LOCATION	and to formulate suggestions for the amelio - ration of such evils as might be found to exist .

		The residts of this investigation have recently been given to the English-reading public through the medium of a small volume in the '' Questions of the Day '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- under the title of `` The Congo : A Report of the
Commission of Inquiry	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The mem - bers of the commission , -- de
Cuvelier	PERSON	,
Droogmans	PERSON	, and Liebrechts , -- are men of eminent ability , and it is safe to assume that their task has been performed with becoming thoroughness .

		All important dis - tricts of the
Congo	LOCATION	were visited , and at every stopping - place sessions were held in which testimony was taken from all officials , agents , missionaries , and natives who presented themselves to make complaints or to furnish information , and also from scores of persons specially summoned because supposed to possess unusual knowledge of conditions .

		Hospitals , prisons , schools , missions , and plantations were vis - ited , and the search was carried relentlessly into the offices of government employees and the counting - rooms of commercial agencies .

		The main topics taken up in the commission 's report are the land rSgime , taxation , military service , trade concessions , depopulation , and the administration of justice .

		In respect to all of these matters , numerous evils are pointed out : the arrogance of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	in appropriating alleged vacant lands , the oppressive - ness of the labor tax , the terrorism and cruelty resulting from quasi-military expeditions , the exploi - tation of the natives by agents of greedy commercial companies , and the lax jurisdiction of the territorial courts .

		Nevertheless , the conclusion of the report is that the twenty years which have elapsed since the creation of the
Free State	ORGANIZATION	have witnessed a tre - mendous improvement in conditions -- an advance from gross barbarism to at least an outward confor - mity with the rules of civilization .

		The slave-trade has disappeared , cannibalism has been practically suppressed , and sacrifices of human beings have be - come rare .

		The railroad , the telegraph , the postal system , the schools , churches , and hospitals , -- all born of yesterday , -- give the traveller the impres - sion that he is in a land which has long enjoyed the blessings of western civilization rather than one which but a quarter of a century ago was totally unknown and savage .

		It is the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	's opinion that , with the resources at its command , the Gov - ernment of the
Free State	ORGANIZATION	has achieved really re - markable things , and that it has but to continue its labors to bring about a satisfactory solution of the much-discussed
Congo	LOCATION	problem .


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 211 A noble life in the service of humanity .

		Success in the field of medicine is too often measured , in this commercial age , by extensive practice , exorbitant fees , or spectacular surgery .

		The patient work of the investigator in medical and sanitary science is rewarded , if at all , by a liWng pittance , and his discoveries attract but little public notice .

		Yet few men add more to the safety and comfort of human life .

		No discovery in the field of medicine in recent years has contributed so much to the safety of life and the stability of commerce , transportation , and industry , in the warm temperate and tropical climates , as that of Dr.
Walter Reed	PERSON	, who first conclusively proved that the mosquito is the active agent in the transmission of that scourge of the South , the yellow fever .

		The story of ''
Walter Reed	PERSON	and Yellow Fever '' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips &	ORGANIZATION	.

		Co. -RRB- has been written by Dr.
H. A. Kelly	PERSON	of
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Reed was a graduate of
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, and of medicine , at an early age ; he was an army surgeon in the far Southeast for many yeare , and took up his scientific work relatively late in life .

		During the Spanish war the opportunity came to him to carry out a series of critical experiments which proved beyond cavil that yellow fever is trans - ferable only by the bite of an infected mosquito or by transfusion of infected blood .

		The results of his discovery made it possible to stamp out yellow fever in
Cuba	LOCATION	within a year , where it had been entrenched for centuries ; and to reduce the mortality and check the spread of the disease , and eventually to stamp it out , in
New Orleans	LOCATION	, on the occasion of its last invasion of this country .

		Methods of quarantine have been made doubly eifective , and at the same time far less costly and disruptive of commerce and travel , by reason of Dr.
Reed	PERSON	's discovery .

		The story of his life reveals a man of the greatest fidelity ' to friends and duty , an heroic cliai-acter , and an inspira - tion to all who would serve humanity by a scientific study of the causes of the iUs of men .

		Incidentally the book gives a very full account of the long cam - paign of investigation waged against the yellow fever plague , and of the experiments which finally resulted in victory .

		Palestine '' ^ ^ ^ Development of Palestine Ex - on the surface ploration '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by Dr.
Fred	PERSON	- and beneath .

		gj.ick
Jones Bliss	PERSON	, the well-known explorer and lecturer , is an ambitious work covering in small compass a large tract of history .

		Explora - tion , in the sense of excavation , is practically a modern idea .

		All earlier attempts to understand and interpret the country were superficial , and did not achieve any notable results .

		Renan and his con - temporaries began a closer study of objects and ruins that pointed to the possibilities of larger things ; but the organization of the Palestine Exploration Fund marked the first attempt to study scientifically the land of the Israelites .

		Excavations were beg ^ n also on the site of
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, to ascertain facts re - garding the situation , size , and structure of the old city .

		Practically ever -RCB- ` thing that has been done of any real value in these fields falls within the last forty years .

		Dr.
Bliss	PERSON	sees great possibilities in future exploration and excavations when made by competent specialists .

		-- A very different book is that of an Italian lady ,
Matilde Serao	PERSON	, '' In the Country of Jesus '' -LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which takes its place in the lighter literature of its subject .

		Here we find many unusual out-of-the-way things , seen by the keen eye of an experienced traveller , woven by a devout Catholic Italian mind into an attractive and charm - ing narrative .

		At every point of interest -- as , for example , at
Bethel	LOCATION	or in
Galilee	LOCATION	, -- the author has caught and recorded things that nine-tenths of the travellers and writers would never see or think of mentioning .

		Devoutness , too , is found everywhere , except where the author attempts a bout with a dragoman or a cunning impostor .

		Her picturesque narrative is illustrated by a few first-class half - tones of some of the choicest scenes on the jour - ney .

		The evident enthusiasm of the writer enlivens the M'hole story , and makes the reader feel like en - gaging quarters on the next steamer to
Jaffa	LOCATION	, that he too may be stirred by the same sights and scenes .

		Telling and Everyone who is interested in the
Bible	LOCATION	sto ' - iei religious instruction of children will for the vounsi .

		welcome Mrs.
Houghton	PERSON	's '' Telling Bible Stories '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		There are certainly few subjects in which the need for help is greater ; for even the most conscientious mother is often baffled , as Mrs.
Houghton	PERSON	says , by the question , '' Knowing as I do that the Old Testament is not precisely such a book as I was taught to think it , and not knowing as yet precisely what sort of book it is , how shall I interpret it to my children ? ''

		Mrs.
Houghton	PERSON	an - swers this question in a way likely to satisfy a ' l but the most conservative .

		She believes in two broad principles , -- first , that the Old Testament , which is `` the marvellous and accurate revelation of human nature in all its elemental characteristics , '' is of all books best adapted to the child , who is the true representative of the essential elements of human nature ; and , second , that the right method of telling Bible stories is not to insist upon their truth as a matter of historic fact , but to ask what is their true meaning .

		This , as Dr.
Mimger	PERSON	reminds us in his excellent Introduction to the book , was the method of the Head-Master of
Uppingham	LOCATION	, who always said to his boys , * ' Never mind whether the story is true or not ; what does it mean ? ''

		Mrs.
Houghton	PERSON	does not re-tell many of the stories , but recommends ad - herence to the Bible wording , since `` poetic imagery never puzzles the child until we begin to explain it to him . ''

		She classifies the stories into groups for children of different ages -- a group of '' Morning Stories '' for the very little folk , of '' Hero and Ro - mance Stories '' for those next older , and of `` Purpose Stories '' for growing young people ; and she inter - prets a large number of them in an interesting and suggestive way .

		It is a pity that so excellent a book has no index .

		212 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, BRIEFER MENTION .

		A companion volume to his '' Choice of Books '' has been prepared by Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, and is en - titled '' Memories and Thoughts : Men , Books , Cities , Art . ''

		The forty chapters of which it consists are partly autobiographical , and have a delightful width of scope , as indicated by the title .

		It is the fine tone , the genial atmosphere , the rich suggestiveness , of Mr *
Harrison	PERSON	's writings that attract the reader and win him over to the cause of good literature .

		These attributes , rather than any specific advice on the choice of books , will help to keep the dust from settling on the classics on our library shelves .

		To pursue a prescribed course of reading is labor and sorrow , and the wisdom of those who counsel such pursuit is foolishness , unless perhaps in the case of very young readers .

		The series of `` Heroes of the Nations '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- must of necessity include a biography of
America	LOCATION	's greatest hero ,
George Washington	PERSON	, and this has now appeared from the pen of a Virginian , Professor
James A. Harri	PERSON	- son .

		The book is written with enthusiasm for the subject , and for the state and the life therein during Washing - ton 's time .

		But while it is interesting as a general description of times and conditions , it lacks clearness and definiteness as a biography .

		It aims to portray the patriot , soldier , statesman ; it does show
Washington	LOCATION	as a patriot from his own letters as well as from his deeds , but it gives almost nothing about him as a soldier except rhapsody , and passes over in a few scanty pages the fateful period of his presidency .

		Rhetorical descrip - tions abound , and there are digressions not a f `` w ; but the portrait presented in the work is hazy and inade - quate in all that relates to
Washington	LOCATION	's public life .

		It is not long that university men have been giving attention to the problems of the elementary school , but in recent days the men of practical training are tak - ing up the discussion of school problems , and essays and addresses on educational subjects are becoming more frequent .

		Thus university professors are coming to exert the influence that they ought to exert both upon the school course and the spirit of the schools .

		Among the more sensible and practical of these is Professor Jere -
miah W. Jenks	PERSON	, who has put into a small volume under the title '' Citizenship and the Schools '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- nine of the addresses and articles produced by him during the last twenty years .

		The prominent thought of most of these papers is the training of children and young people into a sense of their social obligation and civic duty .

		Besides these we find '' Education for
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, the Far East '' that ought to be worth many thousands of dollars to the manufacturers and merchants of our country ; a theoretical `` Critique of Educational Values '' ; and an elaborate article on '' School-book Legislation , '' written fifteen years ago when the subject was especially prominent , but brought down to date . ''

		The Fair Maid of
Perth	LOCATION	, '' the last of
Scott	PERSON	's really good novels , is commended by Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	in his recent life of Sir
Walter	PERSON	.


Simon Glover	PERSON	's beautiful daughter , when she condescends to dismount from her high stilts , is very natural and human and winsome , as Mr.
Lang	PERSON	says ; but the poor girl is made to talk like a book , and a very correct and pious book too , almost every time she opens her mouth .

		Scott 's spirit of chivalry , which , as is well known , hindered any near approach to realism in his treatment of his heroines , here operates to the full .

		The clan combat in the story is called by Mr.
Lang	PERSON	'' one of the best in fiction . ''

		But who can recall without a shudder that horrible butch - ery , deliberately planned by the
King	PERSON	's covincillors , and grimly executed by thirty foemen on a side within an enclosed space whence there was no escape except for the last survivor ?

		One feels that the great artist here fails to realize what it is he is setting forth in such brave colors .

		Interesting is the biographer 's note that '' in Conachar , who ' has drunk the milk of the white doe , ' his foster mother ,
Scott	PERSON	expiates his extreme harshness to a ne'er - do-well brother , who had shown the white feather in the
West Indies	LOCATION	'' -- and whom , except to supply him with money .

		Sir
Walter	PERSON	would have nothing to do with thereafter .

		Notes . ''

		On Reading , '' an essay by Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, which appeared some months ago as a contribution to the now defunct '' International Quart `` rly , '' is published as a booklet by
Messrs. Fox	ORGANIZATION	,
Duffield , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The acquisitive impulse shows itself unmistakably in the passion for collecting and collections .

		Some have been known to find pleasure even in the collecting of strings .

		Miss
Carolyn Wells	PERSON	now adds to her collec - tions of the lighter forms of literature a '' Whimsey Anthology , '' which will soon appear , to gladden the hearts of the whimsical .

		The question of the authorship of '' Truth Dexter '' and '' The Breath of the Gods '' is now settled . ''


Sidney McCall	PERSON	'' proves to be Mrs.
Ernest F. Fenollosa	PERSON	.

		The title-page of the novel , '' The Dragon Painter , '' to be published this month by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, will bear the name of
Mary McNeill Fenollosa	PERSON	as its author and as author of the other two books above named . ''

		Experimental Physiology and Anatomy for High Schools , '' by Mr.
Walter HoUis Eddy	PERSON	, is a text-book prepared to cover the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	entrance requirements .

		It is a publication of the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	, from whom we have also '' Half Hours with Fishes , Reptiles , and Birds , '' an '' eclectic reading '' prepared by Profes - sor
C. F. Holder	ORGANIZATION	, and Professor
W. C. Morey	PERSON	's '' Out - lines of Ancient History . '' ''

		A Bibliography of the History of the
United States Navy	ORGANIZATION	, '' compiled by Mr.
Charles T. Harbeck	PERSON	and re - vised and edited by Miss
Agnes C. Boyle	PERSON	, has just been privately printed by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		at the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	, in an edition of 350 copies .

		This is said to be the first attempt to gather into book form bibliographical material relating to the history of the
United States Navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Statistics , which we know can prove anything , but which in this instance appear not untrustworthy , have been compiled to show the fate of magazine publication in
Chicago	LOCATION	-- using the word '' magazine '' in a some - what elastic sense .

		Out of more than three himdred periodicals started here , forty-nine per cent , lived but a year or less , only a quarter of the number struggled on for five years , and no more than twelve per cent , are now alive .

		Of these thirty-six , nearly half are under five years old .

		But a high rate of mortality -- infant mortality at that -- is common among periodical publi - cations everywhere ; and this is especially true in the early history of a community or a region .

OREGON	LOCATION	A TALE OF TWO SHORES By
EVA EMERY	PERSON	DYE Author of `` McLouGHLiN of Old Oregon , '' `` The Conquest , '' etc. .

		MRS. DYE has now established her unequalled position as the historian-novelist of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not only is her knowledge and authority beyond question , but she has developed the possibilities of history in fiction form farther than any other American writer .

		The chance casting away of a party of Japanese on the
Oregon	LOCATION	coast many years ago inspired
Ronald McDonald	PERSON	, a fully historical personage , to enact a similar drama in his own proper self with the characters and continents reversed .

		In
Japan	LOCATION	he was permitted to establish a school , and it was actually his pupils who acted as interpreters during the negotiations with
Commodore Perry	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
Dye	PERSON	learned her facts from
McDonald 's	ORGANIZATION	own lips , and only deferred publication until his papers finally reposed in her hands .

		NOTES 24 `` ; LIST OF NEW BOOKS 247 THE NOTE OF MODERNITY . ''

		There are still those who view all modem work wath timorou.s suspicion , '' says a wTiter iii a recent English jjeriodieal ; `` to them I would pleatl for a jn.ster vision of the artistic possi - bilities which lie before lis , in the near future ; plead for a realization of the fact tliat modemit -RCB- - does not ueces.sarily sjiellaifectation , tliat uovelty of technique and idea neetl not be ephemeral , but that the workei-s of every age must seek new tools , and that the age which is now on us calls for utterly different methods of expression from those of the past ; plead also for recognition of the fact that the cla.ssics of tomoiTow are lieing created to - < lay . ''

		The substantial soundness of the view thus expi-es-sed is obvaous enough , and the history of genius exemplifies it in manifold instances .

		All art tends to become fossilized under the pressure of precept and ti-adition , and can save itself fi-om death only by a succession of fresh deijai-tiires .

		And every artist knows , as
Wagner	PERSON	did , '' That art is still athirst For water from the deep aiid living
spring	DATE	Of nature , that of all its aims the first Is beauty , that death 's bondage it must burst In every age anew , and boldly fling Aside the cerements that about it cling . ''

		Nevertheless , the writer whom we have qiiote < l seems to be neetUessly concerned .

		The '' new thing , '' whether in literature or music or paint - ing , is likely to get too large , rather than too small , a shai-e of the attention of our ciuious and restless modern public .

		The time is past when a bright light coidd remain long concealed under a bushel , and the present danger is rather that we may mistake a farthing dip for a beacon .

		The artistic atmosphere is so surchargetl with electri - city that we get sparks from the most unexpectetl sources .

		We caught the conservative ' •
Satur	PERSON	- day Review '' afew weeks ago complaining of Mr.
Alfretl Austin	PERSON	because -- of all reasons !

		-- his poems fail to strike the modern note as we heai * it in the lucubrations of ^ Ir .


Bernanl Shaw	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		When such a plaint is heard from such a quarter , we shoidd say that the timr had come , not to rally under the banner of modern - ity , but rather to champion more stoutly than ever before what has been tried and approved i-ather than what is ex -RSB- -RRB- erimental and of dubious wortlu 226 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, Confining our attention to art in its literary manifestations , let us attempt some sort of analysis of what the term '' modernity '' means when thus used as a shibboleth or watchword .

		In the first place , it nearly always means some form of marked novelty in expression .

		No mat - ter how shallow a writer 's thought , and how empty his mind of all real ideas , if he can con - trive to give his work a certain pungency by the use of strange vocables in unexpected colloca - tions he will pass as an original thinker with readers who do not think for themselves .

		A deft employment of the catchwords of the clique , or of those phrases which are the ripples of the fash - ionable literary current , will win for him the reputation of being abreast of the latest thought .

		K , in addition to this journalistic instinct for actuality , he develope an aptitude for paradox , his admirers will multiply ; for paradox always suggests , to minds that can not sound its hollo w - ness , concealed reserves of intellectual energy .

		If , finally , he become boldly radical , and denounce as prejudices the most cherished beliefs and the most solemn convictions of the serious-minded , he may become the founder of a cidt and find himself invested with the robes of the prophet .

		Some sort of novelty , then , achieved at no matter what cost of beauty or sanity , is an es - sential part of the equipment of the `` modem '' in literature .

		The semblance of freshness thus acquired , the pretence of original thought thus exploited , will impose upon many minds , and , to use
Bismarck	PERSON	's famous description of Lord
Salisbury	PERSON	, the '' lath painted to look like iron '' will deceive most careless observers .

		The cour - age which prompts this pose is that of ignorance rather than of conviction , but the credulity of those who accept it for what it appears may be trusted to bear the strain .

		It is from ignorance of the most invincible kind that these novelty - mongers derive their self-assurance , and it is the same proud possession that prevents their fol - lowing from ever discovering how false are the gods of their worship .

		To make the pose com - plete , a herald of the new enlightenment must affect a scornful condescension toward his prede - cessors in the particular field he may have chosen , and he may rely upon his henchmen to better the instruction thus offered .

		So we sometimes witness the instructive spectacle of a Shavian or an Omarian patronizing the great poets and dram - atists , of a Nietzschian or a Spencerian consign - ing aU past philosophers to the rubbish-heap .

		When we hear some contemporary writer acclaimed as a typical representative of the modern spirit , it means at best no more than that he falls in with the intellectual fashion of the day , and is the puppet of his environment rather than a shaper of new issues .

		At worst , it means that he is a conscious time-saver rather than a devoted knight of the spirit .

		The favorite of the hour may seem to be the very incarnation of modernity -- but it is for the hour only .

		Soon he will be seen to have been but a unit in a long procession of barely remembered figures , while some one of his contemporaries , unappreciated when living , may be seen to have been the truer modern , in the sense that his thought really anticipated the now realized future .

		It is not in the market-place , but in the den , '' In far retreats of elemental mind , '' that the problems are worked out whereby mankind grows in spiritual stature .

		In a broad sense ,
Goethe	PERSON	was the gTeatest of all the mod - ems , and we now imderstand this fact far better than it was ever understood when he was alive .

		The conservative attitude toward literary innovation is doubtless the only safe one to assume , although a too rigid conservatism has its dangers also .

		But there is nowadays so much noisy trumpeting of unimportant \ \ Titers that we shall be right nine times out of ten in view - ing such cases with suspicion , and in remaining imperturbed by the clamor .

		Schopenhauer dis - coursed wisely upon many subjects , but upon none more wisely than upon this .

		By way of conclusion , we may suitably reproduce some of his words : '' The history of literature generally shows all those who made knowledge and insight their goal to have remained unrecognized and neglected whilst those who paraded with the vain show of it received the admira - tion of their contemporaries , together with the emolu - ments ... It is a prime condition for doing any great work -- any work which is to outlive its own age , that a man pay no heed to his contemporaries , their views and opinions , and the praise or blame which they bestow .

		This condition is , however , fulfilled of itself when a man really does anything great , and it is fortunate that it is so .

		For if , in producing such a work , he were to look to the general opinion on the judgment of his col - leagues , they would lead him astray at every step .

		Hence , if a man wants to go down to posterity , he must withdraw from the influence of his own age . ''

		A NEW MASTER OF ENGLISH PROSE , AND SOME THEORIES OF VALUE .

		In entering upon a somewhat extended consid - eration of the work of a new English writer , Mr.
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	, may we unmask ourselves at once with the frank avowal that we regard him as one of the greatest living masters of English prose , and his views of life as representing the most
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 227 enlightened and reassuring ideals of a groping and troubled age ?

		If his books are not destined to out - last the pyramids , he wiU at any rate escape Libitina for many generations , and our literature is appreci - ably richer for his contributions .

		Moreover , it is safe to predict that 31r .


Dickinson	PERSON	will come into his own not altogether slowly ; for , despite the baneful sweep of utilitai-ianism , we do respond in some measure to the call of the ideal and the beautiful ; despite dis - heartening and deadly failures , we feel that , even in our daily round , '' Life it is that conquei `` s and death it is that dies . ''

		If this is true , our
Cambridge	LOCATION	essayist may expect from his age a favorable verdict not long deferred , for in his pages the cause of Life and Hope and Beauty is pleaded with the convinc - ing power of an able mind and the winning charm of an almost perfect style .

		Before speaking as an advocate , however , he has examined as a judge ; and his plea for the things which are better appears as a natural result of an investigation at once reasonable , penetrating , and sympathetic , into the world about him and the vari - ous standards of life .

		In his '' Modem SjTnposium , '' for instance , we have as participants a torj ' , a liberal , a conservative , a socialist , an anarchist , a professor , a man of science , a poet , a gentleman of leisure , a member of the
Society of Friends	ORGANIZATION	, and a man of letters ; and in every case the speaker puts his views so well that the most ardent advocate of the partic - ular doctrine or theory could hardly desire a more attractive exposition thereof .

		To take an extreme case of this clairvoyant sympathy with the views of others , let us write down part of a speech from the lips of
Angus MacCarthy	PERSON	, the anarchist : '' • Oh I ' he broke out , ' if I could but g ^ t you to see that this whole order under ■ which you live is artificial and nnnec - cessary I But vre are befogged by the systems we impose upon our imagination and call science .

		We hare been taught to regard history as a necessary process , until we come to think it must also be a good one ; that all that has ever hapK pened ought to have happened just so and no otherwise .

		And thus we justify everything past and present , however palpably in contradiction with our own intuitions .

		But these are mere figments of the brain .

		History , for the most part , believe me , is one gigantic error and crime .

		It ought to have been other than it was ; and we ought to be other than we are .

		There is no natural and inevitable evolution towarda good ; no cooperating with the universe , other than by con - nivance at its crimes .

		That little house the brain builds to shelter its own weakness must be torn down if we would fac `` the truth and pursue the good .

		Then we shall see amid what blinding storms of wind and rain , what darkness of elements hostile or indifferent , our road lies across the mountains to - wards the city of our desire .

		Then and then only shall we understand the spirit of revolution .

		That there are things so bad that they can only be burnt up by fire ; that there are obstructions so immense that they can only be exploded by dynamite : that the work of destruction is a necessary pre - liminary to the work of creation , for it is the destruction of the prison walls wherein the spirit is confined ; and that in that work the spirit itself is the only agent , unhelped by powers of nature or powers of a world beyond .

		-- that is the creed -- no , I will not say the creed , that is the insight and vision by which we of the Revolution live .

		By that I believe we shall triumph .

		But whether we triumph or no .

		otir life itself is a victory , for it is a life lived in the spirit .

		To shat - ter material bonds that we mav bind the closer the bonds of the soul , to slough dead husks that we may liberate living forms , to abolish institutions that we may evoke energies , to put off the material and put on the spiritual body , that , whether we fight with the tongue or the sword , is the inspir - ation of our movement , that , and that only , is the trae and inner meaning of anarchy . ' ''

		How many of us ever dreamed of anarchy voiced in words like these ?

		And yet
MacCarthy	ORGANIZATION	is possibly the speaker with whom the master of the banquet -LRB- who is , of course , 3 > Ir .

		Dickinson in propria persona -RRB- has least sympathy .

		In our own experience , each new page left us more convinced that we were deal - ing with a man who had seen the whole in its parts and the parts in the whole , who had kept his feet upon solid earth while his eyes were turned to the signals from the heights , so that with each step we found ourselves more willing to follow his upward leadership .

		And the heights to which he leads us , or rather to which he invites us to climb by his side , are always beautiful , albeit occasionally dimly des - cried by myopic eyes or not qmte to be scaled by the waj ` faring man .

		The greatest height , indeed , he himself never confidently achieves ; for he con - cludes his dialogue on ' • The Meaning of Grood , '' a search for reality , with a glorious allegorical vision , and waking from it says : `` So that I have had to go on ever since with the know - ledge I then acquired , that whatever Reality may tdtimately be , it is in the life of the affections , with all its confused tangle of loves and hates , attractions , repulsions , and , worst of all , indifferences , it is in this intricate commerce of souls tiiat we may come nearest to apprehending what perhaps we shall never wholly apprehend , but the quest of which alone , as I believe , gives any significance to life , and makes it a thing which a wise and brave man will be able to persuade himself it is right to endure .

		^ Accordingly , with his great Greek master and not a few others from the kings of thought , he seems to end his climbing in a cloud ; but it is a cloud light - ened by hope rather than darkened by despair , and enforces the thought that ** They see not clearliest who see all things clear . ''

		To other peaks , however , he leads us , where the vista is as clear as it is beauti - ful , and even the paths through the lower lying valleys have their own appropriate charm .

		The themes treated by Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	are not new , nor does the form of his treatment offer any innovation .

		Religion , the meaning of good , litera - ture , art in general , -- in short , the thingfs of the mind and the spirit , -- are treated in essay or dia - logue or letter , and we do not need to be reminded that these forms were brought to artistic perfection in olden days .

		The fact is merely that having chosen immortal topics he has treated them with not less largeness of outlook than clearness of inward vision , and has exhibited unerring judgment and unfailing skill in adapting his form to his matter .

		Thus he is manifestly right in his feeling that a discussion of the meaning of good belongs * ' to the sphere of right opinion and perception , rather than to that of logic and demonstration , and seems therefore to be prop - erly approached in the tentative spirit favoured by the Dialogue form '' ; nor can we refuse to agree that 228 The dial -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, this literary form comes closest to the interchange of actual conversation , '' from which we gain our best lights on such a subject . ''

		The same unerring instinct or judgment leads him to put his contrast between
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and Western ideals -LRB- '' Letters from a Chinese Official '' -RRB- in the form of letters from an enlightened Chinaman who has resided long in En - gland without losing his affection for his native land and all that it represents .

		Howbeit , other men are writing on these same eternal subjects without fail - ing to choose approj ^ riate garb therefor , so that we are driven to the jirovocative statement that our author treats the themes with greater power than most of his contemporaries and makes the appro - priate garb more beautiful .

		In the nature of things , it is impossible to justify such a statement by frag - mentary excerpts and curtailed arguments ; but we should be thoroughly surprised if many intelligent readers should rise from a perusal of Mr.
Dickin	PERSON	- son 's works with any strong dissent from the judg - ment we have submitted .

		Recognizing freely this impossibility , we must still face the duty of giving at least an adumbration of our author 's position with reference to some of the central themes of life , and we may as well fail on Religion as on any other subject .

		His attitude , then , in marred and imperfect form , is about this : I. Religious truth is attainable , if at all , only by the method of science .

		There is no `` revelation '' in the accepted usage of the term .

		II .

		Religion is a `` reaction of the imagination upon the world as we conceive it in the light at once of truth and of the ideal , '' which amounts to saying that religion is a certain attitude toward life , willing to recognize the helpfulness of ideas not based on definitely ascertained truth .

		III .

		If this definition is too wide , we should con - sider that there is something between hope and faith , but nearer to the latter and called by its name , -- an attitude of '' • active expectancy , the attitude of a man who , while candidly recognizing that he does not know , and faithfully pursuing or awaiting knowledge , and ready to accept it when it comes , yet centres meantime his emotional and therefore his practical life about a possibility which he selects be - cause of its value or its desirability . ''

		In other words , for practically all men there must be a '' voli - tional assumption , '' not based upon knowledge , as to the worth-whileness of existence , if life is to be most noble and most fruitful .

		The objections to such a view were too manifest to escape our thinker , and he has stated them fairly , thereby relieving us from enlarging upon them ; and we may merely point out that this is the faith not of an ecclesiastic but of a platonizing philosopher .

		And yet , with the more recent work of our author before him Mr.
Gilbert Chesterton	PERSON	could not have written his flamboyant if futile chapter on Neo - Paganism .

		Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	does not attempt '' merely to revive the pagan idea of a simple and rational self-comjiletion . ''

		Rather , he looks for the tide of noblest spiritual progress where the lustrous and rapturous river from the pagan springs of Love and Beauty and Wisdom meet the more sober stream of ideals from the fountain of Christianity .

		The last speaker in the Symposium , who '' expressed himself in a style too intellectual for lovers of poetry , too metaphorical for lovei 's of philosophy , '' voices the thought in this glowing deliverance uttered in the glamor of the dawn .

		`` It is only in the soil of Paganism that Christianity can come to maturity .

		And Faith , Hope , Charity , are but seeds of themselves till they fall into the womb of Wisdom ,
Beauty	ORGANIZATION	, and Love .

		Olpiipus lies before us , the snow-capped mountain .

		Let us climb it .

		together , if you will , not some on the corpses of the rest ; but climb at least , not fester and swann on rich meadows of equality .

		We are not for the vallej ' , nor for the forests or the pastures .

		If we be brothers , yet we are brothers in a < iuest , needing our foremost to lead .

		Aphrodite ,
Apollo	LOCATION	,
Athene	PERSON	, are before us .

		not behind .

		Majestic forms , they gleam among the snows .

		March , then , men in Man I '' If we add this half-mystic flight to the formal state - ment essayed above we shall probably draw as near to the inner sanctum as our philosopher-priest cares to allow the profane to approach without longer service ; and even those who can not accept his relig - ion and worship in his spu'it nnist feel their hearts quickened and their lives enlarged from visiting the courts of the temple by his side .

		From his views on art and literature there will be fewer dissenters .

		Where can we find anything on letters more exqiiisite than the sentiments of our Chinese official ? ''

		Our poets and literary men have taught their successors , for long generations , to look for good , not in wealth , not in power , not in miscellaneous activity , but in a ti-ained , a choice , an exquisite appreciation of the most simple and universal relations of life .

		To feel , and in order to feel to express , or at least to understand the expression of all that is lovely in
Nature	LOCATION	, of all that is poignant and sensitive in man , is to us in itself a sufficient end .

		A rose in a moonlit garden , the shadow of trees on the turf , almond bloom , scent of pine , the wine-cup and the guitar ; these and the pathos of life and death , the long embrace , the hand stretched out in vain , the moment that glides forever away , with its freight of music and light , into the shadow and hush of the haunted past , all that we have , all that eludes us , a bird on the wing , a perfume escaped on the gale , -- to all these things we are trained to respond , and the response is what we call literature . ''

		Hardly less effective is the treatment of Art in the dialogue on ' • The Meaning of Good , '' a treatment almost as perfect in its way as the well-known stanzas quoted from the '' Ode to a Grecian Urn '' in the course of the discussion , to which we can only allude .

		Again , in the third or central chapter of the essays on Religion we may find the following thoughts on the contribution of architecture to re - ligion . ''

		It has raised the material habitation of the Divine , and in doing so has reflected , I think , by a perhaps unconscious symbolism , the forms in which tliat Divine has been con - ceived .

		Surely , at least , one might question whether the difiPerence between a classical temple and a Gothic church is to be attributed only to a difference of climate , or of technical skill and tradition .

		It would be a curiously happy chance , if it were merely chance , that made the house destined for the abode of one of the bright Olympians a i -RRB- alace of gleam -

''

		One recognizes throughout the doctrine of Goethe that art rests fundamentally on a kind of religious sense , and therefore unites so readUy with religion ; but one recognizes also an insistence with
Morris	PERSON	on the possibilities of an intimacy and tenderness of art that shall allow it to become more easily an integral part of our daily lives .

		Foregoing the pleasure of commenting on other phases of Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	's works , we must content ourselves with a brief mention of his attitude to our own land .

		To the present reviewer he seems to be absolutely fair and candid , albeit his candor is of the unflinching sort .

		Far too many of his readers both in
America	LOCATION	and in
England	LOCATION	will be prone to find his final verdict in the speech of
Arthur Ellis	PERSON	, the travelled journalist , and inasmuch as that contri - butor 's arraignment of our '' worship of acceleration '' and our '' doctrine of progress '' is not less quotable than powerful , the reviewers and others wiU be sure to keep it before the public .

		Herein , however , we should be erring grievously ; for
Ellis	PERSON	, although the giver of the intellectual feast regards his attack as formidable , sits down amid a '' hubbub of laugh - ter , approval , and protest , confusedly mixed '' ; and a little later Sir
John Harington	PERSON	, a gentleman of leisure interested mainly in art , takes up the jour - nalist 's diatribe with the expression of a strong hope that the better age for artistic interests may after all dawn in
America	LOCATION	.

		But from neither journalist nor artist should we accept our essayist 's real views , which may be best understood from his own delib - erate words in the introduction to the American edition of the '' Letters from a Chinese Official . '' ''

		For it is impossible not to recognize that the destinies of
Europe	LOCATION	are closely bound up with those of this country ; and that what is at stake in the development of the
American Republic	ORGANIZATION	is nothing less than the success or failure of Western civilization .

		Endowed , above all the nations of the world , with intelligence , energy and force , unhampered by the splen - did ruins of a past which , however great , does but encumber , in the old world , with fears , hesitations , and regrets , the diffi - cult march to the promised land of the future , combining the magnificent enthusiasm of youth with the wariness of maturer years , and animated by a confidence almost religious in their own destiny , the American people are called upon , it would seem , to determine , in a preeminent degree , the form that is to be assumed by the society of the future .

		Upon them hangs the fate of the Western world . ''

		One who did not know many sides of
Cambridge	LOCATION	would hardly be prepared to hear this voice from her academic shades ; but , having heard it , one feels no serious rebellion against this other assertion about
America	LOCATION	: '' For a century past she has drawn to herself , by an irre - sistible attraction , the boldest , the most masterful , the most practically intelligent of the spirits of
Europe	LOCATION	; just as , by the same law , she has repelled the sensitive , the contempla - tive , and the devout .

		Unconsciously , by the mere fact of her existence , she has sifted the nations ; the children of the Spirit have slipped through the iron net of her destinies , but the children of the World she has gathered into her gran - aries .

		She has thus become , in a sense peculiar and unique , the type and exemplar of the Western world .

		Over her unen - cumbered plains the
Genius of Industry	ORGANIZATION	ranges unchallenged , naked , unashamed . ''

		With the spirit of these words from the aged uni - versity beside the Cam , who shall quarrel ?

		Nay , is it not the best evidence of our strides toward health - ful manhood that we have no longer the childish and neuralgic sensitiveness we manifested under the searching criticism of a gifted son from the sister university on the
Isis	ORGANIZATION	?

		Such critics as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	must help us to receive '' the spirit of the world that created manners , laws , religion , and art , -- which is hovering even now at our gates in quest of a new and more perfect incar - nation . ''

		Well will it be for us , and for the world at large , if this incarnation is achieved while our nation is yet young and time itself has not grown old .

		For a consideration of Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	's styleper se , we have little space remaining .

		However , the fore - going quotations have spoken for themselves , and we may limit our excerpts to one example of simple description , perhaps the most difficult form of artis - tically effective prose .

		It is introduced by the author in partial answer to the query as to what manner of men these Orientals are . ''

		Far away in the
East	LOCATION	, under sunshine such as you never saw -LRB- for even such light as you have you stain and infect with sooty smoke -RRB- , on the shore of a broad river , stands the house where I was bom .

		It is one among thousands ; but every one stands in its own garden , simply painted in white or gray , modest , cheerful , and clean .

		For many mUes along the valley , one after the other , they lift their blue or red - tiled roofs out of a sea of green ; while here and there glitters out over a clump of trees the gold enamel of some tall pagoda .

		The river , crossed by frequent bridges and crowded with barges and junks , bears on its clear stream the traffic of thriving village-markets .

		For prosperous peasants people all the district , owning and tilling the fields their fathers owned and tilled before them .

		The soil on which they work , they may say , they and their ancestors have made .

		For see I almost to the summit what once were barren hills are waving green with cotton and rice , sugar , oranges , and tea .

		Water drawn from the river-bed girdles the slojies with silver ; and falling from channel to channel in a thousand bright cascades , plashing in cisterns , chuckling in pipes , soaking and oozing in the soil , distributes freely to all alike fertility , verdure , and life .

		Hour after hour you may traverse , by tortuous paths , over tiny bridges , the works of the generations who have passed , the labors of their children of to-day ; till you reach the point where man succumbs and
Nature	ORGANIZATION	has her way , covering the highest crags with a mantle of azure and gold and rose , gardenia , clematis , azalea , growing luxiuiantly wild .

		How often here have I sat for hours in a silence so intense that as one of our poets has said , ' you may hear the shadows of the trees rustling on the ground ' ; a silence broken only now and again from far below by voices of labor - ers calling across the water-courses , or , at evening or dawn , 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	'' by the sound of gongs summoning to worship from the tem - ples in the valley .

		Such silence !

		Such sounds !

		Such perfume !

		Such color !

		The senses respond to their objects ; they g ^ ow exquisite to a degree you can not well conceive in your northern climate ; and beauty pressing in from without moulds the spirit and mind insensibly to harmony with herself . ''

		To borrow from an old critic , anybody could write that except those who have tried .

		But with our excerpts before us we feel most keenly that they have utterly failed to convey any idea of the charm of the complete works , and we fear we should feel the same even in the presence of the better selection that any of our readers could have made .

		Of the various works we have mentioned , the '' Modern Symposium '' seems to us the finest , al - though the others in their own way achieve an ex - cellence that need not fear comparison and will doubtless be preferred by not a few readers .

		The scene of the masterpiece is laid on a Sussex terrace in the month of
June	DATE	, and the dialogue , or rather the series of monologues , lasts from the late evening light to the dawn ; but the reader feels that there was never a flagging moment from the opening speech of the comfortably discouraged Tory speaking appropriately after a comfortable dinner , to the semi - oracular utterance of the poet-philospher speaking with even greater appropriateness while the glamor of dawn passed into the clear light of morning .

		Every character is made to speak in the language and style one feels inevitable .

		Indeed , one could easily transfer the speakers from the printed page to their accustomed walks of life , and in some cases could assign a definite name .

		There is not a faulty word at any turn , nor the least suspicion of striving for effect .

		The very transitions from character to character seem to bind the parts together and dis - appear in their service .

		Never has art been con - cealed more skilfuUy than in these pages , where Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	is most himself .

		In many of his other writings one can put a hand on this passage or that , and murmur
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, Landor , Pater ; but in this work one feels strongly only the great master of them all , who wrote the parent Symposium .

		And perhaps one could pay no greater tribute to the con - temporary Symposium than to say it is not unworthy to stand beside the Platonic original .

		Of course it falls far short of the older diaglogue in imaginative range , -- which is merely saying that it does not attain the unattainable and ought not to be com - pared with the incomparable , for
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's Symposium and Phaedrus still occupy a niche by themselves in the hall of fame of imaginative prose .

		In one re - spect , however , the modern product is , perhaps , not inferior , for it does keep a shade more closely in touch with our human hopes and needs .

		From the master 's banquet one rises amidst the fumes of the strong wine of almost demoniacal possession , such as Plato himself describes in his doctrine of enthu - siasm , stimulating , exhilarating , sweeping us to the skies of fancy .

		At the disciple 's feast is still strong wine ; but it is the wine of helpful , aspiring reason , glorifying and uplifting , preparing us to face '' with - out excitement or elation the duties of the new day . ''

		It would be easy to select the writers who have influenced Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	most , but it must suffice to recall that his reading represents the curriculum of a Fellow of a
Cambridge	LOCATION	college with a cultured taste for literature and philosophy .

		We must point out , however , that the Greek classics have occupied the fundamental position in moulding his style and thought , and we regard it as a thrice happy accident that we were introduced to him through his '' Greek View of Life , '' * for it is the natural portal .

		With modern literature he is only less familiar ; and American readers will even find manifest traces of Walt Whitman .

		In every case , however , the trace - able influence is entirely free from any suggestion of plagiarism , and we have no mere collection of jewels , but a new and finished product .

		Even the metri - cal quotations inspire the feeling that they should have been written for exactly the place they occupy .

		Over all of his writing is shed just enough of the poeticus color to make his style charming as well as effective .

		Indeed , for those of us who see in English prose one of the highest forms of art , -- all the more important because it can ultimately be made to ap - peal to a practically unlimited constituency , -- Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	at his best fulfils Sainte-Beuve 's critical demand upon poetry , -- il fait battre le coeur .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		Thk reading of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is enjoined upon all by Professor
James M. Hoppin	PERSON	, as conducive to success in various walks of life .

		His recent little book , the title of which is foimd in the first four words of this para - graph , tells us that '' statesmen , political orators , preach - ers , essayists , journalists , authors , even poets , should speak only what they know axid feel from the bases of fact and nature , with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's real knowledge ; and though they might not become Shakespeares , they would come nearer to him in the plain path he led , and nearer to truth and sources of power . ''

		And yet Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	insists that , so far from being a guide to - tis in practical affairs ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	could not and would not grapple with reality ; that to escape it he ran away and poeticized .

		Well , what is one man 's reality is an - other man 's moonshine .

		That view of things is real to us with which we are most familiar .

		As Mr.
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	observes in an article on Ibsen in '' The In - dependent Review , ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	saw the world broadly , as ^ schylus saw it .

		He saw man in antagonism with a power or fate stronger than himself , and he was fond of choosing such types -LRB- like Hamlet ,
Macbeth	LOCATION	, Othello -RRB- as should emphasize this antagonism ; although he could , and did , with his boundless sympathy and insight , create any kind of character in any sort of situation -- a Fal - staff or a Doll Tearsheet as readily as a
Mark Antony	PERSON	or a Coriolanus .

		To us of the workaday world , he is , as Mr.
Hoppin	PERSON	says he should be , a friend and guide and comforter -- next to the Bible a very present help

		231 in trouble .

		How many of us he has helped to '' bear those ills we have '' rather than '' fly to others that we know not of . ''

		A solace in vexation , if not in crushing sorrow , is the reflection that '' there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so '' ; and when things are at their very worst , we can still be sure that , '' come what come may , time and the hour runs through the roo ^ est day . ''

		• • • President
Euot	PERSON	's mitch-discussed plan for limit - ing the bestowal of college aid is thus curiously pro- pounded by one of its advocates : '' The proposal referred to is that all applicants for scholarships be submitted to a physical examination in order that the trust fund at the disposal of the college for the maintenance of indi - gent students may be given only to such applicants as care to live long enough to give an adequate return for the payment . ''

		As if , forsooth , it were merely a matter of preference with the physically weak whether they shall resign this pleasing , anxious being , or continue to haunt the warm precincts of the cheerful day !

		More - over , is it not known to be often true that genius , no less than conceit , '' in weakest bodies strongest works , '' and that the sustaining power of a lofty intellectual or moral purpose will uphold the frail tenement long after its downfall has been predicted by the physician ?

		Had
Immanuel Kant	PERSON	, the poor saddler 's son , been debarred by his physical frailty from receiving the pecuniary aid that he must have received -LRB- but whether from the
Konigsberg Universitv	PERSON	' we are not sure -RRB- in order to get an education , should we now have any '' Critique of Pure Reason , '' and what would modem philosophy be like ?

		And
Kant	PERSON	's example is but one of many .

		Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's Life and Letters , pre - pared by Mr.
F. W. Maitland	PERSON	, is an announcement that arouses very pleasurable anticipations .

		A quiet humor , '' a humor with American touches that our men rarely attempt , '' was , as Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	has remarked , one of
Stephen	PERSON	's most enjoyable qualities .

		A very evi - dent and engaging candor was another .

		He meant what he said and said what he meant . ''

		I like him because he 's always the same , and you 're not positive about some people , '' was
Crossjay Patteme	PERSON	's encomium on
Vernon Whitford	PERSON	in '' The Egoist '' -- AMiitford , as we know , being Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	's conception of I ^ slie Ste - phen , the '' Phoebus Apollo turned fasting friar , '' the '' lean long - walker and scholar , '' who traced a connec - tion between virtue and pedestrianism .

		On resigning his
Trinity Hall Fellowship	ORGANIZATION	and abandoning his last lin - gering intention of entering the
Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Stephen	PERSON	turned to literature with the modest ambition to acquire suffi - cient facility with the pen to turn out an acceptable newspaper article .

		Poetry he appears not to have attempted . ''

		I have , '' he confesses , '' always had the difficulty which
Jonathan Oldbuck	PERSON	tells us prevented him from being a poet : I could not write verses . ''

		Our best wishes are with Mr.
Maitland	PERSON	in his undertaking , and our hope is for its speedy accomplishment .

		• • • Mr.
Howelxs	PERSON	's plea for spelling reform , which lias been widely quoted , complains of our present spell - ing that it does not spell anything , that it is a sort of pictxire - \ s-riting of a purely conventional sort .

		He fore - casts a glad future when we shall have an entirely new and strictly phonetic and absolutely representative alphabet .

		But even supposing it to be at the outset faultlessly phonetic , not only for
London	LOCATION	, but also for
Boston	LOCATION	and
Indianapolis	LOCATION	and
Cape Town	LOCATION	and
Melbourne	LOCATION	, how long would such an alphabet remain phonetic ?

		Prommciation is slowly but constantly clianging , as we occasionally learn to our surprise in reading old poetry .

		The human throat itself , and the vocal chords , are not fashioned after one invariable pattern .

		The Latin alpha - bet was probably once approximately phonetic to the Romans , the Greek to the people of Hellas ; but to
Rome	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	of to-day many of the letters of these alpha - bets stand for quite other sounds .

		Shall we then , in Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's plan , have a new alphabet every five himdred or thousand years , for example ?

		The obvious loss would be greater than the possible gain .

		All spell - ing is and must be largely a matter of convention .

		• • • LiTERATtrRE REPEATS ITSELF , as history does .

		M. Ren ^ Doumic , reviewing a group of new books on the theatre in a late number of the Rente des Deux Mondes , takes occasion to write : '' Why does the dramatist strive so eagerly after realism ?

		Because he knows that the public dearly loves to be thrilled by it .

		... In short , the playwright is inclined to be satisfied if he wins the approval of the public , and the public goes to the theatre simply and solely to be entertained .

		It demands sen - sationalism , to be made to laugh , cry , shudder , thrill ; but cares not a straw how this is effected . ''

		What is this but
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's old plaint in the second book of the '' Laws '' ?

		He there says : '' The ancient and common custom of
Hellas	LOCATION	, which still prevails in
Italy	LOCATION	and
Sicily	LOCATION	, did cer - tainly leave the judgment to the body of spectators , who determined the victor by a show of hands .

		Yet this custom has been the ruin of poets ; for they are now wont to compose with a view to please the bad taste of their judges , and the result is that the spectators become their own teachers , which has operated to degrade the theatre .

		When they -LSB- the spectators -RSB- ought to have characters exhibited to them that are better than their own , and thus receive a higher pleasure , they themselves make these characters inferior . ''

		• • •
Browning	PERSON	's defense of his alleged obscurity OF STYLE is now pretty well known .

		Nevertheless the following passage from a letter of his , preserved in the
Raskin	PERSON	Museum at
Coniston	ORGANIZATION	, may be of interest . ''

		In your bewilderment , '' he says , writing to
Ruskin	PERSON	, '' how shall I help that ?

		We do n't read poetry the same way , by the same law , it is too clear .

		I can not begin writing poetry till my imaginary reader has conceded licenses to me which you demur at altogether .

		I know that I do n't make out my conception by my lang ^ uage -- all poetry being a putting the infinite within the finite .

		Yon would have me paint it all plain out , which ca n't be .

		But by various artifices I try to make shift with touches and bits of outline which succeed -LSB- one another -RSB- , to bear the conception from me to you .

		You ought , I think , to keep pace with the thought , tripping from ledge to ledge of my ' glaciers , ' as you call them -- not stand poking your alpenstock into the holes and demonstrating that no foot could have stood there .

		In prose you may criti - cise so , because that is the absolute representation of portions of truth -- what chronicling is for history ; but in asking for more ultimates you most accept less medi - ates . ''

		This , except that '' less '' for '' fewer '' will annoy the purist , is well put .

		It emphasizes the value of the suggestive in art .

		The unfinished is sometimes better than the carefully elaborated ; '' the half is more than the whole , '' as the Greeks expressed it .

		Thoreau in Twenty Volumes .

		* It was a bold venture in book-publishing to promise the world an edition of Thoreau in more volumes than there are of Dickens the novelist as commonly reprinted in
America	LOCATION	.

		Dickens was born five years earlier , and lived sixteen years longer ; he was and is the most popular English novelist , and will long have many more readers than
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		But when we consider that
Thoreau	PERSON	could only find a publisher for his fii ` st book at his own expense , that he was more than four years paying for that first edition of a thou - sand copies -- which , if they coidd have been sold at the average price they have fetched in the past ten years , would have netted
$ 20,000	MONEY	, -- and that during the twenty-five years of Tho - reau 's literary life he probably received less than
$ 2000	MONEY	for all that he published , the present undertaking of the publishers appears really extraordinary .

		Yet it is supported by the con - stant growth of appreciation for the genius of this long obscure author , and by the fact that his most casual bits of handwriting now sell for more than their weight in gold .

		In
1905	DATE	I knew a half-ounce of his manuscript to bring
$ 40	MONEY	, which was five times its golden equivalent in weight ; and for what sum in dollars would the owner of the thirty extant volumes of his Journals now part with them ?

		Thoreau was the most industrious of all mod - em authors , and the one who devoted himself most scrupulously to his chosen task , which was Literature rather than Nature-study , though the world has long otherwise fancied .

		True , he pursued the study of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, as he did that of Greek and Latin , of Indians and land-surveying .

		But his ultimate aim was literature and philos - ophy ; and the celebrity that his writings are now attaining proves that he succeeded in this steady pursuit .

		His most intimate and appre - ciative friend ,
Ellery Channing	PERSON	, styled him '' the Poet-Naturalist , '' and the title has been generally accepted ; yet he might with almost the same felicity be called a poet-philosopher , the term by which his eloquent friend
Emerson	PERSON	has long been recognized .

		The poetic element in
Thoreau	LOCATION	is easily seen ; not so easily his philosophic wisdom and originality .

		This grows more and more striking as we are allowed to read more in the Journals , which are now being • The Writings op Henky
David Thoreau	PERSON	.

		In twenty volumes .


Boston	LOCATION	:

Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		printed in fourteen volumes , four of which have already been given to the eager lovers of this ever-youthful poet .

		It was his poetic , ideal , transcendental side that
Thoreau	PERSON	himself most valued ; and it first attracted his few readers of 1840-44 in the pages of
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	's and
Emerson	PERSON	's '' Dial . ''

		In
1852	DATE	, he writes in his Journal -LRB-
Feb. 18	DATE	-RRB- : '' It is impossible for the same person to see things from the poet 's point of view , and that of the man of science .

		The poet 's second love may be science , not his first , -- when use has worn off the bloom .

		I have a commonplace-book for facts , and another for poetry ; but I find it difficult always to preserve the vague dis - tinction which I had in mind ; for the most interesting and beautiful facts are so much the more poetry , and that is their success .

		If my facts were sufficiently vital and significant , I should need but one book , of poetry , to contain them all . ''

		Earlier -LRB-
Jan. 26 , 1852	DATE	-RRB- , he wrote : '' Poetry implies the whole truth .

		Philosophy expresses a particle of it . ''

		And later -LRB-
July 18 , 1852	DATE	-RRB- : '' Every poet has trembled on the verge of science . ''

		Again -LRB-
Oct. 20 , 1852	DATE	-RRB- , after his first visit with
Ellery Channing	PERSON	to the
Peterboro Hills	LOCATION	and to
Monadnoc	LOCATION	, he wrote : '' Many a man asks if I took a glass with me .

		No doubt I could have seen further with a glass , could have counted more meeting-houses , -- but this has nothing to do with the peculiar beauty and grandeur of the view .

		It was not to see a few particular objects , as if they were near at hand , that I ascended the moxmtain , but to see an infinite variety , far and near , in their relation to each other , -- thus reduced to a single picture .

		The facts of science , in comparison with poetry , are wont to be as vulgar as looking from Monadnoc with a tele - scope .

		It is a counting of meeting-houses . ''

		And yet very few men , technically scientific , ever made so many and so close observations in certain fields of natural history as
Thoreau	PERSON	did .

		He was naturally an observer , and he narrowed his circuit of observation so as to facilitate accu - racy .

		His present editor -- himself an ornithol - ogist , as Thoreau never was , technically , -- finds a few instances in which this poet-naturalist was late or inexact in naming his bird .

		But let it be considered that he began these journals , and the chapters that he made up from them , at the age of twenty , and that he ceased to journalize at forty-four , -- his noteworthy observations in his
Minnesota	LOCATION	tour -LRB- now in type for issue by the
Boston Bibliophile Society	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- never having been written up by him because of his steadily failing health .

		What other naturalist , who was first and foremost a poet and man of letters , has ever made better observations , while educating himself to his chosen task of writing books ?

		His collegiate course , except as fitting him somewhat
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 in mathematics , did little to qualify him in natural history ; but his occupation as land-surveyor -LRB- a mathematical out-door trade -RRB- came in his mature years to supplement his early poetic opportuni - ties in seeing and delineating Nature , as she showetl herself in the valleys of the
Concord	LOCATION	and Merrimac .

		His account of those streams and their phenomena wovdd have been fuller and richer if he had published his ' • Week '' in
1859	DATE	instead of
1849	DATE	; for it woidd have had ten years more of fluviatUe , riparial , and celestial observa - tion behind it .

		But it woidd have been less poetical , and less saturated with the literature of imagination and religion .

		^ Vhat that was from
1837	DATE	to
1847	DATE	, when he left his hut by
Walden	PERSON	, may be seen by the fragmentary note - books printed in the first volume of the Journals .

		It was never
Thoreau	PERSON	's intent to print these Journals as they now appear , still less as they were partially published by his editor after
1876	DATE	, Mr.
Blake	PERSON	.

		This third editor of the departed poet --
Emerson	PERSON	and EUery Channing having preceded him in the task for a few years , -- although a dear friend and almost an idolater of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, did not quite comprehend the sequence and connection of thoughts in that peculiar mind .

		He therefore rather broke up and parcelled out the Journals whUe editing them , and thus pre - sented them as detached and disconnected Ts-rit - ings , instead of making them centre aroimd a special subject , which was
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's manner .

		It may even be doubted if Mr.
Blake	PERSON	ever actu - ally sortetl out and classified the great mass of manuscripts which
Sophia Thoreau	PERSON	left to him , -- a task of i `` eal difficulty , as every posthumous editor has found .

		He was
Thoreau	PERSON	's senior in years , although long outliving him , and had a delicate modesty which \ ^ dthheld him from that strict dealing with his author of which
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	manifested rather too much .

		The letters and verses of Thoreau which
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	held back from publication , because they might alter that view of his younger friend which he had long and rather wilfidly held , were placed in my hands by !

		Mr.
Blake	PERSON	, or by
Sophia Thoreau	PERSON	; and I am told they have materially modified the opinion earlier readers had formed from the Emersonian legend and presentation .

		I felt sure that they would , as , indeed , Channings inimitable and racy life of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, first published in
1873	DATE	, had already modified the opinion of such as read it against the restrictive view given by
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Journals , as now published , vntH still more correct the imperfect picture of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's mind and heart which was for forty years at least the prevailing impression .

		The patience of
Thoreau	LOCATION	-- and few men were ever more patient -- and the mercurial impatience of Channing both revolted a little , at times , at the fact that they were chiefly known through other authors , and not by their own essaj ^ s and verses .

		In
April , 1852	DATE	, the Journal records this : '' I asked
Ellery Channing	PERSON	yesterday if he had ac - quired fame .

		He answered that , giving his name at some place , the bystanders said : ` Yes , sir , we have heard of you .

		We know you here , sir .

		Your name is mentioned in Mr.
Blank	PERSON	's book . '

		That 's all the fame I have had , -- to be made known by another man . ''

		This remark of Channing was made at the time when he was offering himself as a lecturer in
Concord	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Providence	LOCATION	, and elsewhere , with a success far less than
Thoreau	PERSON	's at the same period .

		Yet
Thoreau	PERSON	, except in
Concord	LOCATION	, and gradually in
Worcester	LOCATION	, did not prove a very attractive lecturer .

		As a promoter of other men 's lectures he was indefatigable , like
Emer	PERSON	- son .

		In the original draft of ''
Walden	PERSON	, '' from which much was dropped before it went to press , I found this passage which no longer appears in the Journal as here printed : `` ' How much , for instance , might be done for this town -LSB-
Concord	LOCATION	-RSB- with
SlOO	PERSON	, if there were a man to do it !

		I myself have provided a select course of lectures for a winter , together with room , fuel , and lights , with that sum ; which was no inconsiderable benefit to every inhabitant . ''

		It then occurred to me to look up in the records of the
Concord Lyceum	ORGANIZATION	, of which
Thoreau	PERSON	was often an official , the list of these lecturers , which he had carefully entered in the book , with the price paid to each .

		The date was about sixty -
two years ago	DATE	.

		The list included
Emerson	PERSON	-LRB- three lectures -RRB- , who received nothing ;
George Bancroft	PERSON	, f 10 ;
Theodore Parker	PERSON	, i3 ;
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	, nothing ;
Horace Greeley	PERSON	, nothing ; Dr.
Charles T. Jackson	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Emerson	PERSON	's brother -RRB- , f 10 ;
Henry Giles	PERSON	, f 10 ; Rev.
E. H. Chapin	PERSON	,
$ 8	MONEY	: James
Freeman Clark	PERSON	, nothing ; Thoreau himself -LRB- several lectures -RRB- nothing , -- and so on .

		It was a distinguished roll of names .

		The financial statement was there too , drawn up by
Thoreau	LOCATION	, -- receipts , # 109.20 ; expenses -LRB- care - fully itemized -RRB- , # 100 ; balance on hand , # 9.20 .

		Seldom has so much wisdom and eloquence been furnished to a Yankee village for so small an outlay .

		Thoreau , like others , had his own explana - tion of
Shakespeare	LOCATION	; and it is to be noted , for all his criticism is worth heeding .

		He did not often read him , but he knew what his value was , though he preferred
Milton	PERSON	, as he once told me .

		In the Journal for
January , 1852	DATE	, he has a suggestive comment .

		234 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, '' The one word which will explain the Shakespeare miracle is ' unconsciousness . '

		If he had known his own comparative eminence , he would not have failed to pub - lish it incessantly . ''

		Thoreau was by no means unconscious of his own powers ; indeed , few men of genius are .

		He valued himself for what he knew he was ; but he was neither conceited nor did he pose , as some of his critics have fancied .

		He coidd undervalue himself upon occasion ; and in one of the passages omitted from '' Walden '' he wrote : '' If the reader thinks that I am vainglorious and set myself above others , I assure him that I could tell a justified story respecting myself as well as him , if my spirits held out ; could encourage him with a sufficient list of my failures , and flow as humbly as the gutters .

		I think worse of myself than he is likely to think of me , -- and better , too , perchance , being better acquainted with the man . ''

		How , then , did
Thoreau	PERSON	acquire his singular genius and character ?

		Like most men , by descent and environment -- chiefly the former .

		The editor of these Journals does not appear to know the family story ; nor was Thoreau him - seK perfectly informed upon it .

		On the mother 's side he was descended from a Tory family -- that of Colonel Jones of
Weston	LOCATION	, an old towTi seven miles from
Concord	LOCATION	.

		This gentleman , who died in
Boston	LOCATION	just before our Revolution , had one daughter ,
Mary	PERSON	-LRB- who became the gTand - mother of Henry
Thoreau	PERSON	-RRB- , and fourteen sons , of whom twelve grew up .

		Eight or nine of these sons joined the Tory faction , and most of them had to go forth from their native land into exile in consequence .

		Several of them served in the British army against their countrymen , and one of them .

		Dr.
Josiah Jones	PERSON	, was a political pris - oner in
Concord	LOCATION	jail while the battle of Bunker Hill was going on ,
June 17 , 1775	DATE	.

		Mary , his sister , then Mrs.
Asa Dunbar	PERSON	, carried him food from
Weston	LOCATION	on that day , as she did on other days , before and after .

		The family tradition on this point , which
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	recorded in his Jour - nal -LRB- not here quoted -RRB- was curious , but not quite correct .

		He wrote : '' Col.
Elisha Jones	PERSON	, my great-grandfather , was the owner and inhabitant of an estate in
Weston	LOCATION	, -- a man of standing and influence among his neighbors .

		He was a Tory .

		His son
Simeon	PERSON	was confined in
Concord	LOCATION	jail four months and a fortnight .

		His sister Mary brought every meal he had from
Weston	LOCATION	.

		He was afraid he might be poisoned else .

		There was one
Hicks	PERSON	, and one more , imprisoned with him .

		They secreted knives fur - nished them with their food , sawed the grates oif , and escaped to
Weston	LOCATION	.

		Hid in the cider-mill .

		Mary heard they were in the mill ; she took old
Baldwin	PERSON	's horse from the lower part of
Weston	LOCATION	, and
Simeon	PERSON	went to
Portland	LOCATION	with him , and then wrote back to
Baldwin	PERSON	where he would find his horse , by paying charges . ''

		This story bears the marks and has the errors of tradition . ''

		Baldwin '' was the sheriff who arrested Dr.
Jones	PERSON	-LRB- and perhaps his brother
Simeon	PERSON	-RRB- , and he may very well have connived at the escape from the authorities of
Massachu	LOCATION	- setts .

		We know that Dr.
Josiah Jones	PERSON	, and another loyalist described as '' the notorious Dr.
Hicks	PERSON	, '' were imprisoned for attempting to send in supplies to the British army besieged in Bos - ton ; and we have no reason to doubt they escaped in the way indicated , and took refuge in
Colonel Jones	ORGANIZATION	's unused cider-mill .

		Possibly
Simeon	PERSON	was with them .

		All but three of the brothers of Mrs.
Dunbar	PERSON	had to leave the country for their Tory - ism , and the family property was lost or dimin - ished by their taking the wrong side .

		At the same time ,
Thoreau	PERSON	's grandfather ,
John Thoreau	PERSON	from the isle of
Jersey	LOCATION	, was privateering on the American side , and thus beginning the fortune which he left to his heirs in
1 8 1	DATE	.

		Henry 's grand - father Dmibar , a graduate of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1767	DATE	, headed a college rebellion in
1766	DATE	, and found so many supporters among the wealthy students and their families that he was never punished , but graduated with honor .

		He was first a clergy - man at Salem , then studied law , and retired to
Keene	PERSON	,
N. H.	PERSON	, near his brother-in-law
Daniel Jones	PERSON	, practised law there and was active in Free - masonry for a few years , and died in
1 7 87	DATE	, before his daughter
Cynthia	PERSON	, who married
John Thoreau	PERSON	, the father of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	, was born .

		From this mixed descent , with which a Scotch strand was twined ,
Thoreau	PERSON	inherited his mingled and rather con - flicting qualities , -- his gravity , his humor , his touch of wildness , his mercantile method , and his independence of thought .

		Something ap - peared in him , too , -- a spark of genius , which none of his known ancestors had shown .

		He was remotely of
Norman	PERSON	, even of
Norse	ORGANIZATION	, descent , probably , as so many of the Jerseymen were ; if he had French ancestors , they had long ceased to live in
France	LOCATION	, though speaking that patois of French which was the dialect of
Jersey	LOCATION	.

		A. certain French elegance of style in prose early marked the writings of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, and the beauty of style in the unstudied journal entries here published will attract frequent notice .

		Of all the writers of the
Concord	LOCATION	group ,
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	will be held hereafter as the most original , where all were original in their own way .

		He was less dependent than
Emerson	PERSON	or
Hawthorne	PERSON	or
Alcott	PERSON	on the books he had read and the traditions he received ; more indebted to Nature and his own free thoughts .

		The ten volumes before me prove this , and those which are to come will hardly cliange the ver -
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 235 diet thus far reached .

		He is fortunate , in this posthumous edition , to have the aid of an ad - mirable photographer , Mr.
Herbert Gleason	PERSON	, who in years past , '' all for love and nothing for reward , '' searched out and took pictures of those impressive scenes which
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	had so pictorially described ; and from these two or three hundred views the publishers have selected a hundred to be reproduced for these volumes , five in each .

		The process by which they are printed has darkened a little the delicacy of the original , but they are still wonderfidly true to the nature amid which
Thoreau	PERSON	was mast se - renely at home .

		The form and tyix -RRB- graphy of the volumes leave little to be desired .

		There are some minor errors arising from the indistmctness of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's manuscript in places , and from the editor 's lack of tliat minute local knowledge in which his author was so remarkable .

		For instance , there is no '' Woods ' Bridge '' in
Concord	LOCATION	, and never was , though the '' ■ wooden bridge '' near the railroad may sometimes have been so called , as leading to the farm of the
Woods	LOCATION	.

		It should always read `` wooden bridge , '' as distinguished from the '' stone bridge ' close by .

		Again , there was a
Concord	LOCATION	weekly newspaper entitled * ' The Yeoman 's Gazette , '' and its name should stand in capitals .

		An ocxiasional mistake in spelling is to be noted .

		But on the whole this ''
Walden	PERSON	Edition '' is every way satisfactory , in its different forms for different purchasers ^ d prices .

		liANDSCAPE IX Poetry .

		* There are few subjects more attractive to students of literature than the treatment of land - scape in poetry .

		To perceive the varying func - tions of natural description in the work of different races , ages , and poets , -- the personi - fied nature of the Hebrews , the serene and vivid landscape of the Greeks , the delicate vignettes of the Middle Age , the detailed but conven - tional backgi-ounds of the Renaissance , the expressiveness of the inanimate world to modem eyes , -- this involves an endlessly fascinating approach to the secrets of the poetic process .

		Despite the fundamental correctness of
Lessing	PERSON	's main position in the
Laocoon	LOCATION	, the history of poetry gives abundant warrant for his caveat : '' How many things woiUd appear incontestable in theory , if genius had not succeeded in prov - * The Feeling for Nature .

		Its Development in the Middle Ages and in Modern Times .

		By
Alfred Biese	PERSON	.

E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		ing them to be the contrary by fact , '' The fact , of course , is that the charm of poetry is , to no small degree , the charm of landscape back - ground .

		Fancy the Odyssey without
Calypso	ORGANIZATION	's grotto and the harbor of
Ithaca	LOCATION	, Chaucer with - out his green and flowery
May mornings	DATE	, Spen - ser ^ vithout his trackless woods and his dazzling if not wholly convincing gardens ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	without the matchless scenery that is of the very texture of his plays ; fancy Eden without its '' bowery loneliness , '' its '' bloom profuse and cedar arches '' ; fancy
Keats	PERSON	without '' the green world '' of his daffodils and the '' hurrying freshnesses '' of his brooks ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	with - out his '' mountains where sleep the unsiuined tarns '' -- to use a Wordsworthian line of
Brown	PERSON	- ing 's , -- and
Tennyson	PERSON	without his enchanted forests and his '' dim , rich '' cities .

		If the per - ception of these things is one of the keenest aesthetic delights of poetry , surely one of its highest practical benefits is to make us more vividly aware of the beauty of the world .

		The dearth of books in English on this inter - esting subject is rather remarkable , though it is no doubt due in part to the infrequency of a literary scholarship that is at once minute and comprehensive , and in part to the absorption of our students of literature in questions of literary history rather than in the more essential prob - lems of art .

		Professor
Palgrave	PERSON	's well-known '' Landscape in Poetry ' is sketchy and inade - quate .

		One reads it with a painful sense of a missed opportunity .

		Its range is not wide enough , and it is poor in examples .

		In this respect ,
Herr Biese	PERSON	's book on '' The Feeling for Nature '' is highly commendable .

		Within the limits that he has imposed upon himself , he has brought together a large and well-chosen body of passages that constitute the chief value of his work .

		His sense of proportion is , however , not faultless , and has led him to lay undue emphasis on many obscure German poets and prose writ - ers , to the neglect of the really significant names of modern
France	LOCATION	, -- De
Lisle	LOCATION	, De la Prade ,
Heredia	PERSON	, and the rest , -- not to mention English poetry of the later nineteenth century , which he almost ignores .

		While he treats
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Klop	PERSON	- stock ,
Jean Paul	PERSON	,
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Lamartine	PERSON	, and Hugo with a gratif jnng fulness , yet it seems a pity to neglect the intensely expressive landscape of modern French and English poetry and emo - tional prose , especially as in these the feeling for nature is more simple , less complicated with what
Herr Biese	PERSON	calls '' the amorous passion , '' than in the work of the early Romantics .

		Surely ,
Senancour	PERSON	and
Amiel	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	'' and Arnold are to be reckoned with , even in the most general survey of European literature .

		To
Wordsworth	PERSON	, indeed ,
Herr Biese	PERSON	devotes a part of two pages , though the following critical re - mark , which is also the only one , is hardly either intelligible or adequate : '' His real taste was pastoral , and he preached freer intercourse with Nature , glossing his ideas rather arti - ficially with a theism , through which one reads true love of her , and an undeniable though hidden panthe - ism '' -LRB- p. 326 -RRB- .

		The famous skating scene is mistaken for a description of `` sledging . ''

		But if
Wordsworth	PERSON	is comparatively neglected ,
Byron	PERSON	, as is usual with continental students of our literature , is treated with fulness and enthusiasm : '' All that previous English poets had done seemed harmless and innocent in comparison with
Byron	PERSON	's revo - lutionary poetry .

		Prophecy in
Rousseau	PERSON	became poetry in Byron '' -LRB- p. 327 -RRB- .

		It is the more remarkable that
Herr Biese	PERSON	did not push his researches into recent French literature , because , as his own examples prove , no German save
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	equals
Lamartine	PERSON	in the blending of precise observation with pro- found feeling ; and the question would therefore seem to be inevitable , '' How far have modern French poets entered into the spirit of the Medi - tations ? ''

		The following from Jean Paul ad - mirably illustrates the tone and manner of the German Romantics , and incidentally has a curi - ous resemblance to the landscape in
Henley	LOCATION	's beautiful lines MargaritcB Sorori : '' The sun sinks , and the earth closes her great eye like that of a dying god .

		There smoke the hills like altars ; out of every wood ascends a chorus ; the veils of day , the shadows , float around the enkindled , trans - parent tree-tops , and fall upon the gay , gem-like flowers .

		And the burnished gold of the west throws back a dead gold on the east , and tinges with rosy light the hover - ing breast of the tremulous lark -- the evening bell of Nature '' -LRB- p. 348 -RRB- .

		Not many of the illustrative passages , it must be confessed , are as successful as this .

		The occasions are few when one feels the instant thrill of response to a direct , sincere , unconven - tional and imaginative natural touch .

		Phrase after phrase of description passes under the eye , leaving no definite image upon the mind , touch - ing no chord of feeling .

		All is vague , remote , abstract , lifeless .

		In spite of the clear objective beauty of the pictures in the Odyssey , one be - gins to suspect that the mere ability to see the significant aspects of what is under one 's eyes is a modern achievement .

		To the passages from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, however , this objection does not apply .

		While the list of examples is not , of course , exhaustive , it is sufficient to prove that his '' grasp of nature was in tenser , more indi - vidual , and subjective '' than that of any preced - ing poet , with the possible exception of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the vitality and significance of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's touches of description ,
Herr Biese	PERSON	hardly doeft justice ; while his praise of Petrarch and of the Renaissance attitude in general toward nature , both in
Italy	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, is plainly excessive .

		That '' English lyrists of the fifteenth and six - teenth centuries showed deep feeling for Na - ture '' -LRB- p. 222 -RRB- can not be maintained , despite the abundance of descriptive and pastoral poetry .

		In no respect does Shakespeare tower above his ^ contemporaries more unmistakably than in the sincerity and vitality of his attitude toward nature .

		Spenser 's description of the
Garden of Acrasia	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- F. Q. , II .

		12 .

		58 -RRB- , quoted by
Herr Biese	PERSON	as evidence of the '' deep feeling for Na - ture '' in the sixteenth century , is highly gen - eralized , wholly conventional , and therefore abstract and unreal .

		Moreover , it is an exceed - ingly close imitation of Tasso -LRB- Ger .

		Lib. , 16 .

		9 -RRB- '' It would hardly be more absurd to talk of '' the deep feeling for Nature '' of the eighteenth cen - tury pastoralists .

		The conventional images and ideas of the Elizabethan lyric are shown , by
Herr Biese	PERSON	's own examples , to be derived in most cases directly from
Petrarch	LOCATION	.

		The critical and historical generalizations o # the volume are not of so much importance as the examples .

		They are in most cases not very defi - nite , nor are the different stages in the develop - ment of the feeling for nature in mediaeval and modern literature sharply discriminated .

		Per - haps they can not be , except in the most general way .

		And yet one clearly perceives the possi - bility of a more satisfactory treatment than
Herr Biese	PERSON	has given us .

		His programme , however , , is admirable .

		He attempts to trace the feeling for nature from the Christian writers of the first ten centuries , in whom pagan elements still per - sist , to what he calls '' the universal pantheistic feeling of modern times , '' though , as we have seen , he ignores its more recent manifestations '' The '' naive '' feeling of the period of the Cru - sades , the Troubadours , and the Minnesingers , the '' individualism and sentimental feeling '' of the Renaissance , '' the enthusiasm for nature among the discoverers and Catholic mystics , '' the artificial treatment of landscape , during the seventeenth century , in
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, and the beginning and f idl tide of romantic feel - ing , with all its sentimental exaggeration , -- these are the principal stages through which , according to
Herr Biese	PERSON	, the treatment of land - scape in European literature has passed .

		He
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 237 devotes a few , not very illuminating , pages , also , to the history of landscape in painting .

		The vague and vin satisfactory impression left by his generalizations is , no doubt , due in some degree to his style , though for this the translator may be to blame .

		On the whole , however , the translation is workmanlike , and we fear that the responsibility for such sentences as the following rests with
Herr Biese	PERSON	: '' -LSB-
Schiller	PERSON	-RSB- called nature naive -LRB- he included natural - ness in Nature -RRB- ; those who seek her , sentimental ; but he overlooked the fact that antiquity did not always remain naive , and that not all modems are sentimental '' -LSB- p. 346 -RSB- . ''

		And since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's characters often act out of part , so that intelligible motive fails , while it is important to the poet that each scene be raised to dramatic level and viewed in a special light ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's words apply , '' etc. -LRB- p. 167 -RRB- .

		There is far too much of the solemn pseudo - technical jargon that often makes German criticism such desperately hard reatling .

		The ingenuous reader believes , or at any rate hopes , tlaat he is not reading nonsense , but he has the disappointment of embracing a shadow whenever he attempts to grasp the meaning .

		The style , too , is without that coherence that depends upon distinctness of articxdation -- a quality in which French criticism , for example , is almost never wanting .

		There is , moreover , a good deal of that specious encyclopjedic abundance which is so easy to obtain : it consists in the indiscriminate heaping up of names and dates that suggest , to be sure , completeness of treatment , but really breed confusion .

		Whether the translator is responsible for plac - ing Drayton and
Drummond	PERSON	of Hawthomden in the eighteenth century -LRB- pp. 223 , 224 -RRB- , we do not know ; but he must at any rate be held ac - countable for such eccentricities as
Bernard von Clairvaux	PERSON	, Hugo von
St. Victor	ORGANIZATION	,
Vincentius von Beauvais	PERSON	, and for the odd locution , '' The real Aristotle was only gradually shelled out from uuader mediaeval accretions '' -LRB- p. 200 -RRB- .

Washington	LOCATION	's spelling -- such as '' over par '' for overseer , '' Molly '' for
Nellie	PERSON	, '' Curtis '' for
Custis	PERSON	, etc. .

		And surely there is something wrong where
Lear	PERSON	's figures make
Washington	LOCATION	's length after death only five feet three and a half inches .

		A foot more will be necessary to satisfy the popular notion of the tall first Presi - dent .

		The reviewer has been unable to find anything in the book that will justify the word '' Recollections '' in the title .

		There is no index .

		The letters are filled with facts about the servants , the slaves , the household economy ; schools for young relatives ; crops , fertilizers , seeds , cattle , horses , sheep , overseers , soils , farm implements ; rents , investments , land sales , and all that interested a progressive farmer of a century ago .

		Some of them certainly make the Father of his Country seem very human and un-heroic , and dim the halo that
Parson Weems	PERSON	and others have created for us .

		For instance , no housekeeper of to-day faces a more trouble - some servant problem than did
George Wash	PERSON	- ington during the last ten years of his life .

		It seems that he preferred white servants who were honest , frugal , neat , and did not drink ; but these were hard to get , and were always wanting their wages raised .

		He refused to bring two kitchen servants from
New York	LOCATION	to
Philadelphia	LOCATION	because they were not neat enough , and the '' kitchen -LSB- being -RSB- in full \ 4ew of the best rooms . ''

		The steward 's accounts are criticised , and Wash - 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, ington declares that `` it is inconceivable to me how other families on 25 hd .

		or
3,000 dollars	MONEY	should be enabled to entertain more company ... than I coidd do for 25,000 dollars annu - ally . ''

		He comes to the conclusion that it is partly on account of the expense of the '' Sec - ond '' or white servants ' table . ''

		I strongly suspect that nothing is brought to my Table of liquors ^ fruits , and other things , that is not used as profusely -LSB- at the servants ' table -RSB- . ''

		And to
Lear	PERSON	, when engaging servants for the
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia establishment , he wrote , '' Be him or them whom they may , it must be expressly un - derstood that wine is not permissable at their Table . ''

		Even while President he looked after the negroes ' clothes , bought their caps , chose the wall-paper and carpets , saw to the proper placing of the furniture and ornaments in every room , looked after the wood supply , engaged washerwomen , traded laundry implements and furniture with Mrs.
Kobert Morris	PERSON	, ordered preserves and butter put up for
winter	DATE	, and per - formed numerous other duties that we think Mrs.
Washington	LOCATION	might have claimed as her own .

		Either he was a meddler , or he deserved the title of `` George
Washington	LOCATION	, Housekeeper . ''

		Nothing is clearer than the double fact that
Washington	LOCATION	liked neither slavery nor slaves .

		He was careful of the comfort of his servants , as he called them , was kind to them , and enclosed with his own their love-letters to their '' delto - bosos '' ; but he had lived long enough in the North to see the advantage of a homogeneous white population , and to the end of his days he hoped to get rid of his slaves and get English and Scotch farmers in place of them .

		To a friend he wrote : '' I do not like even to think , much less to talk , of -LSB- slave property -RSB- ... Were it not that I am principled against selling - negroes as you would do cattle at a market , I would not in twelve months ... be possessed of one '' ... '' but imperious necessity compels ... until I can substitute some other expe - dient . ''

		Perhaps of most interest and value are the letters to overseers and others regarding farm management .


Washington	LOCATION	was not a planter , but a farmer ; Mt.
Vernon	PERSON	was not a planta - tion but a congeries of small farms .

		Hence the labor system was not well organized , and
Washington	LOCATION	had much difficidty in keeping things in running order .

		He complains of indolent negro labor , stupid overseers , '' worth - less white men '' who have '' no more authority over the Negroes ... than an old woman would have . ''

		Yet when he was able to give personal attention to his farms , all went well , -- crojDS were good , cattle were improved , the wool production doubled , etc. .

		He believed in the modern methods of intensive farming , and was convinced '' that if we were to reduce our culti - vation ... to half the present quantity , and manure and till that half well , our profits would be greater . ''

		In engaging a manager to look after Mt.
Vernon	PERSON	while he was in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
Washington	LOCATION	wrote : '' As I am never sparing in furnishing my Farms with any and every kind of Tool and Implement that is cal - culated to do good and neat work , I not only authorize you to bring the kind of ploughs you were speaking to me about , but any others , the utility of which you have proved from your own experience .

		... I shall begrudge no reasonable expense that will contribute to the im - provement and neatness of my Farms : -- for nothing pleases me better than to see them in good order , and everything trim , handsome , and thriving ... nor noth - ing hurts me more than to find them otherwise , and the tools and implements laying where they were last used , exposed to injuries from Rain , sim , etc. '' This was his farmer 's platform , and it explains how he was able to live from the proceeds of his farms and yet serve his country without pay for long periods of time .

		But evidently there were many who were not up to his standard ; for when , in
1790	DATE	, he wanted to lease the Mt.
Vernon	PERSON	place , he refused '' to do it to the slovenly farmers of this Country , '' and later , when he wanted to sell land , he tried to get English and Scotch farmers to buy , '' for I have no idea of fritter - ing up farms for the accommodation of our coun - try farmers whose knowledge centres in the destruction of land and very little beyond it . ''

		We learn that he gave children lottery tickets , and that he had a distillery ; that he could write a scorching dun to a bad debtor ; that he believed in strict discipline over school-children , and that in enquiring about a school he asked first about the discipline and the master , next if the pupils were '' genteel , '' and finally and incidentally , '' Among other things enquire what is taught at these schools . ''

		There are many other interest - ing and homely facts in these letters which throw a new light on
Washington	LOCATION	, and in a way help to bring him down from the heights to earth again -- to the earth where he certainly liked to live .

		THE DIAL 239 The
Eastern Course of Conquest	ORGANIZATION	.

		* From the time of
Caesar	PERSON	, one of the favorite methods of conquest has been the subjection of savage and semi-civilized races under the plea of pacifying and protecting them .

		From the negative position of protection it is only a step to positive direct control .

		We see much of this method of conquest in our own time .

		One of the best examples is probably the gro \ vth of Russian authority over
Central Asia	LOCATION	.

		Another good illustration in the making is the British frontier protectorate over
Afghanistan	LOCATION	.

		It is in this regdon of
Central Asia	LOCATION	that we are now beholding the subtle and fascinatrng game of diplomacy most cimningly played .


Russia	LOCATION	, de - feated in the
Far East	LOCATION	, must now return to her former field of conquests to extend her powers and to recuperate her losses .


England	LOCATION	, recog - nizing this advance of
Russia	LOCATION	southward , must now zealously guard her protectorate over Af - ghanistan , that no direct attack may be made on her Indian possessions .

		The diplomatic re - lations are involved , the conditions are intricate , and the outcome is not at all certain .

		To understand the circumstances and condi - tions , the temper and chai-acter , of these Afghans requires an intimate knowledge of every point involved in such a complicated political , geo - graphical , and historical situation .

		Few stu - dents of Central Asian affairs know aU these conditions so well as does Mr.
Angus Hamilton	PERSON	, author of a notable book on
Korea	LOCATION	, and for some time a correspondent of the '' PaU Mall Gazette '' from
Central Asia	LOCATION	His volume on
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, like that on
Korea	LOCATION	, is heavy , but it is substan - tial and instructive reading .

		He marshals an astonishing array of data on the commercial and political affairs of that country , but out of the dry material thus offered he makes an able di - gest and conclusion of present conditions that are interesting to the student of geography , politics , and trade , in that part of
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Above all things , liis volume is pregnant with ideas concerning the conflict between
Russia	LOCATION	and En - gland for prestige in
Central Asia	LOCATION	.

		Of primary importance in either the subjec - tion or the protection of
Afghanistan	LOCATION	is the rail - way .

		The
Orenbiu-g-Tashkend Railway	ORGANIZATION	, which has been but recently completed , now reduces the
pre %	PERCENT	aoiis long journey from
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	to
Tashkend	LOCATION	to the small matter of twentj ' - four hundred miles , thus making a close jointure between the military and commercial depots , between the capital and the frontier .

		A further •
Afghanistan	LOCATION	.

		By An ^ os
Hamilton	PERSON	.

		With IDustrationfi and Maps .

		New York :
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		study of this system shows that it is possible to connect
Merv	PERSON	, the terminus of the
Murgab Valley	LOCATION	division , with the Indian system of railways at
New Cliaman	LOCATION	, by the way of
Herat	LOCATION	in the west and
Kandahar	LOCATION	m the south , thereby lessening the travelling distance between
England	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	by seven days ' journey .

		There is no probability , however , that this scheme will be - come a reality .


Russia	LOCATION	will not consent to the building of a line which will so much profit her enemy .


Russia	LOCATION	's policy , according to Mr.
Ham	PERSON	- ilton , wiU be to extend the
Tashkend	LOCATION	road along the northern Persian and the northern Afghan borders in order to control the military and trade conditions of those strong strategical posi - tions .

		It is
Russia	LOCATION	's pui ` pose , undoubtedly , to extend the system to
Herat	LOCATION	, the key to
India	LOCATION	, on the western border .

		Such a line , once estab - lished , would give
Russia	LOCATION	the advantage in the event of an outbreak of hostilities .

		At
Kandahar	LOCATION	and the southern border of
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, the question of railway building is also the chief political concern of
England	LOCATION	.

		Kandahar is of more importance as a trade centre than
Herat	LOCATION	, and is of almost equal im - portance in sti-ategical position .

		At present the British position in southern
Afghanistan	LOCATION	is en V air , but a railway from
Kandahar	LOCATION	to
New Chaman	LOCATION	in
India	LOCATION	would link
Afghanistan	LOCATION	to
India	LOCATION	in a more tangible way .

		It seems likely that such a line will be established before long .

		British interests , while favoring this short line , are inimical to a trans - Afghan system ; for in order to preserve the integrity of the state it is necessary that
Afghanistan	LOCATION	shall remain a buffer state , whereas a trans-Afghan railroad would make her a gateway to
India	LOCATION	.

		So runs the story of the whole book .

		Were we to summarize Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	's account of every district of
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, we should only repeat what we have said about
Herat	LOCATION	and Kan - dahar -- the importance of the railway problem , and the admonition regarding
Russia	LOCATION	's advance .

		Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	's whole thought and tone is summed up in the following quotations from his book : ''
Russia	LOCATION	is really the supreme and dominating factor in
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, not only along the northern , eastern and western frontiers , but throughout the kingdom . ''

		`` The policy of this country -LSB-
England	LOCATION	-RSB- should be mistrustful of
Russia	LOCATION	always , and our attitude should be actively suspicious . ''

		The i ^ essimistic views of the author are pro- bably accentuated by two further facts revealed in the latter part of his book -- the failure of Sir
Louis Dane	PERSON	's ^ lission to make a favorable I treaty with the Afghan powers , and the insta - 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, bility of the weak-willed ruler of
Afghanistan	LOCATION	,
Amir Habib Ullah	PERSON	.

		Like the men in the nur - sery rhyme who marched up the hill and then marched down again , the
Dane Mission	ORGANIZATION	return - ing from
Kabul	LOCATION	, the capital of
Afghanistan	LOCATION	, had to report meekly that the Amir had been elevated to the height of an Independent
King	PERSON	, that he was permitted to import arms at his pleasure , and that his government was to be released from the arrears which had accumulated in the Indian treasury .

		As an offset for these concessions , the
Mission	ORGANIZATION	reported that the Amir was disaffected and untrustworthy !

		Mr.
Hamil	PERSON	- ton is gracious enough to think , however , that this affront was due more to the conspicuous vanity of the Amir than to the manifestation of his ill-will .

		And herein lies the promise of trouble for
Afghanistan	LOCATION	.

		As a man and ruler , the Amir is so strongly marked by a capricious temper and a weak will that his seat on the throne is not at all secure .

		Surrounded by an all-powerful priesthood opposed to foreign advice ; intrigued against by relations , both masculine and feminine , who , led by his strong - willed brother ,
Nasr Ullah Khan	PERSON	, are waiting for a propitious moment to overthrow him ; unbeloved , although amiable in disposition , by his subjects , he may at any time become the centre of a rebellion .

		Then wiU be the moment for active hostilities between
Russia	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		The volume is dedicated to the late Viceroy of
India	LOCATION	,
Lord Curzon	PERSON	, whose knowledge of Central Asian affairs is unsurpassed .

		All the helpful means for understanding the text , such as illustrations , maps , tables , appendices , are abundantly provided .

		At times , however , when our interest is aroused by some picture it remains unsatisfied so far as any comment in the text is concerned .

		But then , Mr.
Hamilton	PERSON	's view - point is not often that of picturesqueness .

		chiefly occupied with the puritan settlement of
New England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Andrew Macphail	PERSON	is the author , and the story is something more than readable , although it is long-winded throughout and drags not a little toward the end .

		The hero is one
Nicholas Dexter	PERSON	, a valiant captain under
Cromwell	PERSON	, and , when the story opens on the eve of the Restoration , a fugitive from the vengeance of the
King	LOCATION	.

		Escaping from
England	LOCATION	with the connivance of a daring sea-dog named
Phineas Pratt	PERSON	, he seeks a home in
Boston	LOCATION	; hut , finding the theological atmosphere of the Bay too stifling to breathe , he soon again becomes a wanderer .

		The particular object of his quest is a maiden whom he had rescued when she was but a child , and whom he now seeks as a lover .

		Her fortunes have been no less chequered than his , and the pursuit leads him a merry chase from
Boston	LOCATION	to the
Bahamas	LOCATION	, and thence again through
Boston	LOCATION	to the northern wUderness .

		Of course she is found at last , and she turns out to be the long-lost daughter of
Phineas Pratt	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Macphail	PERSON	knows something of the early history of the Bay , but his knowledge is far from accurate , and a critic of the more microscopic sort might pick many flaws in his narrative .

		Mr.
Warwick Deeping	PERSON	, is to be warmly congratu - lated upon his latest story , which he has entitled `` Bess of the Woods . ''

		It is a story of country life in
England	LOCATION	, dated in the
latter half of the eighteenth century	DATE	, and accomplishes the difficult feat of pre - senting that period in romantic coloring , while remaining faithful to its artificial speech and its social usages .

		Gentlefolk and rustics are alike de - lineated with truth and sympathy , and in the contrast between these two groups , brought into close relations by the hero 's romance , the author finds one of his best artistic effects .

		We have , on the one hand , besides the hero , his delightfully cynical and selfish aunt , who is a seasoned campaigner , and the baronet his neigh - bor , whose family includes a swaggering son and a shrewish daughter of more summers than she would willingly acknowledge .

		This young woman marks the hero for her own , and he becomes so entangled in his own strained notions of honor that he is well nigh victimized , being saved , however , by an infusion of good sense which results from certain interviews with his malicious but clear-sighted aunt .

		On the other hand , deep in the neighboring forest there lives a small community of peasants , whose chief occu - pation is smuggling , and among them the heroine , who is believed to be of their blood , but who has in reality been left in their hands as a child after a grim The King 's Revoke .

1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 scene of murder and robbery committed many years before .

		She is , in fact , another
Lorna Doone	PERSON	, and the patriarchal government of the clan is rather closely patterned after that of
Blackmore	PERSON	's famous nest of outlaws .

		How hero and heroine meet , how they heed the voices of their hearts , with what machi - nations of craft and villainy they are compassed about , and with what triumph they finally escape from the toils , are the matters set forth in this ex - tremely interesting , well-written , and artistically - framed romance , which has not had many equals in the fiction of recent years . ''

		In Desert Keeping , '' by Mr.
Edmund Mitchell	PERSON	, is the story of a secret murder which the desert does not , however , keep very long , and which when dis - closed brings about a pretty complication .

		The victim has been , in days long past , the lover of his slayer 's wife ; and it is their son who discovers the secret of the crime , believing all the time that the slayer and not the slain is his father .

		The son , being the legatee of the dead man 's fortune , is charged with compli - city in the crime , which keeps the reader in a con - dition of tense excitement for quite a while .

		It is a , rather poor story , on the whole , but not without some slight merits of characterization and plot .

		Mr.
Filson Young	PERSON	, who under the name of '' Guy Thorne '' will be remembered as the author of the rather crude and sensational novel '' When It Was Dark , '' has given us in '' The Sands of Pleasure '' a far more acceptable and serious work .

		Its hero is an engineer by profession , and the first section of the novel presents him occupied with the task of con - structing a lighthouse on the
Cornish	LOCATION	coast .

		There is much display of technical information in this de - scription , but it is discreetly handled , and the picture of the struggle with the sea is singularly impres - sive .

		When his work is practically over , the hero goes to
Paris	LOCATION	for relaxation , and for the first time in his life comes into contact with the world of pleasure-seeking and sordid vice .

		This second sec - tion of the work thus deals with debatable matter , and with a frankness hitherto almost unexampled in English fiction ; but we are g ^ ven fair warning of what is to come , and the author 's defence of his course is not without weight . ''

		It is obviously im - possible , '' he says , '' that everyone should know the half-world at first-hand : but there is every reason why mature people should read about it , not bitterly or unpleasantly , but as pleasantly as possible , in the mirror of a page written without moral preoccupa - tions . ''

		So Mr.
Filson	PERSON	's heroine -LRB- as far as the book has one -RRB- is a demi-mnndaine , a creature of delicate and elusive charm who captivates for a time the senses of the hero , yet who is not portrayed with the artificial sentimentality of '' La Dame aux Camel - lias , '' but is presented in a light clear enough to illuminate the ugliness of her life no less than its attractive aspects .

		We may hardly quarrel with a writer who so conscientiously aims at artistic truth , however much he may startle us by the boldness of his treatment .

		In the third section of the book , the hero , his infatuation brought under control , is ag ^ in found at the scene of his labors , the difficult process of regeneration at work within his soul .

		The episode of a visit to a Trappist monaster ^ ' contributes notably both to his strenghtening and to the impressiveness of the book 's implied teaching .

		It is not a book for the young to read , but it is one that will work no harm to mature and balanced minds .

		Madame Emma M agdalena
Rosalia Maria Josef	PERSON	a
Barbara	LOCATION	,
Baroness Orczy	PERSON	, has given us , in '' A Son of the People , '' a deeply interesting romance of the Alfdld , or great Hungarian plain .

		The peasant and the magnate 's daughter provide the romance , which is worked out upon a familiar plan .

		The magnate has impoverished himself by agi-icultural experiments and a reckless scale of living ; his estates are heavily mortgaged , and the rich peasant becomes his princi - pal creditor .

		The latter has long worshipped the magnate 's daughter from afar , and proposes to relieve the financial situation by making her his wife .

		This sordid arrangement is effected , and the wedding takes place .

		But the aristocratic heroine , scorning her base-born husband , overwhelms him with her contempt , and he makes no effort to keep her at his side .

		Eventually , however , the nobility of his char - acter is revealed to her , and her scorn dissolves in the love which she has long half-consciously felt for him , thus bring the tale to a happy ending .

		It is a strong and attractive piece of work , vivid in descrip - tion and characterization ^ dramatic in action .

		Depict - ing the kind of life with which the romances of Jokai have make us fairly familiar , it has in some respects an advantage over those fantastic inventions .

		At least , it conforms more closely than they to the accepted European ideals of orderly movement and logical structure , while sacrificing nothing of their intensely national character . ''

		The Man from
America	LOCATION	, '' by Mrs.
Henry de	PERSON	la Pasture , is described as ' * a sentimental comedy . ''

		It is a story without a problem or a purpose , as these terms are used by the strenuous modem novelist , but simply a charming study of some young people of
Devonshire	ORGANIZATION	, with an ancient expatriated French - man and a few visiting Americans thrown in for variety .

		It is decidedly pleasant to be in the society of the old Frenchman and of the two grand-daughters upon whom his affection is lavished .

		The book 's chief excuse for being is that it affords us this plea - sure ; the fact that the story is all the time slowly leading up to a series of happy and reasonably roman - tic marriages is only a secondary consideration .

		That the work is fresh , human , and altogether de - lightful , must be the verdict of every reader .

		We expect work of verj ' high character from Mrs ,
Margaret Woods	PERSON	, and ' • The King 's Revoke '' does not disappoint us .

		This '' episode in the life of Patrick DUlon '' bears the date of
1808	DATE	, and is con - cerned with the efforts of the young Irishman , in the service of the Spanish royalists , to rescue the young King from captivitj ' in the hands of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.


Joseph Bonaparte	PERSON	occupies the throne , supported by 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, time-serving afrancesados , and the English army is pounding away at the ramparts of his kingdom .

		Meanwhile , Ferdinand the Desired , to whom the mass of the Spanish nation are passionately attached , lives in enforced seclusion in
Touraine	LOCATION	, a guest at
Talleyrand	LOCATION	's chateau .

		He proves a most unheroic hero , for when the plot for his liberation is at the point of successful issue , he sets the plans of the conspirators at naught by refusing to hazard his precious skin , hoping that in the end the imperial French usurper will prove his most useful friend .

		The conspiracy which thus ends in failure is both ingenious and intricate -- rather too much so to be altogether intelligible .

		The main part of the ro - mance has its scene in
Touraine	LOCATION	, and introduces us to a mixed and interesting society of English dete - nus , Spanish nobles , and Frenchmen of various ranks .

		Young
Dillon	PERSON	cuts a dashing but not always dignified figure in the plot , and his shady accom - plice .

		Count d'Haguerty , provides an interesting study in character .

		One figure , that of the beau - tiful and high-souled Marquesa de
Santa Coloma	LOCATION	, stands out above all the others upon this crowded canvas .

		`` The Day 's Journey , '' by
Miss Netta Syrett	PERSON	, is an old story tricked out in modern habiliments .

		Its garb of speech and incident is so extremely modern that we are apt to forget how old the story is in all its essentials .

		When it opens , the hero and the hero - ine have been married for five years , and the dream of love has given place to the grey consciousness of a lost illusion .

		The man has become wearied of do - mesticity , and is seeking for distraction elsewhere .

		The woman thus neglected has at last , after much silent suffering , ceased to care greatly for anything .

		Then the opportune reappearance of an old-time lover restores something of her interest in life , and and her youth and beauty burst once more into bloom .

		She separates herself from her husband , who then begins to realize what she has been to him , while at the same time he discovers how insincere and self-seeking is the character of the other woman who has been the cause of his infidelity .

		Eventually his wife takes pity upon him , and a soi `` t of recon - ciliation follows , bringing the book to a close .

		This complex situation is handled with delicacy through - out , and the whole story is told in a crisp style which never drags and which is always charming .

		A sentimentalized '' literary '' description of the
Fifth Symphony	ORGANIZATION	, by Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	, serves as prelude to '' Where Speech Ends , '' a novel by Mr.
Robert Haven Schauffier	PERSON	.

		It is a musical novel , as this title and this fact indicate ; but the reader need not be apprehensive .

		There is no vague rhap - sodizing in its pages ; the hero is not a romantic tenor , and the heroine is not a moon-struck damsel .

		Nor is there any attempt to represent the artist as an unbalanced and irresponsible creature , whose genius is a sufficient excuse for his moral aberra - tions .

		On the contrary , the gi'oup of musicians with which the story is concerned are essentially normal human beings , having their little eccentricities , no doubt , but on the whole very much like other people .

		The writer seems to understand , moreover , that music is an art having real relations to life .

		Says the Princetonian who follows his bent and becomes a fiddler : '' My chums on the campus call me hard - hearted and disloyal , and say I do n't love the old university properly .

		They ca n't know , of course , that the orchestra is the most deeply sociable insti - tution going ; they ca n't conceive the ecstasy of joining with a hundred kindred musicians and a thousand kindred hearers in that very apotheosis of the brotherhood of man , the
Ninth Symphony	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The characters in this book are for the most part members of the
Chicago Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	.

		This statement must not be taken too literally , for the figure of old
Wolfgang	PERSON	is hardly to be taken as a portrait of the late
Theodore Thomas	PERSON	, despite a few realistic touches .

		But the scene is
Chicago	LOCATION	, with the definite naming of localities , and even the recognizable de - scription of personalities .

		The
Avriter	PERSON	has a keen faculty of humorous observation , which may be illus - trated by this thumb-nail sketch of the old kettle - drummer at the festive board : • ' At his food
Loewen	ORGANIZATION	was always a pleasing and curious spectacle .

		He had done military service in his youth , and four times a day his early training cropped up in him .

		He was always militant at his meals .

		Before attack - ing a roll his face would take on an invincible expres - sion .

		Then the resolute jaws would bury themselves in it and one could see the dozens of valiant little wrinkles that would scale the cheeks and lodge about the discolored temples .

		He handled a knife like a sabre , a fork like a bayonet , and his infrequent operations with a finger-bowl partook of the nature of ablutions before inspection . ''

		There is pathos , too , in the book , of a sincere and appealing kind .

		The plot is unimportant , although it gives us a hero -LRB- or possibly two -RRB- and a heroine , with a villain whose machinations keep the lovers apart for a time .

		But the story is essentially one of incidents , loosely strung together , charming in their freshness , and intimate in their revelation of the musician 's every - day life .

		It makes reading of an altogether wholesome and delightful sort . ''

		Buchanan 's Wife , '' by Mr.
Justus Miles Forman	PERSON	, is the story of a woman who has married for money , and whose husband , a man of moody and occasion - ally vicious temper , makes her life unbearable .

		Matters are further complicated by the existence of the man whom she ought to have married .

		Presently
Buchanan	PERSON	disappears mysterously , and long after - wards a body is discovered which the wife identifies as that of her lost but not mourned consort .

		Then she man-ies her lover .

		But the fact is that she has lied in identifying the corpse , and presently
Buchanan	PERSON	turns up in the form of a consumptive tramp , who has forgotten the facts of his former life , although haunted by intangible fancies , which become danger - ously vivid when he is brought once more into the old familiar environment .

		The terrified wife tries
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 243 to conceal the fact of his existence , but her second husband finds it out .

		Then follows an exciting scene in which the real husband dies , the nominal husband barely escapes with his life , and the blackmailing villain is torn to pieces by an infuriated dog .

		Thus ends a preposterous yarn which has little power to arouse sympathy , and which depends for its effects upon trickiness and crude melodrama .

		Mr.
Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	's new novel strikes a deeper note , and is altogether of more serious quality than most of his productions .

		It is a story of a
New England	LOCATION	coast town , with a light-house and a life - saving station , both of which adjuncts are effectively used in its development .

		It is thus , to a consider - able extent , an open-air story , with effects of storm and sunlight that the author knows how to put to picturesque uses .

		Essentially , however , it is the life - history of two sisters , one of whom is a selfish worldling , a girl who lapses from virtue , and success - fully , until near the end , conceals her misdoing .

		This concealment is made possible by the devotion of the other , who sacrifices happiness and even good repute in the endeavor to save the erring sister 's name from stain .

		The book is one of much simple strength and human sympathy .

		Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	has many admirable qualities as a novelist , and his work is always interesting , but the novel of character is not his affair .

		Consequently , the praise which is justly due his romantic inven - tions -LRB- even the most fantastical of them -RRB- and his fictions having a historical framework must be re - luctantly withheld from '' ` The Fighting Chance , '' which is a story of the idle rich in their favorite haunts .

		Here is a book without a single character who has ever done anything to justify his existence , without a worthy ideal of any kind to bestow upon it a genuine human interest .

		Of course there is a brave pretence of depicting this seamy phase of our society in such a light as to expose its snobbishness and corruption , but we can not feel that the exposure is made in full sincerity .

		We have all the time a consciousness that the writer is quite as much con - cerned to show how intimately he knows the life of `` the smart set '' as he is to hold it up for reproba - tion .

		Even the novels of Mi-s .

		Wharton and Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	give us something of this feeling , and the present work impresses it still more strongly upon us .

		The lieroine is another
Lily Bart	PERSON	, and the final triumph of love over worldliness in her case is rather a concession to romantic sentiment than the revela - tion of anything particularly admirable in her character .

		The hero is a semi-reformed drunkard whom the author 's best efforts can not succeed in making otherwise than superficially attractive .

		Such books as this play with the glittering surface of life , but have nothing to do with its deeper realities .

		If Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	is well-advised he will return , after this unfortunate experiment , to his metier as a writer of historical romance and interpreter of the poetry of nature .

		... Professor
Maior	PERSON	's `` First Steps in studies in the , / - , , ■ `` , .

		n mental growth Mental
Grrowth	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is of a little child , mainly a record of observations upon his own eldest son during the first three years of life .

		It is true , as the author says , that '' one can - not undertake the arrangement of material of this kind without thinking about it , '' and in consequence more or less interpretation has been included .

		It is hard to say whether more data or more interpreta - tion is the greater need of child-study just now ; probably both must advance together .

		Until we have more trustworthy facts , theorizing is hazardous ; and yet until we have some more definite lines of hypoth - esis the task of the observer is a blind one .

		So we may welcome all such work as this of Professor Major 's , giving us the benefit of the observation of a trained psychologist at close range with his infant subject .

		We can not , indeed , have too many such records .

		The author is in general remarkably sane and conservative in his inferences , and seems always on his guard against asserting the inner psychic event upon any but convincing evidence .

		He often takes the attitude expressed by his words on page 197 : '' But reflection will show that the case is not quite so clear as seems at first sight . ''

		Only by such vigilant caution may the psychologist hope to escape reading into the psychic state what is not there at all .

		The old ambiguity as to Imitation crops out in Chapter V. '' The idea of a movement , '' we axe told , '' is already the beginning of that movement . '

		* True enough ; but in the subsequent discussion it is not always remembered that it is the idea of a. movement in oneself , and not the vision or image of a movement in another , that is the beginning of the movement .

		The refusal of the child to '' imitate '' various simple and apparently tempting acts -LRB- p. 129 -RRB- is easily explained on this basis ; seeing the father clapping his hands produces an idea of a movement , it is true , but no immediately dynamic or ideomotor idea .

		The most serious lack in the book seems to us to be the neglect of the will .

		Mere physical con - trol is treated , of course , in the chapters on move - ments , drawing , imitation , play , language ; but the beginnings of ethical control are slighted .

		Nor ia this book alone in this regard , but in general little attention has been given by the psychologists of childhood to the origin and development of the dis - position and the habitual moral attitude , especially such matters as habits of obedience and disobedience , cheerfulness , activity , affection , and the like .

		On the whole .

		Professor Major 's book is one of the safest and most fruitful of its class .

		Assays worth preservinij .

		Collected and reprinted book-reviews too often have this , and this only , in common with life : that they are '' as tedious as a twice-told tale , vexing the dull ear of drowsy man . ''

		Hence the satisfaction with which we hail such exceptions to the rule as are found in 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	,
R. H. Hutton	PERSON	's trenchant and vigorous book-notices , in
Ainger	ORGANIZATION	's gentle and genial literary appreciations , and in Mr.
Herbert Paul	PERSON	's able and scholarly sur - veys of current noteworthy publications .

		The vol - ume entitled '' Stray Leaves '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- comprises ten essays contributed by Mr.
Paul	PERSON	to '' The Nineteenth Century '' and `` The Independent Review , '' six of them being criticisms of books , one a chapter in praise of
Peacock	LOCATION	's novels , one a strong plea for Greek but not for its compiUsory study , still another having to do with '' The Religion of the Greeks '' -- being suggested by Miss
Jane Harrison	PERSON	's `` Prole - gomena to the Study of Greek Religion '' -- and finally , though first in the order of position , a eulo - gistic sketch of the late Bishop
Creighton	PERSON	.

		Jour - nalism is dignified by such pens as Mr.
Paul	PERSON	's -- none too numerous , unfortunately .

		Biography , and history too , have received no mean contributions from his scholarship and energy .

		In the present volume of miscellanies there is something ingratia - ting in the way he disclaims all erudition in Greek language and literatm-e , and then goes on to show a great deal of curious and special knowledge in matters relating to his theme , as in the Greek schol - arship of English writers from
Bentley	LOCATION	to
Brown	PERSON	- ing .

		He has no fear that Greek literature will fall into neglect unless the study of it be kept up by compulsion .

		Here he sounds a brave note .

		But he sadly errs in declaring very roundly that '' the study of Greek is time thrown away unless it results in a familiarity with the style and idiom of the Greek writers from Homer to Theocritus , at least equal to an educated Englishman 's acquaintance with French . ''

		Must we easy-going scholars , who delight to sit down with our '' Iliad '' in one hand and our `` Autenrieth '' in the other , believe that we are wasting our time , and that we might as well be reading Pope 's epic of the same name ?

		No , indeed .

		FitzGerald loved the very lexicon he thumbed so thoroughly in reading his favorite `` Don '' in the original Spanish .

		Can not we too get a smack of the true Homeric flavor by aid of grammar and dic - tionary ?

		Nay , more , is there a Greek scholar in all
England	LOCATION	, or in all
Europe	LOCATION	, who can read a tragedy of iEschylus as easily and as rapidly as a tragedy of Corneille or
Racine	LOCATION	?

		Apart from this absurd notion as to the uselessness of a little Greek , Mr.
Paul	PERSON	has written a good book .

		Man does not live by bread alone ; and the spicing or the garnish or the relish that makes his diet palatable and even sustaining is furnished by the imagination that both guides and vivifies the steps of his intel - lect .

		Inspiration at the highest , originality or in - itiative at the simplest , puts the cutting edge on our faculties and shapes our several achievements to their several ends .

		To fathom the inner nature of this phase of human endowment has ever been an allur - ing and ever will remain a legitimate problem in the psychologist 's programme .

		Professor
Ribot	PERSON	, well known for his interesting popularizations in diverse The creative imagination .

		fields of the mental domain , has focussed his ma - terials and his methods upon the task of presenting the role of the imagination in the intellectual en - deavor ; and the essay has tempted the translator to render accessible the data to English readers in a volume entitled `` The Creative Imagination '' -LRB-
The Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- The analysis , the de - velopment , and the types of this faculty occupy the serial enfoldment of the tale , and afford some insight into the sorts and conditions of its manifestations , from the myth-making tendencies of primitive man to the discerning and daring guesses of the well - equipped latter-day worker in science .

		The current of the analysis never runs very deep ; and a great mass of interesting and pertinent detail is lightly touched upon and well marshalled , -- quite enough to suggest that a more serious voyage of discovery along the same stream would be variously profitable .

		Yet the excursion fairly well meets its purposes , and offers suitable guidance to the average , or more than average , excursionist ; though it suggests , as trans - lations commonly do , that an independent tour de - signed to meet the precise needs and modes of travel of the Anglo-Saxon mind would be yet more successful .

		As a manual to a region well worthy of exploration , the volume may be recommended both in the original and in the present form .

		The psycho - logist welcomes such aids to the comprehension of his purposes , though he regrets that they so largely replace , rather than summarise , the more important records of the advancement of his pursuit .

		Brittany is always an alluring subject '' ` Picturesque f ^ j. ^ jjg pgj ^ ^ f ^ \ yQ descriptive writer and the brush or pencil of the artist .

		This ancient province , with its forbidding coast tortured into a thousand fantastic shapes , its wild hilly inland districts , with their foaming torrents , streams , and rivulets , its barren wind-swept moors and heaths , with their ponds and marshes , is essen - tially different from the rest of
France	LOCATION	.

		The Britons , moreover , have ever kept themselves a race apart , intermarrying as a general rule amongst themselves only , speaking their own language , now broken up into several dialects , and clinging with almost pa - thetic devotion to traditions and customs long since abandoned elsewhere .

		In the opinion of many scholars , it was amongst the glades and oak-groves of the primeval forests of Brittany that was first evolved the Arthurian romance that has exercised so great an influence over modern literature and art .

		King Arthur himself , the greater number of his knights , the mighty enchanter
Merlin	PERSON	and the fair
Vivien	PERSON	who wrought his ruin , are all supposed to have been of Briton birth ; and not so very long ago any presumptuous skeptic who should have dared , in certain districts of
Brittany	LOCATION	, to scoff at the legend of the Holy Grail , would have been in dan - ger of rough treatment at the hands of the natives .

		In fact , the Britons still retain the poetic imagina - tion of childhood ; they live in an ideal world of their own , and are proud of the limitations which
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		Thus , to the student of folk-lore , as well as to the archaeologist , the historian , and the artist , this land of many memories offers an inexhaustible field .

		The hittorv ^ ^ '' ^ ^ ^ Lelaud Ha worth 's book on ofafamou * `` The Disputed Hayes-Tilden Elec - duputed election .

		^ : ^ Q ^ of 1876 '' -LRB-
BiUTows Brothers	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the first adequate history of ' • the most memorable electoi-al controversy in the history of popular govern - ment . ''

		Thii ` ty years have passed since this remark - able contest ; the chief candidates , most of the party managers , and all but two of the members of the
Electoral Commission	ORGANIZATION	are dead , and most Americans have no personal recollection of the events described .

		Mr.
Haworth	PERSON	is therefore correct in believing that the time has come when its history may be written impartially , and judgment passed without prejudice .

		The book bears evidence of painstaking research and study .

		Besides more than 20,000 pages of Congres - sional docimientary evidence , the author has drawn his material from a variety of other sources , and has personally interviewed the more prominent survivors who figiu-ed in the controversy .

		He reviews the political situation at the close of the
Reconstruction Perio	ORGANIZATION	< l , and describes the demoralization which brought about the revolt in the ranks of the Repub - lican party and culminated in the Democratic triumphs of
1874	DATE	and
1876	DATE	.

		He discusses in detail the violence and intimidation which marked the elections of
1876	DATE	in
Florida	LOCATION	,
South Carolina	LOCATION	, and
Louisiana	LOCATION	; draws a vivid picture of the excitement and intense strain which followed ; summarizes the constitutional provisions for counting the electoral votes ; reviews the precedents regarding the electoral count , and discusses the various schemes proposed by both parties for settling the controversy , the crea - tion of the
Electoral Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and the pi-ocesses by which it reached a decision .

		Mr.
Haworth	PERSON	's own judgment is that many regrettable things were done by both parties , but that the desperation to which the people of the South had been driven by the long period of misgovernment serves in a measure to palliate the violence and intimidation which they practised in order to carry the elections .

		This vio - lence and intimidation was mUd in most cases , although in some instances it was horrible beyond belief .

		Had there been a fair election , he asserts , in the disputed states , there is every reason to believe that all would have returned substantial majorities for
Hayes	PERSON	, and that the Republican returning board , under the pressure of '' visiting statesmen '' from the North , were guilty of the most irr ^ nlar practices in throwing out votes to secure the election of a ticket which would have been successfid with a fair and free vote .

		The act creating the
Electoral Commission	ORGANIZATION	, he asserts , was , without a shadow of a doubt , one of the wisest pieces of statecraft ever evolved by an
American Congress	ORGANIZATION	; the procedure and decision of the Conmiission on all the points before it was con - sistent and in accord with the law .

		and the American people ratified the decision by electing one of its members -LRB-

		Mr.
John	PERSON	Fj ` vie 's well printed and illustrated com - pilation entitled ' • Some Literarj - Eccentrics '' -LRB-
James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has characteristics of the first two classes , and is not wholly free from those of the last .

		The opening chapter treats of a forgotten eighteenth - centurj * author highly commended by so distinguished a critic as
Hazlitt	PERSON	.

		Thomas Amor ^ ' , whose chief work was that strange hodge-podge of a novel called ``
John Buncle	PERSON	. ''

		is styled by
Hazlitt	PERSON	the English Rabelais , as Mr.
Fj-vie	PERSON	takes occasion to remind us .

		In a later chapter ,
Hazlitt	PERSON	himself comes in for con - sideration as one of the eccentrics , which may seem the more natural and fitting after his hyperbolic praise of Amory .

		The author , in recording the visit of
Hazlitt	PERSON	's father to
America	LOCATION	, saj ^ s that '' he founded the first Unitarian church in
Boston	LOCATION	, after the con - clusion of the war , in
1783	DATE	. ''

		But , if accuracy here is worth while , `` The Monthly Repository , '' Vol .

		III. , page 305 , informs us that this dissenting minister arrived in
Boston	LOCATION	May 1.5 ,
1784	DATE	; and that he so used his influence , especially by publishing a tract in confutation of the Thirty-nine Articles , that the congregation of
King 's Chapel	ORGANIZATION	, then under Dr. Free - man 's liberal leadership , came out openly for Uni - tarianism ; all of which may be found in Mr.
George Willis Cooke	PERSON	's • ' Unitarianism in
America	LOCATION	, '' and elsewhere .

		Among the not too familiar good things in the book occurs a curious illustration of the '' scientific imagination . ''

		Babbage , the calculating machine , once capped the poet
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's story of having caught cold from mistaking a single-paned window for an open one , with the following : '' When I go to the house of a friend in the country and unexpectedly remain for the night , having no nightcap , I should naturally catch cold .

		But by tying a bit of pack - thread tightly round my head I go to sleep imagining that I have a nightcap on ; consequently I catch no cold at all . ''

		Taken for no more than it professes to be , the book is a good one ; moreover , its chapters have already received the imprimatur of magazine 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	,
Tennyson	PERSON	as seen by a child editors ; and , finally , if it be true , as
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	maintains , that eccentricity and strength of character often go together , these studies of some notable variations from the type are not beneath our attention .

		Incurably shy of lion-hunters in his lifetime ,
Tennyson	PERSON	has since his death fallen victim to countless chroniclers of reminiscences of the poet , chiefly as seen -LRB- how often it must have been against his will -RRB- in his island retreat of Farringford .

		To this mass of
Tennyson	LOCATION	- iana , this parasitic growth that flourishes on the great man 's fame without lessening its vitality , Mrs.
Edith NichoU Ellison	PERSON	has added '' A Child 's Recollections of Tennyson '' -LRB- Button -RRB- in a pretty illustrated book - let that can be easily read at a sitting .

		Mrs.
Ellison	PERSON	is the daughter of Dean
Bradley	PERSON	of Westminster .

		In her childhood the family used to spend a week or two twice a year in the Isle of
Wight	LOCATION	, two miles from the Tennysons ; and as the children of the two households were plapnates , her opportunities to see the poet were many .

		Her childhood impressions of him , as recalled after an interval of half a century , are eked out with recollections of some of his friends , and with other not always closely related matters .

		The writer says incidently of herself and playmates , '' There were few of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's poems which we could not pour forth in moments of enthusiasm '' -- which would indicate that they were remarkable children .

		As a sample of the book 's contents , let us close with the following an , ecdote , which is fravight with a deeper meaning . ''

		One
summer	DATE	day he -LSB- the writer 's father -RSB- arrived at his Freshwater home in high spirits , and almost immediately rushed oft ' to see his poet friend ... My father smote him im - petuously on the shoulder , calling out , ' Hullo !

		how are you ? '

		The poet answered in a deep voice , and without even turning his head , ' Tired of life ! '

		At this time , as it happened , Mr.
Tennyson	PERSON	was particu - larly prosperous and fortunate in every way . ''

Oct. 16	DATE	^ KEEPING UP WITH THE MAGAZINES without giving all one 's time to them is a task of ever-increasing difficulty .

		CThis is decidedly the magazine age .

		The number , variety , and high quality of our periodicals are nothing less than amazing .

		The master-minds of the world go to their making , -- the greatest of living thinkers , workers , story-tellers , poets , and artists .

		One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand .

		By limiting oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year , all but a very small portion of the field is overlooked .

		C.The only sensible plan is to buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the things one wants most to see .

		This plan has been made practicable by What 's in the Magazines , a monthly publication which renders the mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy every-day reader .

		Each issue presents a bird 's - eye view of the maga - zine-contents of the month , with the aid of which one may gain in ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as though he had personally examined a copy of each .

		C .

		It is not a mere list of contents ; neither is it a complicated and confusing library index .

		Everything is arranged and classified , simply but exactly ; whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ - ers or merely looking out for good things in general , the arrangement is equally convenient .

		C .

		It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine - land , -- a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell ; and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person .

		A genuine inspiration .

		The Nation : -- AMERICAN '' We do not recommend it to impatient readers .

		To all others , we recommend it with something more nearly approaching enthusiasm than is usually expected of the jaded novel-reader of tradition ... Seriously , we take this to be a novel of imcommon quality ... We hardly know how to suggest the mellowness of this story , and therein lies its charm .

		In detail it is often brilliant , sometimes exuberant -- a work of true humor . ''

		New York Times Review : -- '' No work of fiction at once so broadly human , so variously delightful ... so richly and distinctly a liter - ary transcript of significant things in a real life , has appeared in a long time .

		Even ' The Divine Fire ' of Miss
May Sinclair	PERSON	, the book of recent years which comes nearest to the mark , must yield place to this ... Rich in felicitous wordings of things everybody ought to see and does not or would like to say and can not ... a book worth reading and re-reading and keeping in your house . ''

		Spectator : -- ENGLISH '' A remarkable novel , a fine novel , by whatever standards we judge it .

		We have never for a moment a doubt about the reality .

		Every character , down to the humblest , has the stamp of a genuine humanity .

		Mr.
DeMorgau	PERSON	shows that it is possible to be shrewd without cynicism , and humorous without buffoonery .

		No book has appeared for long in which lovers of the classic tradition in English fiction are likely to find such genei-ous entertainment . ''

		Speaker : -- '' A human document , and impresses one as a close study from life itself .

		The humour is too drj - to have been invented , the satire too delicate .

		And the sadness of the book , too , is the sadness of life , the tragedy that arises from mistake ... Deserves to stand high above the average output of fiction . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION 286 NOTES 286 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 288 A YEAR OF CONTINENTAL LITERATURE .

		The annual reviews of the chief
Continental	ORGANIZATION	literatures , which have long constituted one of the most valuable services of the
London	LOCATION	`` Ath - enaeum , '' ' are no longer regidarlv presented in a single group of articles , but are scattered through the year as occasion seems to warrant .

		Two recent numbers of our English contemporary have contained reports from
Germany	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Kussia	LOCATION	, which we here attempt to summarize .

		The German report , by Dr.
Ernst Heilbom	PERSON	, instead of essaying the customary survey of the whole field of literary production , is this year confined to a discussion of
t %	PERCENT	vo books .

		Pastor Frenssen 's novel '' Hilligenlei '' and
Herr Schnitzler	PERSON	's comedy '' • Zwischenspiel . ''

		The for - mer work , which we review elsewhere in its En - glish translation , need not for that reason long detain us .

		We quote only a single suggestive sentence from Dr. Heilbom : '' In the episodes in which
Herr Frenssen	ORGANIZATION	gives poet - ical and popular expression to those dim fancies and presentiments of struggling , self-willed souls that are so characteristic of his Holstein people , his style resem - bles that of the ballad - writers ; we get the impression that a master of the short ballad -- he has never pub - lished anything in that form -- is trying his hand , and not altogether to his advantage , at a long prose nar - rative . ''

		Turning to
Herr Schnitzler	PERSON	's play , we read of the author that '' he is a sceptic , and puts no faith in sensual impulses . ''

		The situation in '' Zwischenspiel '' is thus introduced : '' A man and a woman , both of whom are free from prejudices of any kind , have married .

		He is a musical director , and she a singer , and the unconventional views held in the artistic circles they frequent have influenced them deeply .

		Even from the beginning they felt that their union would have to come to an end as soon as their love for each other should be dead .

		Their part - nership , however , was , as they imagined , based upon one solid foundation -- that of sincerity .

		They have prom - ised -- and hitherto have kept the promise -- that they will speak the truth to each other unreservedly , even if the day should come when one or the other falls in love with someone else . ''

		But temptation comes to both , and `` the very sincerity on which they had relied proves their ruin . ''

		The working out of the play offers a 270 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, tangle of infidelity , suspicion , attempted recon - ciliation , and final separation .

		The play proves , we are told , '' that the institution of marriage is justified in its own nature , and those who con - sider themselves superior to all the traditional conceptions of morality are themselves made to furnish the proof , '' which is a most excellent moral .

		The critic makes a comparison between the two significant writers of whom he has been discoursing .

		The novelist , he says , '' Has the health and sturdy independence of one who lives a country life , looks his fellows straight in the face , and turns his clear gaze up to the stars in visionary thought ... -LSB- The dramatist -RSB- is the neurotic , moody , sen - sitive child of the metropolis , who makes it his task to arrest and hold fast the fleeting impulses of the spirit , and to whom reality appears illusion , and illusion real - ity .

		We may feel ourselves drawn to the one or the other according to our temperament , but neither can be ignored . ''

		Dr.
Guido Biagi	PERSON	's notes on Italian literature give the first place to Senator Fogazzaro 's '' II Santo , '' of which also we review the translation upon another page of this issue .

		This book , the writer remarks , '' produces the effect of those ultra-modern religious pictures in which
Christ	ORGANIZATION	is seen appearing at a supper of persons clad in evening dress .

		The violent contrast between the theme and the modern and mundane atmo - sphere destroys all verisimilitude . ''

		We have already said something like this about '' Hill - igenlei , '' and the observation applies to '' II Santo '' with perhaps gi'eater truth .

		Other Italian fiction of the year includes
Signora Serao	PERSON	's '' Dopo il Perdono '' and
Signer Diego Angeli	PERSON	's '' L'Orda d'Oro , ' which is a story of '' that cosmopolitan society which flocks to
Rome	LOCATION	in search of the distractions offered by the only capital in existence that can boast of two Courts and two diplomatic worlds , where carnival and dance can be had in double doses . ''

		A highly important work in the dramatic field is Prof essor
Luigi Rosi	PERSON	's '' Italian Comedians , '' being two richly illustrated volumes upon the history of the Italian stage .

		A. few other works are '' La Poesia Popolare Italiana , '' by Sig .

		A. d'Ancona ; ``
Nuovi Studi Danteschi	PERSON	, '' by Sen - ator
F. d'Ovidio	PERSON	; '' La
Donna Fiorentina	PERSON	del Buon Tempo Antico , '' by Professor I. del Lungo ; and a '' Manuale Comparative di Let - terature Stranieri , '' by Professors
G. Mazzoni	PERSON	and
P. E. Pavolini	PERSON	.

		Don
Rafael Altamira	PERSON	says that '' the balance of the last twelve months has been rather against Spanish literature . ''

		The death of Valera a year ago has been followed by that of
Pereda	PERSON	, the novelist of Santander , and by that of the poet
Manuel Palacio	PERSON	.

		Although all three lived to an advanced age , and had probably given their best to the world , '' they seem to cast a sort of tutelary shade within which are developed the authors who are destined to replace them . ''

		The important enterprise of the resuscitated '' Biblioteca de Autores Espanoles '' is discussed at considerable length , and special comment is made upon the four volumes of the new series already published .

		It seems that works in Catalan and in
Latin	LOCATION	are also to be included in this library .

		In fiction ,
Senor Galdos	PERSON	has published a new '' Episodio Nacional '' entitled '' La Vuelta al Mundo en la
Numancia	LOCATION	, '' de - scribed as '' the most perfect and eloquent , as well as the most effective , of his symbolical works . '

		Other novels are '' Tristan o el Pesi - mismo , '' by
Senor Valdes	PERSON	, and '' La
Maja Desnudo	PERSON	, '' by
Senor Ibanez	PERSON	.

		Three novelists of the younger school are
Senor Ciges Aparicio	PERSON	, author of '' Del Hospital '' ;
Senor Sanchez Diaz	PERSON	, , author of `` Juan Corazon '' ; and
Senor Miro	PERSON	, author of '' Del Vivir . ''

		All tlu-ee are '' remark - able for energy of thought and expression , for the realistic sincerity of their transcriptions , , and for an engaging audacity of view . ''

		Russian literature , of which Mr.
Valerii Briusov	PERSON	is the chronicler , has been much affected by the revolutionary movement and the com - parative freedom that the press has enjoyed during the past year or more .

		Under these - changed conditions , we are told , '' Numerous new periodicals appeared in
Russia	LOCATION	, withi very varied objects , and extending to social democratic aud revolutionary programmes .

		Many of these were - suppressed after the first numbers or after an existence of some weeks , but they were soon reissued under an - other name , and readers recognized this change of masks .

		Satirical magazines appeared in numbers , ridiculing the higher ranks of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	and their activities ; ; and in this way in
Russia	LOCATION	, after a long interval , political and social satire arose .

		Pamphlets on political subjects had a great circulation -LRB- for the most part translations of chapters of books by
Marx	ORGANIZATION	,
Kautski	PERSON	,
Labriola	LOCATION	, Van - dervelde , and
Kropotkin	PERSON	-RRB- , sometimes running to hun - dreds of thousands of copies .

		At first pamphlets of a social-democratic tendency had the greatest success ; : in the later period those dealing with the advocacy of anarchist theories were in the greatest demand . ''

		Many books of a kind heretofore impossible in
Russia	LOCATION	also found publication -- books about the Decembrists and studies in constitutional law .

		Even such a work as
Radistchev	ORGANIZATION	's '' Jour - ney from
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	to
Moscow	LOCATION	, '' which caused the writer to be severely punished in .1790 , has at last been permitted to see the light .

		Mr.
Andreev	PERSON	's '' To the Stars '' is the most noteworthy dramatic publication of the
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 271 year .

		Although the censorship keeps it from the stage , it has been widely read and discussed . ''

		In this play a savant is represented who is entirely devoted to astronomical questions , and there is a circle of revolutionaires occupied en - tirely with contemporary matters , the burning questions of the day . ''

		Mr.
Andreev	PERSON	has also collected his best '' Tales '' into a volume . ''

		The Red Sword '' is a collection of stories by Mrs.
Z. Gippius	PERSON	, '' written in an elaborate and original style . ''

		Professor
Merezhkovski	PERSON	has been the most conspicuous literary figure of the year , having published three books which are thus described : '' ' The Coming Vulgarian ' characterizes
A. Chekhov	PERSON	and
Gorki	PERSON	as writers without religious feeling : in their success , especially that of the latter , the author sees a symptom of the coming triumph of the \ Tilgar fellow , everything that is grovelling in man .

		In ' The Prophet of the Russian Revolution , ' he gives a totally new point of view of Dostoievski .

		The author shows that there is a profoimd disagreement between
Dostoievski	ORGANIZATION	's offi - cial Slavophile views , justifjnng Russian autocracy , and the spirit of revolt which lies hid in his work .

		The terrible force of revolution is more dangerous to society than all the attempts of the throwers of bombs .

		His third work , '
Gogol	PERSON	and the Devil , ' gives an original interpretation of the person and fate of Gogol . ''

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The mechanicai , spirit of the age , so far at least as it shows itself in the production of meclianical music , is deplored by Mr.
Sousa	PERSON	in a recent magazine article .

		The protest comes none too soon .

		For a number of years now it has been possible to soothe the savage breast by dropping a coin into a penny-in-the-slot machine , to soften rocks by gramophone , and to bend a knotted oak with the pianola .

		The camera and process - printing devices combine to give us cheap machine-made art ; type-setting machines and steam presses facilitate the wholesale manufacture of make-believe literature for the market-place ; type-writers , phonographs , and stenographers do their united utmost to verify
Cowper	PERSON	's familiar line and make poetry itself a mere mechanic art . ''

		On Behaviour at Meals , '' a quaint and curious essay written by
Erasmiis	PERSON	five centuries ago , lays down some rules that are almost too homely for quotation , but that help the modern reader to believe the world is really impro \ - ing , if not in its major morals , at least in its minor .

		This is comforting , unless one happens to be disquieted by a lurking suspicion that refinement of manners may be attended by a corresponding refine - ment of wickedness .

		However that may be , the essay - ist gravely admonishes his readers that it is '' very rude to blow your nose on the table-cloth , '' or '' to wipe your fingers on your neighbor 's coat . '' ''

		Never praise the results of your cook 's labours or press your guests to eat , whether they like or not .

		Never criticise your host 's dinner imfavourably even if it be badly cooked .

		Pass over all these things in silence .

		Do not give dogs your bones to crack under the table , or feed the cat , or en - courage animals to jump on the table . ''

		Above all , '' do not lick your plate ; it is an act that ill-becomes a cat , let alone a gentleman . ''

		To descend some rounds on the literary ladder , possibly a novel-i-eader here and there may recall that TroUope makes
Conway Dalrymple	PERSON	, in '' The Last Chronicle of Barsetshire , '' refuse on prin - ciple Mr.
Dobbs Broughton	PERSON	's '47 claret when that gen - tleman had himself praised the wine and told its price .

		But it is doubtfid whether
Dalrymple	PERSON	, or even
Trollope	PERSON	, knew that he was here frowning on the violation of one of
Erasmus	ORGANIZATION	's rules .

		This brief reference to the learned Dutch scholar and one of his minOr works is prompted by a peep into Mr.
Richard Davey	PERSON	's recent interesting volumes on '' The Pageant of
London	LOCATION	. ''

		The art of solitude , if the expression is allowable , appears to be in some danger of becoming a lost art in these crowded hours of glorious life .

		The means of intercommunication are superabundant , and we nm the risk of forgetting Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	's wholesome ad - vice . ''

		Be able to be alone , '' he counsels the reader , in his '' Christian Morals . '' ''

		Lose not the advantage of solitude , and the society of thyself ; nor be only content , but delight to be alone and single with Omnipresency .

		He who is thus prepared , the day is not uneasy , nor the night black unto him .

		Darkness may bound his eyes , not his imag ^ ination . ''

		As if with these last words of
Browne	PERSON	's in his mind ,
Lowell	PERSON	says in his essay on Dryden : '' Solitude is as needful to the imagination as - society is wholesome for the character . ''


Gibbon	PERSON	in his memoirs has left this stately note of a yearly custom of his : '' On the approach of
spring	DATE	I withdraw without reluctance from the noisy and extensive scene of crowds without company , and dissipation without pleasure '' The golden mean is of course the thing to aim at .

		`` Here again , as so often , '' writes
Emerson	PERSON	, `` Nature delights to put us between extreme antagonisms , and our safety is in the skill with which we keep the diag - onal line .

		Solitude is impracticable , and society fatal .

		We must keep our head in the one , and our hands in the other .

		The conditions are met if we keep our independ - ence , yet do not lose our sjTnpathy .

		These wonderful horses need to be driven by fine hands . ''

		The Greek vase , so effectively used by
Keats	PERSON	in his finest ode , has again been admirably employed as an illustration , or symbol , by Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	, in a recent public address .

		The '' Attic shape '' served the speaker to typify the contrast between American civilization and that of
Continental Europe	ORGANIZATION	.

		A pyramid is the form taken by European society , -- broad at the base and tapering upward to the point for whose sup - port all the substructure has its being ; and , it might be added , the base of the pyramid is little less likely to rise than is the peasant of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		American society , on the other hand , is viewed by Dr.
Hale	PERSON	in his indom - itable optimism as having the gracefid and flowing out - lines of a Greek vase , -- contracted at the base , swelling to ample proportions in the middle , and narrowing only a little as it nears the top .

		In other words , the mud - sill of our social structure presents itself to the speak - er 's eye as no more conspicuous than such a fimdament ought to be in a well-designed piece of architecture .

		As for the controlling mass of our population -- the fortimate multitude to whom Agur 's prayer , '' Give me 272 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, neithei ' poverty nor riches '' has heen granted -- Dr.
Hale	PERSON	holds that neither the arrogant plutocracy above nor the brutality and ignorance below can avail to diminish its strength and vitality .

		This striking image of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's was modestly offered the other day as nothing new , being casually thrown out in the course of a long address with the remark that the speaker believed he had said the same thing in the same place twenty years before .

		• * • The newspaper habit is deservedly stigmatized in a timely little volmne of essays on bookish themes by one who , as librarian , and in other capacities , has rend - ered honorable service to the cause of culture .

		Without searching his pages for arguments and proofs , anyone might with little difficulty show that an indiscriminate newspaper diet can not but produce flippancy , superfi - ciality , aimlessuess , vulgar curiosity , commonplaceness , laziness , mental flabbiness , disregard for truth , a grow - ing thirst for sensation , and many other undesirable qualities .

		In these days when the chief purveyor , in this country , of this variety of literature , and that too in its most objectionable form , is manifesting ambitions of a kind that , unless checked , might bring him in the end to sit in very high places , no condemnation of this demoralizing species of reading-matter can be made too emphatic or repeated too often .

		It is true that the rising tide of newspapers is not to be swept back with the broom of literary censure ; yet as honest
Sancho	PERSON	has assured us that '' there is a remedy for all things but death , '' even the literary critic may take heart .

		At the very worst , the disease will probably , in the fulness of time , work its own cure .

		When the reading public has had its nausea raised to the right pitch , the stomach will refuse to receive any longer its unsavory food .

		• • • Life 's little ironies give a never-failing piquancy and charm to the daily round of otherwise humdrum duties and vapid pleasures , even as destiny 's grim mock - eries impart a tragic meaning , awfid in its fascination , to the larger concerns of life .


Thomas Wotton	PERSON	, the father of
Sir Henry	ORGANIZATION	, was wont to declare again and again , '' That if ever he did pxit on a resolution to marry , he was seriously resolved to avoid three sorts of persons : namely .

		Those that had children ; Those that had Law-suits ; And those that were of his kindred . ''

		Nevertheless he wedded as his second wife a woman in whom was found '' a concurrence of all those accidents against which he had so seriously resolved , '' and who , be it added , became the mother of
Sir Henry	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` When me they fly , I am the wings , '' is fate 's mocking com - ment on those that think to escape their destiny .

		Rings thrown into the sea in the morning are served up in the fish course at dumer .

		Cinderella , banished to the kitchen hearth , weds the handsome prince .

		Cyrus , delivered to Harpagus to be killed , lives to de - throne his hard-hearted grandfather Astyages .

		-LRB- Edipus , maimed and exposed on Mt. Cithseron by his father Laius , survives to perpetrate , unwittingly , the most terrible crimes .

		And so on , in an imending variety of fable and legend illustrating the same familiar theme .

		These reflections , the triteness of which is not denied , are the fruit of a pleasant hour with
Walton	PERSON	's '' Lives . ''

		From the trivialities of modern members one turns with relief to the old masterpieces of biography , simple and stately , presenting the larger outlines of character and conduct .

		C ^ ^ S ^ to goxrhs .

		A
Bizarre Book on Dickens	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Chestertonese , like Johnsonese , has so marked and invariable a character that it is easy to rec - ognize and not difficidt to imitate , however hard it may be to equal .

		One might discourse for hours in the Chestertonic manner , beginning somewhat as follows : There is a very common saying that virtue is its own reward ; but noth - ing could be further from the truth : virtue is its own penalty .

		And then , by placing oneself on one 's head and viewing all things inverted , one could easily demonstrate the collective wis - dom of the sages to be foolishness , tear to tat - ters the maxims of world-old experience , and leave the generally accepted conventions not a leg to stand on .

		To a fluent writer with a well - developed bump of destructiveness , this is as exhilarating as smashing window-panes is to the small boy with a pocketful of pebbles .

		But to maintain the sensation in its first riotous inten - sity , the window-panes must increase in size , the paradoxes must grow ever more paradoxical .

		That Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	indidges in his wonted orgy of paradox in his already famous book on
Dickens	PERSON	, is only saying that he is still the Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	of '' Varied Types '' and '' Heretics . ''

		Some one has spoken , perhaps a little unkindly , of his '' tremendous , breathless , bank-holiday vol - ubility of expression . ''

		This rushing overflow of superabundant health and high spirits is not in itself a thing to be condenmed so much as won - dered at and enjoyed .

		Taking jDassage in one of his breezy volumes , we straightway find our - selves -LRB- to adopt a current favorite metaphor and nomenclature -RRB- automobiling -- we are tempted to say '' automobubbling '' -- over the literary high - way in a quite breathless and pulse-quickening fashion .

		To be sure , the machine has some little tricks of its own , -- a way of jerking the pas - senger 's breath out of his body and shaking him up now and then , that is rather disconcerting at first , but at last becomes merely monotonous and tiresome .

		For example -- and the figure must now be dropped -- three times at least in the book under review democracy is characterized as undemocratic . ''

		The democracy , '' declares Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, `` has a hundred exuberant good qualities ; the democracy has only one outstand - ing sin -- it is not democratic . ''

		And again , speak - ing for
Dickens	PERSON	, and as if expressly commissioned *

1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 273 by him : '' He realized that representative gov - ernment has many minor disadvantages , one of them being that it is never representative . ''

		The initial major defect has here become a minor .

		Still again , in the same strain : '' '
Carlyle	PERSON	fan - cied that our modern English government was wordy and long-winded because it was demo - cratic government .

		Dickens saw , what is cer - tainly the fact , that it is wordy and long-winded because it is aristocratic government . ''

		Before dropping the subject of mannerisms and taking up the consideration of Mr.
Ches	PERSON	- terton 's book as a whole , a few more instances may be cited .

		A sti-aining for startling effects and for epigrammatic smartness is , of course , all too apparent , though it would probably be nearer the truth to call this not a straining , but an over-indulged natural inclination .

		He wTites : '' The common mind means the mind of all the artists and heroes ; or else it would not be com - mon. .

		Plato had the common mind :
Dant	PERSON	`` had the common mind ; or that mind was not com - mon. '' And on an earlier page : ''
Carlyle	PERSON	killed the heroes ; there have been none since his time .

		He killed the heroic -LRB- which he dearly loved -RRB- by forcing upon each man this question : ' Am I strong or weak ? ' ''

		Another instance : '' And while they might easily get more satis - faction out of a screaming article in The War Cry than out of a page of
Emerson	LOCATION	about the Over-soul , this would not be because the page of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	is another and superior kind of lit - erature .

		It would be because the page of Em - erson is another -LRB- and inferior -RRB- kind of religion . ''

		And finally : '' There is no idea more vulgar or more ignorant than the notion that a gentleman is generally what is called refined . ''

		The au - thor 's favorite mode of emphasizing a writer 's excellences is illustrate < l by the folloAving char - acterizations of
Dickens	PERSON	's art . ''

		We may , '' he writes , '' almost say this : that he coidd only make his characters probable if he was allowed to make them impossible . '' ''

		Dickens 's art is like life because , like life , it is irresponsible , because , like life , it is incredible . ''

		Is not this the very false gallop of consecutive reasoning ?

		It is a perpetual game of bluff ; the reader has no sooner recovered breath after one startling asser - tion than he is again struck speechless with another .

		Credo quia impotusibile , is all he can gasj -RRB- imder this bombardment of paradox .

		One outrageously Chestertonian phrase , '' a raving windmill of pessimism , '' seems made expressly to fit
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's designation of '' Avild and whirling words . ''

		But enough of the author 's well-known idio - syncrasies .

		As to the substance of his book , he is successfvd in showing the reasons of
Dickens	PERSON	's popidaritj ' , in tracing the development of
Dick	PERSON	- ens the writer from the early '' • Sketches by Boz '' through the transitional ''
David Copperfield	PERSON	'' to the final and unfinished ''
Edwin Drood	PERSON	. '' ''

		Pickwick '' he considers the flower of
Dick	PERSON	- ens 's genius , although it is not a novel ; for , excepting '' The Tale of Two Cities , ''
Dickens	PERSON	wrote no novels .

		He was the showman of cer - tain immortal and familiar types .

		Like the folk-lore legends handed down from age to age ,
Dickens	PERSON	's stories have no rounded completeness , with definite beginning and end .

		They are myths , capable of indefinite expansion .

		As Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	expresses it , -- ''
Dickens	PERSON	was a mythologist rather than a novelist ; he was the last of the mythologists , and perhaps the greatest .

		He did not always manage to make his char - acters men , but he always managed , at the least , to make them gods .

		They are creatures like Punch or Father Christmas .

		They live statically , in a perpetual
summer	DATE	of being themselves .

		It was not the aim of
Dickens	PERSON	to show the effect of time and circumstance upon character ; it was not even his arm to show the effect of a character on time and circumstance .

		It is worth remark , in passing , that whenever he tried to describe change in a character , he made a mess of it , as in the repentance of Dombey or the apparent deterioration of
Boffin	PERSON	. ''

		Considerable space is given to the American experiences and impressions of
Dickens	LOCATION	, and the writer is friendly to us in his treatment of the subject .

		He sympathizes with the Amer - ican resentment of
Dickens	PERSON	's eager advocacy of international copyright . ''

		A beautifid young dreamer , '' we read , `` ought qpt to be even conscious of copyrights .

		For it is quite unjust to say that the Americans worship the dollar .

		They really do worship intellect -- another of the passing superstitions of our time . ''

		The following comment on ''
Martin Chuzzlewit	PERSON	'' contains more than a grain of truth . ''


Martin Chuzzlewit	ORGANIZATION	's
America	LOCATION	is a mad-house : but it is a mad-house we are all on the road to .

		For com - pleteness and even comfort are almost the definitions of insanity .

		The lunatic is the man who lives in a small worid but thinks it a large one : he is the man who lives in a tenth of the truth , and thinks it is the whole ... Hence the more cleariy we see the world divided into Saxons and non-Saxons , into our splendid selves and the rest , the more certain we may be that we are slowly and quietly going mad .

		The more plain and satisfying our state appears , the more we may know that we are living in an unreal world .

		For the real world is not satisfying ... The real world is full of bracing be - wilderments and brutal surprises . ''

		Who of us , with even the dimmest remem - brance of his youth , can read without a respon - sive twinge what Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	says about some of boyhood 's agonies ?

		274 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, '' The bitterness of boyish distresses does not lie in the fact that they are large ; it lies in the fact that they are small .

		About any early disaster there is a dreadful finality ; a lost child can suffer like a lost soul .

		It is currently said that hope goes with youth , and lends to youth its wings of a butterfly ; but I fancy that hope is the last gift given to man , and the only gift not given to youth .

		Youth is preeminently the period in which a man can be lyric , fanatical , poetic ; but youth is the period in which a man can be hopeless .

		The end of every episode is the end of the world .

		But the power of hoping through everything , the knowledge that the soul survives its adventures , that great inspiration comes to the middle-aged ; God has kept that good wine imtil now .

		It is from the backs of the elderly gentle - men that the wings of the butterfly should burst .

		There is nothing that so much mystifies the young as the con - sistent frivolity of the old .

		They have discovered their indestructibility .

		They are in their second and clearer childhood , and there is a meaning in the merriment of their eyes .

		They have seen the end of the End of the World . ''

		It is in passages like this that the writer speaks with a happy insight and a telling force of ex - pression that make one almost forgive him his irritating perversities and eccentricities .

		Espe - cially good also is what he has to say about
Dickens	PERSON	's faulty management of his characters , although the good things are , as usual , clothed in paradox .

		A chapter on the great characters of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	is followed by one on his optimism , and this by a final brief chapter on his probable future .

		The author ventures to suggest that
Dickens	PERSON	's '' place in nineteenth century
England	LOCATION	will not only be high , but altogether the high - est ' * ; and further , with the current wrong use of a much over - worked word , '' I venture to offer the proposition that when more years have passed and more weeding has been effected ,
Dickens	PERSON	will dominate the whole
England	LOCATION	of the nineteenth century ; he will be left on that plat - form alone . ''

		This and other judgments in the book display such a lack of judicious deliberation and seemly moderation as to injure the work as a piece of criticism .

		As a life of Dickens it does not profess to have value .

		At the same time , it is entertaining , suggestive , brilliant in spots , the very last book one would go to sleep over .

		As a self-portrayal of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	, rather than a picture of his greater f eUow-coun - tryman , it has decided merits .

		The eye sees only what it brings with it .

		Again and again Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	hits off his own characteristics in seeking to detect those of his hero . ''

		Up - roariously readable '' he calls
Dickens	PERSON	; and up - roariously readable one is at times inclmed to call Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	.

		Dickens 's delight in '' great draughts of words '' is surely equalled by his latest critic 's .

		If Dickens possessed '' hilarious self - consciousness , '' his eulogist is not lacking therein ; and if the elder writer was always striving for '' the pungent perfection of epithet , '' the younger is not less eager in the quest .

		Those who like literary fireworks wiU thoroughly enjoy the book .

		The more sober-minded will deplore the fatal facility of this vigorous and original thinker , a facility that has drawn him into pro- lific authorship before his mind has been sea - soned with long years of study and observation and silent thought .

		He has made haste to set every stitch of canvas before a favoring breeze , without adequate ballast in his hold .

		He has achieved his reputation at an age when many a scholar is , with much self-questioning and many doubts , first venturing to contribute of his accu - mulated treasure toward the enriclunent of the world 's thought .

		Never can the bizarre , as such , be of enduring worth .

		After the War in
Dixie	LOCATION	.

		* During the past few years there have appeared a number of interesting books of war reminis - cences by
Southern	ORGANIZATION	women .

		Two of the best of these , '' A
Virginia	LOCATION	Girl in the Civil War '' and '' A Diary from Dixie , '' were edited by Mrs.
Myrta Lockett Avary	PERSON	, a native Virginian , who now appears again in print with a volume of her own on '' Dixie after the War , '' the first book written by a woman dealing with that stormy period and the smouldering fires of con - troversy which it enkindled .

		Owing to the exceeding interest of the subject , it is probable that this volume wiU be followed by others of a similar natiu-e .

		Such books are valuable , but they can hardly compare in popular interest with those dealing with the more heroic phases of actual war .

		The mere mention of Recon - struction causes an unpleasant feeling ; people on both sides of the line are still irritated about it ; they are not agreed , and it will be long be - fore they are .

		Consequently no book that touches its vital problems will be accepted with - out controversy .

		No one , unless it be some scientific historian , now believes that an unbi - assed account of the happenings of those times could be written ; no one with human feelings .

		Northerner or Southerner , can read or write of many of the happenings of that time without exasperation .

		Probably about all we can reasonably expect in the way of fairness and soberness , in dealing • Dixie after the War .

		THE DIAL 275 with the Reconstruction period , has been done in the vohime under review .

		Its thirty-three chapters treat , from the Southern woman 's point of Aaew , practically all that was of interest , as shown by such variety and range of topics as these : The last campaigns of the war in the heart of the Confederacy ; the dissolution of the Confederate government ; Lincoln in
Richmond	LOCATION	; the military occupation , military government , and relations between the soldiers and the South - ern whites and blacks ; the home-coming of the Confederates ; the imprisonment of Southern leaders : the negroes and freedom ; the aftermath of war -- want and suffering among whites and blacks : religious affairs , amusements , fashions ; the initiation and continuance of negro govern - ment : illegal secret societies ; relations between the races during the Reconstruction period ; the carpet-bagger 's crooked political methods , and the overthrow of Reconstruction ; race preju - dice and '' crimes against women '' ; and , filially , iJie meaning of Memorial and
Confederate pa	ORGANIZATION	- triotic societies .

		The author does not pretend to deal ^ \ ^ th the purely political problems , but aims rather to show what the Southern people of both colors were doing and thinking and say - ing after the war .

		Her sources of information are her o ^ ^ ^ l experiences , journals and letters of friends , contemporary newspapers and public documents .

		A wide acquaintance with the lit - erature of the period is shown , and there are few slips as to facts , names , and dates .

		The book is written in a lively anecdotal style ; the author has a keen sense of humor and a pro- found concejjtion of the value of a good story .

		She has the right knack of selecting the most striking facts , and presenting them at the proper time and place in her narrative .

		Her work will throw many side-lights on the dreary political history of the times .

		While the book is written from the
Southern	LOCATION	woman 's point of view -LRB- and she says that
Southern	ORGANIZATION	women have foimd it diffieidt to get over war and Reconstruction -RRB- , it is generous and fair .

		In describing the military < xjcupation , she says : '' I hate to say hard things of men in blue , and I must say all the good things I can .

		Because many were unworthy to wear the blue , many who were worthy have carried reproach . ''

		The imdisciplined black troops were guiltj '' of horrible outrages ; but for the white troops she has little but praise .

		The most irritating parts of the military regime ^ -- the frequent compidsory oath-takings , the flag persecutions , the '' button '' order , the regulation of church services and marriages , -- are de - scribed in a series of anecdotes , of which the following is a good example .

		It is taken from a diary of the time . ''

		At church I saw officers wearing side arms .

		They come regularly to watch if we pray for the President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		I hope they were edified .

		A number stood up during that prayer .

		Among the most erect were the M -- girls , who have very retrousse noses .

		The
Yankees	ORGANIZATION	reported : ` Not only do they stand up when the President is prayed for , but they turn up their noses . '

		They sent word back : ' A mightier power than the
Yankee Army	ORGANIZATION	turned up our noses '' ' !

		The military conunanders were gentlemen , and shielded the people in many ways , often making themselves offensive to radical politi - cians .

		The enlisted men were prompt to aid the helpless and relieve sviffering .

		One would give his rations to the himgry ; another would guard the homes of unprotected women .

		The following story , told of an
Atlanta	LOCATION	lady now living , then a young wife whose husband had not yet returned after the surrender , is one of the best in the book : '' A big-hearted Irishman caught the little lady strug - gling over soap-suds .

		It looked as if she would never get those clothes clean .

		For one thing , when she tried to wring them , they were streaked with blood from her arms and hands ... ' Faith an ' bejabbers , ' said Pat , ' an ' what is it that you 're thryin ' to do ? ' '

		Go away , and let me alone ! ' '

		Faith , an ' if you do n't lave off clanin ' thim garmints , they '11 be that doirty -- . ' '

		Go ` way ! ' '

		Sure , me choild , an ' if ye 'll jis ' step to the other soide if the tub without puttin ' me to the in - con vaniauce -- . '

		He was about to pick her up in his mighty hands .

		She moved .

		... * Sure , an ' it 's as good a washerwoman as iwer wore breeches I am , ' said Pat .

		... In short order he had all the clothes hanging snow white on the line ; before he left , he cut enough wood for her ironing . '

		I 'm your
Bridget	PERSON	ivery washday that comes ` roun , ' he said ... This brother-man did her wash every week . ''

		Naturally there was little social mingling of Northern people and Southerners ; the women especially kept at home , with windows closed , but we have the author 's word for it that the young ones often peeped through the blinds to see what the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	visiting ladies wore . ''

		I will never forget how queer we thought the dress of the
Northern	ORGANIZATION	ladies ... Their gowns were short walking length , and their feet could be seen quite plainly .

		That style would be becoming to us , we said to ourselves .

		... I got one as soon as I could ... We thought -LSB- their hats -RSB- the most absurd and trifling things .

		But we made haste to get some . ''

		A Southern girl who accepted the attentions of a '' Yankee beau '' was frowned upon .

		It was considered imfair to the dilapidated Con - federate swains now returning from the war .

		But some amusiog things happenetl through this exclusiveness .

		For example : '' Our ladies went veiled on the street ... There was not much opportunity for young blue-coats to so 276 THE J3IAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, much as behold our pretty girls , much less make eyes at them ...
Mary Triplett	PERSON	, our famous blonde beauty , was walking along , when the wind took off her veil and carried it to the feet of a young Federal officer .

		He bent , uplifted the vagrant mask , and with his cap held before his eyes restored it . ''

		Some of the most instructive chapters in the book are devoted to the conduct of the neg ^ ` oes after the war .

		In spite of all demoralization , it is clear that they took their freedom well .

		For their ill behavior , others than themselves were mainly to blame .

		Of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's first and only speech to the Southern blacks , Mrs.
Avary	PERSON	says : '' Mercurial blacks collected about Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, im - peding his progress , kneeling to him , hailing him as ' Saviour , ' and ` My Jesus ! '

		They sang , shouted , danced .

		One woman jumped up and down , shrieking , ' I 'm free !

		I 'm free ! '

		Some went into the regidar Voodoo ecstasy , leaping , whirling , stamping , until their clothes were half torn off .

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	made a speech in which he said : ' My poor friends , you are free ... But you must try to deserve this priceless boon .

		Let the world see that you merit it by your good works .

		Do n't let your joy carry you into excesses .

		Obey God 's commandments and thank Him for giving you liberty , for to Him you owe all things .

		There , now , let me pass .

		I have little time here and much to do . ' ''

		Great were the expectations of the newly - freed blacks .

		Some of them started North to the `` promised land '' ; some expected to turn white . ''

		Ole Miss , '' asked one pickaninny , , '' now I ` se free , is I gwin ' turn white lak white folks ?

		... I 'd ruther be white ,
Ole Miss.	LOCATION	''
Washington	LOCATION	was the place of miracles .

		When Uncle
Peter	PERSON	went there , some tricksters told him his wool could be made straight , and his color changed . ''

		Said dey could make it jes lak white folks ' ha ` r , '' he informed his mistress , mournfully , when he had paid the price -- nearly his whole capital -- and returned home with flaming red wool .

		His wife did not know him , or pretended not to , and drove him out of the house .

		One old colored lady , wear - ing her mistress 's clothes , followed in the rear of
Sherman	PERSON	's army in her mistress 's carriage , fanning herseK , in the dead of winter , with a huge fan .

		Someone asked her , '' Why Aunt Sallie , where are you going ? '' ''

		Law , , honey !

		I ` se gwine right back intuh de Union ! ''

		The negroes fared better than most of the whites .

		They were the wards of the nation ; the whites were just then disfavored step-children .

		Colonels and generals came home to sell pies and tea and oysters , to make a bare living .

		The story of the poorer white people is told in the following incident : '' A
Northern	ORGANIZATION	missionary said in
1867	DATE	, to a
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia audience , that he had seen in
North Carolina	LOCATION	a white mother hitch herself to a plow which her eleven - year-old son drove , while another child dropped into - the furrows seeds Northern charity had given .

		I saw in
Virginia	LOCATION	's Black Belt a white woman driving a plow to which her young daughters , one a nursing mother , , were hitched . ''

		The book is packed full of such incidents , illustrating every phase of domestic life among the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	whites and blacks .

		As affording much material to explain the present problems of the South , the work is valuable , whether one accepts the author 's conclusions or not .

		The numerous pictures of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	women of the time cause one to reflect on the great change that has taken place in
Southern	LOCATION	ideas as to the publicity of women 's names and pictures .

		Forty years ago it would have been a mortal offence to publish these portraits .

		Now , young women -LRB- except perhaps in
Charleston	LOCATION	-RRB- keep supplies of photographs for the society pages of the news - papers .

		Compare these pictures wdth those of the
South Carolina	LOCATION	legislature -LRB- p. 354 -RRB- , and the jury that indicted
Davis	PERSON	-LRB- p. 238 -RRB- , and one has a long story without words .

		The book opens with a quotation from the last public speech of
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	; it closes with one from
Presi	LOCATION	- dent
Roosevelt	PERSON	's
Richmond	LOCATION	address .

		Each in itself is proof of great changes in feeling since the days of which Mrs.
Avary	PERSON	has so interest - ingly written .

		The
Intimate IjIfe of Sir Henry Irving	ORGANIZATION	.

		* As
Johnson	PERSON	had his Bos well , so it may well be said in years to come that
Irving	PERSON	had his Stoker .

		And in justice to the gentleman last named , we may add that the statement is made from a literary point of view , with due considera - tion of the art of biographical portraiture : to exaggerate
Boswell	PERSON	's weaknesses is perhaps im - possible , but the talents mingled with them have sometimes been underrated , and a paradoxical antithesis has been set up between the folly of the man and the greatness of his book .

		For upwards of thirty years the author of these Reminiscences was an intimate friend of Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	, in certain ways the most in - timate friend of his life ; and it is tridy said that he knew him as well as it is given to any man to know another .

		In a prefatory note Mr.
Stoker	PERSON	points out that the fame of an actor is won in minutes , not in years , the latter being only helpful in the recurrence of opportunities ;

		THE DIAL 27T that it is not practicable to record adequately the progress of his work , for that in its perfec - tion can not be recorded , as words can convey but faint suggestions of awakened emotion . ''

		So much , then , for the work of art that is not plastic and permanent .

		There remains , therefore , but the artist .

		Of him the other arts can make record in so far as external appearance goes .

		Nay , more , the genius of sculptor or painter can suggest -- with an under - standing as subtle as that of the sun-rays which on sensitive media can depict what can not be seen by the eye -- the existence of these inner forces and qualities whence accomplished works of any kind proceed .

		It is to such art that we look for the teaching of our eyes .

		Modem science can record something of the actualities of voice and tone .

		Writers of force and skill and judg - ment can convey abstract ideas of controlling forces and purposes ; of thwarting passions ; of embarrassing weak - nesses ; of all the bundle of inconsistencies which make up an item of concrete humanity .

		From all these may be derived some consistent idea of individuality .

		This individuality is at once the ideal and the objective of portraiture . ''

		Forty years ago , provincial playgoers did not have much opporttinity to see great acting , except in star parts .

		It was the day of stock com - panies .

		Mr.
Stoker	PERSON	first saw Irving as Captain Absolute in ' • The Kivals , '' at the Theatre Royal ,
Dublin	LOCATION	, on the
evening	TIME	of
August 28 , 1867	DATE	.

		It was nine years before , as dramatic critic on the ''
Dublin	LOCATION	Mail , '' he met the actor .

		Their friendship began at a dinner , after which Ir \ Tng asked permission to recite Thomas Hood 's poem , ' • The Dream of
Eugene Aram	PERSON	. ''

		Stoker sat spellbound .

		Irving had foimd an understanding and appreciative friend ; and the friendship thus begun continued till the end of
Irving	ORGANIZATION	's Hfe , In the present work the author has aimed not so much at a formal biography as to present a picture of his subject 's life by showing him amongst his friends and explaining who those friends were , by affording glimpses of his inner life and mind as gained by intimate association .

		To trace Irving 's career for several years after their first meeting is only to follow him from one .

		scene of triumph to another .

		During these years his one ambition was to have a theatre to himself where he would be sole master , an am - bition which was realized when he took the management of the Lyceum and made ^ Ir .

		Stoker his acting ' managfer .

		During Irvinsr 's personal management of the Lyceum he pro- dueetl over forty plays , making an avei-age of two plays each year from
1878	DATE	to
1898	DATE	.

		The memorable series of Shakespearean plays were a part of these .

		Xever before had such scru - pvdous attention been given to the detads of stage-production .

		Irving was always careful not to offend the feelings of the public , espe - cially in religious matters .

		For instance , when the church scene of '' Much Ado about
Noth	PERSON	- ing '' was set for the marriage of
Claudio	PERSON	and
Nero	ORGANIZATION	, he got a Catholic priest to supervise it , who pointed out that the white cloth spread in front of the Tabernacle on the High Altar meant that the Host was within , whereupon Irving or - dered a cloth of gold ; when the red lamp hung over the Altar-rail by his direction , for purely scenic effect , was pronounced a sacramental sign , he replaced it by others to destroy the significance .

		But not so when , as
Becket	LOCATION	, he put on the pall to go into the cathedral , where the murderous huddle of knights awaited him .

		There were no feelings to be offended then , though the occa - sion was in itself a sacrament -- the greatest of all sacraments , martjTdom .

		All sensitiveness regarding ritual was merged in pity and the grandeur of the noble readiness , '' I go to meet my King . ''

		Perhaps no successful play ever had so little `` done for it as '' The Bells `` on its production .

		When
Irving	PERSON	took the management of the Lyceum , this play was one of its assets .

		The original choice of the play is an object-lesson of the special art-sense of an actor regarding his own work .

		As Mr.
Stoker	PERSON	points out , it would be difficult for an actor to explain in what this art-sense consists , or how it brings con ^ action to those whose gift it is .

		Irving 's own views upon this interesting point are weU worth quoting . ''

		It is often supposed that great actors trust to the inspiration of the moment .

		Nothing can be more erro - neous .

		There will , of course , be such moments when an actor at a white heat illumes some passages with a flood of imagination -LRB- and this mental condition , by the way , is impossible to the student sitting in his armchair -RRB- ; but the great actor 's surprises are generally well weighed , studied and balanced .

		And it is this accumu - lation of such effects which enables an actor , after many years , to present many great characters with remarkable completeness .

		... It is necessary that the actor should learn to think before he speaks ... Let him remem - ber , first , that every sentence expresses a new thought , and therefore frequently demands a change of intona - tion ; secondly , that the thought precedes the word .

		Of course , there are passages in which thought and lan - guage are borne along by the streams of emotion and completely intermingled .

		But more often it will be foimd that the most natural , the most seemingly accidental , effects are obtained when the working of the mind is seen before the tongue gives it words . ''

		This chapter on '' • Irving 's Philosophy of his Art '' is one of the most interesting in the entire book .

		Irving 's first visit to
America	LOCATION	, in
1883	DATE	, was a matter of considerable importance .

		At that time the great body of the British people did not 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, inow much about
America	LOCATION	, and did not care a great deal , according to the present author . ''

		The welcome which Irving received on that night of
October 29 , 1883	DATE	, lasted for more than twenty years -- until that night of
March 25 , 1904	DATE	, when at the Har - lem
Opera House	ORGANIZATION	he said ' Good-bye ' to his American friends -- forever !

		Go where he would , from
Maine	LOCATION	to
Louisiana	LOCATION	, from the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	to the Western sea , there was always the same story of loving greeting ; of appre - ciative and encouraging understanding ; of heartfelt au revoirs , in which gratitude had no little part .

		As Ameri - cans of the
United States	LOCATION	have no princes of their own , they make princes of whom they love .

		And after eight long winters spent with
Henry Irving	PERSON	, amongst them I can say that no more golden hospitality or affectionate belief , no greater understanding of purpose or enthusi - asm regarding personality or work , has ever been the lot of any artist -- any visitor -- in any nation .

		Irving was only putting into fervent words the feeling of his own true heart , when in his parting he said : ' I go with only one feeling on my lips and in my heart -- God bless
America	LOCATION	! ' ''

		Another particularly interesting chapter is devoted to
Ellen Terry	PERSON	, whose artistic life was so closely associated with
Irving 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		She is treated only incidentally , but is pictured as a ^ eat artist -- the greatest of her time .

		In the closing chapter of the book , Mr.
Stoker	PERSON	- explains the cause of Irving 's ilhiess during the last seven years of his life .

		Here we learn for the first time the details of his patient suffering .

		Little wonder that , when the 13th of
October , 1905	DATE	, came around , he was tired , tired out .

		The actual cause of his death was physical weakness ; and the last words he spoke on the stage were
Becket	PERSON	's last words in the play : '' Into Thy hands , O Lord I into Thy hands . ''

		That Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	had many rare and winning gifts of mind and soul ; that his impulses were right and noble ; that most of those who knew him best seem also to have loved him most dearly ; that his ambition , large as it was and growing with what it fed on , seldom if ever out - ran his honesty of purpose , or turned his proud self-reliance into uncharity and seK-conceit ; that he had his dramatic principles and never sacri - ficed them to a greed for wordly advancement ; that he had a fine scorn for hypocritical pre - tenses of every kind , and a fine sense of honor for himself , are convictions which are confirmed by Mr.
Stoker	PERSON	's book .

		His candid Reminis - cences have opened the actor 's life and character to the public .

		The wit , the wisdom , the anec - dote , the talk by famous men and about them , the strangeness and vivacity of many of the inci - dents and eminence of many of the characters , combine to render the work fascinating and in _ qructive .

		It is in two handsome volumes , ade uately illustrated .

Canada Seex	ORGANIZATION	through English Eyes .

		* Nothing reveals more strikingly the changed attitude of Englishmen toward
Canada	LOCATION	than the space given to Canadian questions in contem - porary English literature .

		Scarcely a month goes by but one or more of the English reviews publishes an article on some aspect of Canadian life , political , industrial , or intellectual ; the great
London	LOCATION	dailies , that not so long ago clipped a Canadian item here and there from the Asso - ciated Press despatches , now have their own cor - respondents in
Canada	LOCATION	; and not content with this , every now and then they send out a special correspondent to study conditions on the spot .

		These special correspondents , generally expe - rienced and well-informed journalists , have done a great deal to break down the wall of compla - cent ignorance that shut out the average En - glishman from any intelligent interest in Colonial affairs .

		Their letters are given a prominent position in one or other of the great daily news - papers , and are read not only in
London	LOCATION	but throughout
the United Kingdom	LOCATION	; and finally , according to the established practice , they are gathered together in book form , and serve a further useful purpose as books of reference on contemporary conditions in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Two such books are ''
Canada	LOCATION	the New Na - tion , '' by Mr.
H. R	PERSON	,
Whates	PERSON	, and ''
Canada	LOCATION	as It Is , '' by Mr.
John Foster Eraser	PERSON	, both authors being well-known
London	LOCATION	journalists .

		The books cover substantially the same field , -- that is to say , the
Canada	LOCATION	of the twentieth century , with its marvellous potentialities , and its young and vigorous people just awakened to the knowl - edge of a mighty future .

		The subject is one that must appeal irresistibly to the intelligent onlooker with the proj -RRB- er point of view .

		Both these observers have , on the whole , acquitted themselves creditably .

		They have studied
Cana	LOCATION	- dian questions and conditions on the spot , taking nothing at second-hand ; they have not contented themselves with the lifeless reports of govern - ment officials , but have gone among the people , always with the acute ear of the trained news - paper man , interviewing everyone from hod - carrier to cabinet minister , and recording their impressions while they were fresh and vivid .

		This method of writing contemporary history has its limitations , but these exist in any method .

		THE DIAL 279 that he '' travelled steerage '' from
Liverpool	LOCATION	to St.
John	PERSON	; tried snow-shovelling in
St. John	LOCATION	, to satisfy himself that an emigrant need not starve if stranded at that port in \ sinter-time : spent a few days in a typical New Brunswick limiber - camp ; took up a free homestead in the
Sas	ORGANIZATION	- katchewan Valley , to get in touch with the conditions to be faced by the would-be Canadian farmer : explored the northern clay-belt through which the new transcontinental railway is to run ; and admired the magnificent mountains and beautiful valleys of
British Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of certain classes of Canadians and certain Canadian characteristics , !

		Mr.
\ NTiates	PERSON	has no very high opinion ; but for what he calls the '' average Canadian of the prairie and the back - woods '' he has nothing but praise .

		He finds him '' a man whose virile character and keen intellect , bodily hardihood , self-dependence in isolation , heroic endurance of long , fierce win - ters , strength of will and patient courage in converting primeval wastes into a noble home - land , make him the typical figure of
Canada	LOCATION	, the New Xation . ''

		Mr.
Whates	PERSON	has much to say as to the ad - vantages of the Dominion as a field for British emigration , but at the same time strongly , and justly , condemns the '' indiscriminate emigra - tion of people who find themselves crowded out of the English labor-market and are weakened in physique and morale by long endurance of defeat in the battle of life in great cities . ''

		Of the American immigrant , he has the highest opinion .

		• • The American immigrant is a pio - neer , and accustomed to deal with new condi - tions and adapt himseK to them .

		He is a man of the plains -- resourceful , self-reliant , and enterprising .

		And he often brings growing boys and girls with him -- the best asset that
Canada	LOCATION	can attract , for what she needs mostly is young men and women ... He is , indeed , an aristocrat among Dominion immigrants ; and , it should not be forgotten , he is an English - speaking immigrant . '' '

		Mr.
Eraser	PERSON	also has travelled far and wide throughout
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Gifted with a quick eye , and the wide if not always very deep knowledge of the experienced journalist , he has produced an entirely readable little volume .

		It appears that for some years he has made a carefid study of
Canada	LOCATION	, its growth , its possibilities , and its sentiments toward the parent country and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It is a trifle surprising , how - ever , to find such cai-eful preparation resulting in statements like this : • ' In
Alberta Territory	ORGANIZATION	and
Vancouver Province	LOCATION	, where there is little snow , there are nasty , chill , and continuous rains . ''

		Alberta is now a province , though no doubt it was still a territory when
Air	ORGANIZATION	.

		Eraser 's book was written .

		There is not now , and never has been , a Province of
Vancouver	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Eraser	PERSON	no doubt means
British Colxmibia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The '' nasty , chill , and continuous rains '' might apply to the rainy season on the coast ; certainly nothing of the kind is found in
Alberta	LOCATION	.

		But these are only the trifling faidts that must creep into any similar attempt to handle a big subject rapidly and in small compass .

		Air .

		Eraser 's discussion of Canadian political and social problems is in - teresting , if not always convincing .

		The same criticism applies to jMr .

		\ ^ ^ lates 's treatment of the same problems .

		The advantages of an out - side point of view are obvious , but no journalist with only a superficial knowledge of conditions in another country can hope to probe success - fully the depths of its political and social life .

		Mr.

		280 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, the title of a large volume of letters written by Mrs.
Campbell Dauncey	PERSON	to some unnamed cor - respondent in
England	LOCATION	.

		Covering 346 pages of good size , and treating easily of subjects vary - ing as widely as the mode of tariff administration under the insular government and the disagree - able traits of American office-holders , the book arouses some doubt in the mind of the reader as to whether the '' letters '' were written to some actual person or are merely a chosen literary form .

		The first letter is dated
November 27 , 1904	DATE	, the last ,
August 22 , 1905	DATE	.

		Mrs.
Dauncey	PERSON	must have indeed been a constant correspondent to write in that time her forty-two letters aver - aging nearly ten pages of close print each .

		At all events , the product is an amusing , and at times extremely instructive , book for readers who have the slightest desire to be informed on Philippine events .

		Nearly every subject of popular interest in connection with Philippine matters is treated more or less thoroughly , in - cluding the trip of the Secretary of War and his party through the islands in the
summer of 1905	DATE	.

		It is not a pleasant picture of Philippine life that Mrs.
Dauncey	PERSON	draws .

		Particularly striking is the contrast developed in the first pages be - tween life at
Hong Kong	LOCATION	, with its orderliness , prosperity , and comparative comfort , and the high prices , vexatious taxes and tariffs , and un - cleanly ways of living encountered in
Iloilo	LOCATION	, the second city of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, where Mrs.
Daun	PERSON	- cey spent most of her sojourn .

		There are chap - ters , too , upon
Manila	LOCATION	; an interview with Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	, the wife of the Governor ; and impres - sions of the city itself which do not differ ma - terially from those gained during the stay at
Iloilo	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Dauncey	PERSON	's husband being the man - ager of an English firm engaged in business in the islands , her point of view may at times be regarded as colored by the alleged prejudice felt by English residents of the
Phillippines	LOCATION	toward the American regime there .

		The most apparent evidence of such a bias , and one of the worst blemishes upon the book , is found in frequent slighting remarks about conditions in the
United States	LOCATION	, a country which the author herseK has never visited .

		Barring several ludicrous blun - ders thus almost wilfully made , the letters stick with great faithfidness to conditions as person - ally observed , and have the touch which comes from direct observation .

		Briefly sunmiarLzed , and eliminating the bulk of incident and experience which chiefly give the volume its interest , Mrs.
Dauncey	PERSON	finds the
Philippines	LOCATION	badly administered , without refer - ence to the needs of the population either native or foreign .

		The cost of living , instead of being low as in other Oriental countries , is abnormally high , even when judged by the standards of Western countries , and exceeds that of house - keeping in
England	LOCATION	.

		The natives , owing to a false standard of social relations set up by the American residents , are not only naturally lazy , like most tropical peoples , but have added to this normal laziness a contemptuous disregard of all regular methods of getting a living that involve real labor .

		Few opportunities to learn any useful trades or professions are afforded them , the education offered being academic in character , based upon the ideas developed in Western countries , and especially in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Business in the islands , Mrs.
Dauncey	PERSON	finds , upon the evidence of her husband and his friends , as well as upon that of stray American acquaintances , is in a languishing condition , and nothing is being done toward the development of the resources of the country .

		Officials , it is intimated , are largely incompetent , and in some cases corrupt , or maintain themselves by virtue of political favoritism .

		At times they appear -LRB- even some of those in relatively high positions -RRB- to be unfamiliar with the usages of ordinary polite society .

		Perhaps the most timely part of the book is the section which deals with Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's visit to the
Philippines	LOCATION	and the disap - pointment of the natives at learning from his own lips that the promises and vague hopes of independence fostered during his former stay in the islands as governor can not be gratified within any reasonable future time .

		The fol - lowing bit of conversation , reported by Mrs. .

		Dauncey as occurring at the close of the ball given in honor of the Secretary during his stay in
Iloilo	LOCATION	, summarizes a long and unusually graphic chapter describing Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's sojourn at that place : '' At the top of the staircase , I met a very Prominent Citizen , who remarked that this had been a great occa - sion for
Iloilo	LOCATION	.

		I said : ' He spoke a great many truths ; , what he said was very straightforward . ' ''

		` Yes , ' said the P. C , ` but he should have said
all that two years ago	DATE	. ' ''

		And that I find is the unanimous verdict of every class and nationality about Mr.
Taft	PERSON	's subtle and rather tardy interpretation of the promises he made when he was Governor of
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Next evening , a Prominent Citizen of our acquaintance came walking ^ past .

		* It was a fine show , ' we said . '

		AVhy , yes , ' h & agreed ; ' I guess the Filipinos did their best for the Secwar . ' '

		I think he disappointed them , though , ' said C. ` Well , I should smile ; I guess Secretary
Taft	PERSON	' & the best hated man in these islands now . '

		And that , I believe , is the unfortunate truth . ''

		Of the life-likeness of Mrs.
Dauncey	PERSON	's book
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 281 there can , unfortunately , be very little doubt .

		The outlines and the incidents are altogether too familiar to anyone who has had even the briefest Philippine experience .

		It is not likely that any responsible person will try to make rebuttal of the very serious criticisms of the American administration conveyed in this vol - lune .

		The personal character of the narrative and the limitation of the statements to actual observations and incidents leave the reader to draw his o \ sti inferences , and the most that can be offered in answer is the stock insinuation of prejudice and bias which is even now heard in certain jjolitical circles as to this very book .

		Meantime , Mrs.
Dauncey	PERSON	's amusing letters re - main as not the least count in the indictment of American rule in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		Two VlSIOXAREES .

		* A great poet and a great novelist constitute the claim of present-day
Italy	LOCATION	to a leading place among the literary nations .

		Few other nations may claim as much --
England	LOCATION	certainly , Ger - many possibly , and
Norway	LOCATION	until a few months ago -- so capriciously does the World Spirit be - stow the gift of genius .

		The fame of the poet , considered from the cosmopolitan point of view , must inevitably suffer from the impossibility of translation , and Sig .


Carducci	PERSON	, venerated by his own people , is even to-day little more than a name to the rest of mankind .

		The fortune of the novelist is happier , for his work is suscep - tible of reproduction without serious impairment of its artistic quality , and the latest work of Sig .

		Fogazzaro has within a year found its way to the cosmopolitan public , and gained recog - nition as a masterpiece throughout the culti - vated world .

		In the very acceptable English version now given us , it naturally demands a more detailed consideration than we are accus - tomed to give the ordinary ' novel , although even this tribute to its distinction does not suffi - ciently emphasize the fact that the work differs not merely in degree , but almost in kind , from books of fiction in the ordinary sense .

		In

		prose trilogy which has occupied the author for many years .

		Lest this statement deter some readers from making its acquaintance , we hasten to add that the book is a fairly independent en - tity , to be enjoyed without a knowledge of its predecessors , although appreciation wiU doubt - less be made more complete by a preliminary reading of '' Piccolo Mondo Antico '' and ''
Piccolo Mondo Modemo	PERSON	. ''

		But these books have not yet , to our knowledge , been translated into English .

		In the first of them , one
Don Franco Maironi	PERSON	gives his life for the cause of freedom .

		In the second , his son Piero , artist and dreamer , bound to one woman who is insane , and lo ^ Tbag another who is separated from her husband , runs the gamut of sinful passion and remorse and religious conversion , and disappears from the view of his associates .

		It is to this
Piero Maironi	PERSON	, in his character of `` the saint , '' that we are now introduced anew , after the lapse of three years devoted to austere practices for the chastening of his soul .

		Some acquaintance with his past , and \ '' - ith that of the woman who loves him , is of course essential to the vmder - standing of the situation now offered ; this diffi - cult -RCB- ' has been skilfully dealt with by the nov - elist , who by means of allusion and suggestion puts us into possession of all we need to know , without for a moment making us feel that these retrospective glimpses are forced or inartistic .

		The reader who takes up '' The Saint '' ex - pecting to find it a novel of plot and incident will be disappointed , and shoidd be warned in advance .

		While the work is not devoid of dra - matic passages , it makes no appeal whatever to the sensational instincts and resorts to no form of trickery .

		It is a psychological study of vsr rious types of Italian society , including within its scope the troubled seeker after truth , the worldling , and the peasant .

		It is a work pre - occupied with the fundamental problems of con - science and the innermost significance of religion .

		Mr.
W. R. Thayer	PERSON	, who provides it with a sym - pathetic introduction to the American public , groups it with ''
John Inglesant	PERSON	'' and ''
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	'' ; holding it far superior to either by virtue of `` its subtler psychology , its wider hori - zon , its more various contacts with life . ''

		The author has the temperament of a mystic , com - bined with the intellectual outlook of the ad - vanced modem thinker , and both these qualities are reflected in his hero .

		He is not blind to any aspect of reality , but he believes the most im - portant of realities to be those of the spirit , and this thesis he unswervingly defends .

		He be - lieves , moreover , that the
Church	ORGANIZATION	is the di \ ` inely 282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, instituted interpreter of God to man , and holds unassailable the rock upon which it is built , but he believes the Church to have been wounded in the house of its friends , to have suffered ossifi - cation in its frame , and paralysis in its vital activities .

		It suffers from the spirits of false - hood , and clericalism , and avarice , and immobi - lity .

		It opposes science , which means that it has lost faith in itself . ''

		The
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, which proclaims itself the minister of Life , to - day shackles and stifles whatever lives youthfully within it , and to-day it props itself on all its decadent and antiquated usages . ''

		We do not wonder that the
Curia	LOCATION	, its faults thus relentlessly set forth , should have retaliated by including the book in the Index Librorum Prohibitorum .

		HappUy , this is in our own days a futUe method of suppression , for so vibrant a voice as speaks to us from these pages is not to be hushed by ecclesiastical condemnation .

		In reading `` The Saint '' we have thought more than once of Ibsen 's '' Brand . ''

		Both works have the same tonic character ; both en - force the precept that a man consecrated to the Christian life should exemplify in every word and act , absolutely and uncompromisingly , the faith which he professes .

		We may refuse to grant the premises , but having once allowed them , there is no escape from the writer 's logic .

		Again , we can not avoid a comparison of this work with
Zola	PERSON	's ''
Rome	LOCATION	, '' or even with Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's '' The Christian , '' a comparison usefxd for its effective contrast between sincerity and sensationalism , between life and stagecraft .

		Such a comparison is made inevitable by the climactic episode common to the three books , the hero 's interview with the Pope .

		The Saint 's impassioned appeal to the Pontiff to drive the money-changers from the temple , to cleanse the Augean stables of clericalism , to turn his face from the past to the future , to welcome the con - quests of science , and to come forth from the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	into the world , constitute what is prob - ably the most eloquent section of the whole work .

		This is the programme which is put forward by the younger generation of earnest Italians who , unwilling to sever their relations with the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, have acclaimed Senator Fogazzaro as their leader , and , in defiance of its condemna - tion , have accepted '' The Saint '' as a concrete embodiment of their ideals .

		A book that has such fortunes is more than a publication , it is an event .

		The coincidence that brings to us Pastor Frenssen 's '' Hilligenlei '' and Senator Fogaz - zaro 's '' II Santo '' at practically the same time is worth noting .

		It is not alone in the fact that these two men have recently become the foremost novelists of their respective countries that the coincidence occurs ; it is found also in the fur - ther fact that each has sought to express , in his latest work , the same essential idea .

		Wide as are the differences between the two men in both temperament and environment , great as is the diversity of the methods and materials they em - ploy , they have in common the same fundamental ideal of a regenerated faith , they voice the same protest against ceremonial and dogma , they make the same plea for the validity of the modem rationalized conception of religion , and they urge the same passionate defence of the spirit of Christianity against the ecclesiastical perver - sions that have come so near to stifling its breath .

		One does not discover all this in '' Hilligenlei '' -LRB- entitled '' Holy land '' in the translation -RRB- until well along in its pages .

		The fundamental im - pression which it is the author 's purpose to pro- duce is created by a long succession of delicate touches , working upon the sub-consciousness of the reader , and gradually combining in cumu - lative effect .

		The story begins in a haphazard sort of way , introducing one character after another seemingly at random , and stringing together loosely related incidents of various sorts .

		All this is done with a deftness of delinea - tion , a faculty of vital observation , and a strength of homely sincerity that reveal evidences of mastery quite sufficient to hold our attention , but it is long before we realize that anything more is being offered than the contemplation of a group of simple human lives -- humble peas - ants and sailor folk toiling for a precarious existence by the shores of the
North Sea	LOCATION	.

		It is some time before the reader can even determine which of the characters -LRB- growing up from child - hood under his eyes -RRB- is destined to be the real hero of the novel .

		As for plot , there is none at all for a while , and little enough afterwards , yet somehow the relations of these people whom we come to know so intimately slowly assume order and significance and beauty , until we see that a constructive ideal has been all along in - cluded in the author 's plan .

		The motif of the work is introduced in the following words : ''
Roiind	PERSON	about the bay of
Hilligenlei	LOCATION	, at the foot and under the shade of the great sea dyke , clustered many little houses , in which dwelt laborers , fishermen and small farmers .

		Thesepeople , living extraordinarily lonely lives in their dark , low-roofed rooms , far away from the church , had from long time past brooded over a peculiar faith .

		They called themselves '' Holyland men '' and lived m the belief that the little town of Hilligenlei and
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 283 the country round the bay would be one day a real
Holyland	LOCATION	.

		They looked for the Kingdom of God in the bay . ''

		This traditional faith , imperfectly conceived by most of the country folk , and often inter - preted by them in anything but a spiritual sense , at last finds lodgment in the soul of a sensitive boy .

		He dreams of it when a child , and broods over it in the reflective years of early manhood .

		And his soid is slowly shaped , by the rough ministries of the struggle for existence , of physical breakdown and unrequited love , to become , in some sense , an instrxunent for the fidfihnent of the old-time prophecy .

		His ma ^ - tured thought is embodied in these words : '' Once more our nation is convulsed by the need of a renascence of the three great powers , to which itself gave birth ,
Authority	ORGANIZATION	, Religion , Custom ; once more it is rent by the longing to return to nature , to the beauty of religion , of social justice , and a simple and genuine ideal of life . ''

		The culmination of this work is reached in a sixty-page chapter entitled '' The Manuscript . ''

		The visionai-y who is the central figure of the story , after much soul-searching and tribuhv - tion , feeling that his end is near , elaborates a statement of the rationalized faith which is the final product of his meditations .

		This statement is in its substance a life of Christ , so narrated as to bring it into vital relations wdth the actual world .

		It is analogous , in some ways , to
Count Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's analysis of Christianity , in others , to the work of those modem painters who have represented the divine figure in the guise of a modern man of the people .

		In whatever aspect we may regard it , this manuscript , bequeathed to his feUows by the dreamer of
Hdligenlei	LOCATION	, is a wonderfully impressive document , made so by its earnest sincerity and its poetic vizualization .

		It will be anathema to the official exponents of the Christian faith , but its teaching can not fail to make a powerfid appeal to the open-minded and untrammelled seeker after truth .

		Those who are clear-sighted enough to perceive that a radical reconstruction of the forms of religious belief is inevitable , and even now impending , will welcome this attempt to disengage the essence of Christianity from its accidents .

		Sr V ^ - ^ ^ ^ ^ t dreams in his book , `` A Hundred Years Hence '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , which will hold the attention of all disciples of Mr.
Bellamy	PERSON	.

		Even regarded as the baseless fabric of a vision , the book has a certain fascination ; but its forecasts are not without a foundation of scien - tific probability .

		In material progress we are picking up speed at an astonishing rate , so that fifty years - of the present era are better than a cycle of antiquity .

		In mental and moral advance , too , the author be - Ueves that we are moving at an accelerating pace ; ; but here his predictions are somewhat less convinc - ing than when he confines himself to our material betterment .

		As to the latter , however , he seems to - err in some matters of detail .

		Discussing new sources of energy , he speaks of the end of the coal age as - '' already well in view , '' whereas recent discoveries of rich veins , the likelihood of other such discoveries , , and more careful surveys of leads already being - worked , tend to push the evil day into the indefinite future .

		Some new and cheap method of decompos - ing water is expected by Mr.
Russell	PERSON	to make avail - able this '' inexhaustible supply of energy . ''

		Is not this the perpetual-motion fallacy in a new form ?

		The energy required to separate the oxygen and hydrogen in water can never be less than that de - veloped by their recomposition , just as the energy needed to vaporize water is never less than the power exerted by the steam in moving the engine , while the incidental waste of energy through f riction ^ radi - ation of heat , and other forms of leakage , is very great .

		Water , even that of
Niagara	LOCATION	, is a medium , not a source of energj ' .

		The author takes a some - what exalted view of the virtues of Americans , -- as when he says : '' In
America	LOCATION	, where there i '' practically no standing army , ... the people are - conspicuous for manliness , for high endurance , for patience under the reverses of fortune , for tem - perance : and in the average of physical courage

		A commodious and substantial buUding , bearing a name intimately associated with the pursuit of ideals in an American spirit , was then dedicated to the cause of that learning which has ever been and ever will be a dominant expression of human interests and human aspirations .

		Doubtless the portion of the buUding that would most surprise the
Concord	LOCATION	sage would be the equipment of the top floor , in which , with the aid of specialized and elaborate apparatus , the twentieth century aspirant for the doctor 's degree is seeking to penetrate a slight step or two farther into the modus operandi of our complex mentality .

		The layman is not likely to be tempted 284 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, to delve deeply into the 644 pages that form the second volume of the '' Hai ` vard Psychological Stu - dies , '' just appearing with the imprint of
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	; yet if he did so he would certainly be interested in the description of the purposes and arrangements of the Psychological Lab - oratory in
Emerson Hall	LOCATION	, as set forth by its able Director , Professor
Muensterberg	PERSON	.

		This appropri - ate introduction to the appearance of the Studies in a newer and more independent form is a desirable record of the purposes that inspired the erection of that building .

		In addition , a group of twenty-three special studies , dealing with widely different phases of the psychologist 's pursuit , present an admirable survey of the spirit and the method of stating and answering problems which to-day animate this science .

		Technical though this be , and saturated with the data that the experimental scientist seeks and elaborates , it yet has its bearing upon the larger problems of life and mind that warrant the instal - ment of this discipline in a building devoted to the interest of the humanities .

		Such a set of studies likewise reflects the high place that has been accorded to the philosophical disciplines at
Harvard	LOCATION	, -- a place that could have been achieved only by the services of such men as Professors James ,
Royce	PERSON	,
Palmer	PERSON	,
Peabody	ORGANIZATION	,
Muensterberg	PERSON	, and a group of younger men quite ready and worthy to succeed in their turn .

		The reputation of American scholar - ship is something that is gradually achieving the appreciation it deserves ; it is as a significant con - tribution to an important phase thereof , issuing from an inspiring centre , that these Studies make appeal to the wider public that cherishes the arts of culture .

		jj ^ j ^ jg pleasant book , `` The Quest of the Simple Life , '' just issued in this country by
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, some time after its
London	LOCATION	appear - ance .

		In form it is autobiographical , narrating the happy escape of a
London	LOCATION	clerk , after twenty years ' drudgery in the city , to the free air and manifold delights of a horticultural , piscatorial , and literary life in the lake district .

		To heighten the verisimil - itude , minute details and tables of comparative expense -LRB- city and country -RRB- are scrupulously set down ; and the whole outcome is so successful and so satisfying in the reading that one wishes , with a brief but consuming desire , that one were a
London	LOCATION	clerk on a salary of # 250 , with a wife and two boys , just to repeat the experiment .

		But on recall - ing the writer 's actual life-history , his early entry into the Methodist ministry , and his later successes in a Congregational pulpit and as a lecturer and writer , all these pleasing bucolic visions die away and fade into the light of common day .

		It is to be hoped that the seductive volume may not fall into the hands of any London-weary clerk who shall mistake its plausible fictions for the gospel truth hebdomadally preached by its author , and shall leave his friendly desk to court disappointment and possible starvation under wholly untried con - ditions .

		Apart from this half-innocent deception in its general tone and appearance , the book is to be commended .

		Most eulogists of the simple life seem to be ever peeping out of one corner of their eye to see whether the great world is taking proper note of their fine carelessness of its opinion .

		But Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	is free from this offensive self-conscious - ness .

		Such popularization requires , in - deed , a master-hand well versed in the bearings of concept and principle , and equally expert as a phy - siologist and a psychologist .

		It is perfectly true that the relations of mind and body have been measura - bly transformed by the researches of the foremost ranks of time ; and it is equally true that to render the results of such increased insight available to the lay mind is a worthy and profitable task .

		Dr.
Thom	PERSON	- son 's motives are well justified .

		It is much to be regretted that the performance falls so decidedly short of the promise of the title .

		Much of what is set forth is true and pertinent ; possibly more is of that '' nearly true '' order which is more pernicious than error itself ; so that on the whole , when the array of evidence comes to the test of an aperqu and a practical application , commendation is wholly out of the question .

		Prone upon slight provocation to deride metaphysics , the author is hoist by his own petard , and erects the personality into a figment of a crude philosophy , tliat suddenly becomes potent to explain what it feebly describes .

		In brief , popular - ization is a difficult art , and should flow from that fulness of knowledge , chasteness of spirit , and tact of expression that are reserved to a master of his craft .

		Volumes like the present , that fail of this through fundamental lack of fitness , do not aid the cause which they espouse with good faith and earnest intention .

		THE DIAL 285 official reports , and writings of participants on both sides .

		He endeavors to be fair to both friend and foe , and recognizes the devotion and unanimity with which the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	people supported secession and risked their all for their cause .

		Few writers on events and conditions during the Civil War have approached the subject with a better fund of his - toric information , and few have the vivid yet plain power of narration possessed by
General Curtis	ORGANIZATION	.

		A regimental roster is appended , showing the later careers of many of the members and the ravages death has made .

		This feature will prove of especial interest to the survivors , while the entire book can be read with profit by those interested in the actual experiences of army life diu'ing the great conflict .

		A model ^ ^ - ^ ° ^ ^ Madox Hueffer ' g Mono - biographv graph on
Holbein	LOCATION	, published in the of an artist .

		u Popular Library of Art '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , is a model of what such a study should be .

		The small size of the volume imposed severe restrictions , but on the whole these have made for good : the absence of padding and irrelevant matter of any kind is refreshing .

		The treatment is critical in the best sense of the term .

		Appreciation of the master 's transcendant qualities goes hand-in-hand with equally keen realization of his limitations .

		Ardent admiration of his great achievements in portraiture is coupled with frank recognition of the essential wrongness in principle of his designs for decoration .

		Cogent reasons are given for rejoicing that such works as the wall-paintings in the council chamber of the Rathhaus in
Basle	LOCATION	have not survived .

		They could only have intensified the pernicious influence exerted by
Holbein	PERSON	's marvellous vision and suberb draughtsmanship when misapplied in so - called ornament .

		As little is known with certainty about the detail of
Holbein	PERSON	's life , the rival conjec - tures are set before the reader impartially , with the author 's reasons for regarding one or the other as the more probable .

		Many , but not all , of the artist 's paintings are passed in review .

		A notable omission is any reference to one of his most wonderful per - formances , technically considered , the `` Young Man with a Book , '' in the
Imperial Gallery	ORGANIZATION	,
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		Numerous illustrations , excellent in spite of the small scale of reproduction , help to make the book useful and attractive .

		In a 24-page '' publisher 's advertise - ment , '' Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	tells the story of the manuscript which he lias pub - lished under the title , '' Memoirs of the Count de Cartrie : A Record of the Extraordinary Events in the Life of a French Royalist during the War in La Vendue , and of his Flight to
Southampton	LOCATION	, where he followed the Humble Occupation of Gardener . ''

		To prove the genuineness of these memoirs , a careful examination of the manuscript was made by
M. Pierre Amedde Pichot	PERSON	, a scholar well equipped for such research .

		Advertisements , too , were printed in the leading historical and literary papers of En - gland ajid
France	LOCATION	, to recover , if possible , the lost A French royalist 's adventures French original of this anonymous translation .

		As a result , the historical reality of this Count de Cartrie -LRB- incorrectly written '' Comte de Castric '' in the manuscript -RRB- , and the truth of his Vend ^ ean and En - glish adventures , are reasonably established , -- an in - quiry in which the abundant memoirs of the period proved useful ; but the lost French original of the narrative has not yet ttirned up .

		Curiously enough , the English translation has now been re-translated into French for publication in
France	LOCATION	.

		To both En - glish and French versions M. Fr ^ d ^ ric
Masson	PERSON	con - tributes an extended historical introduction , while the nameless translator 's introduction is itseK added in an appendix -- in the English edition , at least .

		Another appendix and eleven pages of fine-print notes are furnished by
M. Pichot	PERSON	, many illustrations are interspersed , and an index completes the volume .

		As a tale of adventure , the work can not fail to attract .

		It also has value as a side-light thrown on a memorable epoch in French history .

		Places , evenu , ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ '' Grafton Historical Series '' and people of -LRB- The
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , it is proposed old
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		^ issue , in convenient and uniform style , a number of books upon the early history of our country , -- short geneaJogies , biographies , and reprints of important old books and documents .

		The first volume of the series is entitled '' In Olde Con - necticut , '' and is written by Mr.
Charles Burr Todd	PERSON	.

		It is made up of a series of essays pertaining to that
State	ORGANIZATION	, collected from various periodicals where they first appeared , and put together without much con - tinuity or coherence , except that all bear some rela - tion to
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		They vary in time from the days of the
Pequot Indians	LOCATION	to the beginnings of the
Hartford	LOCATION	and New Haven Railroad .

		Among the places described are Saybrook and
Guilford	LOCATION	,
Groton	LOCATION	, Mystic ,
New London	LOCATION	,
Fisher	PERSON	's
Island	LOCATION	, Mount Tom ,
Litchfield	LOCATION	, and
Greenfield Hill	ORGANIZATION	, together with the
Burr Mansion	ORGANIZATION	and the
Trumbull House	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the legends re-told is that of the frogs of
Windham	LOCATION	and the '' earthquakes '' of Mount Tom .

		A chapter is devoted to the burning of
Fairfield	LOCATION	by the British in
1779	DATE	, and another to the whaleboat privateers - men of those days .

		One of the best descriptions is that of the old Revolutionary prison at
East Granby	LOCATION	, near
Hartford	LOCATION	.

		The little book will prove of espe - cial interest to persons connected by birth or kinship with
Connecticut	LOCATION	, and will also be read with pleasure and profit by the general public .

		Art essays on
Whistler	LOCATION	and others .

		There is little about
Whistler	LOCATION	in Mr.
Frederick Wedmore	PERSON	's '' Whistler and Others '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The essays and fragments that make up the volume are in part reprinted from various periodicals .

		Some of them seem hardly of sufficient importance to warrant the more permanent form .

		Easily the best are `` The Place of
Whistler	LOCATION	'' and '' The Print CoUector . ''

		In these the author , who is well-known to a limited circle through his catalogue of
Whistler	LOCATION	's etchings , is on sure ground .

		He writes from the point of view 286 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, of the collector and connoisseur ; and the words of a man who has become an expert through the exhaustive concentrated study that successful col - lecting demands are worth listening to whether one always agrees with him or not .

		His assertion that the average citizen does not really care for art has evoked adverse criticism from reviewers who mistake languid interest for affection ; but it is true , never - theless , as every genuine art-lover knows .

		Mr.
Wedmore	PERSON	's preface offers food for reflection on this point , and may be commended to those who doubt the statement .

		A traveller writing his impressions A book of thanks j foreign land usually does it for for social favors .

		Not so
Pastor Wagner	PERSON	, the genial and naive author of '' The Simple Life , '' whose '' impressions of
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
McClure , Phillips & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are only too evidently written for Americans to read .


M. Wagner	PERSON	has a great many friends in the
United States	LOCATION	, with President
Roosevelt	PERSON	looming large among them .

		These friends will no doubt enjoy reading his unstinted praise of everything American .

		The book is , in fact , not much more than the equivalent of what in common parlance is called a '' bread-and-butter letter '' -- the returned guest 's thanks for courtesies received .

		From a lit - erary point of view , it is aljout nil ; as also from the point of view of the American who desires to see his country more clearly through the eyes of a stranger .

		In this respect it contrasts strikingly with the work of the famous French scholar ,
Hugues Le Roux	PERSON	, after his visit a year or two ago .

		Perhaps the au - thor intended it as an atonement or apology for his fellow countryman 's lack of gallantry , especially toward American women .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		`` The
Oxford Treasury	ORGANIZATION	of English Literature , '' of which the first volume has just been published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, is a work designed '' to indicate , as far as the limits of space permit , the chief landmarks in the progress of English literature . ''

		The plan of the work is to provide few but significant examples of En - glish verse and prose , accompanying them by a moderate amount of critical , biographical , and explanatory matter .

		The first of the three volumes which the work will comprise has for a sub-title '' Old English to Jacobean , '' and is edited by Messrs.
G. E. and W. H. Hadow	PERSON	.

		The work is admirably done , and wholly worthy of the distinction of its Oxford imprint .

		Messrs.
Alden Brothers	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	, send us , in a volume of over six hundred pages , the complete Poems of Miss
Amanda T. Jones	PERSON	.

		The book embodies all the author 's previous works -- ''
Ulah	PERSON	, '' '' Atlantis , '' '' A Prairie Idyl , '' and the lately-published '' Rubaiyat of Solomon '' ; and represents a full half-century of poet - ical achievement .

		Miss
Jones	PERSON	's work has several times been noticed in The Dial , and commended for its sin - cerity , originality , and often forceful and felicitous diction .

		Many of her pieces have appeared in prom - inent magazines , and some of them have gained a place in standard anthologies among the best representatives of her country 's poetical literature .

		Her old friends , and we hope many new ones , will welcome this com - plete collection of her poems .

		The volume has two portraits of the author , which , with the brief introductory sketch giving some intimate details of her early life and the influences that shaped her literary career , impart additional personal interest to the poems .

		The latest addition to the '' Heroes of the Reforma - tion '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a life of
John Calvin	PERSON	, by Professor
Williston Walker	PERSON	; and it is an excellent piece of work .

		Professor 's
Walker	ORGANIZATION	's previous work has shown that he is thoroughly equipped in the ecclesi - astical history of the Reformation period , and he has shown in this book the other qualities of a good biog - rapher .

		While by no means light reading , the book is clear and straightforward , and it makes the real man
Calvin	PERSON	live before us his strange life , so far-reaching in its influence .

		The author has done this by giving special attention to
Calvin	PERSON	's training , spiritual development , and constructive work , rather than to the minutife of his Genevan contests , or the smaller details of his rela - tions to the spread of the Reformation in the various countries .

		Twenty helpful illustrations add to the value of the book .

		New York 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, KEEPING UP WITH THE AlAGAZINES without giving all one 's time to them is a task of ever-increasing difficulty .

		CThis is decidedly the magazine age .

		The number , variety , and high quality of our periodicals are nothing less than amazing .

		The master-minds of the world go to their making , -- the greatest of living thinkers , workers , story-tellers , poets , and artists .

		One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand .

		By limiting oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year , all but a very small portion of the field is overlooked .

		C.The only sensible plan is to buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the things one wants most to see .

		This plan has been made practicable by What 's in the Magazines , a monthly publication which renders the mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy every-day reader .

		Each issue presents a bird 's - eye view of the maga - zine-contents of the month , with the aid of which one may gain in ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as though he had personally examined a copy of each .

		C .

		It is not a mere list of contents ; neither is it a complicated and confusing library index .

		Everything is arranged and classified , simply but exactly ; whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ - ers or merely looking out for good things in general , the arrangement is equally convenient .

		C .

		It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine - land , -- a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell ; and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person .

		We could fill - ^ SdU ` lC ' `` sP ' ^ ` stion .

		307 THE SCHOOL REVIEW A Journal of Secondary Education THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE HIGH SCHOOL AGE The importance of the field of secondary edu - cation is gaining increasing recognition .

		While the intellectual aspects of the high school may appeal more immediately to teach - ers and superintendents , the physical , social , and moral problems presented by the boy and girl at this period are matters of deep con - cern to parents , and to all who are interested in their welfare .

		THE SCHOOL REVIEW aims to meet the problems of this period of life and education .

		It believes that they can only be dealt w4th by bringing to the atten - tion of all the work of successful investigators or administrators , and by stimulating to deeper investigation those who are competent to deal with some phase of the broad situation .

		The Review imderstands its field to include all the problems that parent , teacher superintendent , or school board must face in dealing with this situation .

		On the one hand it will endeavor to be timely in bringing to the general atten - tion of the whole country whatever of interest or value is being done in any part .

		Import - ant discussions at educational gatherings will be reported and experiments in teaching or in administration will l ^ e described .

		At the same time it will be the purpose of the Review to study these topics not only in their more immediate bearings , but in their more fvmda - mental principles .

		The busy teacher or superintendent needs the help of the specialists in all educational fields , as well as the stimidus from others , who , like himseK , are face to face with the immediate aspects of the problem .

		BRIEFER MENTION 330 NOTES 330 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 331 FJEJSR GYNT .

		Sometime in the middle eighties strange ru - mors , proceeding from the vicinity of
Boston	LOCATION	, were noised abroad .

		The cultured coteries of the American
Athens	LOCATION	had discovered , it seems , a new writer , a maker of plays in far-off
Norway	LOCATION	, who had startling opinions upon such cheerful subjects as hereditary viciousness , political cor - ruption , and the subjection of women .

		The mat - ter was investigated , and much agitation ensued .

		But such teapot-tempests of discussion had raged in those quarters before , and subsided without appreciable effects .

		In this case , however , to change the metaphor , there was fire beneath the smoke , and there arose a controversial confla - gration that was destined to spread far , to in - vade the woman 's club , and the newspaper , and the pulpit , and to work something like a revo - lution in the theatrical world .

		For this Nor - wegian plajTight , whose then unfamiliar name is now upon as many lips as that of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, was found to be a genuine thinker of iconoclastic temper as well as a consununate master of stage - craft , and his works have forced themselves upon the theatre through the sheer power of poetical genius allied with technical mastery , until now , some score of years after those early Botolphian rumblings , the foremost of American actors has crowned his significant career by an elaborate pro- duction of one of the Norwegian 's two dramatic masterpieces , and has thereby done a great serv - ice to art , besides winning for himself a greener laurel than has hitherto adorned his brow .

		From the Ibsen of the eighties in
America	LOCATION	, allowed with fear and trembling an occasional experimental performance , to the Ibsen of our new century , revealed to eager throngs in the most elaboi-ate and sumptuous of settings , is a far cry indeed .

		It is an even farther cry from the diy light and the desiccated dialogue of '' A Doll Home '' to the glowing color and riotous poetic imagination of '' Peer Gynt . ''

		For one thing , ^ Ir .

		Mansfield 's enterprise for the first time sets Ibsen before the theatre-going public in something like the right perspective .

		As we have been urging at many times for many years , the true
Ibsen	PERSON	, the Ibsen who may fairly be accounted one of the great creative forces of the
last century	DATE	, is far less the author of the studies 310 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, of modem social life that have hitherto monopo - lized public interest in his work than the author of the two great dramatic poems , '' Brand '' and '' Peer Gynt , '' with which that interest has been almost wholly unconcerned .

		Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	de - serves much gratitude for the conspicuous way in which he has now put the emphasis in the right place , and employed all the resources at his command for the proper presentation of a work compared with which
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's social dramas of the later period are of trifling significance .

		The first production of '' Peer Gynt '' in the English language , which took place in
Chicago	LOCATION	a few days ago , must be regarded as a literary event of the first importance , and we make no apology for considering it in that light .

		We wish that it were possible to give hearty praise to the literary form in which the work appears , but that we are unable to do .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's translation , which is the basis of Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	's prompt-book , is very unsatisfactory .

		It preserves the rhythm of the lines in a rough fashion , but it makes no attempt to reproduce the rhymes , and the result is a sort of hybrid composition to which either good literal prose or free poetic paraphrase would be preferable .

		We know the difficidties attendant upon any kind of a translation of '' Peer Gynt , '' and are well aware that an adequate translation is an impossibility ; but something better than this might have been done with the text .

		Profes - sor
Herford	ORGANIZATION	's extraordinary rhymed version of `` Brand '' gives us the example of what a really inspired translator might have made out of the companion work , and makes it clear that our demand is not a mere counsel of perfection .

		Furthermore , the most difficult scene in '' Peer Gynt , '' the indescribably moving and pathetic scene of the death of Aase , has been translated by Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	in a way that is marvellously reproductive of its poetical and emotional effect , and Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	would be well-advised to sub - stitute this version for the inferior one that he now uses of this particidar scene .

		It would bie so much of clear gain .

		For the rest , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	fails at countless points to convey the poig - nancy , it may be , or the grotesque humor , or the acrid satire , of this passage or that ; in his version the keen edges have become dulled , and the gold transmuted into baser metal .

		In preparing his acting version of the play , Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	has been forced to take great liberties .

		To make of '' Peer Gynt '' a prac - ticable stage-drama a free hand was necessary , and we are not disposed to be unreasonable in our criticism .

		Remembering what he has done with
Shakespeare	PERSON	and
Schiller	PERSON	, we were pre - pared for a greater violence to the framework of the piece than was actually in evidence .

		The fact must be taken into account that a complete production of '' Peer Gynt `` is as impossible a '' a performance in its entirety of either '' Hamlet '' or the second part of '' Faust . ''

		Many pagea must necessarily be excised to bring the perform - ance even within the four-hour limit .

		Allowance must also be made for the further fact that Ibsen himself did not expect the work to appear upon the stage in the form in which he wrote it .

		He published it as a book , and hardly expected it to be produced at all .

		It was not until six or seven years later that he began to look at it from the stage standpoint , and then , when he asked Grieg to write the incidental music for the production , he outlined many changes from the printed text .

		He even went so far as to say that '' almost the whole of the fourth act is - to be omitted in the performance , '' with the substitution of '' a great musical tone-picture , suggesting Peer Gynt 's wandering all over the world . ''

		He advised the omission of other scenes - also , and suggested various condensations in the text of scenes that coidd not be whoUy spared .

		Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	, in dealing with this difficult question , has adopted some of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's sugges - tions , but rejected others .

		His initial perform - ances included a number of scenes that were afterwards excised owing to the great length of the play .

		The first three acts are given with few cuts and with little shifting of parts .

		The fourth act , which Ibsen thought should be left out altogether , is represented by the scene upon the coast of
Morocco	LOCATION	, with the banquet , the stolen yacht , and the miraculous appearance of the emperor 's white charger .

		To this is added a rather meaningless dance of
Anitra	PERSON	and her attendant maidens , which
Anitra	PERSON	has to explain in an interpolated passage , for the scene in which that designing young woman cajoles the masquerading prophet out of steed and treasure is not given at all .

		The Sphinx and Memnon episodes , followed by the scene in the mad-house at
Cairo	LOCATION	, are omitted .

		The momentary vision of
Solveig	PERSON	, so reminiscent of
Faust	LOCATION	's vision of
Gretchen	PERSON	in the midst of the Walpurgis night revelry , is transferred from its desert setting to a place at the opening of the fifth act .

		This act also suffers greatly from curtailment .

		We have the scene of the shipwreck , but not the subse - quent struggle in the water .

		The graveyard scene is omitted , as well as the suggestive scene in which Peer finds in an onion , with its many wrappings but no kernel , the symbol of his own
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 311 character .

		We are not given the symbolical scene of the yam-balls and the dead leaves and the broken straws , for practical reasons which are sufficiently obvious .

		With the entrance of the button-molder the closing scene begins , and this is condensed in a way that considerably impairs its logical force .

		Nevertheless , the out - come is wonderfully impressive .

		On the whole , our criticism on this score of condensation is di - rected not so much against the lengthy excisions as against the occasional omissions of certain pregnant phrases .

		Among such unaccoimtable omissions we note , in the scene of Aase 's death , Peer 's momentary and ventrUoquial assimaption of the character of God the Father ; in the scene on the coast of
Morocco	LOCATION	, after his yacht has gone to the bottom , his plaint to the effect that
Divine Providence	LOCATION	is anything but economical in its methods ; and in the scene with the button - molder , the latter 's words : '' Both strength and seriousness are needed for a sin . ''

		The vast audiences that are filling the play - house nightly for week after week to witness this remarkable production must include many types of spectators , but so rich is the play in various kinds of interest that no one is likely to go away altogether unrewarded .

		At one extreme of appreciation we have the devotee of musical comedy and spectacular fable and at the other we have the lover of poetry and the seeker after ethical truth , and both may find in '' Peer Gynt '' something of their affair .

		For those whose dramatic ideal is found in '' The Wonderful Wizard of Oz '' there is the giant pig , and the ugly urchin , and the dance of the Arabian maidens , and the gorgeous scene at the court of the old man of the mountains .

		What better sport than this coidd the most frivolous ask ?

		For those who ask the stage to present an embodiment of poetry and pathos there are the
Solveig	PERSON	scenes and the death of Mother Aase , accompanied by
Grieg	ORGANIZATION	's inspired music .

		And for those who look to the drama for an envisagement of the deepest problems of char - acter and fate there are the striking symbolisms of Bojg and the button-molder , the contrasted philosophies of self-sufficiency and self-realiza - tion , and the stem enforcement of the only law by which a man may save his soul .

		Trxdy , here is a feast whereof the scraps alone would suffi - ciently furnish forth any ordinary dramatic banquet-table .

		Of Mr.
Mansfield	PERSON	's personal part in the pres - ent noteworthy production we would say just this : He has seized the greatest opportunity offered by the dramatic literature of our time , and he has given us a characterization which outranks the best of his previous efforts .

		In no single work that he has hitherto attempted has he shown such histrionic versatility , and in none has he given us so complete a revelation of the deeper possibilities of his art .

		He has risen magnificently to a great occasion , and he has his reward .

		His own summary of '' Peer Gynt '' illustrates the completeness with which he has penetrated into the meaning of the poem , and may be suitably quoted as an appendix to our comment upon the performance . ''

		This phan - tasmagoria , or comedy of hvunan life , embraces all the elements of the serious , the pathetic , the tragic , the grotesque , the real and the unreal , the actualities and the dreams , the facts and the consequences , the ambitions and the disappoint - ments , the hopes and the disillusions , and the dread and terror , and the resurrection in love , of the himian soul . ''

		THE HUNGER-MOTIVE IN FICTION .

		Poets are not plagiarists , but men are the same .

		The distribution of myths , the reappearance of inci - dent , the repetitions of history , all point , not to tradition or heredity , but to the rooted likeness of men and circumstance .

		Nature and humanity -- this is the world ; and the world of art is like unto it .

		The works of this last world vary according to their intensity , their differing admixture of plot and character , and by the quality of soul in the creative artist which gives him his originality of thought and separateness of expression .

		Hunger is the great motive for the work of the world .

		Nearly all industries , warfares , adventures , displays of .

		wealth , social arrangements as far as property is concerned , are bottomed on this fact .

		Half the happiness or misery of mankind arise from it .

		The mere wUl to live expresses itself as hunger before conscious identity is established .

		And the old woman in '' Punch , '' who , when her clergyman inquired of her what blessings she was most gfratef ul for during her long life , answered , '' My wictuals , '' said a true thing .

		What would fiction do without eating and drink - ing ?

		If I were asked to name the difference between dramatic and narrative art , I think I should say that it consisted in the way that respective poets feed their characters .

		Of course there are some pick - ings on the tables of the dramatists .

		The Thyestian banquet is at least mentioned in the
Agamemnon	LOCATION	, and in the Cyclops we almost assist at a similar cannibalistic feast .

		Shakespeare in general is a '' poor provider , '' though the Duke feasts in
Arden	LOCATION	, and
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	sits down to the ghost-interrupted banquet , and Falstaff consumes at least one pennyworth of bread .

		If
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	had had a real feeling for good living , he would not have let Petruchio fling 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, the viands about as he did .

		No ; the di ^ amatists do not much condescend to eating .

		They can handle liquor very prettily .

		Don Juan drinks to the Com - mandante .

		The boors tipple in
Auerbach	LOCATION	's cellar , and
Carl Moor	PERSON	and his comrades swig in the forest .

		But they do not fall to like honest trenchermen .

		Possibly it is because in a play they have not the time .

		A glass of wine can be tossed off in a second , but nobody would believe that a character could get through a satisfactory meal in the brief moment allowed by stage action .

		But the narrative poets and novelists !

		What banquets , feasts , dinners , luncheons , snacks , they provide , primarily for their characters and second - arily for their readers ' regalement !

		To begin with Homer : his heroes are always eating , and we are even allowed to see the cooking of the huge joints of beef that nourish their mighty ardor .

		De Quincey found out that Odysseus ate four dinners in one night !

		Probably he was laying in for a campaign , like the Esquimaux who eat enough blubber and whale-oil at one meal to last them a month .

		The old Irish epics reek with the kitchen smell .

		Their heroes fought magnificently for their cattle-spoils , and devoured them nobly .

		The worst reproach a bard could cast upon a man was to say that in his house '' the guests did not grease their knives . ''

		Chaucer is a very lord of hospitality .

		One of his most amiable characters is the Frankelein in whose house '' it snowed of meat and drink . ''

		Milton , the loftiest of poets , is liberal enough to
Adam	PERSON	and Eve in the matter of fruits and nuts and such like food -- rather cold comfort , one would think , though the Archangel partakes affably enough when he drops in to take pot-luck with our first parents .

		Keats 's pretty '' spread '' in the '' Eve of
St. Agnes	LOCATION	'' reminds me of a supper I once sat down to after a long cold day 's ride .

		It consisted of four kinds of cake , three kinds of pie , and a half-dozen different preserves .

		But
Keats	PERSON	's meal was purely an aesthetic one , for the eye .

		It does not appear that the parties in in - terest partook of it at all .

		They tripped away into the
night	TIME	, and left the cates and dainties untouched in
Madeline	LOCATION	's chamber .

		After all , it is to the prose writers that we must go for the full fury and fervor of appetite and the satisfaction thereof .

		Petronius devotes nearly the whole of his book to
Trimalchio	ORGANIZATION	's dinner .

		Some library-giving philanthropist should make this work accessible to the poor of all the world .

		There is enough food in it for an army .

		Reading it is as good as a meal , any day .

		One can say of the '' Ara - bian Nights '' that the people in it are great dinner - givers .

		They never meet together in a social way but someone claps his hands and servants appear with salvers laden with food .

		Of course , to a flesh - eating Northerner the temperate Arab 's predilection for dates and figs and sherbets seems trifling .

		The celebrated Barmecide dinner is only their ordinary fare pushed to the extreme .

		Mention of this meal brings to mind that other state banquet where
Sancho Panza	PERSON	, at the height of his felicity as governor of an island , has the dishes whisked away from him before he can taste them .

		Cervantes , indeed , is full of delightful episodes of eating , and though
Don Quixote	PERSON	may have to discourse over a banquet of acorns , or Sancho gorge himself with cow-heel , they both make up for it at
Camacho	LOCATION	's wedding , where the squire is given a long fork and told to browse at large among the steaming cauldrons .

		Fielding and SmoUet , as befitted their lusty na - tures , gave their heroes large appetites and let them loose on an innkeeping world .

		Fielding even endows his heroines with a certain touch of that feeling for food which is probably out of the reach of the femi - nine soul .

		That supper -- of stewed mutton , was it not ?

		-- which Amelia prepared for Captain Booth deserves
Thackeray	PERSON	's praise .

		Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	was hardly inferior as a trencherman to his predecessors .

		The scene where the pious Clerk of Copemanhurst first denies and then accords King
Richard	PERSON	his hos - pitality is one of the decisive dinners of fiction .

		But the culinary gods of literature are surely
Dumas	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	.

		Their books exhale , not the odor of
Russia	LOCATION	leather or celestial gums , but the fragrance of delightful cookery .

		We open one of them with the same feeling with which we approach a country inn at the coming of dusk , and see the windows glowing red and the gray smoke curling up from the chimneys .

		Nor are we ever disappointed .

		What a savory succession of viands do we enjoy !

		What a motley and magnificent company of boon comrades do we meet !

		How often have we lunched , guests unseen , with
D'Artagnan	LOCATION	and his comrades in the Bastion St.
Gervais	PERSON	, or watched Chicot in the
Paris	LOCATION	tavern persuade Dom
Modeste	PERSON	out of his fasting and his sermon !

		How often have we been with
Dick Swiveller	PERSON	and the Marchioness at their frugal meal , or looked on as
Tom Pinch	ORGANIZATION	's sister made the meat pie !

		But perhaps the full enthusiasm , the very rigor of the game of eating , is to be found , not in a novel , but in the '' Noctes Ambrosianse '' of
Christopher North	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the delirium of what
Milton	PERSON	called '' concoctive heat . ''

		As compared with other writers who imaginatively tickle the gustatory nerves ,
Wilson	ORGANIZATION	reminds me of the placard in a Western restaurant : '' Dinner fifty cents ; an immortal gorge , one dollar . ''

		Even Homer did not catalogue all the heroes on the plains of Troy , and I can not begin to name the novelists to whom hunger and its satisfaction are sources of incident .

		In general , the keener the want the keener the zest of eating , both to the character and the reader .

		When one of Mr.
Clark Russell	PERSON	's sailors , after tossing about for days in an open boat , climbs aboard a deserted ship , breaks into the store - room , eats his fill and takes an inventory of the provisions at hand , our mouths water in sympathy .

		The lists of provisions given in books of Arctic exploration are delightful reading , though no one would care to wade through a grocer 's catalogue .

		In a higher way there are carefully-wrought scenes of hunger in fiction which impress us by their pathos .


Jane Eyre	PERSON	's starvation on her flight from
Thornfield Hall	ORGANIZATION	is one .

		The incident in
Feuillet	LOCATION	's novel , where
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 313 the starving young nobleman takes a piece of bread which his sister is about to throw away , and tells her that he will give it to a poor man , is another .

		Starvation , indeed , is one of the long-suits of the novelist to engage our sympathy .

		Pestilence , disease , resulting as they mostly do from a lack of proper nutrition , are powerful agents of plot and situation .

		For the first , there is the Florentine plague which serves as a sombre back - ground to the gay scenes of the Decameron , the similar pestilence which is introduced into
Manzoni	PERSON	's
Promessi Sposa	PERSON	, and the death-scourge at
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia which is the main subject of one of
Brockden Brown	PERSON	's novels , I think `` Edgar
Huntley	PERSON	. ''

		Disease in indiWduals is too common in literature to need specification .

		I wiU only name
Andrd Chenier	PERSON	's poem , the
Jeune Malade	ORGANIZATION	.

		Convalescence , too , which is a sort of new birth with a special , keenness and delicacy of appetite and sense , is a good theme .

		Thomas Gray has a poem on the subject , and there is a novel by
Edmond About	PERSON	describing the recovery of a consumptive girl in the
South of Europe	LOCATION	which treats the matter with great charm .

		Wealth , which is a sort of concentrated food , or at least a safeguard against hunger , is an ingredient in most plots .

		The Argonauts sail for the Golden Fleece ;
King Lear	PERSON	gives his property away and comes to grief ; the envious uncle does the Babes in the Wood to death in order to inherit their estate ; the Nabob from
India	LOCATION	comes back in the nick of time to endow a heroine or rescue a scapegrace nephew , -- obviously this branch of our inquiry is so large that one can only hint at it .

		Adventures to gain a fortune , treasure-seeking , and so forth , come under this head .


Dumas	PERSON	's `` Monte Cristo , ''
Poe	PERSON	's `` Gold Bug , '' and a myriad other stories , body forth the primal idea of wealth as a shield and a weapon .

		Perhaps ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' is the central book of the world in symbolizing the desirability of property .

		When Crusoe is cast away and has stripped the wreck of all available articles , he boasts that he has a greater stock of necessities than was ever gathered together for one man 's use before .

		Yet he goes on building , planting , breeding , and is really the tj ` pe of our race .

		Balzac is the novelist of modern times who has most realized the value of wealth .

		Money is the great theme of all his works .

		Other novelists and dramatic writers have made the miser a comic or despicable figure , but old Grandet is almost re - spectable .

		The getting of money with him is a duty and a religion .

		There are many figures in fiction that stand for the negation of wealth .

		The hermit idea is best embodied in the Hindoo epics and dramas ; but the
Philoctetes of Sophocles	LOCATION	, the
Timon of Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Scott 's Black Dwarf	ORGANIZATION	, are European examples .

		Per - haps
Thoreau	PERSON	's
Walden	PERSON	may be accepted as our American contribution on this theme .

		Wars , con - quests , discoveries of new lands , colonizing , and such enterprises , are for the most part only larger exhibi - tions of the greed for wealth , the desire to make life secure .

		The multitude moves , instead of one man .

		The results belong to history rather than to fiction , but literatiire takes the historic legend for its own .

		The Pandu brothers ,
Herakles	LOCATION	,
Agamem	PERSON	- non ,
Caesar	LOCATION	,
Attila	LOCATION	,
Vasco de Gama	ORGANIZATION	,
Columbus	LOCATION	, -- the names are endless of those who explore or struggle for dominion .

		There is a whole section of literature which deals with the growing of crops , the raising of cattle , the anntial replenishment of man 's stock of food .

		The pastoral poetry of the world , the idyls of Theocritus , VirgU 's
Georg	PERSON	^ cs , the Italian and English shepherd plays , are all based on this theme .

		Goldsmith 's '' Deserted Village '' gives the idea in reverse .

		A thousand modern novels deal with the life connected with pastoral occupations .

		Half the charm of ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	'' resides in the pictures of farm-life -- the corn waving on the hillside , the poultry cackling in the yard , the pigs fattening in the pen , aU of which edibles are to furnish provender for the mighty appetites of
John Ridd	PERSON	and his compeers .

		The novels of
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	also are full of such scenes .

		The sense of growing things pervades them all .

		The nomad life of hunting and fishing is almost equally represented in fiction .

		Rama and
Sita	ORGANIZATION	and
Laksmana	PERSON	in the Indian jungle , the Hunt in Calydon which has inspired more than one ancient and mod - ern tragedy , Der FreishUtz ,
Melville	ORGANIZATION	's `` Moby
Dick	PERSON	, '' -- these are only a few instances .

		There is an American author of the past , who used to be called the '' Shakespeare of nature-writers , '' whose hunting sketches and stories have a freshness and zest aU .

		their own .

		No one has expressed better than
Frank Forrester	PERSON	the primal savagery of man in preying upon the lower creatures , his delight in hunting , tracking , killing , and eating his g ^ me .

		With our more recent nature-writers the bird or beast '' sits not as a meat but as a g ^ est , '' which is more humane but hardly as true .

		Commerce has to do with tlie hunger idea also , as providing the means for distribution of earth 's products .

		And with commerce come in the themes of houses , inns , cities , roads , rivers , the sea .

		And these themes bourgeon out into innumerable minor ideas of home , hospitality , journeys , highwaymen , voyages , pirates , and so forth forever .

		Science in use has provided weapons to fight hunger , and writers like
Jides Verne	PERSON	and Mr.
Wells	PERSON	have drawn inspiration from its inventions .

		Lastly in our category , there is the hunger of the earth and the hunger of the ocean .

		The earth , like Kronos , devours its own children , trees , vegetation , men , cities .

		This theme is best expressed in Gray 's '' Elegy '' and
Bryant	PERSON	's '' Thanatopsis . ''

		The ocean finally devours the earth and all that is thereon .

		Cities which have slipped into the sea have furnished matter for many a legend and song , as have the stories of burned galleons and fleets .

		After the
Duke of Clarence	ORGANIZATION	's vision in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	's '' Sargasso Sea '' is the most wholesale and impres - sive treatment I can think of regarding this theme .

Nov. 16	DATE	, COMM UNICA TION .

		DEVIOUS METHODS OF BOOK ADVERTISING .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The '' boom '' spirit , of which the `` Western town has often been said to have a monopoly , makes its appear - ance in strange surroimdings .

		A few evenings ago I was greatly enjoying that wise and himian book by
Benson	PERSON	, `` From a College Window . ''

		Under the spell of the thought and the charm of the style , I was living in another world from that in which hard material standards have so much sway , when suddenly I came upon the following passage : `` I was reading the other day a sensible and appreciative review of Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's new biography of
Charles Lamb	LOCATION	. ''

		At the right of the last word in the sentence stood a figure ^ , an addition the more distracting because it was a reference to one of the only two foot-notes in the vol - imie .

		So , the spell of the book broken , I studied the note .

		It read : ''
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	: The Life of
Charles Lamb	LOCATION	.

		2 vols .

		G. P. Put - nam 's Sons ,
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		The spirit of inquiry was now aroused , so I turned back to the title-page ; then I realized that the enter - prising firm of publishers of '' From a College Window '' had seen , and seized upon , the opportimity to advertise another of its valuable publications .

		Into the midst of '' bit of writing full of unworldliness , and formed by the artistic spirit , they had interjected a bit of commer - cialism .

		It was as if a salon picture had been exhibited with a `` paster '' on the centre of the canvas proclaim - ing its price and the name of the agent of sale .

		It reminded one -- to compare small things with great -- of
Lowell	PERSON	rudely awakened from his twilight reverie in the
Cambridge	LOCATION	fields by the patronizing appeal of a German beggar .

		If such a use of books for advertising purposes is imassailable by any but a squeamish criticism , may we not expect that some day the foot-notes of our volumes of essays or of poems , perhaps even of our manuals of devotion , will contain such sprightly refer - ences as : '' Why not buy ' The Fighting Chance ' when you take your next railway journey ?

		The book to which the author refers is one of our publica - tions , a complete price-liat of which will be sent on receipt of a two-cent stamp . ''

		One can not help wondering how Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, lover as he is of a good book , and thoroughly contemptuous of whatever would debase it , would treat such a turn-a - penny intrusion upon his readers ' peace and satisfaction .


Edward S. Paksons	PERSON	.

Colorado Springs	LOCATION	,
Nov. 10 , 1906	DATE	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The timidity of American poetry is a quality pointed out and commented on by an English critic in a
London	LOCATION	journal .

		This lack of confidence , often ap - pearing under the guise of sentimentality , is attributed partly to the fact that our poetry is no spontaneous na - tional song , but rather voices '' the traditions of a race which , by the time when American poetry can first be taken seriously , had become an alien and distrusted race '' ; and partly is it ascribed to the Calvinism that forms an element in the American temperament .

		It is this want of assured poise in us as a young people that was years ago well characterized and in part accounted for by Dr.
G. Stanley Hall	PERSON	in a little book written on his return from a sojourn abroad .

		But we have pro- gressed since then .

		With the development of national consciousness and conscience come larger literary free - dom and independence , and one day we shall wake up and feel no more afraid of the older families of our kind across the water .


Walt Whitman	PERSON	, of all our poets , was least afraid of them , and they seemed to like him the better for it .

		• • • The impracticability of international drama is stoutly maintained by that competent critic , Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	. ''

		Every nation , '' he contends , '' must hold up its own mirror to its own soul -- else is the theatre a mere plaything , an article of luxury . ''

		And again : '' As a general rule , only third-rate , conventional , machine-made plays are capable of exportation . ''

		But Mr.
Archer	PERSON	has just been paying a visit to
Berlin	LOCATION	, where he finds that one can see more of Shakespeare on the stage than in
London	LOCATION	, and at least as much of Ibsen as in
Christiania	LOCATION	; and he also discovers that
Bjornson	PERSON	,
Strindberg	LOCATION	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, and Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	are all , in a greater or less degree , naturalized on the
Berlin	LOCATION	stage .

		We must hold -- and it is hard to believe that Mr.
Archer	PERSON	would seriously dispute it -- that the best in dramatic as in other literature has some - thing of the universality of light and air , of blue skies and of the mind of man .

		• • • The lake-dwellers ' civic pride will be gratified by Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's remarks on
Chicago	LOCATION	in his new book , `` Memories and Thoughts . ''

		He says : ``
Chicago	LOCATION	struck me as being somewhat unfairly condemned as devoted to nothing but Mammon and pork .

		Certainly , during my visit , I heard of nothing but the progress of education , university endowments , people 's institutes , libraries , museums , art schools , workmen 's model dwell - ings and farms , literary culture , and scientific founda - tions .

		I saw there one of the best equipped and most vigorous art schools in
America	LOCATION	, one of the best Toyn - bee Hall settlements in the world , and perhaps the most rapidly developed university in existence .

		My friends of the
Union League	ORGANIZATION	, themselves men of business proud of their city , strongly urged me to dispense with the usual visit to the grain elevators and the stockyards , where hogs and oxen are slaughtered by millions and consigned to
Europe	LOCATION	, but to spend my time in inspecting libraries , schools , and museums .

		No city in the world can show such enormous endowments for educational , scientific , and charitable purposes , lavished within ten years , and still unlimited in supply . ''

		Really , we are getting on !

		It is not so long ago that another English traveller disposed of
Chicago	LOCATION	by a single line in his book on America : '' I did not visit
Chicago	LOCATION	, -- why should I care for pig-sticking f '' Why , indeed ?

		It has long puzzled the people of
Chicago	LOCATION	to tell why the tastes of so many English visitors should run that way .

		We are glad at last to have become objects of interest to a class who , like Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, have an eye for something besides pigs .

		• • • The printing of new plays is urged upon English and American playwrights by Mr.
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	in '' The Theatre Magazine '' for
October	DATE	.

		German and French plays appear in book form as a matter of course , and are often in the hands of the public before their presentation on the stage . ''

		Surely in
France	LOCATION	, '' writes Mr.
Jones	PERSON	, `` the art of acting , as well as the art of the
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 315 drama , stands upon an immeasurably higher level than in
England	LOCATION	; and this is partly due to the differentiation in the public mind of the art of the drama from the art of acting .

		Both are judged in their due relation to each other , add both are judged on their respective merits instead of being carelessly muddled together .

		And in weighing the advantages and disadvantages which would accrue to the actor were every play to be published simultaneously with its production , he may be asked to reflect that the printing and reading of plays tends to raise the intellectual level of the drama , and with it the intellectual quality of the acting and the intellectual status of the actor .

		Xo actor who respects and loves his art ... can consistently object to the immediate publication of a play on the eve , or on the morrow , of its production . ''

		A movement is noted on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	toward the publication of English and American plays , and a leading
Xew York	LOCATION	publishing house has imdertaken to issue some of Mr.
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	's < lramas .

		Several of our college professors of English are furthering this movement by putting their classes through a course of lectures and examinations on cur - Tent plays of the better sort .

		Of course the theatre managers and syndicates constitute a power to be reck - oned with in effecting this innovation , but their opposition may be overcome here as it has been elsewhere .

		• • • Blunders of translators are again going the rounds • of the literary journals .

		Old wood to burn , old wine to drink , old friends to trust , and old jokes to laugh at .

		Along with the ancient tested and approved absurdities in this department of whimsical literature are cited sev - eral more modem instances . ''

		La Dernifere Chemise de I ` Amour '' -LRB- '' Love 's Last Shift '' -RRB- is classic ; but '' Frappd ou Mademoiselle '' as a rendering of the title of the farce '' Hit or Miss , '' and '' Le Ministre Assassin '' as an equivalent of '' The Stickit Minister , '' may possibly still iave a flavor of novelty to some readers .

		Groldsmith 's line '' As ocean sweeps the labored mole away '' -LRB- from ^ ' The Deserted Village '' -RRB- is said to have been Gallicized by one of these ingenious mistranslators , '' Comme la mer d ^ truit les travaux de la taupe . ''

		Truly , the per - formances of the literal translator are almost as amusing as those of the phonetic speller .

		• • • The humor of Mr.
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	is an ele - ment of his art that might well have received at least a passing word in Mr.
Hellems	PERSON	's appreciation recently published in these columns .

		It is a humor that is as modestly unobstrusive as it is quietly enjoyable -- to the reader who is content to be amused without burst - ing five buttons off and tumbling in a fit .

		The opening • of
Arthur Ellis	PERSON	's slap-dash harangue in `` A Modern Symposium '' is an illustration , especially when taken in connection with the immediately preceding speech . ''

		This , '' he begins , `` is an extraordinary discovery
Wilson	PERSON	has made , that fathers have children , and children fa - thers !

		One wonders how the world has got on all these centuries in ignorance of it .

		It seems so obvious , once it has been stated .

		But that , of course , is the nature of ^ reat truths ; as soon as they are announced they seem to have been always familiar .

		... It is the privilege of genius to formulate for the first time what everyone has been dimly feeling . ''

		Humor , too , of a grim sort , imparts flavor to this same
Wilson	PERSON	's somewhat aggres - sively arrogant assertions . ''

		What else the state can do , '' he says in the course of his address , '' it must do by education ; a thing which , at present , I do not hesi - tate to say , does not exist among us .

		We have an elementary system of cram and drill directed by the soulless automata it has itself produced ; a secondary system of athletics and dead languages presided over by gentlemanly amateurs ; and a university system which -- well , of which I can not trust myself to speak . ''

		With the humor of the book there is a sufficiency of wit to keep sweet the temper of this many-voiced discussion , La which the reader watches with curiosity and amuse - ment '' one biulding after another laboriously raised by each speaker in turn , only to collapse ignominiously at the first touch administered by his successor . ''

		• • • The perfect type of city-lover , we take it , was
Charles Lamb	PERSON	.

		His was '' a mind that loves to be at home in crowds '' ; and to such a mind , he tells us , even the mud of
London	LOCATION	is pure gold .

		Quite natiirally , then , we should look for much of Lamb in an anthology celebrating '' The Friendly Town , '' and particularly so when the compiler happens to be so devout an Elian as Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	.

		There is a good deal from
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	in Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's pretty volume , but the selections seem to us for the most part irrelevant .

		One searches in vain for the first passage that inevitably comes to mind when one thinks of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	and
London	LOCATION	: `` The lighted shops of the Strand and Fleet Street ; the innumerable trades , tradesmen , and customers , coaches , wag : - grons , playhouses ; all the bustle and wickedness round about Covent Garden ; the very women of the Town ; the watchmen , drunken scenes , rattles ; life awake , if you awake , at all hours of the
night	TIME	; the impossibility of being : dull in Fleet Street ; the crowds , the very dirt and mud , the sun shining upon houses and parements , the print shops , the old bookstalls , parsons cheapen - ing books , coffee-houses , steams of soups from kitchens , the I > antomimes --
London	LOCATION	itself a pantomime and a masquerade -- all these things work themselves into my mind , and feed me , without a power of satiating me .

		The wonder of these sights impels me into night-walks about her crowded streets , and I often shed tears in the motley Strand from fullness of joy at so much life . ''

		If there is not in this , and other similar passages from Lamb not made use of by Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	, the very essence of the urban spirit , where may it be found ?

		• • • Limited editions of standard authors offer en - couraging testimony of those authors ' continued vogne , at least among the more well-to-do , despite the not in - frequent purchase of these sumptuous sets for purposes of show rather than use .

		Such editions of
Dickens	PERSON	and
Stevenson	PERSON	are now annoimced .

		The elder novelist 's works , in a '' National Edition '' of forty volumes , in - cluding more than 130 pieces now first collected , are issued by Messrs.
Chapman	PERSON	& HaU of
London	LOCATION	, who began to publish for
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	seventy years ago .

		The pictures , 850 in number , comprise all the original draw - ings , with other illustrative matter .

		Forster 's life of the author is also included .

		The edition is `` strictly limited to 750 sets for
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, '' and the English price , with the English fondness for the odd penny , is just sixpence over half a pound per volume .

		All this is weU enough , except that the raking and scraping together of hitherto uncollected -LRB- and , inferen - tially , unimportant -RRB- matter is of doubtful wisdom .

		The
Stevenson	PERSON	enterprise , imdertaken by
Messrs. Cassell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	with the sanction of all parties legally concerned , and with Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	as editor , is more generous in the fixing of its limit -- 1550 copies , at ten guineas each , being promised .

		The speedy rise in price of the Edinbiu ` gh edition of twelve years ago appears to ensure the success of this new and , as may be hoped , equally excellent issue of a popular author .

		316 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	^ ^ t i ^ to g00ks .

		An English Journalist in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		* Baudelaire , as quoted by Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	in prefacing his '' Twenty Years in
Paris	LOCATION	, '' used to say , '' J'ai plus de souvenirs que si j' avais mille ans . ''

		For one with only the twenty - second part of a thousand years to look back upon , this Englishman in
Paris	LOCATION	is surprisingly fertile in reminiscences , and also , it may be added , almost as garrulous -- in an entertaining fashion -- as one might imagine Baudelaire 's hypothetical millennarian to be .

		He says he is conscious '' that many people have been left unnamed who ought to have been named , and that many things have not been told which ought to have been told . ''

		But his five hundred large pages of recollections will do very well for a young man , and we can patiently wait awhile for the many people and the many things here omitted .

		In fact , it would not be hard to point out some omissible passages even in the present volume , as , for example , this sage reflection near the beginning : '' Slanderers are a very contemptible race .

		Indeed , their very practice and infamy are confessions of their own inferiority .

		The harm they do is incalculable .

		Few people there are who have not cause to regret having listened to their evil tales about their contem - poraries . ''

		This ostentatious avoidance of gossip is a famil - iar and amusing feature in both talkers and writers .

		However , the author has done himself no serious discredit in the present instance ; and though he is fond , perhaps pardonably fond , of advertising his own foresight after the event , and nothing loth to represent himself as enjoy - ing the friendship of great men before as well as after they had achieved greatness , the whole narrative moves so briskly , the dialogue is car - ried on by so many and so interesting actors , the stage is so crowded , and the scenes succeed one another so quickly , that it would be unhand - some to feel otherwise than friendly toward the purveyor of so much varied entertainment .

		Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	is too well known in the world of letters to need many words of introduction here .

		He says of his entrance into journalism : '' It was by mere accident that having come to
Paris	LOCATION	to lead a life devoted to literature and to study , and to seek the companionship and instruction of the g ^ eat minds in the capital of the world 's intellect , I was drawn into the vortex of journalism .

		I had no training for this

		life ; my sympathies were altogether elsewhere ; I was at home rather in the study than in the antechamber * of notoriety ; it has , indeed , always been only by a strong effort that I have been able to bring myself to those acts of importuning others which the profession of reporter - exacts .

		For the foreign correspondent is , in the first place , a reporter . ''

		Yet he appears bravely to have overcome his diffidence .

		On another page he declares , '' There is one excellent thing about the new journalism , , and that is that it dispels all false modesty ^ When one has either to do or to ' get left , ' and when to get left usually means to die of hunger , , one develops remarkable energy in the assertion of one 's personality . ''

		Yes , and the more 's the pity .

		Of the notabilities that figure most con - spicuously on Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	's ample page , we will name de Lesseps ,
Zola	LOCATION	,
Daudet	LOCATION	,
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, , the ill-fated
Ernest Dowson	PERSON	, and Mr.
Edison	PERSON	.

		Our author 's literary leanings are sufficiently indicated by his ardently-expressed admiration of Zola and Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	.

		As
Paris	LOCATION	cor - respondent of a new York paper , Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	called upon de Lesseps , in
1887	DATE	, to question him on the subject of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal .

		What the great promoter is reported to have said has a present-day interest . '' '

		I am as full of confidence as ever .

		If you are a shareholder in the
Panama Company	LOCATION	, let me advise you to put your shares away in a safe , and to bolt and bar them in .

		We shall open our canal at the end of
1889	DATE	, after the Exhibition here , or at the very latest at the beginning of
1890	DATE	.

		That is certain .

		I say it and I mean it .

		What was the reason of the recent fall in the shares ?

		The manoeuvres of certain rogues , speculators of course , , who trade on the pusillanimity of the shareholders . ' ''

		A few words from
M. Eiffel	PERSON	, another and a , more fortunate director of great engineering works , will interest statisticians , and others also . '' '

		It has been ascertained by statistical observation that in engineering enterprises one man is killed for every million francs tliat is spent on the work .

		Thus , supposing you have to build a bridge at au expense of one himdred million francs , you must be prepared for - the death of one hundred men .

		In building the
Eiffel Tower	ORGANIZATION	, which was a construction costing six million and
a half	DATE	, we only lost four men , thus remaining below the average .

		In the construction of the Forth Bridge , fifty - five men were lost in over
forty-five million francs	MONEY	' worth of work .

		Here the average is much exceeded ; but when the special risks are remembered , this number shows as - a very small one , and reflects very great credit on the engineers for the precautions which they took on behalf of their men . ' ''

		The author appears to have made a slip just before this in making the same speaker say , in reference to this bridge , that '' the number of workmen who were killed during the carrying out of the work was much below the ascertained average . ''


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 31T To pass from the fashioning of iron to the shaping of sentences , here is what the younger
Dumas	PERSON	said to \ Ir .

		Sherard on the subject of literary style , when the name of
Jules Verne	PERSON	had been introduced : '' ' I am trying to get the Academy to recognize his merits .

		I am pushing his claims to be admitted .

		Bat why will he live au bout du monde f Why does he live in
Amiens	LOCATION	? ''

		Les absents ont toujours tort , '' and the fault that they find with him is that his style is bad , that he has no style , as if that were not a contradiction in itself .

		To have no style is to have a good style .

		Dumas had no style .

		I have no style .

		Style is a neces - sity only to the writer who has nothing to say . ' ''

		In vindication of
Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	's true-hearted - ness and warmth of affection , the author wTites : '' As a matter of fact , those who knew the intimacies of
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	's life , knew of a love story in which he had shown himself the most impassioned of wooers , and of lovers the most ardent and faithful .

		It was my privilege to have in my hands a collection of love-letters written by him , and I sometimes regret that I did not consent to make use of them for publication .

		They were models of the style , and I do not think that de Maupassant ever surpassed in any of his works the beauty of this prose . ''

		Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	makes himself a bit tiresome with his excessive admiration for
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, about whom he has elsewhere written so fidly .

		He also enlarges on the part he took in enlight - ening the world as to Captain
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	's inno - cence and in predicting its ultimate vindication .

		And this naturally brings in
Zola	LOCATION	, and the author 's stanch advocacy of the French realist 's claim to greatness long before
England	LOCATION	would consent to tolerate him .

		A little less insistence by Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	on his own courage and perspi - cacity in this matter woidd have sufficed .

		Yet his self-complacency is not unpardonable .

		The author 's style is , of course , journalistic , but not pronouncedly so .

		He could study meth - od and brcNaty with advantage .

		An occasional Gallicism , as the use of the definite article with abstract nouns , is not surprising in an author who has lived so long among Frenchmen .

		The occiirrence of '' ridded , '' '' frightened of , '' '' mid - dle of the ages , '' ' • gazetteer '' -LRB- meaning jour - nalist -RRB- , here and there attracts attention , even though the writer may be guilty of nothing worse than an unusual or an obsolete form .

		But when he writes of an '' argument ab im - probabile '' and then two lines below , as if to prevent any charitable ascription of this '' im - probable '' Latin to the compositor , speaks of '' arguing ab improbabile , '' he exposes himself to the critic 's shaft .

		And when he makes Mr.
Edison	PERSON	say of electricity , `` It is a mode of mo - tion , a system of vibrations .

		A certain speed of vibrations produces heat ; a lower -LSB- ours the italics -RSB- speed , light ; still lower something else , '' -- he represents either Mr.
Edison	PERSON	or himself as deficient in the very rudiments of molecular physics .

		On one page he says of the murderer
Aubert	PERSON	's kindness to animals , '' This character - istic has been often noticed in those who have no kindness for their fellow-creatures . ''

		But in a later chapter he declares , apropos of Mme.
Bemhardt	PERSON	's alleged cruelty to a pet cat , '' I do n't think that there is ever anything very wrong about a man or woman who is kind to animals . ''

		Two descriptions , fortunately brief and as inoffensive as such descriptions could well be , are given of executions , a triple and a double one , at which the author was present ; yet it is in reference to scenes of this sort that he gravely writes : '' When the law affords such disgusting spectacles as the slaughter of a hu - man being , it can hardly be expected that the better and humaner classes will be represented amongst the spectators . ''

		He does not , however , ^ make it appear that his own presence was on either occasion indispensable , and with reference to one of them he distinctly says that he attended to oblige a friend .

		The book has eight portraits of well-known Frenchmen , and two facsimile letters , a charac - teristic one from Mr.
Eidison	PERSON	and one of grapho - logical interest written by the murderer already mentione < l .

		But to leave off with something pleasanter than murder , let us give a bonmot as quoted by Mr.
Sherard	PERSON	. ''

		A very distinguished man '' was once asked that tiresome question , '' K you were to be allowed only one book , what book woidd you choose ? '' ''

		The Book of Job , '' was the reply . ''

		And why ? ''

		persisted the curious questioner . ''

		To learn patience when worried with foolish questions . ''

Fefty Years After	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It is fifty years since the publication of the first edition of Walt Whitman 's '' Leaves of .

		Grass , '' with its strange electric message , so disconcerting and so irritating to such of the general public as tried to read it .

		It is not yet quite twenty-five years since the last mistaken effort at suppression occurred in
Boston	LOCATION	, when the publishers of the poems were officially de - nied the privileges of the public mails at the instigation of the Society for the Suppression of Vice .

		But the general grounds for a discussion of Walt WTiitman 's claims as a poet have long • Walt Whttmax .

		His Life and Work .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Hoashton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Bliss Perry	PERSON	- 318 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, since shifted from the question of -LSB- his morality to a question regarding his technique .

		We comprehend better , to-day , the thought of the man who declared , ^ ' I have said that the soul is not more than the body , I And I have said that the body is not more than the , soul , And nothing , not God , is greater to one than one 's self is . ''

		And now our debate is over the point whether or no the thing that has been said , with the manner of saying it , is poetry .

		It will be thought significant by some that in the volume of carefully selected verse published last year by our best-known
Boston	LOCATION	book house , a volume entitled `` The Chief American Poets , ''
Walt Whitman	PERSON	was given a place , and on equal terms , with our recognized classic group ; and now we receive from the same firm a very note - worthy life of Whitman , written by Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, the editor of '' The Atlantic Monthly . ''

		Surely , it may be said that the '' good gray poet '' is at last coming to his own !


Walt Whitman	PERSON	, however , came to his own : a long time ago .

		For , in spite of the divergent - views so frankly and so emphatically expressed hj opposing camps , it is doubtful if any other verse-maker ever received more immediate and more illustrious recognition along with much forthright and vigorous abuse .

		The opposition was natural enough , was indeed to be expected ; the applause was so notable that it is worth recalling .

		Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	's impulsive but per - fectly sincere letter of
1855	DATE	, with its memorable * ' I greet you at the beginning of a great career , '' is of course remembered by everyone .

		Let us quote Mr.
Perry	PERSON	here , with reference to the wider recognition : '' While
Burroughs	PERSON	and
O'Connor	PERSON	argued , and Whit - man read by his new astral lamp or tramped the streets with
Peter Doyle	PERSON	, some of the most subtle of the younger English critics were finding in Leaves of Grass a new world of poetry .


Frederick W. H. Myers	PERSON	, then a , fellow of
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	, read from the book to
John Adding	ORGANIZATION	- ton
Symonds	PERSON	, an
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	man of brilliant mind and deli - cate body , who listened with ' thrills to the very marrow of his bones . '


Edward Dowden	PERSON	,
Tyrell	PERSON	, and other young Irish scholars were reading it in
Dublin	LOCATION	.

		William
Bell Scott	PERSON	the artist , who had received a copy from
Thomas Dixon	PERSON	' the cork-cutter , '
Ruskin	PERSON	's friend , introduced it to the notice of
Swinburne	LOCATION	and
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	.

		It will be remembered that
Emerson	PERSON	had sent a copy to Car - lyle , ten years before .

		Thoreau had sent one to his friend
Cholmondeley	PERSON	, and a few other copies had found their way to
England	LOCATION	.

		But here was a band of clever tiniversity men , scholars and poets of a new generation , who became convinced of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's claims to be the representative poet of democracy . ''

		Add to this the fact of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's enthusiasm , the subsequent pleasant interchange of social fellowship between
Whitman	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	, the intimate appreciation of
Burroughs	LOCATION	, the friendly criticism of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, the cordial words from
Tennyson	LOCATION	, to say nothing of German , Danish , and French endorsement , and we have an expression of approval that must have been balm indeed to the poet whose work had been described , characteristically , in '' Putnam 's Monthly '' as '' a compoimd of the
New England	LOCATION	transcendentalist and
New York	LOCATION	rowdy . ''

		As it is largely on the intrinsic merit of '' Leaves of Grass '' that
Whitman	PERSON	's place and fame depend -- in his own estimate surely , as in that of the critic 's , -- it will be especially interesting to readers of the new biography to see what this author has to say with reference to that important work .

		Thus does he set forth Whitman 's idea : '' Very deliberately , as was his manner in all things , this ruminative and unpractical carpenter began to plan an extraordinary thing -- a book which should embody himself and his country .

		All that he had experienced was to be a part of it ; the life which he had hitherto caressed casually , as one touches now the cheek and now the hand of the beloved , was to yield itself wholly ; to lose , as it were , its own individual existence , and to reappear as a Book , but a Book with all the potencies of life so coursing in it that it should seem not so much a Book as a Man . ''

		There is an interesting study of
Walt	ORGANIZATION	's pe - culiar measure , and his embarrassing manipu - lation of the device of catalogue ; a discussion of the peculiarities of rhythmic prose and the influence of writers like
Blake	PERSON	,
Macpherson	PERSON	, and
Tupper	PERSON	-LRB- in his `` Proverbial Philosophy '' -RRB- on the methods of this new bard ; but most significant of all , Mr.
Perry	PERSON	thinks , was the publication in
1851	DATE	of a '' Lyrical Soliloquy , '' by
Samuel Warren	PERSON	, entitled '' The Lily and the Bee , '' in which the curious reader finds a com - plete prototype , in most of its pecidiarities , of '' Leaves of Grass . ''

		That the poetry of Whitman is to be read as declamation , or rhapsody , is in - sisted upon . ''

		To interpret as formal song what was intended as rhapsodical speech is to misread Walt Whitman . ''

		Now , what of the finished product ?

		To quote Mr.
Perry	PERSON	again , -- `` As by the ebb and flow of the tide , the universal frame of things thus becomes flooded with personality : in one moment thmgs are made anthropomorphic , and in the next men and women are de-personalized into scarcely sentient flesh .

		Never was there a stranger pantheism , -- flexible , reversible at will .

		The ' Song of Myself is full of sexual imagery , and the constant shift - ing of the word ' I ' from its individual to its symbolic meaning -- that is , from the actual
Walt Whitman	PERSON	to the typical human being whom the • I ' is often used to represent -- frequently gives this sexual imagery a startling character .

		The human body is stripped bare ;
1906	DATE	. ''

		!

		THE DIAL 319 and in the emotional frenzy which masters the poet , the conventions , and occasionally the decencies , are clean forgotten .

		Yet these passages , offensive as they will always be to the fastidious , -- ' it is as if the beasts spoke , ' said
Thoreau	PERSON	, -- sprang from a profound sense of the germinal forces of life .

		It was a Titanic en - deavor to express the spirit in terms of the flesh .

		It was predestined to partial failure , not only because that feat is so insuperably difficult , but also because
Whitman	PERSON	was after his fashion a philosopher and prophet as well as a poet , and this was a task calling for pure poetry . ''

		In his final chapter , '' After Fifty Years , '' the writer includes the following suggestive paragraphs : `` To appreciate Leaves of Grass as a product ... of Transcendentalism , one should read it , not after a course in
Nietzsche	LOCATION	and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, much as they enforce and illuminate its teaching from various points of view , but after
Carlyle	PERSON	s
Sartor Resartus	PERSON	and
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's Essays and
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's Journal .

		Its eccentricities , like its noble - ness , are a part of the sansculottism and the exaltation of the time .

		... It would be unfair to say of
Whitman	LOCATION	, as
Emerson	PERSON	did of
Gibbon	PERSON	, ' The man has no shrine ; a man 's most important possession . '

		He had altogether too many shrines .

		Monist as he was in philosophy , he was a polytheist in practice : he dropped on his knees anywhere , before stick or stone , flesh or spirit , and swore that each in turn was divine .

		He would have no liierarchy .

		The lesson of gradation , taught by the very stars in their courses , he would not learn .

		TTie gentle - man was no higher than the man , the saint no finer product than the sinner .

		With a soul that instinctively cried ` Glory !

		Glory ! '

		he nevertheless did not perceive that the glory of the terrestrial was one , and the glory of the celestial was another . ''

		The foregoing passages -- and for the pur - poses of this brief review we have restricted our citations to those paragraphs in which the au - thor deals with this most important and typical of Whitman 's compositions -- are sufficient to show that Mr.
Perry	PERSON	's critical judgment is calm , sane , and discriminating .

		His attitude is friendly always , at time ^ enthusiastic , although never that of an enthusiast ; he never slips his moorings , critically .

		His comments are bright - ened , too , with an occasional flash of quiet Yankee humor , revealing the presence of elec - tricity in the atmosphere without any roll of thunder following ; as when he says , for instance , of the poet : '' He is often like a yard-man coupling parlor-cars whose names are rich in individual associations --
Malvolio	ORGANIZATION	,
Manitoba	LOCATION	,
Mazzini	PERSON	,
Manchuria	LOCATION	,
Maria	LOCATION	.

		But however excitedly those musical names are ejaculated , this does not start the train . ''

		In its presentation of Walt TMiitman 's pic - turesque personality , ^ Ir .


Perry	PERSON	's book is , as it could not fail to be , delightfully entertaining .

		The frankness which appears judicially in the criticism of the poet 's work is found also in the narrative of his life .

		There are many vivid glimpses of this demo - cratic figure , this powerfully assertive soul -- always assertive , always democratic -- from the days of early childhood when the sturdy , fair - skinned , black-haired yovmgster tumbled in the clover by the small weather-beaten house where he was bom , listening to the phoebe bird , smelling the lilacs , complacent , absorbing these things -- '' And the third-month lambs and the sow 's pink-faint litter , and the mare 's foal and the cow 's calf , '' and all the vegetable and animal and human life aroimd him , -- from these days of earliest youth to the time of old age in the squalid Camden cottage , the exit , the nightfall , and the good-bye .

		It would be easy to linger over the details of this unique life , but
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's compelling figure has long since made itself familiar , -- here , leisurely strolling through the
New York	LOCATION	streets , now surveying the human comedy from the top of a Broadway omnibus , or looking out from the pilot-house of a ferry - boat on the busy panorama of the
East River	LOCATION	, -- this free-hearted warm-blooded caresser of life , lover of man , comrade of pilots and car-drivers , volunteer nurse , stalwart , health - breathing , bending over the tortured bodies of sick soldiers in the tainted atmosphere of crowded hospitals , bending and touching -- with a hand like a woman 's for tender ministration -- the pain-tom bodies , saying comfortable things , bestowing his little gifts , taking the last message , kissing the dying boy : we remember the picture of
Walt	ORGANIZATION	in war-time .

		He himself writes these things to his mother , his plain , wholesome , '' perfect '' old mother ; how affectionately he writes to her .

		Later , in the cloudy days , his health broken by the hospital service , depressed by the attacks of '' malignant virtue , '' he writes again to her from
Washington	LOCATION	: `` I pass the time very quietly -- some evenings I spend in my attic -- I have laid in wood and can have a fire when I want it -- / wish you teas here . ''

		How natural it is to turn rhapsodist over this singer and lover of the universal ; but the editor of '' The Atlantic '' does not rhapsodize , nor does he represent a cult . ''

		The close atmos - phere of a cult is not healthful for anybody , '' he says ; and shows its bad effect on Whitman in old age .

		The true lovers of Whitman wiQ welcome this clear , sincere interpretation of their prophet all the more warmly for its conscien - tious frankness and its dispassionate tone .

		How - ever realistic the study , in the presence of such a portrait one can but echo the words of
Lincoln	LOCATION	when he first saw Walt Whitman : ' * Well , he looks Hke a MAN ! ''

		320 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, We can not better end our account than by allowing the author of this admirable biography in his own words to summarize the poet 's mes - sage and its claim on the interest of posterity . ''

		Upon the whole the most original and suggestive poetic figure since
Wordsworth	PERSON	, he gazed steadily , like
Wordsworth	PERSON	, upon the great and permanent objects of nature and the primary emotions of mankind .

		Of the totality of his work one may well say , ' The sky o'er - arches here . '

		Here is the wide horizon , the waters rolling in from the great deep , the fields and cities where men toil and laugh and conquer .

		Here are the gorgeous processionals of day and night , of lilac-time and harvest .

		The endless mystery of childhood , the pride of manhood , the calm of old age are here ; and here , too , at last is the ' Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet , ' the hush and whisper of the Infinite Presence .

		These primal and ultimate things Whitman felt as few men have ever felt them , and he expressed them , at his best , with a nobility and beauty such as only the world 's very greatest poets have surpassed .

		Numbers count for nothing , when one is reckoning the audience of a poet , and
Whitman	ORGANIZATION	's audience will , for natural reasons , be limited to those who have the intellectual and moral generosity to understand him , and will take the pains to do so .

		But no American poet now seems more sure to be read , by the fit persons , after one hundred or five hundred years . ''

		The liOifG Story or a Short Oration .

		* In a period of so extensive an output of books as prevails at present , literary coincidences are to be expected ; but rarely have three books appeared simultaneously , bearing upon so minor an incident as the delivery of an address , strictly occasional , by a man who was not a noted orator .

		The occasion referred to was the dedication of a portion of the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	battlefield as a cemetery ; and the speaker was President Lin - coln .

		This
Gettysburg	LOCATION	speech , occupying barely thirty lines of type on an ordinary page , has be - come a classic , declaimed in the schools and used as a model for the rhetorician .

		The events con - nected with its delivery have consequently as - siuned an unusual importance .

		Of the three authors whose books , treating these events , are now before us , one weaves the incidents into the form of fiction based presumably on fact ; another approaches the topic as a historian deal - ing with collected materials ; while the third writes reminiscently , having been officially con - nected with the exercises .

		The Perfect Tribute '' on the
Gettys	PERSON	- burg speech is rendered directly to
Lincoln	LOCATION	, in a
Washington	LOCATION	hospital , by a wounded soldier who had read the address in a morning news - paper , -- the President having been accidentally called in to draw up a will for the dying man .

		The basis , if any exists , for the improbable story is not known to the reviewer ; but if the author has taken as many liberties with it as with the facts regarding the delivery of the address itself , it may well pass for pure fiction .

		The special train from
Washington	LOCATION	to
Gettysburg	LOCATION	is made to start in the morning instead of at noon .

		Mr.
Everett	PERSON	is placed on the train with Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, instead of coming directly from
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	is made to write his speech on a scrap of wrapping-paper on the train , although that story is known to be apocryphal .

		He '' leans slouchingly , '' and '' slouched back across the platform '' at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, as he may have done in his early days in a country court-room .

		Mr.
Everett	PERSON	is made to congratidate
Lincoln	LOCATION	imme - diately after the conclusion of the address in words which he really wrote to Lincoln the fol - lowing day .

		However , leaving veracity out of consideration , it must be confessed that the little story is written with a tenderness of touch and a delicacy of diction which make it delightful reading .

		The second book , ''
Gettysburg	LOCATION	and Lincoln , '' by Mr.
Henry S. Burrage	PERSON	, is best described as an unofficial history of the steps taken to preserve the battle-field , preceded by a brief sketch , with diagrams , of the three days of battle .

		The sketch is weU written and to the point ; it takes no part in the many controversies arising from the con - duct of the opposing armies , and treats Con - federate and Federal alike in matters of praise or censure .

		The bulk of the volume is devoted to the work of
the Memorial Association	ORGANIZATION	which had charge of the field in
1893	DATE	, and the
National Park Commission	ORGANIZATION	in control since that date under Congressional appropriations .

		Various states contributed
$ 835,625.55	MONEY	to the purchase and ornamentation of the

		After a lapse of half a century , his remembrances of the occasion are griven to the public in a book - let which is a tasteful specimen of the art of printer and binder .

		He invites confidence in his recollections by confessing in certain in - stances that he did not observe or can not recall .

		He accepts the Xicolay statement that half the address was written before Lincoln started from
Washington	LOCATION	and the remainder in
Gettysburg	LOCATION	on the morning of the dedicatory day .

		Mr.
Burrage	PERSON	inclines to the story that the address was fully blocked out in
Washington	LOCATION	and re - WTitten in
Gettysburg	LOCATION	during the evening after
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's arrival .

		Both authors reject the story that he wrote it on the train , or on his hat held in his lap while
Everett	PERSON	was speaking .

		Mr.
Burrage	PERSON	accepts the reportorial interpolations of `` Applause '' and '' Long continued applause '' as evidence that both audience and speaker were satisfied with the effect produced by the address .

		Mr.
Carr	PERSON	, however , hints that these were inven - tions of the reporters , '' Except when he con - cluded , '' ' he says , '' I did not observe it -LSB- the applause -RSB- , and at the close the applause was not especially marked . ''

		He also says : ' • Time and again , expressions of disappointment were made to me .

		Many persons said to me that they woidd have supposed that on such a great occasion the President would have made a speech . ''

		This disappointment is ascribed to the brevity of the speech , to the confusion attend - ing the coming of the President to the front of the platform , and to the impression that he was uttering commonplaces -- nothing new which was not self-evident . ''

		So short a time was Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	before them that the people coidd scarcely believe their eyes when he disappeared from view .

		Higher Edvcatiox ix
America	LOCATION	.

		* Concerning education in
America	LOCATION	, there are many conflicting voices , some finding no praise high enough , others crying only of its errors and defects .

		We would be the last to deny the possibilities of almost limitless improvement in our system : too often superficiality marks our theories , and false economy alternates with prod - igality in our administration ; our compulsory attendance is largely a farce ; our professional training of teachers touches only the mar gin of the field .

		Notwithstanding all this , and much more , the record of American education is one to warm the heart of every one of us , and deepen our just and reasonable pride in our nation and our history .

		Most of all is this true of higher education , in which
America	LOCATION	has distinguished herself in more ways than are commonly recog - nized .

		President Thwing 's '' History of Higher Edu - cation in
America	LOCATION	'' is animated and rightly influenced by a sense of the greatness of the theme , and wOl be welcomed by an unusually large and varied body of readers The book has a very distinct character of its own : first , it does not contain an iminteresting page ; the reader who takes it up is likely to read from page to page and from chapter to chapter until he reaches the end .

		The author has ransacked the sources , and has shown uncommon discern - ment in what he has brought away for his readers ; we imagine that few will read it with - out frequently meeting what is new to them , or even surprising ; most of us have some vague idea that lotteries were far commoner once than they are now , but how many are aware that ' * Down to the beginning of
the fourth decade f of the eighteenth century	DATE	-RSB- nearly all colleges were enriched through lotteries '' ?

		322 THE DlAl ^ -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, aspects of the theme of their due space and at - tention .

		But it can not be denied that the per - sonal quality enhances the interest , for not only is it true that the proper study of mankind is man , but it is also a fact that most of vis like to see the individual in propria persona , and not veiled under a colorless general term .

		So the book abounds in men , great teachers like
Silli	PERSON	- man and
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, administrators like
Josiah Quincy	PERSON	and
Eliphalet Nott	PERSON	; and many brilliant names from outside the field of education , such as those of
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
John Adams	PERSON	,
Franklin	PERSON	, and
Webster	PERSON	.

		Here is perhaps the place to express our surprise that nowhere in the book have we been able to find any mention of one of the largest figures of the latest period of higher education in
America	LOCATION	,
William Rainey Harper	PERSON	; it is hard to see how such a history can be thought complete without mention of this man and his work .

		Dr.
Thwing	PERSON	does not content himself with any external account of educational affairs and institutions , but seeks everywhere for their mo - tive and spirit .

		The many human figures that enliven the narrative are there because they embody the ideals , the aspirations , the enthusi - asms , which were the true creative forces pro- ducing the outward and visible forms of educa - tional institutions .

		Religious and moral purpose , devotion to higher thought and to pure science , the spiritual influence of
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	at different epochs , receive full recognition among the formative principles of our institu - tions of learning .

		This quality of our author finds its best expression in the closing chapter on the general results of higher education in
America	LOCATION	; here he sets forth with insight and warmth what he regards as the services which higher learning has rendered to the common - wealth , intellectually , religiously , socially , polit - ically .

		One would be cold or skeptical indeed who could read this chapter without a glow of sympathetic enthusiasm .

		We have already spoken of the author 's skill in the selection of materials ; this quality , per - haps the very first essential for good composi - tion of any sort , springs from a certain natural sympathy and comprehension which enable the possessor to choose from a mass of details those which men will love to hear .

		Dr.
Thwing	PERSON	's power in this respect shows itself particularly in felicitous quotation , and is perhaps at its best in the fine chapter on '' The Colleges in the Civil War . ''

		There are sentences or paragraphs from letters written by students and teachers of both
Northern and Southern	ORGANIZATION	colleges ; each has its own message , and together they convey a vivid and touching picture of what the outbreak of the war meant to these men engaged in the peaceful pursuit of knowledge .

		No citation which we can make here can fairly represent the chapter , but we select one or two striking and descriptive passages .

		These are from stu - dents ' letters : `` It was impossible for me to carry on my studies with any degree of interest or of profit to myself .

		... I felt that if I re - mained at college , I could derive no benefit whatever while my mind was so entirely inter - ested in another direction . '' ''

		It is not congenial • to my tastes to go to war , but it seems now that all who love their country ought to be willing to take up arms in its defense . ''

		The chapter fitly closes with the well-known lines composed and spoken by a college professor to college students : '' What were our lives without thee ?

		What all our lives to save thee ?

		We reck not what we gave thee ; We will not dare to doubt thee , But ask whatever else , and we will dare . ''

		As the author says -LRB- p. 374 -RRB- , `` The lesson .

		.

		, is the general lesson of the patriotism of the American college ... There is no antago - nism between culture and patriotism ... The American college is the nursery of patriotism . '

		^ It is of course impossible to do justice to the history of higher education in
America	LOCATION	within the limits of five hundred pages ; there is , then , the more need for keeping true proportion , and above all not omitting any essential elements .

		Dr.
Thwing	PERSON	's book seems to us to be defective in this regard .

		The most conspicuous cases of this defect are found in the neglect of several distinctively American characteristics .

		First among these we would name the American college as an institution markedly different in organization and function from any foreign type .

		We can not feel that this great fact in our history receives adequate recognition in the book .

		It is possible that all the actual material for such recognition is included , much of it , for instance , in Chapter XVII. , on `` Undergraduate Affairs and Undertakings , '' but the material is nowhere concentrated upon the significant point .

		Again , the whole subject of technical education is slighted , in spite of the fact that
America	LOCATION	has actually created an institution and a method for such education , and in consequence has been able to send her men and her machinery to all parts of the world in successful competi - tion with the output of older nations -LRB- and we may add that calling this a characteristic achieve - ment of
America	LOCATION	by no means implies the opinion
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 323 that it is one of her greatest or best achieve - ments -RRB- .

		Thirdly ,
the State	ORGANIZATION	university ^ now looming so large upon the future of higher edu - cation , and indubitably a natural outcome of our educational and social history , is almost ignored in Dr.
Thwing	PERSON	's account .

		Naturally , the experiment station and the agricultural col - lege share the same neglect .

		Besides these cases of the neglect of pecul - iarly American elements we note that insufficient attention is given to the rise of American sci - entific and professional literature ; our scholars and scientists have done their best , in the face of some adverse conditions , to contribute to the store of hmnan knowledge , and not a few jour - nals of the many established have attained in - ternational reputation .

		Finally , is not German influence even more deserving of a separate chapter than French ?

		^ Vhen we turn to the style of the book , we are met by astonishing inequality .

		Some of the chapters are clear , strong , often fluent , and at times almost grand ; such , for example , is the treatment of
Jefferson	PERSON	and
the University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	in Chapter VII .

		Some of the earlier chapters , on the other hand , are marred by petty imperfections , and by the prevalence of a disjointed , almost jerky , structure .

		Examples of this last faidt would take too much space ; specimens occur on page 19 -LRB- last seven lines -RRB- , page 68 -LRB- last paragraph -RRB- , page 89 -LRB- first nine lines -RRB- .

		To illustrate the numerous small flaws referred to , we give the following : '' A little of history , and a little of botany '' -LRB- p. 29 -RRB- . ''

		The college was placed at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, first called
Newtown	LOCATION	, in recognition of the English origin of the foimdation '' -LRB- p. 9 -RRB- . ''

		Gowns , silver pots , ... and the services of a barber are ele - ments quite as significant as in some instances more costly than the room and tuition '' -LRB- p. 41 -RRB- .

		One need not be a purist to object to the repeated use of share ioT part -LRB- pp. 19 , 26 , etc. -RRB- , obtained ioT prevailed or existed -LRB- pp. 27 , 29 , etc. -RRB- , and represent in such phrases as '' boxing matches , dancing ... represented severe -LSB- `` ic .

		^ -RSB- offenses '' -LRB- p. 34 ^ / i -RRB- .

		These petty faults of style and diction , even though they rarely destroy the sense , do annoy the reader and distract his at - tention .

		Surely no reputable writer can afford to let his work get into public print unpiirged of such blemishes .

		Some other minor criticisms might be made : definite information is often omitted , or con - cealed in a mass of detail , particularly in the case of the dates of opening of the early colleges -LRB- see pages 54f , 67f , 11 If -RRB- .

		The name
Catho	PERSON	- lepistemiad is hardly to be called '' mongrel , '' odd as it is ; nor does the context make clear just how it is `` significant '' -LRB- p. 202 -RRB- .

		More seriously wrong seems the statement that '' the method and purpose of the French nation -LSB- at the end of the XVIII .

		century -RSB- were one with the method , purpose , and power of the new Ameri - can nation '' -LRB- p. 193 -RRB- .

		Nor do we think it true that the degree of Ph.D. , in
America	LOCATION	at least , '' has come to represent what the degree of Bachelor stood for in the continental universities six hundred years ago '' -LRB- p. 429 -RRB- .

		This would be nearer the truth if asserted of
Germany	LOCATION	, where the Ph.D. is considered the minimiim qualification for giving any higher instruction ; but even there the resemblance is slight , for the Bachelor of the fourteenth century , like the Bachelor of to-day , after taking his baccalau - reate degree , resumes his attendance at the lec - tures of the regular university masters or professors .

		-LRB- See
Rashdall	PERSON	, `` Universities of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' I. , pp. 443-448 . -RRB-

		But these defects are of secondary importance , to be regretted in a dignified work , yet not seriously impairing its value .

		The book is con - ceived and executed in a large and generous spirit , combines accuracy and interest in an unusual degree , and is a notable addition to the literature of our educational history .

		A Critic Militaxt .

		* There are critics and critics .

		There is the critic who is chiefly concerned with matters of style and technique , who views literature as a thing apart , and pronovmces Rhadamanthine judgments upon poems and novels and plays .

		Then there is the critic who is preoccupied with categories and classifications , who is an exponent of what he calls the philosophy of literature , and whose mission it is to develop abstract prin - ciples out of concrete materials .

		And then there is the critic who finds literature to be primarily the criticism and the expression of human life , and is all the time bent upon pointing out its relations to the political and social and intel - lectual environment of the men who are its producers .

		To this class of critics Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	clearly belongs ; and if we add that he puts into his work an aggressive or militant element , that energy means more to him than art -LRB- although art is by no means left out of the • REMiinscBJiCBS OF My CHILDHOOD AND YouTH .

		324 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, question -RRB- , and that his aim is quite as much the propagation of ideas as the evaluation of pro- ducts , we have a reasonably accurate formula of his activity .

		He is one of the foremost of living critics by virtue of his immense knowledge of literature and the devotion which he has applied to its interpretation for something like forty years .

		The importance of his work has won its deserved but long-delayed recognition through - out the European world , and particularly , since the publication of his Shakespearean studies , the English-speaking public has learned to know and value his critical product .

		Under these circumstances , then , it is safe to say that his volume of '' Reminiscences '' will find many eager readers in both
England	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		No one who has felt the influence of his work can fail to be attracted by his own account -- his own frank and intimate revelation -- of the unfolding of his intellectual life , and the shaping of the ideas about modern literature that he has enforced with so much impressiveness in so many books .

		The vigor and the vitality which characterize his treatment of other writers are equally characteristic of this account of his own career , and impart even to the most trivial happenings a high degree of interest .

		Nor is interest of a more objective sort lacking .

		Although this instalment of what we hope is to be a complete autobiography takes us only to the early seventies , when the writer has just turned thirty , its scope embraces the spo - liation of
Denmark	LOCATION	by
Germany	LOCATION	-LRB- a chapter of history which was the occasion of much soul - searching for Scandinavian youth -RRB- and the later spoliation of
France	LOCATION	by
Germany	LOCATION	after the ex - citing months of the War and the
Commune	ORGANIZATION	.

		These happenings , and the contemporary hap - penings in
Italy	LOCATION	, all figure in these reminiscent pages , and gain fresh interest from their reflec - tion in the consciousness of this independent observer .

		We have also glimpses of famous men --
Taine	PERSON	, Renan , Mill -- with whose friend - ship the youthful critic was honored , and to whom he has elsewhere paid more formal tributes .

		Of Scandinavian personalities there is of course much mention .

		Aside from
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and
Bjomson	PERSON	, the men introduced to us are little more than names to the general reader , whose knowledge of Scandinavian literature , if not an absolutely minus quantity , is at best apt to be haphazard or accidental .

		Before the two great men just named appeared above the horizon , our public thought of Scandinavian literature as chiefly represented by
Swedenborg	PERSON	,
Hans Christian Andersen	PERSON	, and the estimable
Frederika Bremer	PERSON	.

		Tliis is very much as if an intelligent foreigner should have thought of English liter - ature as mainly adorned by
Cudworth	LOCATION	,
Harriet Martineau	PERSON	, and ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	. ''

		Now many of the names mentioned by Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	are doubtless of no more than parochial interest , but there are many others of which no cultivated person can afford to be ignorant .

		Such writers as
Holberg	ORGANIZATION	,
Oehlenschliiger	PERSON	,
Kierkegaard	LOCATION	, and
Drachmann	PERSON	-- to mention
Danes	PERSON	alone -- count for a good deal in the history of literature ; and we have always been thankful to our author for the calm assurance with which he has named them in his books whenever their example would serve his purpose , as if taking for granted that they would be no less familiar than examples of similar weight drawn from other literatures . ''

		If you have never heard of them , so much the worse for you '' is the unspoken `` aside '' which accompanies many references in '' Main Cur - rents '' and the other works .

		But if we are to convey any idea of the quality of these '' Reminiscences , '' we must cut short our preliminary observations , and busy ourselves with extracts .

		The story begins at the beginning . ''

		He was little , and looked at the world from below .

		All that happened went on over his head .

		Everyone looked down to him ... The trying moment of the day was when he had to go to bed .

		His parents were extraordinarily prejudiced about bed-time , just when he was enjoying himself most . ''

		He was a delicate boy physically , but his eager little mind was woi ` king at an early age , and serious problems perplexed his tender years . ''

		God was strange , too , in other ways ; He was present everywhere , and yet mother was cross and angry if you asked whether he was in the new moderator lamp , which burnt in the drawing-room Avith a much brighter light than the two wax candles used to give .

		God knew everything , which was very uncomfortable , since it was impossible to hide the least thing from Him .

		Strangest of all was it when one reflected that , if one knew what God thought one was going to say , one could say some - thing else and His omniscience would be foiled .

		But of course one did not know what He thought would come next . ''

		The child who thus reasoned about '' fate , free - will , foreknowledge absolute '' was the father of the man in a more than usually accurate sense .

		One childish experience made a great impression .

		He noticed that for some time , when out walk - ing with his nursemaid , boys in the street had been making faces at him and calling him names . ''

		One day when I had heard the shout again , I made up my mind that I would know , and when I came home asked my mother : '' Wliat does it mean ? '

		` Jew ! '

		said mother , ' Jews are people . ' '

		Nasty people ? ' '

		Yes , ' said
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 325 mother , smiling , ' sometimes very ugly people , but not always . ' '

		Could I see a Jew ? ' '

		Yes , very easily , ' said mother , lifting me up quickly in front of the larg ^ oval mirror above the sofa .

		I uttered a shriek , so that mother hurriedly put me down again , and my horror was such that she regretted not having prepared me .

		Later on she occasionally spoke about it . ''

		Thus early in life was learned the lesson of race-prejudice , so wide-spread , so dishonoring to human nature , and so terrible in its occa - sional consequences .

		Although of the Jewish race , the boy 's family was anything but orthodox . ''

		Nothing was ever said at home about any religious creed .

		Neither of my parents was in any way asso - ciated with the Jewish religion , and neither of them ever went to the Synagogue . ''

		Nevertheless , the boy was in due time con - firmed , according to law and custom ; but his rationalizing instincts had already asserted themselves , and he looked upon the ceremony with something like disdain .

		`` The confirmation , according to my mocking sum - marj ' of the impression produced by it , consisted mainly in the hiring of a tall silk hat from the hat-maker , and the sending of it back next day , sanctified .

		The siUy custom was at that time prevalent for boys to wear silk hats for the occasion , idiotic though they made them look ... `` When called upon to make my confession of faith with the others , I certainly joined my first ' yes , ' this touching a belief in Grt -RRB- d , to theirs , but remained silent at the question as to whether I believed that God had revealed Himself to Moses and spoken by His prophets .

		I did not believe it .

		I was , for that matter , in a wavering frame of mind imable to arrive at any clear understanding ... Under these circumstances , my young soul , feeling the need of something it coidd worship , fled from
Asia	LOCATION	's to
Europe	LOCATION	's Divinities , from
Palestine	LOCATION	to
Hellas	LOCATION	, and clung with vivid enthusiasm to the Greek world of beauty and the legends of its Gods .

		From all the learned education I had , I only extracted this one thing : an enthusiasm for ancient Hellas and her Gods ; they were my Gods , as they had been those of Jidian .

		ApoUo and
Artemis	ORGANIZATION	,
Athene	PERSON	and Eros and Aphrodite grew to be powers that I believed in and rejoiced over in a very different sense from any Grod re - vealed on
Sinai	ORGANIZATION	, or in
Emmaus	LOCATION	.

		They were near to me . ''

		So he goes on to relate that
Thorwaldsen	ORGANIZATION	's Museum in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	became the temple in which he worshipped , and that he found his '' soul 's true native land '' through the revela - tions of the great Danish sculptor .

		The youth whose attitude toward religion was thus early defined , and in a sense so antagonistic to conventional beliefs , was naturally destined to a somewhat imcomfortable career .

		The odium theologicum is the meanest and the most ma - lignant of all the foes of intellectual freedom , and a large part of Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	's life has been spent in defending himself from its attacks .

		The clergy paid their compliments to the young man from his first appearance in the intellectual arena .

		The following incident is illuminating : '' One day in
1868	DATE	the much-respected Pastor Hoh - lenberg walked into my friend
Benny Spang	PERSON	's house , reprimanded her severely for recei \ ` ing such an un - doubted heretic and heathen under her roof , and de - manded that she should break off all association with me .

		As she refused to do so and turned a deaf ear to his arguments , losing all self-control , he flung his felt hat on the floor , continued to rage and rail against me , and , no result coming of it , dashed at last , in a towering passion , out through the door , which he slammed be - hind him .

		There was a farcical ending to the scene , since he was obliged to ring at the door again for his hat , which , in his exasperation , he had forgotten . ''

		It is no wonder that such provocations as these developed the aggressive side of the student 's personality , and made him a critic militant , a critic of many other matters than those of purely literary interest .

		Referring to the above inci - dent , he says : '' This was a kind of private prologue to the ecclesi - astical drama which from the year
1871	DATE	upwards was enacted in most of the pulpits of the country .

		Only the parsons , instead of flinging their hats upon the floor , beat their hands against the pulpit . ''

		The young man 's vocation was early declared . ''

		I felt an inward conviction that I should make my way as a writer , '' he says , speaking of his feelings at the age of eighteen , when he had just passed his philosophical examination . ''

		It seemed to me that a deathlike stillness reigned for the time being over European literature , but that there were mighty forces working in the silence . ''

		That same year he wrote in his diary as follows : '' We
Danes	PERSON	, with our national culture and our knowl - edge of the literatures of other countries , will stand well equipped when the literary horn of the Gods re - sounds again through the world , calling fiery youth to battle .

		I am firmly convinced that that time will come and that I shall be , if not the one who evokes it in the North , at any rate one who will contribute greatly toward it . ''

		To prepare himself for the fray , he studied lit - erature , art , sesthetics , philosophy , political science , even jurisprudence and music .

		He must have had an enormous power of assimilation in those early years , for the ground that he cov - ered was simply amazing .

		Here is to be found the fundamental explanation of his later influ - ence as a critic .

		It is not merely because he has always related literature to life that he ap - peals to us so forcibly , but it is also because his wTitings , whatever their theme , always re - flect a wide range of thought and observation , always reveal a mind that has subjected itseK to severe and various disciplines in its formative period .

		326 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	was fortunate enough in his early manhood to attract the attention and gain the confidence of three of the leaders of European thought ,
Taine	PERSON	,
Renan	ORGANIZATION	, and Mill .

		Of the three .

		Mill was the one who most deeply impressed and influenced him , and his characterization of the English philosopher is of much interest .

		It was in the
summer of 1870	DATE	, only a few days before the declaration of war , that the two men first met . ''

		At that time Mill was without any doubt among
Europe	LOCATION	's most distinguished men , the greatest admirer of French history and French intellectual life to be found outside of
France	LOCATION	; but he was of quite a different type from the French , even from those I esteemed most highly .

		The latter were comprehensive-minded men , bold and weighty like
Taine	PERSON	, or cold and agile like Renan , but they were men of intellect and thought , only having no connection with the practical side of life .

		They were not adapted to personal action , felt no inclination to direct interference .

		Mill was different .

		Although he was more of a thinker than any of them , his boldness was not of the merely theoretical kind .

		He wished to interfere and re-model ... Thus in him I met , for the first time in my life , a figure who was the incarnation of the ideal I had drawn for myself of the great man .

		This ideal had two sides : talent and character ; great capacities and inflexibility .

		The men of great reputation whom I had met hitherto , artists and scientists , were certainly naen richly endowed with talents ; but I had never hitherto encountered a per - sonality combining talents with gifts of character ... Now I had met a grand inflexibility of ideas in human form , and was impressed for my whole life long ... In MiU I learnt at last to know a man in whom the power of action , disturbance , and accomplishment were devoted to the service of modern sociological thought . ''

		A few days after this first interview , the author made a visit to
England	LOCATION	, and enjoyed frequent conversations with his new friend , conversations which '' had a fertilising and helpful influence '' upon all the rest of his life .

		The following glimpse of
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	in
1870	DATE	is interesting : '' The Emperor himself was a wreck .

		I had had no doubt of that since I had one day seen him at very close quarters in the
Louvre	LOCATION	, where he was inspecting some recently-hung decorative paintings .

		It was quite evi - dent that he could not walk alone , but advanced , half - sliding , supported by two tall chamberlains , who each gave him an arm .

		His eyes were half-closed and his gaze absolutely dulled .

		The dressed and waxed mous - tache , which ran to a needle-like pomt , looked doubly tasteless against his wax mask of a face .

		He was the incarnation of walking decrepitude , vapid and slack . ''

		How utterly this arch-criminal had become re - duced to the condition of a mere simidacrum of a man appears from what is written of him a few weeks later , after the early disasters of the war .

		Despised by all parties alike , his name was already half - consigned to oblivion . ''

		He himself hardly dared to send any messages .

		After having been obliged to surrender the supreme command , he followed the army , like a mock emperor , a kmd of onlooker , a superfluous piece on the board ... The Revolution of
September	DATE	4th was not an overturn - ing of tilings ; it was merely the ratification of a state of affairs that people were already agreed upon in the cap - itol , and had been even before the battle of Gravelotte . ''

		With these few extracts from this extraor - dinarily interesting volume our review must close .

		Many aspects of the work have not been touched upon at all , and little has been said of its character as an intimate and charming per - sonal revelation .

		The writer declares that one of the deepest impressions of his early life came from his reading of Goethe 's '' Dichtung und Wahrheit , '' and this we may well believe , for he has himself produced an autobiography of the same type and having the same sort of attract - iveness .

		The story , as now told , leaves the au - thor in
Italy	LOCATION	, at the age of thirty , and on the eve of his return to
Denmark	LOCATION	.

		We trust that he plans to continue the narrative ; his failure to do so would be nothing less than a literary calamity .

		What were the forces and what the combinations that pro- duced the `` youngest child of the world 's old age '' ?

		The historian of both events and tendencies , who inquires into the inner workings of mind as well as of things outward , would wish to know what prepar - atory thinking was done by the Japanese themselves .

		At what were their men of vision and foresight active a century or two before
Townsend Harris	PERSON	?

		The writer who looks at the problem from the European side will tell you much about British and other naval operations .

		Probably the American missionaries who , as early as
1859	DATE	, began to train the modern intellect of
Japan	LOCATION	and to make it a seed - bed for thought brought from the West , could tell most of all .

		Yet not the least important side is that seen from the view-point of the foreign servant of the Japanese government , who a generation ago taught material civilization and matters of engineer - ing interest to eager pupils in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Such an author , competent and clear-headed , although not a past - master in literary composition , is Mr.
J. Morris	PERSON	, who spent some years of his early manhood in helping the Japanese to learn the arts and sciences by which they afterwards were able to humble
Russia	LOCATION	.

		In the twenty-two biographies , each accompanied by a full - page reproduction of a photographic portrait , that compose his volume entitled `` The Makers of
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , he sets out to show who these makers
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 327 really were .

		He tells us of
Keiki	LOCATION	, the still-living last of the shoguns , and of the three men who , seeing the American treaty ships coming when these were yet below the horizon , wanted their country to wel - come them , but who , in the sixties , met what may be called the death of martyrs .

		Then he pictures the two bright lads who , exchanging the incendiary 's torch and the assassin 's sword for the ways of peace and law , stole away to
Europe	LOCATION	and came back to be the unquailing champions of civilization , now known as the
Marquis Ito and Count Inouye	ORGANIZATION	.

		The two Kioto court nobles who formed the link between the throne and the people ,
Iwakura	LOCATION	and Sanjo , are next set before us .

		After that follow the great statesmen , soldiers , and creators of
New Japan	LOCATION	, each with a chapter .

		If Mr.
Morris	PERSON	had the literary skill , he would have made a book of value and interest far beyond the writings of
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	, who is popxilarly supposed to be '' an inspired exponent of Japanese esoterics , '' but who has built not a few theorems out of materials supplied by his own en - thusiastic admiration .

		Basing his narrative on facts , Mr.

roe Bacon	PERSON	, has brought together about the '' Beautiful River '' and its immediate neighborhood the stories and history of the settlers and settlements of that region , whether in
Connecticut	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, Ver - mont , or
New Hampshire	LOCATION	.

		He dwells in consider - able detail upon many points that general histories of the
United States	LOCATION	mention but casually , whUe at the same time he has drawn from local histories only those facts -LRB- or legends -RRB- that contribute to the unity of the treatment .

		That he has relied upon his predecessors in the field -LRB- though none had hitherto chosen his precise localization -RRB- more than upon original sources , seems probable , inasmuch as he is much given to quoting felicitous phrases without credit to the authors .

		The historical section of the book begins with the year
1614	DATE	, when
Adria	ORGANIZATION	`` n Block , ' • first of Eui'opean navigators to enter and explore '' the
Connecticut River	LOCATION	, laid the foundation for the struggle between the Dutch and English along its lower banks -- a struggle that finally re - sulted in the English supremacy , through the instru - mentality of those rebels against the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Bay leaders who sought and finally obtained per - mission to establish themselves apart .

		The history of the valley , as its settlements extended slowly up the river , is followed to the
end of the eighteenth century	DATE	, after which time the history of the valley towns gradually became absorbed into that of their respective states .

		Among the prominent episodes included in this section are the separation of the Rev.
Thomas Hooker	PERSON	and his followers from the Bay government , the beginnings of
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	, the battle of
Bloody Brook	ORGANIZATION	, the Sack of
Deerfield	LOCATION	, the wai '' of the '' New Hampshire Grants , '' and the establishment of
Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	. '

		The second part , '' Romances of Navigation , '' treats of the river as an early colonial highway , traces the establish - ment upon it of various locks and canals , tells of the efforts to carry steamboating up the river and of its final disappearance at the coming of the raUroads .

		The third section , on the '' Topography of River and Valley , '' takes the reader from source to mouth , describing special points of formation and scenery , and pointing out historic spots and buildings on the banks and in the bordering towns .

		For those who have once visited these lovely scenes , as well as for the intending traveller , this section is naturally the most interesting , although the entire book may be read with pleasure and enlightenment , in spite of its faults .

		Numerous instances could be adduced of careless writing -LRB- sometimes no doubt of careless proof-reading -RRB- -- such as the indiscriminate use of the words '' Mahican '' and '' Mohegan , ''
Maria Smith	PERSON	for
Sophia Smith	PERSON	-LRB- the founder of Smith Col - lege -RRB- , '' goal '' for '' g ^ l , '' etc. .

		There is a fairly good index , but Mr.
Bacon	PERSON	would not have erred in providing a list of authorities or an occasional foot - note of reference .

		A word should be said concern - ing the numerous illustrations , which are attractive and well-executed photographs , but to our thinking do not include a sufficient number possessing his - toric interest or significance .

		Librariei at antidotes to newspapers .

		With his wonted clearness and f orce , ^ and in English that it is a delight to read , Mr.
J. N. Earned	PERSON	, well known as former librarian of the
Buffalo Public Library	ORGANIZATION	and as the editor of a very useful encyclopaedia of history , emphasizes the urgent necessity of spread - ing the culture of good literature among the people at large .

		His little volume on '' Books , Culture , and Character '' -LRB- Houghton ,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is made up of seven addresses , or parts of addresses , delivered at various times between
1883	DATE	and the present year .

		In his opinion , the impoi-tance of libraries and the benefits accruing from the study of history are be - yond estimate .

		His enthusiasm renders almost im - practicable for most readers his advice on historical reading .

		In American history alone he names , as if in passing and as a mere preliminary to larger undertakings , books to be read that aggregate per - haps twenty thousand pages .

		In biography , he makes somewhat light of
Boswell	PERSON	's hero , but he says a good thing about biographical reading in general . ''

		I have never known one person , '' he declares , '' who enjoyed what may be called the fine flavors of character in biography who had not fine tastes in all literature . ''

		In his abomination of sensfttional 328 THE DIAL -LSB-

America	LOCATION	, and a reader of nothing better . ''

		One more quotation may fittingly close this brief notice of an excellent book . ''

		I am by nature an optimist .

		Things as they are in the world look extremely disheartening to me ; but I think I can see forces at work which will powerfully change them before many generations have passed .

		Among such forces , the most potent in my expecta - tion is that which acts from the free public library .

		Through its agency , in my belief , there will come a day -- it may be a distant day , but it will come -- when the large knowledge , the wise thinking , the fine feeling , the amplitude of spirit that are in the great literatures , will have passed into so many minds that they will rule society democratically , by right of numbers .

		The very balance-sheet '' is almost hu - man in a sense , and so does it get hold of our psy - chology that even now we feel that anything said against it might be to our detriment .

		For nothing in life , not even a half-developed young woman , is so freighted with contradictions as this document . ''

		Other chapters treat , with much delicate sentiment and a most engaging playfulness , of dining , of lunching in the city , on the advantages of living in a lunatic asylum , on the cultivation of the spirit of Greek archaeology , and several other matters .

		Some of these humorously fanciful sketches might almost have come from the pen of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	at his desk in the
East India House	ORGANIZATION	; and one notes with approval the author 's expressed admiration of
Elia	LOCATION	.

		With almost equal sq , tisfaction we greet his tribute to Horace : '' Before me lies a night with
Horace	PERSON	, of all the Latins my favourite . ''

		But , alas , why will he run the risk of spoiling everything , of turning the cordial ardor of our appreciation and enjoyment into the cold aversion of surprised disgust by making so vulgar and so needless a word-blunder as meets our pained and astonished gaze on his forty-third page ?

		Valentine , a sentimentalist and a dreamer , wanders in the murmuring woods and lai/s on the grass .

		The sentiment and the poetiy vanish irrevocably .

		It is as if a beautiful young lady were caught eating with her knife .

		Some dedicatory lines to Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	follow the title-page , and other verses occur in the body of the book and at its close .

		A philosophical In '' The American Ten Years ' War , history of the 1855-1865 '' -LRB-
Sigma Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	, Civil War .

		g ^ ^ Louis -RRB- , Mr.
Denton J. Snider	PERSON	has attempted a philosophical interpretation of the causes , conditions , and results of the American Civil War .

		For this task he certainly has some qualifica - tions , particularly on the philosophical side , since we are told that he has already exhibited his views in twenty-six published volumes , of which nine were on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, Homer , and
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, six on philosophy , three on kindergarten subjects , three on miscellaneous matters , and five were of poetry covering the field from '' Agamemnon 's Daughter '' to ``
Johnny Appleseed	PERSON	's Rhymes . ''

		Now with his twenty - seventh volume Mr.
Snider	PERSON	enters the his - torical field .

		It must be said that he follows no old paths , but breaks a road for himself .

		He begins with the
Kansas	LOCATION	troubles in
1855	DATE	, and traces sec - tional controversies down to the surrender of Lee .

		He uses much philosophical jargon , has much to say about Folk Soul , World Spirit , Spirit of the Age , Conscience , etc. , all of which , and much else , he writes with capital letters .

		Everywhere is evi - dence of wide acquaintance with the classics , but one searches in vain for signs of superior historical knowledge .

		Clearly he knows much more about the Peloponnesian War than he does about the American Civil War .

		The entire philosophical structure is based on a weak foundation of facts .

		However , valueless as much of this work is , there are here and there some keen observations , evidently based on personal experience , in regard to conditions in the West before the Civil War , especially with reference to the Western attitude toward slavery and negroes , to the Western leaders , and the
Kansas	LOCATION	emigrants .

		Some suggestive points are brought out relative to the influence of abstract ideas in the sectional con - troversy and to the immense power of the public press .

Japan	LOCATION	, after a thousand years of intellectual life , has produced very little in the field of pure philosophy which is likely to win the respect of the world .

		Her ancients and classics are in
India	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	; her genius is in their selection and assimi - lation .

		Dr.
George William Knox	PERSON	, in his scholarly philosophical work on `` The Spirit of the Orient '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , gives four chapters to the discussion of what the Japanese call the '' treasure lands '' --
India	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	, and two to '' the great borrowing nation , ''
Nippon	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a final essay upon the New World , in which he interprets the significance of the victory of
Japan	LOCATION	, he sees no `` yellow peril '' or any likeli - hood of
Japan	LOCATION	wanting to make more war .

		He knows that the Japanese are a very young people , and sees in them an unconquerable determination to be both scientific and free .

		He can not discern that
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 329 the Chinese are ever likely to conquer anybody , or that they even have the desire to do so .

		He sums up his thinking by showing us how we can teach the East by showing them the value of personality .

		As action and reaction are equal , he predicts that the old Asiatics are yet to lead us away from our absorption in the things of sense , and to introduce new elements into our life and thought .

		The su - preme conflict of the coming centuries , -- rather , we may say , the progress that will result in recon - ciliation and unity , -- will be in finding the balance between East and
West	LOCATION	.

		In the Orient , the politi - cal organism is supreme ; in the Occident it is the individual .

		From the union of East and West shall come forth the higher and better humanity , and the new world in which peace and truth abide .

		The recreations P ^ of essor
Simon Newcomb	ORGANIZATION	is gener -
0	DATE	/ o veteran ally conceded to be one of the f ore - attronomer .

		most astronomers of the world , and thus one of its leading men of science .

		His intel - lectual interests cover a wide range , and now in the ripeness of years he writes much and admirably upon a variety of topics .

		His latest work , '' Sidelights on Astronomy '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- consists of a collection of twenty-one essays and addresses most of which origfinally appeared in the pages of popular maga - zines , and are now revised for appearance in this more permanent form .

		Two-thirds of them are on astronomical themes , and several of these touch upon the great problem of the structure and extent of the universe of stars by which we are surrounded .

		Among the non-astronomical chapters are those entitled '' The Fairyland of Geometry , '' '' Can We : Make It Rain ? ''

		and `` The Outlook for the Flying - Machine . ''

		It goes without saying that
Professor Newcomb	ORGANIZATION	treats all these subjects in an Uluminating way .

		His '' geometrical fairyland '' is space of f our dimensions , in which a football might be turned in - side out without tearing it ; a man turning a somer - sault in such space would find every part of his body exchanged -- right for left , and vice versa , when he resumed his original upright position .

		Years of agpricultural prosperity have driven the rain-maker from the public eye , so that the author 's contention that explosions can not produce rain will fall upon listless ears .

		In opposition to the hopes of various enthusiastic experimenters that a successful flying - machine will at last be evolved , our author firmly believes that no possible combination of structural materials , macliinery , and forces now known , can render aerial navigation practicable .

		TTie ttren uous ezUtence of invalidism .

		An eloquent plea against limiting the bestowal of college aid to the physi - cally robust is foimd in Mrs. Na - thaniel
Southgate Shaler	PERSON	's book , `` The Masters of Fate '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Her opening paragraph refers to the now well-known
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	proposal to make this limitation ; and then follow , grouped in chapters according to their ailments , numerous examples of great men with puny bodies , all illustrating the book 's sub-title , '' the power of the will '' to combat physical infirmity .

		Curiously enough , and sadlj enough , while the book was in the printers * hands Professor
Shaler	PERSON	, himself one of the noblest proofs of this will-power to hold the suffering body to its task , succumbed at last to an attack of pneumonia .

		To his memory his wife has added a supplementary chapter , the freshest and best in the book .

		The tone of the work as a whole is a little suggestive of the excellent Dr. SmUes 's '' Self-Help , '' being a some - what similar combination of biography and anecdote , with here and there a timely pointing of the moral .

		In classifying her illustrious invalids , the author 's inclusion of Napoleon among the epileptics , even as a historically doubtful example of that malady , is likely to give many readers a little start of surprise .

		In the footnotes credit is given to the standard bio - graphies consulted .

		For the details of Laura
Bridg	PERSON	- man 's life the writer appears for some unknown reason not to have drawn on the latest and best bio - gi'aphy of her , that prepared by two of Dr.
Howe	PERSON	's daughters .

		Mrs.
Shaler	PERSON	's book should give chronic invalids renewed courage , and should help them to resist the disheartening downpull of bodily weakness and decay .

		Epueopaiian ^ X ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ch the Rt Rev. Henry bishops and
Codman Potter	ORGANIZATION	, Bishop of
New York	LOCATION	, archbishops .

		would write could not fail of inter - est to a large number of readers .

		Nevertheless , his '' Reminiscences of Bishops and Archbishops '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- fails to gratify the expectations created by its title or to fulfil the promises of its preface .

		One of the causes of disappointment is that out of the hundred or more Bishops of the
Protestant Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	in this country with whom he was associated as Secretary of tlie
House of Bishops	ORGANIZATION	, all of them more or less interesting characters , he has selected but ten ; and of these he presents formal biographies rather than personal reminiscences .

		Another cause of disappointment is that so much of the matter used in these ten sketches is derived from other sources and is not of the nature of the personal reminiscences of the Bishop whose name appears on the title-page of the book .

		FuUy a third of the matter comprised in the ten biographies is quoted .

		Still , the first ten chapters of the book are a valuable biographical con - tribution to the history of the
American Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	, made all the more valuable by the accom - panying portraits .

		And the concluding chapter , '' Recollections of Three Archbishops , '' compensates for the disappointment felt in the rest of the book .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Four volumes , the seventh to the tenth , are added to the handsome ``
Gettysburg	LOCATION	'' edition of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	's complete works , published by the
Francis	PERSON	D.
Tandy Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have recently described this work , and need only indicate its progress and the special features of these new volumes .

		They include
Lincoln	LOCATION	's writings and telegrams during nearly the whole of the 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, war , from
September , 1861	DATE	, to
February , 1865	DATE	, the period of his greatest growth and greatest ser \ ` ice , revealing to us in his own words the breadth of his statesmanship and the greatness of his manliood .

		The addresses and tributes included in these voUmies are by
Robert G. IngersoU	PERSON	,
George Bancroft	PERSON	,
Charles Sumner	PERSON	, and
Henry Ward Beecher	PERSON	, and are exceedingly valuable as contemporary judgments on Lincoln .

		They contain also the usual fine portraits of him and those asso - ciated with him , and among the poems the well-known '' Punch '' poem attributed to
Tom Taylor	PERSON	.

		These vol - iimes confirm and strengthen the good opinion of this edition that we have already expressed .

		A happy inspiration has added a volume of '' Fifty Shakspere Songs '' to the '' Musicians Library , '' pub - lished by the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The contents are grouped as follows : Songs mentioned by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	in his plays .

		Songs possibly sung in the original per - formances , Settings composed since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time to the middle of the nineteenth century , and Recent Settings .

		The third group includes two by
Purcell	PERSON	, three by
Arne	PERSON	, and two of Schubert 's most heavenly lyrics .

		In the fourth group we find represented a num - Iber of the most promising of our younger writers .

		The editor of the collection is Dr.
Charles Vincent	PERSON	, who supplies an introduction and notes .

		The Chandos por - trait is given for a frontispiece .

		Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	's '' The Standard Operas '' is reissued by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in an enlarged and revised edition .

		The enlargement consists in the added descriptions of operas that have been produced of recent years , and in a generovis array of portrait illus - trations , representing famous singers in characteristic costumes .

		There are nearly a himdred of these por - traits , while among the later operas described are Mr.
Damrosch	PERSON	's `` Scarlet Letter , ''
Herr Goldmark	PERSON	's ''
Merlin	PERSON	, ''
Herr Humperdinck	PERSON	's '' Hansel imd
Gretel	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Pader	PERSON	- ewski 's '' Manru , ''
Herr Strauss	PERSON	's '' Feuersnoth , '' and Tschaikowsky 's ''
Eugen Ondgin	PERSON	. ''

		In its present form , this work is far more useful and attractive than it ever was before , and we predict for it a long lease of re - newed popularity . ''

		The International Library '' of works devoted to the movement for peace and arbitration is slowly assuming substantial dimensions .

		There are seven volumes now published at what is practically cost price , and no little good may reasonably be anticipated from their circula - tion .

		The seventh volume , just added to the list , is a treatise on '' The Moral Damage of War , '' by the Rev.
Walter Walsh	PERSON	, of
Dundee	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a new work in twelve chapters , each of which discusses some special aspect of the moral damage of war .

		Thus , the effects of war upon the soldier , the politician , the preacher , the mis - sionary , and many other types of men , are successively considered , a matter of treatment which results in a terrific indictment , for every count of which the author cites chapter and verse .

		The work is published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	for
the International Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The appearance , within little more than a year , of four volumes of selections from Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poems appears to be symptomatic of the growth of that gen - eral recognition which has hitherto been withheld from his work .

		The anthology made by Dr.
Payne	PERSON	for the `` Belles Lettres '' series of
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and published last year , is now followed by three other selections .

		The first of them , made by Dr.
Arthur Beatty	PERSON	for the Messrs.
Crowell	PERSON	, illustrates what is pro- verbially known as the sincerest form of flattery .

		In selection , grouping , and annotation , it follows the ex - ample of the '' Belles Lettres '' volume rather more closely than the ethics of this sort of book-making wiU justify .

		-- The volume called `` Anactoria and Other Lyrical Poems , '' published by Mr.
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	, is a pretty booklet containing fifteen pieces only .

		One or two of the selections are unexpected , but all are good poetry .

		-- Of the '' Selected Lyrical Poems , '' pub - lished by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, we must say emphatically that the title is a misnomer .

		The volume is not a selection at all , but a complete reprint of the first volume of '' Poems and Ballads , '' with thirteen other poems chosen in accordance with no imaginable principle of taste and tacked on at the end .

		There may be rhyme to this volume , but there is no reason employed in its construction .

		Notes .

		A fourth edition , revised and extended , of Dr.
C. T. Stockwell	PERSON	's suggestive essay on `` The Evolution of Immortality '' has recently been published by the
James H. West Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The Riverside Press Editions of '' The Song of Roland '' and `` The Idylls of Theocritus '' have been delayed from various causes , we are informed , but are now promised for publication early in
December	DATE	; so that book-lovers who are accustomed to choosing their Christmas gifts from these choice editions are not likely to be disappointed this year .

		The Memoirs of the late Chancellor Prince
von Hohenlohe	PERSON	, which seem to have been the literary sensa - tion of the year in
Germany	LOCATION	, will be published in this country at an early date by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The late Chancellor is said to have revealed very frankly the inside history of the
Kaiser	PERSON	's dismissal of
Bismarck	LOCATION	, and other secrets of German diplomatic and political history .

		The Life of Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	,
K. C. B.	PERSON	, by Dr.
Frederick William Maitland	PERSON	, about which we recently had something to say , is announced among the
Novem	DATE	- ber publications of Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons , who are the American publishers of
Stephen	PERSON	's works .

		Dr.
Maitland	PERSON	was a close personal friend of Sir
Leslie	PERSON	and his family , and is at present
Downing Professor of Law	ORGANIZATION	at
Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Another important bird book is aimomiced by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who have concluded arrangements with Dr.
Frank H. Knowlton	PERSON	, President of the
Biologi	PERSON	- cal Society of
Washington	LOCATION	, for a volume on '' Birds of the World , '' edited by
Robert Ridgway	PERSON	, Curator of Birds in the
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	.

		This book will appear in the new '' American Nature Series , '' recently inaugu - rated by Dr.
C. William Beebe	PERSON	's '' The Bird . ''

		The hundredth anniversai-y of the birth of
Longfellow	LOCATION	will occur
February 27	DATE	next , and will be made the occa - sion of a special celebration at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, the poet 's home .

		All the schools of the city will take part , and among the speakers at the public exercises will be Mr. Ho wells .

		President
Eliot	PERSON	, Colonel
Higguison	PERSON	, and Profes - sor
Norton	PERSON	.

		In commemoration of this interesting event a special
Longfellow	LOCATION	medal , in bronze , will be prepared , of a beautifiU and appropriate design , and will be offered to a limited number of subscribers at the price of
ten dollars	MONEY	each , which may be sent to Mr.

G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		This book , issued in
Italy	LOCATION	under the title of
Piccolo Mondo Antico	ORGANIZATION	, will be published in the English and American editions as '' The Patriot . ''

		It will be followed shortly by the authorized edition of the second story in the Trilogy ,

		A limited reprint of
Viscount Wolseley	PERSON	's sketch of General Lee , originally published in '' MacmUlan 's Magazine '' for
March , 1887	DATE	, has been issued by Mr.

Rochester	LOCATION	.

		It will be recalled that
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	met Lee in
1862	DATE	, and spoke later of him in these strong terms : '' I have met many of the great men of my time , but Lee alone impressed me with the feeling that I was in the presence of a man who was cast in a grander mould , and made of different and finer metal than all other men . ''

		The monumental '' History of English Literature '' in fourteen royal octaro volumes which the
Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	has recently imdertaken , will be published in this country by Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		In scale and plan it will more or less resemble the '' Cam - bridge Modem History . ''

		It will embrace the whole course of English literature from
Beowulf	LOCATION	to the end of the Victorian age .

		The action of foreign influences and the part taken by secondary writers m successive lit - erary movements will receive a larger share of attention than is possible in shorter histories , in which lesser writers are apt to be overshadowed by a few great names .

		Each volume will contain a sufficient bibliog - raphy .

		The history will be edited by Dr.
A. W. Ward	PERSON	, Master of Peterhouse , and Mr.
A. R. Waller	PERSON	.

		We do not often receive books bearing
Khartoum	LOCATION	as an imprint , and this fact alone makes somewhat note - worthy '' The Second Report of the
Wellcome Research Laboratories	ORGANIZATION	at the
Gordon Memorial College	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The volume -LRB- a quarto , with many illustrations -RRB- is edited by Dr.
Andrew Balfour	PERSON	, and published by the
Department of Education of the Sudan Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		The most im - portant of the papers included relate to studies of mos - quitoes and other insect pests .

		There is also an inves - tigation of the disease called trypanosomiasis , and a report from the chemical laboratory upon such varied subjects as the Nile waters , the nulk supply of
Khartoum	LOCATION	, `` Gum Arabic , '' and the
Nyam Nyam	ORGANIZATION	arrow poison .

		Judg ^ g from the rich material here offered , the Laboratories seem to be abundantly justifying their existence .

		Since the publication by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of '' The Chief American Poets , '' edited by Pro- fessor Curtis Hidden Page , the publishers have been planning for the preparation of a series of volumes , to be entitled '' The Chief Poets Series , '' which shall con - tain all the best work of the principal poets and drama - tists of different epochs ; and they now announce for early publication the following volumes : '' The Chief Elizabethan Dramatists '' -LRB- except Shakespeare -RRB- to the Close of the Theatres , edited by Professor

		THIS book belongs to that elusive , delicate class that have interpreted with a rare understanding the soul of a romantic child .

		It tells of the love of a Httle boy for a beautiful lady w ^ hom he first sees reflected in a stained glass window in church , while he is struggling desperately to keep awake during a long sermon . ''

		He found that the lady was sitting on a line with his view of his favorite window , that her gown was of a dark rose velvet , which looked like that worn by the window lady , and that her face fitted as nearly as possible over the one in the window Her sweet face , of which he could see exactly one-half , again covered the pictured face , and he saw now that her soft , rose velvet gown had ever so little of a dull gold trimming on it , and so had the border of the gown on the Mother in the window . ''

		The two come to know and love each other .

		The little boy visits the lady often , and they have long serious talks about flowers and fairies .

		They invent won - derful games , and play for hours together , and finally , to his great happiness , the little boy goes to live with the beautiful Stained Glass Lady . '

		MORES !

		It is with something more than Ciceronian in - dignation that the morals of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' are now being denoimced by the ahnost unani - mous voice of the publishing and bookselling interests of the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	.

		For some months past a fierce conflict -LRB- not of words only -RRB- has been raging in
England	LOCATION	, aroused by the enterprise of '' The Thunderer '' in seeking to enlarge its circtdation by offering its subscribers alluring opportunities for the purchase of new books at reduced prices .

		Since not only the newspapers and trade journals , but the authors as well , have taken a hand in the controversy , it is given an unwonted zest , and the famous newspaper which has provoked it is made the target of bolts quite as Jovian as those of which it has long had the traditional monopoly .

		At our distance from the scene of action , it is not altogether easy to view the line of battle , or to appreciate the strategic moves made by the respective forces ; but the situation is clear enough in its general outline , and of enough interest to readers everywhere to warrant dis - cussion by the American outsider .

		The struggle , moreover , involves a question which has arisen in some form in almost every country of literary importance , and finds its American coimterpart in the efforts of our own publishers to establish a fixed uniform price for net publications , and to preserve the bookseller from the extinction with which he is menaced by the department store .

		In its American phase , we have repeat - 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	; edly discussed the question in these columns , and trust that we have left no doubt in the reader 's mind that our sympathies are with the legitimate seller of books .

		There is no doubt in our mind that this is a case in which what is sometimes termed an '' agreement in restraint of trade , '' despite the sinister monopolistic asso - ciations of the expression , is necessary for the true interests of intellectual prosperity .

		The analogous case presented by the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' and its assailants may be briefly stated .

		That venerable three-penny organ of conserva - tive opinion , seeing itself of late years greatly outdistanced in circulation by the penny press , and finding its traditional methods inadequate to cope with the enterprise of sensation monger - ing journalism conducted upon the American plan , has been casting about for devices where - by to meet the new competition .

		When certain wily Americans appeared upon the scene with a plan for a combination offer of the '' Times '' and the '' Encyclopaedia Britannica , '' its pro- prietors seized the opportunity , launched the enterprise , and , by dint of an unprecedented campaign of advertising , gained many subscrib - ers and much profit .

		Having once doffed the robe of journalistic dignity , these same pub - lishers were ready for another scheme , which the same wily
Yankees	ORGANIZATION	were prompt to supply .

		It took the form of the '' Times Book Club , '' an organization whereby subscribers were to have the right to borrow new books , and , if they liked , to buy them in a practically unsoiled con - dition at bargain prices .

		This is the scheme which has aroused the angry passions now rife among English publishers and dealers , and pre - cipitated the new '' battle of the books '' which has become a matter of such absorbing interest .

		For a time the implications of the scheme were not fully apparent .

		The publishers began to receive large orders from this unexpected quarter , were willing to accord the `` Times '' a `` most favored nation '' treatment in the matter of terms , and even accepted , without making too wry a face , the condition of buying from the newspaper a certain amount of advertising -- a percentage based upon the book-orders -- which ' really amounted to so much additional discount on the sales .

		But presently the face of the matter changed .

		It was discovered that the members of the Times ' Book Club -- that is , subscribers to the number of about eighty thousand -- were purchasing the latest publica - tions within a few weeks of their issue , and at prices that practically ignored the question of profit .

		These subscribers , moreover , were evi - dently buying books for their friends also ; the bookshops were deserted , and the publishers came to realize that their sales to the '' Times '' were being made at the expense of more profit - able sales to other middlemen .

		Thereupon war was declared .

		The Zauherlehrling had turned on the water , and now frantically sought to turn it off .

		The proper form of incantation has not yet been found , but dismay lias at least given place to hope , and united action against the common enemy is doing something to restore confidence to the hearts of authors , publishers , and booksellers .

		That both publishers and booksellers are united m their opposition to the
Times ' Book Club	ORGANIZATION	is evident from the action taken by their official organizations .

		The publishers made the modest request that the `` Times '' should not resort to undercutting during a period of six months from the date of a book 's appearance .

		This was flatly refused , and the possibility of a modus vivendi was ended .

		Thereupon the publishers withdrew their advertisements from the paper , and refused to sell it their books upon trade terms .

		The '' Times '' retorted by declaring a boycott on the obstinate publishers , and went so far as to urge its readers not to buy any of the publications of a specified list of famous houses -- a list headed by the name of the Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		Here the matter now stands , with the odds decidedly against the '' Times , '' as that journal practically admits .

		If it can not buy books at trade prices , the jig is up , and it is now cb ` iven to the desperate resort of an appeal to prejudice after the fashion of the yellowest of the American newspapers .

		The
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' and the New York '' Journal '' make strange bedfellows , but to this association they have been brought , and both of them put forth the same disingenuous plea against a pre - tended monopoly in the interest of a plan which , rightly considered , woidd prove it a monopoly of the most vicious sort .

		The argument that pub - lishers make a profit of eight hmidred per cent on their wares is not likely to impose upon many readers ; it is surprismg that the constitu - ency of the '' Times '' should include any readers capable of being misled by so palpable an ab - surdity .

		All that the publishers need to do at present is to '' sit tight , '' and , as one of them expresses it , `` their position is as impregnable as
Wellington	LOCATION	's was behind the lines of Torres Vedras . ''

		As for the authors , they are for the most part quick to perceive the idtimate consequences of such a bookselling monopoly as the `` Times ' *
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DTAT .

		381 would like to establish .

		It would work a greater injury to them than residted from the old * ' cir - culating library '' system which they succeeded in overthrovsing a few years ago .

		With fresh memories of one old man of the sea , they are not likely soon to fall into the clutches of another .

		^ Ir .

		Kipling sees the point clearly enough , and states it with his wonted bluntness .

		`` As for the ' Times 's ' claim to benefit the public by supplying it with cheap literature , it offers no guaran - tee that prices once lowered to secure control of a market may not be raised when that market is secure ; nor is the record of other trusts reassuring on this head . ''

		The end seems simple enough .

		The author , cut off from his bookseller , who is his distributing agent , must lie absolutely at the mercy of the ' Times . '

		So the public will have exchanged the right of reading at fixed prices whatever they wish to read for the pri ^ - ilege of buying at whatever price the ' Times ' may appoint pre - cisely whatever the ' Times , ' in its judgment , allows to reach them . ''

		This arrangement may pay the ' Times , ' but it seems to be on the way to depriving literature , the author , and the public of a certain amoimt of fi-eedom . ''

		Not only have many authors as individuals expressed themselves in similar terms , but the
Societj ' of Authors	ORGANIZATION	has also stated its position in a series of emphatic resolutions .

		The authors ' point of view is admirably summed up by -RSB- Mr.
G. Herbert Thring	PERSON	, secretary of the Society , in the following language : '' If the methods of the Club be allowed to continue , they will spread .

		Imitators wiU arise .

		The author will be no longer the partner able to demand his fair share .

		He will be at the mercy of a few large ♦ concerns ' which can take his books at their own price or refuse to take them imless he accepts it , whose sole interest is cheap buj-ing and quick ' scrapping , ' whose interest in literature is limited to the question how they can best make the buying and selling of books a useful subsidi - ary means of promoting the yield of their advertise - ments , the popidarity of their aerated water , or the vogue of their toilet soap .

		Where lies the advantage to the author , either to his pride or to his pocket ?

		It would be contran , - to general opinion and experience to suppose that in the long nm the public would find their benefit in a state of things savouring far more strongly of monopoly than the present organizations either of publishers or of booksellers or of authors -- a state of things at least threatening a despotic control of the lit - erary profession and of the book trade by a small group of persons , firms , or companies , whose methods and objects alike are totally alien from literature , from any desire to promote the production and appreciation of good books . ''

		This is a nutshell form of the argument for prices fixed by agreement .

		Books are more than merchandise , and the midtiplication of book - stores , even if it means an increased cost of handling , is essential to the interests of culture .

		It does not greatly matter whether there are few or many centres for the distribution of soap or shoes or sausages , but it matters much whether there are few or many bookstores in a great city , whether a small town has or has not such an establishment .

		Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	notes that there were once some twelve hundred book-shops in and about
London	LOCATION	, whereas there are now only an eighth of that number .

		It would be extremely mifortunate should the figures of their census be still further reduced , no matter how plausible the argument for economy by which the reduction were defended .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The value of sympathy in uteraky criticism is urged anew , with an emphasis worthy of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	himself , in an able review of recent critical literature in the current ''
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Review . ''

		In the course of the article , Mr.
George Brandes	PERSON	receives some rather hard knocks .

		While the writer admits that '' no other critic could bring more knowledge , a clearer dis - cernment of finer distinctions , a more discriminating and resolute grasp of characteristic qualities , a more many-sided intellectual culture to his task , '' he at the same time contends that no other critic could bring '' a more solidly unsympathetic moral aloofness from the individual ideals , sentiments , and emotions of the authors he reviews ... He exposes without ruth the littlenesses of the great .

		His strictures are warrantable .

		But dis - paragement of the immortals by dispraise of their works of inferior merit , however warrantable , is to lower the estate of the whole art of criticism ... To dem - onstrate the base concomitants of the soil where gems lie embedded , to the obscuring of the vital light - giving properties of those gems , is to render ill service to the memory of those whom death has dispensed from all dependence on opinion , and to mankind at large ... It is , moreover , when all is said and done , the interpre - tation of the stars , not of the ` unpurpled vapours , ' which leads the worlS ^ errant on the path of truth . ''

		All this is curiously in accord with some things that Mr.
Brandes	PERSON	, in his recent autobiography , has said , and has quoted from others , about himself .

		• • • Literature of the departmevt store is the latest thing to emanate from
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The salesmen and sales - women of a large department store in that literary centre write , edit , and publish a monthly review whose pvirpose is to promote '' cultural education '' -- thus distinguish - ing , it seems , between mere business training and that of a finer and more intellectual character .

		Schools and colleges have for some time offered commercial courses ; and now we have a commercial house , or rather its employees , offering a course in literary training .

		Yet the business aspect of the matter is not lost sight of : one can sell goods all the better , it seems , for a little `` cultural education . ''

		As the writer of the leading article puts it , `` Application to study gives one self - confidence through ability to concentrate one 's mind on whatever matter may arise , in addressing people under conditions where a wavering manner would lose the case . ''

		And further , '' By reading standard literature we unconsciously acquire the use of good English and the ability to paint mind pictures , both of which are strong factors in impressing the superior merits of our business upon the public , the first being also necessary 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, in our dealings with manufacturers , because good En - glish is impressive and presents arguments and needs in a most effective manner . ''

		A literary magazine issuing from a dry-goods emporium is a striking and not unpleasing phenomenon in the world of letters and of commerce .

		• • • The seventieth birthday of two literary nota - bles , Mr.
Henry M. Alden	PERSON	and Mr.
T. B. Aldrich	PERSON	, fall - ing on the eleventh of
November	DATE	, and the presence of the Ponkapog poet at the
Franklm Square	LOCATION	party in honor of the
New York	LOCATION	editor , not only furnish a pleas - ing spectacle to the contemplative on-looker from afar , but may also serve to recall attention to the works and worth of these two literary veterans , both of them authors , and magazine editors as well .

		A selection from the poems of the `` enamored architect of airy rhyme , '' entitled '' A Book of Songs and Sonnets , '' is a timely and welcome issue from the Riverside Press .

		We hear of no re-issue of '' God in His World '' and '' A Study of Death , '' by Mr.
Alden	PERSON	, but these too will bear re-reading .

		It is many days now since Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	was editor of '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' but Mr.
Alden	PERSON	's skilful and faithful hand is still at the editorial helm of '' Har - per 's Magazine , '' whose course he has directed so long and well .

		■ • • Some interesting notes on the technique of poetry are contributed to the
November	DATE	'' Fortnightly Review '' by Mr.
Charles F. Keary	PERSON	.

		Rejecting the theory that poetry is merely translated prose , as
Camden	LOCATION	and
Ben Jonson	PERSON	professed to believe , Mr.
Keary	PERSON	main - tains that the poet thinks in lines , not in single words .

		Passion seeks utterance in phrases .

		Singing , it has been conjectured , preceded articulate speech , and the unit of song is not a single soxmd , but a musical phrase , which , in some sort of cadence and contrast of sound , must have been evoked by emotion before language was formed .

		Verse is neither an accident nor a choice nor a trick , nor a translation of prose , but a necessity for cer - tain modes of thought and feeling .

		The caesura Mr.
Keary	PERSON	makes to follow the stressed word in the line , and if there is more than one such word there is more than one csesura .

		Incidentally , the writer says that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's prose is often used for greater impres - siveness . ''

		It is certain , '' he writes , '' that Hamlet 's personality never shows itself more vividly than when he speaks in prose '' ; and he quotes in illustration from the very grave-digging scene which Sill -LRB- see '' The Prose of
Edward Rowland	PERSON	Sill '' -RRB- some years ago cited to prove the opposite .

		Sill declares that when Hamlet speaks prose '' there is no deep feeling or earnestness of purpose in what he says . ''

		Shy lock , according to Mr.
Keary	PERSON	, is `` never so tremendous as in his prose out - bursts '' -LRB- '' Hath not a Jew eyes ?

		Hath not a Jew hands ? ''

		etc. -RRB- ; while Sill maintains that the trivial business of every-day life is what gets itself expressed in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's prose .

		Each is partly right , partly wrong ; but Sill is probably supported by more examples .

		• • • The reading habits of our people are interest - ingly revealed by Mr.
Gustave Michaud	PERSON	in the
Novem	DATE	- ber '' Putnam 's Monthly . ''

		Statistics of book-circulation in public libraries tend to show that
New England	LOCATION	, as might have been expected , is far more given to reading than the rest of the country , and that of the New En - gland states
Massachusetts	LOCATION	stands well in the lead , with
Connecticut	LOCATION	second and
New Hampshire	LOCATION	third .

		The fourth place is held , not by an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	state , but by
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia ; after which come , in order ,
Vermont	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	,
Rhode Island	LOCATION	,
Montana	LOCATION	,
Delaware	LOCATION	, the
District of Columbia	LOCATION	,
Cplorado	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	, and
Illinois	LOCATION	.

		At the other end of the scale the list reads backward from
Florida	LOCATION	,
Mississippi	LOCATION	,
Ala	LOCATION	- bama , and
Arkansas	LOCATION	, through other Southern states , where the colored population greatly depresses the average .

		Gold-seekers , or other miners for wealth , ap - pear to bring up this average in the mineral regions .

		The British gold-mining colonies , too , are great book - consumers .

		The reading habit and visions of
Eldorado	LOCATION	-- do they go together ?

		One other significant fact :
New England	LOCATION	, which leads in book-reading , has also by far the highest birth-rate of geniiis .

		• • • French praise of an American author is found , in generous measure , in a 29-page review of '' The
House of Mirth	ORGANIZATION	, '' in the Revue des Deux Mondes of No - vember 1 .

		This very commendatory notice of Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	and her work is from the pen of Mme.
Blanc	PERSON	-LRB- `` Th .

		Bentzon '' -RRB- , who has already , notably in the case of Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	, expressed her appreciation of cur - rent American literature in the pages of the Revue .

		In Mme.
Blanc	PERSON	's opinion , Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	'' has written per - haps the best novel that has appeared this year in En - glish '' ; and further , '' Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	can write nothing that lacks distinction '' ; she is `` infinitely witty , '' her characters talk charmingly -LRB- causent a ravir -RRB- , and `` we know of no dialogues better carried tlirough than hers . ''

		This critic calls '' The House of Mirth '' as interesting and as pitiless a novel , at one end of the world and at one extremity of the social ladder , as Zola 's L'Assommoir at the other . ''

		The chief difference is that its author has the marvellous gift of saying everything tactfully , in precise language , which , without avoiding anything , never offends against modesty . ''

Colorado College	ORGANIZATION	, in regard to a note which he finds in the vol - ume '' From a College Window , '' by Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, pub - lished by our house .

		Professor
Parsons	PERSON	takes the ground that to utilize in a work of literature a note so worded as to constitute an advertisement of another book , is bad form ; and that nothing in the shape of an advei 't isement ought to be connected with the text of a work of literature .

		We find ourselves fully in accord with this position .

		The publishers are , of course , responsible for the text of any volume issued with their imprint .

		It may be in order to explain , however , that this particular note was added , while the work was going through the press , by the hand of an over-zealous proofreader ; and until our attention was called to the matter through The Dial , we had in fact no knowledge that any such note had been inserted .

		Instructions have been given for the cancelling of this note before the printing of another edition of the Benson volume .

		1906 -RSB- , THE DIAL 383 g ; ^ t gcto goohs .

		A Distinguished Holiday Art-book .

		* The perfecting of photo-mechanical processes for reproducing drawings has made possible a class of books for which there is reason to be grateful .

		Ownership of original works by ac - knowletlged masters of the brush and pencil is necessarily the privilege of the few .

		Exhibited in art musevmis and public galleries they may be viewe < l by the many , but under conditions that make long looking a weariness to the flesh , absorjjtion in the joy of aesthetic contemplation soon giving way under the distraction of physi - cal discomfort .

		And long looking is for most people the only | -RRB- athway to assimilation .

		At best a public collection can impart but in rare instances , even to its frequenters , that sense of intimate personal relation bet ^ veen the observer and the things observetl through which alone art becomes a part of life and a tonic to the sold .

		For this , nothing else can take the place of the clase dady association which the true art - lover feels to be vital to his spiritual well-being .

		Such lx -RRB- oks as • ' The Drawings of Jean Francois Millet ' '' minister directly to this need by briugiug examples of the work of a great master within the reach of people of moderate means .

		Fifty of this artist 's drawings , repro - duced in photo-lithography by the
Hentschel	PERSON	- colortyjje process , with an introductory essay by
Leonce Beuedite	PERSON	, make up a volume that can fitly be described as distinguished .

		The exam - ples given have been selected with the design of covering as wide a range as possible .

		They show well the method of the artist as applied to varying themes .

		Most of them are studies in crayon or charcoal for pictures afterward painted in oil .

		One , the chaiining sketch entitled '' The River . ''

		was done entirely with the brush .

		The majority are in simple black and white ; a few have slight touches of other hues .

		In one , the original study in colored chalks for '' The Angelus , '' the complete color-scheme is effect - ively indicated .

		Taken together , they form a fairly representative collection .

		Included among them are studies for such well-kno \ sTi paintings as '' The Gleaners '' -LRB- now in the
Louvre	LOCATION	-RRB- , the '' Charcoal Burner 's Hut , '' '' Going to the Fields . ''

		• • The Sower , '' • • The Mideteer , '' '' The New-liom Calf , * ' '' Shepherdess and Flock at • The DRAwrsGS of Jeax Francois Miixet .

		the Edge of the Forest , '' and '' The Vine Dres - ser . ''

		It woidd have been well had the sizes and the whereabouts of the originals been indicated .

		In passing , it may be remarked that these drawings are not , as stated on the title-page , ** of '' Millet , but are by him .

		This locution is becoming almost as common as the dreadful '' different to '' that mars the workmanship of so many English writers .

		It may Ije taken as a general rule that an artist 's sketches and studies often exhibit more force than his finished pictures .

		However skil - ful the replication , some loss is inevitable .

		Of the truth of this .

		Millets works afford a con - spicuous example .

		It is to his drawings rather than his pictures that we must look for that most precious quality , `` the instant magic of the realizing hand , '' as it has been aptly termed .

		These sketches and studies serve also to empha - size the truth -- a truth imperfectly realized by most of our modem artists -- that the basis of all art that is worthy of the name Ls composition .

		In the last analysis , the secret of Millet 's power to charm avlQ be found to lie in the skill with which he brought all the elements of his designs into harmonic unity .

		The extreme simplicity of many of them gives at first sight the impres - sion that they afforded no opportunity - for the exercise of such refinement .

		As a matter of fact , the niceties of composition are in inverse pro- portion to its complexity : the simplest is the most exacting , and calls for the truest feeling .

		Few artists of modem times have been more written and talked about than
Jean Fran9ois Millet	PERSON	.

		The story of his life is almost a house - hold woi-d .

		AVho does not know about his boy - hood on his father 's farm at Gruchy : of the gentle home-life in which he was there rearetl ; of the years of bitter struggle in
Paris	LOCATION	; of his retirement to Barbizon , and his devotion thence - forth to rustic themes : of the greatness and tenderness of his heart ; of his pathetic battle with poverty ; of the indifference of the public during his lifetime and the fame he has since achieved ?

		His devotion in his later years to the expression of what he use < l to call '' ■ la vie de Vensemble '' -- the life of the universe as a whole , -- and the extraordinary degree in which his ai-t was made the vehicle of his thought , has causetl attention to be centred upon its sub - jective qualities almost to the exclusion of its aesthetic side .

		It is not strange that it should be so .

		The more cai-efully his draA ^ dngs are studied the more apparent is it that technique was nothing to him except as a means to an end .

		But also will it be perceived that to make us 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, feel with him the dignity of human labor and man 's relation to the planet he inhabits , there had to be the master 's sensitiveness to beauty of line , and the unerring sense of harmonic propor - tion by which he ordered his darks and lights , his masses and vacant spaces .

		Otherwise we should have had sermons only , not works of art .

		There would be no need of calling attention to this so particularly were it not so commonly overlooked .

		Unlike the human message em - bodied in the artist 's work , it does not insist upon recognition , nor does it appeal to such a wide audience .

		For upon their subjective side
Millet	ORGANIZATION	's compositions touch us all .

		We must , if we are not hopelessly devoid of all sympathy with human emotion , feel the reverent tender - ness in such drawings as `` The Knitting Les - son , '' the `` Young Mother Nursing her Baby , '' and the '' Almsgiving '' -- to name a few of those reproduced in the volume under consideration .

		And who can fail to be affected by the charm of the masterly '' Shepherdess and Flock at the Edge of the Forest , '' or the realism , impressive despite its sketchy treatment , of the '' Charcoal Burner 's Hut '' in winter ?

		The tone values of the original drawings and the quality of the artist 's line have been excep - tionally well preserved in the reproductions before us .

		More than this can hardly be asked ; but in calling them .

		Jacairnlles a claim is made that is not strictly accurate , as the shiny surface of the paper upon which they are printed con - stitutes a substantial difference in the result .

		Doubtless , in selecting a paper having this un - pleasant characteristic the publishers were actu - ated by the desire to obviate as far as possible the chief shortcoming in all mechanical repro - ductions .

		The tendency is to modify both the lights and darks , with the result of taking away some of the vivacity , the '' life , '' of the draw - ing .

		The difficulty is the greater when , as in the case of
Millet	LOCATION	, the drawings were made without any thought of their suitability for '' processing . ''

		Our modern illustrators , in an endeavor to overcome this tendency , force their work into an abnormal key by greatly intensify - ing both the high lights and the deep shadows .

		In his admirable introductory essay , Mr.
Benedite	PERSON	reviews the leading events in
Millet	LOCATION	's life-history .

		With fine appreciation , the excep - tional figure of the master is set before the reader , special attention being given to his re - lation to the ideals current in his day .

		Thus , he shows how it was that the semi-recluse who held himself aloof from the movement with which his name is inevitably associated -- the man who always painted resignation , never re - volt , and who asserted that he liad '' never dreamt of pleading a cause of any sort '' -- was the forerunner and in a sense the prophet of the realists .

		Biographies ix Holiday Fokm .

		* In a group of handsomely illustrated bio - graphies , individual and collective , that await review , the ladies , of various sorts and condi - tions , and of reputations spotless and otherwise , are in an overwhelming majority .

		Thus we find -- curious conjunction I -- George Eliot rubbing - elbows with
Lady Hamilton	PERSON	,
Hortense Mancini	PERSON	, the `` wanton
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	, '' and numerous others of not unblemished fame .

		Some readers may be so cruel as to see a certain significance in bracket - ing with these notorious offenders the great novelist who dared to violate English marriage law and custom .

		But in this instance the asso - ciation is purely one of chance , not of design .

		While many of the women treated of in these works are not characters that the lover of bio - graphy is warmly interested m , yet their doings and misdoings are discreetly handled , and as their names are of more or less historic import - ance we must not let our prudery get the better of us .

		The merit of the volumes as handsome holiday publications is considerable , but space is lacking for anything like detailed criticism of the narrative matter accompanying the abun - dant and on the whole excellent illustrations .

		In taking up the books , one by one , we give the precedence not to the ladies this time , but to the lamented stage favorite .

		THE DIAL 38S is sure to be skilfully executed .

		This latest printing of ^ Ir .


Fitzgerald	PERSON	's work is , he tells us , '' practically the third Issue .

		It was written under
Irving	PERSON	's hearty encouragement , and all the earlier sheets were revisetl and corrected by him .

		... It has been thoroughly revised -- largre additions have been made which cover a period of some ten years , and bring the work down to his lamented death . ''

		Greater atten - tion is given to the man than to the actor , and a very winning personality he is made to appear .

		In one of the passages devotetl more especially to professional matters , some comparison is drawn between
Irving	PERSON	and Booth , as they ap - jjeared together at the Lyceum in
1881	DATE	; and the honors are emphatically given to the host , the actor who trod his own boartls , rather than to the \ Tsitor amid strange surroundings .

		It is more than implied , too , that Booth failetl to requite his host 's hospitality when the English actor \ nsitetl
America	LOCATION	.

		Prejudices in his friend 's favor are excusable in the author , and so are dramatic criticisms with which the reader can - not always agree .

		This volume can not compete in wealth of dttaU with Mr.
Bram Stoker	PERSON	's longer work already noticed in these pages ; but it can well supplement it , and perhaps the two can on some points serve as a sort of check to each other .

		Both are written by friends of some thirty years standing .

		There is still room , how - ever , for a full critical account of Ir ^ ` ins : the actor .

		In one of his closing paragraphs ^ Ir .

		Fitzgerald laments -LRB- rather incoherently , it is true -RRB- that '' though some months have elapsed since his -LSB-
Irving	PERSON	's -RSB- death , the gi-eat actor 's name is scarcely mentioned .

		He seems , indeed , forgotten .

		For many a ' cheap ' celebrity , there are committees and subscriptions and memorials and statues ; but nothing of the kind has ever been suggestetl . ' ''

		Mr.
Fitzgerald	PERSON	justly prides himself on the number and excellence of the illustrations he has pro ^ ^ ded for this book from his ' • twenty huge folios ' '' of Irving pictures .

		The Rev.
Wdliam Mottram	PERSON	has collected into a book his series of articles on George Eliot originally contributed to '' The Leisure Hour , '' and four new chapters are added .

		First cousin , once removed , to
George Eliot	PERSON	, he wTites with the authority of near kinship and familiar asso - ciation .

		From an unpublished autobiography of
Seth Bede	PERSON	-LRB-
Samuel Evans	PERSON	-RRB- and a brief pub - lishetl autobiography of
Dinah Morris	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- ^
Irs	ORGANIZATION	.


Samuel Evans	PERSON	-RRB- , the author reproduces some noteworthy passages .

		The original of jVIrs .

		Poyser he finds in the novelist 's mother , and of
Adam Bede	PERSON	in her father .

		With something : of a flourish , he gives us a chapter explaining and justifying her relations with
G. H. Lewes	PERSON	as if he were publishing new facts ; but he offers hardly anj ^ thing not already known to students of her life .

		As a whole , the book is written in a tone of alternate religious devotion and per - sonal panegyric that becomes tiresome to the less piously enthusiastic .

		The eighty-six portraits and illustrations are good process prints , and rival the text in interest .

		Especially is this true of a surprisingly atti * active fi-ontispiece portrait of
Georsre Eliot	ORGANIZATION	in her voungf womanhood . ''

		This is not a history , '' admits Mr.
Philip Gibbs	PERSON	, in prefacing his '' Men and Women of the French Revolution ' '' : and he proceeds to style it ' • rather , jserhaps , a psychological study of some of the actors in the great drama , so arranged , however , that the thread of narrative is not confusetl or lost . ''

		The text of this book , he frankly avows , ' • does not compare in interest with the illustrations .

		They are the excuse and the value of the volume .

		These contemporary ' French prints , mostly reproduced for the first time in this coimtry , are surprisingly inter - esting . ''

		In thus deviating from the beaten jjaths of history and giving rather free play to his own fancy in this '' psychological study , '' the author has produced a work more attractive in some respects than the formal chronicles of the periotl .

		As a handsome holiday book that may induce some to enter upon a more serious study of what the author rightly considers '' a period of inexhaustible interest , '' the work is of value .

		The numerous photogravnires are works of art .

		the quarto size of the page contributing not a little to their excellence .

		Of the many impor - tant characters whose portraits had to be omitted simply because some limit wa.s necessary , one notes especially the omission of
Charlotte Corday	LOCATION	and
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		In the annals of woman 's fraUt -RCB- - , -RSB- Mr.
W. R. H. Trowbridge	PERSON	's '' * ■ Court Beauties of Old White - hall '' will take no prominent place either for original research or for naughty piquancy of style .

		These '' Historiettes of the Restoration , '' as the sketches are called in a sub-title , give in readable form the stories of eight lovely butter - flies that fluttered about the radiance of ^ o ^ ` altl '' ^ most of them singeing : their wingfs more or less , and most of them also ending their days in ob - scurity if not in wretchedness .

		It is significant that , of these eight brief biographies , the ac - coimt of the
Comtesse de Gramont	ORGANIZATION	, `` la belle
Hamilton	PERSON	, '' the best woman of them all , is the shortest ; so much more eventful are the annals of \ ` ice than the colorless chronicles of virtue .

		386 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, The volume has thirty-two portraits , inchiding a fii ` st reproduction of the only extant likeness of
Armand	LOCATION	,
Comte de Guiche	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author speaks of this as engraved from the original ; but it is evidently a process print , and either a very poor one or from a blurred and faded painting ' , -- probably the latter .

		The chapters , in their order , treat of
Hortense Mancini	PERSON	,
Duchesse de Mazarin	ORGANIZATION	;
Barbara Villiers	PERSON	, Duchess of
Cleve	PERSON	- land ; '' la belle
Stuart	PERSON	, '' Duchess of
Richmond	LOCATION	; `` la belle
Hamilton	PERSON	, '' Comtesse de Gramont ; '' the lovely
Jennings	PERSON	, '' Duchess of Tyrconnel ; `` wanton
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	, ''
Anna Maria	PERSON	, Countess of
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	; '' Madame , ''
Henrietta	PERSON	, Duchess of
Orleans	LOCATION	; and
Louise de Keroual	PERSON	, Duchess of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	.

		The subject of the first chapter of the book just mentioned reappears as the leading char - acter in Mr.
H. Noel Williams	PERSON	's '' Five Fair Sisters . ' '


Hortense Mancini	PERSON	and her four sisters receive the honor of a 422-page history at the hands of this prolific author of French memoirs .

		Of these sisters , the eldest ,
Laure	PERSON	, who married the
Due de Mercoeur	ORGANIZATION	and became the mother of the
Due de Vendome	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- renowned in the Marl - borough wars -RRB- , appears to have been the only one of unchallenged virtue , being also the one of least personal beauty ; while Olympe ,
Marie	PERSON	, and
Hortense	PERSON	-- the three really meant when reference is made to
Mazarin	LOCATION	's nieces -- attained to European fame of an unenviable sort .

		De - tails can not here be entered into concerning these ingenuously immoral young ladies , nor is it necessary , vnth so full an account of the
Mancini	PERSON	family now at the reader 's service .

		Lely 's portrayal of
Hortense	ORGANIZATION	's seductive charms forms the frontispiece in a handsome photogra - vure ; and photograjjhic reproductions of nu - merous other portraits , including her four sisters , are interspersed through the volume .

		Scattering footnotes mention some of the numerous me - moirs available for the making of such books as Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's .

		A sumptuous set of twenty-three large plates of Lady
Hamilton	PERSON	's portraits by
Romney	LOCATION	, Rey - nolds ,
Lawrence	LOCATION	, Mme.
Le Brun	PERSON	, and
Masque	ORGANIZATION	- rier , furnishes Mr.
J. T. Herbert Baily	PERSON	, editor of '' The Connoisseur , '' an excuse for telling anew her rather pathetic story in his ''
Emma	PERSON	,
Lady Hamilton	PERSON	. ''

		Romney 's numerous
Cassan	PERSON	- dras and Circes and Bacchantes , depicting in various costumes and attitudes the charms of this Trilby-like beauty , are more or less familiar .

		Mr.
Baily	PERSON	's narrative , short and readable , is apologetic and even warmly eulogistic in tone , and may well be supplemented and corrected by some less favorable presentation of the famous courtesan .

		An antidote is found , for example , in a reference to her from a letter of Sir
Gilbert Eliot	PERSON	to his wife , wherein he speaks of her as showing the ease of a barmaid , and adds that '' her person is nothing short of monstrous , '' and '' her language and conversation -LRB- with men -RRB- are exaggerations of anything I ever heard any - where . ''

		This , to be sure , was when she had attained to matronly maturity .

		Of two of the four children commonly said to have been born to the fair
Emma	PERSON	, this biographer makes no mention ; and he repeats the seemingly false account of her death in such poverty that she had to be buried in a deal coffin at the cost of a charitable English lady ,
Paget	PERSON	's memoirs relate , on the authority of Lady
Hamilton	PERSON	's daughter , that she was buried in an oak coffin and with a degree of ceremony that brought the funeral expenses up to # 2,8 10s .

		Readers of ''
Fenwick	PERSON	's Career '' will enjoy the more than hasty glimpse of Romney that this book affords .

		The list of engraved portraits of Lady
Hamilton	PERSON	enumei-ates more than forty such reproductions , much the gTeater number being after Romney .

		A wealth of elaborate embroidery upon a pov - erty of historic fact is furnished in the 358 large pages of Miss
Marie Hay	PERSON	's pseudo-biography entitled '' A German Pompadour . ''

		So far as vice can be rendered attractive by throwing on it the glamour of romance , the un virtuous life of
Wilhelmine von GrJivenitz	PERSON	, mistress of Eber - hard
Ludwig	PERSON	,
Duke of Wiirtemberg	ORGANIZATION	, has been thus treated in being made to serve as the theme of a love story that is not uninteresting as a skil - ful bit of fiction , and has something even of salu - tary warning in its gloomy ending .

		The author writes with a clever woman 's knowledge of the human heart , but her style occasionally borders on the luscious , as may be illustrated by a sen - tence from an early chapter representing the heroine as poised on the giddy brink of her ruin .

		The Didce has wrapped
Wilhelmine	PERSON	's cloak about her , and '' as he did so his hand involun - tarily touched the soft skin of her shoidder , and
Eberhard Ludwig	PERSON	flushed to the edge of his white curled peruke as he murmured : ' Au revoir , Philomele ! '

		and
Wilhelmine	PERSON	daringly whis - pered back : ' Au revoir , gentil poete . ' ''

		The words '' bigamist '' and '' bigamy '' are misused by the author , who applies them to
Wilhelmine	PERSON	and her conduct in marrying the already - wedded Duke . ''

		The mills of God grind slow , but they grind exceeding sure , '' she writes , in quotation marks , altering without improving the familiar renderino '' of this line from
Friedrieh von Loirau	ORGANIZATION	.

		for in that case he is of course hopeless .

		The author who preferred a dead snake to a live man or woman has not spoken recentiy , either with his own voice or that of any of his colleagues .

		The most sumptuous nature-book of the year , Mr.
Beebe	PERSON	's '' Log of the Sun , '' is also , as its title indicates , the most comprehensive .

		Any one who absorbs this book will become in his own jjerson a fairly accomplished naturalist , besides having a very good time in the process .

		Mr.
Beebe	PERSON	scarcely carries out his intention of keeping the bird 's or insect 's jx -RRB- int of view , but he succeeds nevertheless in his main purpose , which is '' to reveal beauties which are wholly invisible from the usual himian view-point . ''

		Whether he writes of biixLs that have so far learned the lesson of natures economy as to use the cast-off fur of animals for their nests , or of night-hawks that nest upon the tar-and-gravel roofs of city houses , or of the squid that changes color at will , drawing its color cells together untU they seem confluent , -- • ' as if the freckles on a person 's face should all be joinetl together , '' -- he communicates secrets which only intimate acquaintance woidd have discovered .

		Keeping the log of the year week by week somewhat disturbs the continuity of subject , making many digressions and returns necessary ; but no real inconvenience residts , since the book is too large for continuous reading .

		It will be used rather for reference and inspiration , a chapter or two at a time .

		Mr. Stones fifty-two full-page draw - ings in color , and the generous number of pho - tographs , desei ^ - e an appreciable share of credit for the admiration the book will receive .

		Though the author writes modestly of the '' petty but real difficulties to be met with on such an ex - pedition , '' and says that `` anyone could have done it , '' the reader recognizes the heroic en - deavor .

		It scarcely seems a petty difficidty when
Dinkey	PERSON	, `` the cocky , self-confident little horse , '' falls over the edge of a precipice , or Old Slob overjumps on a slippery bridge , or especially when the whole party , worn and bruised , are turned back late in the day to retrace steps which have taken them since sunrise , or when they make their final descent across the face of a sheer cliff on a hair-line ledge which is scarcely visible in a photograph .

		The book is of good size , and has dainty marginal sketches , with some attractive full-page illustrations .

		From lower levels of a neighboring region comes Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	's unique study of '' The Flock . ''

		The poetic temperament which so well fits Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	for \ vi-iting stories of the West has been of equal advantage to her m telling of the shepherd-life , with '' its background of wild beauty , mixed romance , and unaffected savagery . ''

		A prefatory chapter , `` which is not on any accoimt to be omitted , '' tells how in
1770	DATE	Rivera y Moncada brought the first flocks from
Velicata	LOCATION	to the newly-founded Mission at
San Diego	LOCATION	, and how ever since , in that land of '' the indolent lapping of the nights and days , '' the dust and blether of a flock has been a rescue '' from the clutch of great Tedium . ''

		Lambing - time , shearing , the work and character of dogs and shejiherds , the depredations of enemies , and the journeys through valleys , up mountain slopes , and across open ranges , are described with an eye quick to see and a word competent to suggest every sig-nificant and picturesque detail .

		It is not often that a reader can have such implicit trust in an author 's use of words as in Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	's .

		What , for instance , could be more accurate or more musical than this account of the coming of night in the mountains ? ''

		In the Wild , the night moves forward at an impulse tiowiug from unknowable control .

		Darkness comes out of the ground and wells up to the canon rims , light still diffusing through the upper sky , a world of light beyond our world .

		Few things besides man suffer a check in their affairs .

		The wind treads about the forest litter on errands of its own ; yoii hear it but the more jjlainly , as if blackness were a little less resistant to somid . ''

		Whatever is needed by the imagination that words can not supply is given by Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's skiKul but unobtrusive drawings .

		Usually foreign nature-books are less inter - esting than our own , because we know too little of the places and the life they describe .

		But this stricture does not apply to the volumes by Mr.
Dewar	PERSON	and Mr ,
Crawford	PERSON	, ''
Bombay	LOCATION	Ducks '' and '' From
Fox	ORGANIZATION	's Earth to Mountain Tarn . ''

		Both these books , one treating of the birds and small animals of
India	LOCATION	, the other of wild life in
Scotland	LOCATION	, are of ample size , with excellent photogi * aphs , and both touch upon sub - jects of more than local interest .

		Mr.
Dewar	PERSON	explains in his preface that though the term ''
Bombay	LOCATION	Ducks '' really means pieces of dried fish , he has chosen to use it for the birds and animals in which he is interested .

		He treats of them like a writer , not like a scientist forced to use his pen in the service of his subject ; and his style is piquant and refreshing .

		On
Eliza Cook	PERSON	's saying that '' Linnets teach us how to love , and ring-doves how to pi'ay , '' the author comments : '' Had that estimable and well-meaning lady invested eighteenpence in one of the cooing community she might have said of them ' They teach us how to swear . '

		But the question woidd arise , do men need to be taught that accomplishment ?

		I am inclined to think that swearers , like poets , are born , not made . ''

		Such glints of philosophy keep the l ^ ook , ex - haustive as it is , from ever beconiing : dull .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's book , '' From
Fox	ORGANIZATION	's Earth to Mountain Tarn , '' makes an equally thorough study of the wild life of
Scotland	LOCATION	, traversing the country from
Ailsa Crag	LOCATION	and the Tweed to the
Shetlands	LOCATION	.

		The contention of the book is that sport , in the artificial form it has taken , is de - stroying wild life .

		For the sake of the hunt , the fox is allowed to thrive , though he destroys grouse , pheasant , and rabbit ; to make room for putting-greens on the coast golf-links , terns and eider ducks are driven from their breeding - places .

		Worst of all , the falcon , '' the sporting bird that woiUd rather a long chase than an easy capture , rather a swift wing than a fat meal , '' is being exterminated .

		Thus sport becomes ugly , when there is no longer '' the instinct of fair play , which is the vital spark of sport . ''

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	has a way of saying things that makes one think .

		The debt of the huntsman to the birds whose swiftness disciplines his marksman - ship is thus effectively pointed out : '' The falcon gave the flight feathers , lengthened and pointed the wing .

		The eagle touched the plumage with moorland hues , whose charm was the greater because of the exquisite sympathy .

		The reaction is marked ; the eye of the eagle became keener .

		Even the by-play is of infinite interest .

		The protective shades of grouse give the nose of the pointer ; less cunningly hidden , and a coarser sense were enough .

		An interesting three are grouse , sportsman , and dog .

		The hawk established their delicate relations . ''

		A book of less pretentious size , which records

		THE DIAL .

		389 good general observarion of wild life in our own conntrv ' .

		is Mr.
Ingersoll	PERSON	's '' The Wit of the Wild . ''

		Interesting comparisons with man 's ways are the most tmique feature of the book ; for instance , the wasp 's habit of storing up spiders for her larvie is calle < l • • life insurance for wasps , '' , and the rattlesnakes ' • shaking of castanets , '' the coloring of fire-toatls , the songs of bii `` ds and calls of animals at ma ting-time , are describetl in a chapter on ' • Animals that Ad - vertise . '

		A chapter on * • Bluffing '' leads to the conclusion that '' • ' animaLs are probably able to bluff more effectively thau men , because they are in such deatUy earnest about it and do it so often . ''

		If there are no sti-ikingly new facts in ^ Ir .

		Ingersoll 's book , there is a new way of em - phasizing old ones , and ' * a truth of simplicity which constitutes a charm often lacking in elaborate fiction . ''

		The thi-ee stories of individual animals -- '' Scraggles . '

		`` ShaggACoat , '' and '' White Fang '' -- are destinetl for ix -RRB- pidarity , ^ \ - ith scarcely a choice as to which l -RRB- est deserves it .

		Perhaps Mr.
James	PERSON	's touching history of Scraggles , the impromising little song-spaii-ow which he took to his home and his heart for its thi-ee months ' life , \ n \ l appeal most to girls ; but they are not the only ones to whom it vriB .

		appeal .

		Scraggles tells her own story of how she became the Pro- fessor s companion , helping liiiu wTite his book on the Old Missions of
California	LOCATION	, foUowing him out of doors on his walks , and sleeping in his shoes .

		Onlv at last , when her strengfth fails , does the author take up the pen in his own j -RRB- er - son and complete the tearfid little record . ''

		Shaggycoat , '' Mr.
Clarence Hawkes	PERSON	's story of a beaver , will l > e fascinating to boys , though they again wUl not be the only ones .

		Attention is called to the fact that the
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	Com - pany , and many great families -- the Astors , for instance -- owe much of their wealth to this industrioiLs builder , who , '' like the red man , is a true American , for he was here before
Colum	PERSON	- bus , and whose jjelt was the prize for which the wilderness was scouretl . ''

		Mr.
Hawkes	PERSON	gives this important animal biography in a simple , straightforward way , and earns our gratitude by leaving it with a happy ending in spite of the fact that the beaver trilie is l > eing ruthlessly wiped out .

		In '' White Fang . ''

		Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	has given us a book that probably will be more read than an ^ - thing else he has written .

		It is a re - markable stoiy for its own sake , and is further remarkable for being the converse of '' The Call of the Wild . ''

		The hero of '' The Call of the Wild '' is a dog with wolf blood , who goes from a home where he is loved and petted , through experiences of hardship and brutalitj '' , back to the life of the wilderness .

		White Fang , a wolf with dog blood , is liom in the wUdemess , and after experiences of hardship and brutality is brought at last to a home where he is loved and petted .

		There is as much that goes against the reader 's sympathy in one book as in the other : but because the story of White Fang ends hap - pily , much of the cruelty in it \* t11 be forgiven and forgotten .

		The early life of White Fang is narrated with an understanding of animal psychology which seems almost uncanny , yet shows Mr.
London	LOCATION	's power in one of its best phases .

		When the young dog - wolf first saw the Indians about their camp-fire '' a great awe de - scended upon him .

		... In dim ways he recog - nized in man the animal that had fought itseK to primacy over other animals of the Wild . ''

		He joins the camp , and Ijecomes the dog of Gray Beaver .

		His master is his god , but not for love . ''

		There were deeps in his nature which had never been sounded .

		A kind word , a caress - ing touch of the hand , on the part of Gray Beaver might have sounded these deeps ; but Gray Beaver did not caress nor speak kind words .

		His primacy was savage . ''

		The reign of hate brings White Fang to be the fighting - dog of a white man .

		But from his last fight -- and there is no more blood-curdling dog-fight in literature -- he is rescued by the love-master .

		By this patient , kind man , his brute nature is redeemed , and for the master he loves he leams to endure the restraints of cixdlization .

		The book will be judged inferior to '' The Call of the Wild '' by sticklei-s for '' strong '' endings ; nevertheless it will \ -RRB- e more enjoyed by the mass of readers .

		A finely-made book , whose open print and abundant pictiu ^ s will especiallj * delight old people , is Mr.
Huston	PERSON	's '' Around an Old Home - stead . ''

		This '' lx -RRB- ok of memories , ' though it celebi-ates a particular house , vnR serve to stir home memories in the heart of anyone who has lived in the country .

		It has much to say of the house itself , the open fire , the orchards , the woods , the squirrels , the dogs , and the acti \ `` ities of farm life .

		If the citing of authors , from
Tennyson	LOCATION	to
W. C. Gray	LOCATION	-- and one can scarcely think of anything appropriate that has been omitted -- seems to the over-critical too plentif id and premeditatetl , it will probably not seeiu so to those who take their reading in snatches .

		Since the study of out-door nature leads as certaiidy to philosophy as does that of human 390 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, nature , it is not strange that two of the new books in our list should be given over to philoso - phizing .

		Dr.
Abbott	PERSON	's '' Rambles of an Idler '' does not attempt to point a moral , except that it is well to ramble and enjoy ones self .

		The author `` goes hand in hand with day-dreams , '' and his mind makes material out of whatever his eye lights ujjon .

		His philosophy , if discursive , is cheerful and pertinent , -- as in this example : '' I find , where I walk , a rusty pan among the dead leaves and a vesper mouse has made a snug home of it .

		It suggests that the art of much comfort from little is better than supposititious ease from much .

		He really does not enjoy nature who demands it in excess , and must have oceans and mountains , and spurns the uaodest hills and wood-girt ponds that are roimd about him . ''

		The book is good proof of how genially a man is affected who spends much time in the sunshine .

		In contrast with the general tone of Dr. Ab - bott 's philosophy is the particiUar intention of Mr.
Long	PERSON	s .

		The object of '' Briar Patch Philos - ophy '' is to establish the thesis that animals think .

		The words are put into the mouth of ``
Peter Rabbit	PERSON	, ' but as this plan affects the manner of them only to the extent of naming the Rabbit `` I '' and human beings `` you , '' the author - ship is not much disguised .

		Mr.
Long	PERSON	bases his belief that animals think on the fact , admitted by all great naturalists , that they have minds , and the theory tliat since the laws of the uni - verse are constant the laws of mind must be con - stant . ' '

		Any truth , therefore , which you discover about your own mind -- which constitutes your psychology -- must apply to any mind in the imiverse , wherever you find it . ''

		That is , since animals have minds , they must use them as men use theirs .

		The reasoning , though supported by charac.teristically close observation , is from anal - ogy , and readers wiU value the conclusions accord - ing to their valuation of that method .

		Certainly Mr.
Long	PERSON	carries it rather far when he says : '' Your dog certainly does not obtain his idea of a master 's spirit through the senses , for to his senses man is not nearly so powerful or noble as many of your great beasts .

		Whatever idea your dog has of you , as his Master , is the recognition in you of some mental or spiritual quality , and is gained by him through some mental or spiritual perception .

		What is there , therefore , to prevent all animals from feeling more or less surely the simple presence of one whom all your religions rec - ognize as a master and ruler of the solitudes , present and active in all things , though no mortal eye can see him nor any ear hear the sound of his footsteps ? ''

		Still , if one can not foUow Mr.
Long	PERSON	in grant - ing religion and a belief in immortality to dumb creatures , one can not help enjoying the clever - ness with which he defends his belief . ''

		Peter Rabbit '' sees some things about his human neighbors that make him wonder if they think .

		Why is it , he asks , that '' to change a habit of thinking among men requires centuries , and generally the blood of a few martyrs ; while the animal changes his smiple habits in a single generation , led by his own reasonable experi - ence '' ?

		Why do men eat when they are not hungry , breathe bad air when they might have pure air , work for money that they do not need , and make slaves of themselves when they might be free ?

		At least ''
Peter	PERSON	Rabbit '' asks ques - tions that are hard to answer , and in the end wins gratitude for letting poor humans off as easily as he does .

		And Mr.
Long	PERSON	, in this seri - ous piece of work , has made a contribution ta animal study that will have permanent influ - ence .

		It shoidd be said , moreover , that the unus - ually animated illustrations save the book from being too serious .

1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 391
England	LOCATION	, the book is concerned only with the
State of New York	ORGANIZATION	and with the city of
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It contains much that is old -- old enough , for the most part , to have become new again to Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's readers ; and it is laden with reminiscences from a day more remote in feeling than in time .

		The author tells us that the work was inspired by the conviction that there are not books enough concern - ing travel in these States ; and he set himself to the task of remedying this lack in our literature , just as he performed a similar ser ^ ^ ce for our national balladry .

		His first paragraph reads as follows : ■ ' It seems to me curious that so few people write about travels in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		One in a thousand of the intelli - gent Americans who travel in
Europe	LOCATION	puts his observations into print .

		One in fifty of the people who cross
Asia	LOCATION	does the same ; and every one who crosses
Africa	LOCATION	does .

		But of the travellers of
America	LOCATION	, you might count on the fingers of two hands all who have written anything worti reading that has been printed In the
last twenty years	DATE	. ''

		The illustrations are profuse and well-chosen , con - sisting of reproductions of old prints and portraits and photographs of present-day scenes .

		Mr.
William T. Hornaday	PERSON	, the well-known travel - ler and wi'it `` r on natural history , found in the
Cana	LOCATION	- dian
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	material for what President
Roosevelt	PERSON	might well call a `` bully '' travel-book .

		He went there especially to find mountain goats -- and he cer - tainly found them .

		A short quotation will show what happened while he was studjTug a herd of twenty - eight of these animals which their dogs had brought to bay long enough to have them photog ^ phed . ''

		Suddenly sharp cries of surprise came up from the camp , and I sprang up to look about .

		Three gxiats were running past the tents at top speed , -- a big billy , and two smaller • ' • Hi , there I Goats !

		Goats I ' cried
Smith	ORGANIZATION	and Norboe . '

		■ The cook was stooping over the fire , and looking under his right arm he saw the bunch charging straight toward him , at a gallop .

		A second later , the big billy was almost upon him . '' '

		Hey I You son-of-a-gun I ' yelled
Huddleston	PERSON	.

		and as the big snow-white animal dashed past him he struck it across the neck with a stick of firewood .

		The goat 's tracks were within six feet of the camp-fire . ''

		As was to be expected , the book abounds in vivid descriptions of wild animals ; and it gives also many extremely interesting pictures made from pho - tographs taken at ranges almost inciedibly close .

		In one or two places in his admirable book , `` Certain Delightful English Towns . ''

		^ 1t .

		W. D. HoweUs shows a tendency to apologize to the people of
England	LOCATION	for the unkind words he has sometimes written of them .

		Witness such a paragraph as this : ■ • On the tender was an Englishman whom I asked which was the best hotel in
Plymouth	LOCATION	.

		At first ne would not com - mit himself ; then his humanity began to work in him .

		and he expressed a preference , and abruptly left me .

		He returned directly to give the reasons for his preference , and to excuse them , and again he left me .

		A second time he came back , with his con.science fully roused , and conjured me not to think of going elsewhere .

		I thought that charming , and I afterwards found the hotel excellent , as I found nearly all the hotels in
England	LOCATION	.

		I found everything delightful on the way to it , inclusive of the cabman 's overcharge , which brought the extortion to a full thirrl of the just fare of a
New York	LOCATION	cabman . ''

		It would be hard to find fault with a traveller who was so prepared to enjoy his sojourn in a strange land , and one wherein he felt himself to be no stranger .

		It was this attitude toward life that went far towai 'd making both journey and the account of it so cheerful .

		The book has the usual charming and idiomatic style of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, who should now be persuaded to do as much -- as much as he can , that is -- in the same vein for some of our American cities .

		Some charming pen drawings by Mr.
Ernest Haskell	PERSON	, together with numerous reproductions from photog ^ phs , add not a little to the attractiveness of this pleasant volume .

		JVIr .


Henry C. Shelley	ORGANIZATION	strays even farther from the beaten path than does Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, for in his '' Literary By-Paths in
Old England	LOCATION	'' he has under - taken to follow the haunts and dwelling-places of
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Sidney	PERSON	,
William Penn	LOCATION	, Gray ,
Gilbert White	PERSON	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	, Bums ,
Keats	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	, and
Tom Hood	PERSON	, concluding with the multiplicity of literary interests that centre in • ' royal ''
Winchester	PERSON	.

		The novelty of the work does not consist so much in new discoveries , for there are none of consequence , as in presenting his subjects in a light not usual .

		One thinks of
Goldsmith	PERSON	, for instance , and one thinks of '' The Deserted Village '' in connection with him ; yet somehow it is a novelty to think of Auburn itself , as it stands , still deserted , in its -LRB- and his -RRB- native
Ireland	LOCATION	, and to think of
Goldsmith	PERSON	in just that con - nection .

		So
Keats	PERSON	, though known to have been a chemist and student of medicine , is so entirely the poet in the popular estimation that his signatures as a student of chemistry and medicine possess a curious human interests The book furnishes abun - dant opportunity for illustrations , which are supplied from photographs taken bj - the author .

		Mr.
E. Y. Lucas	PERSON	, in his attractive volume entitled `` A Wanderer in
London	LOCATION	. ''

		adds his charming prose and even an occasional modest verse to his minute knowledge of locality and literature , and the result is a book well worthy the attention of any visitor , actual or intending , to the British capital .

		Such a paragraph as this , chosen quite at random , illustrates its wealth of reference and its author 's interesting manner of presentation : ''
Grosvenor Square	ORGANIZATION	is two hundred years old and has had many famous residents .

		It was in an ante-room of the
Earl of Chesterfield	ORGANIZATION	's house here that
Johnson	PERSON	cooled his heels and warmed his temper .

		Mr.
Thrale	PERSON	died in
Grosvenor Square	LOCATION	, and so did
John Wilkes	PERSON	, at No. 30 .

		At No. 22 lived Sir William and
Lady Hamilton	PERSON	, with '
Yathek	PERSON	' Beckf ord , and thither went
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	after the battle of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		And so on .

		for page after page , until past and pres - ent are allied vrith the strongest ties of association and charm of literary treatment .

		The sixteen col - ored pictures by Mr.
Nelson Dawson	PERSON	are charming ; and there are many other illustrations .

		Mrs.
Mona Caird	PERSON	brings a romancer 's love of sen - timent and an artist 's powers of description to her '' Romantic Cities of
Provence	LOCATION	, '' Avith the happiest results .


Avignon	LOCATION	,
Uzes	LOCATION	,
Barbentane	PERSON	, the lagoons , Aries ,
Tarascon	LOCATION	,
Beaucaire	LOCATION	.


Carcassonne	LOCATION	, and many 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, more of these old romantic places , are duly entered , their atmosphere absorbed , the local legends studied , and the result given in entertaining and often bril - liant passages of descriptive writing .

		In the matter of dates and merely useful knowledge , Mrs.
Caird	PERSON	has been , as she says , '' frugal '' ; but the essentials for an understanding of the people are nowhere lacking .

		It is the festival in the beloved city of Tarascon that evokes the following : `` No one can be iu the South , above all in
Provence	LOCATION	, knowing ' of its ancient festivals , its music , its farandoles and Saracenic dances , and fail to be startled into new realization of this element that has psissed out of our life , the menace that lies in the pervading dulness , that benumbed worshij -RRB- of sorrow , of ' work ' and ' duty ' without understanding and without freshness , that absence of fantasy and outcry that binds the modern world in a terrible and unnatural silence .

		Of what avail is it that the people are law-abiding at the cost of the very spi'ing and essence of being ? ''

		We are reminded of the annvial protest against such few holidays as we permit ourselves , and of the curious orgy of work and quest that we regard as an essential preparation for them .

		The book breathes the very spirit of holiday .

		Of equal interest with the text are the numerous illustrations from pen - drawings by Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	and Mr.
Edward M. Synge	PERSON	.

		It is no great way from
Provence	LOCATION	to the begin - nmg of Mr.
Frederick H. A. Seymour	PERSON	's ''
Saunter	PERSON	- ings in Sjiain , '' and he has succeeded in giving his book something of the same charm , because his first interest lies in the cities of the Moors , and they have left behind them many elements of joy not essen - tially Spanish .

		The manner in which
Seville	LOCATION	celebrates the feast of Corpus Clu-isti appealed to Mr.
Seymour	PERSON	as an admirable opportunity to study a Spanish crowd , and the following are among his observations : '' The men generally are singularly plain , lint the ladies ' eyes would deserve a chaptei -- or even chaptei-s -- to do justice to them .

		The eyes are never still .

		They glide , they swim , they dilate , they contract , thej ' half close , they lan - ^ ish , they curve , they sweep round the corners , and , pre - ternaturally recovering themselves , they drop upon yours with a sudden glow .

		They do all things that eyes and tongue and lips can do .

		But one thing they can not do , and that is to keep still ; but they never stare . ''

		Yet the book is more deeply laden with useful knowl - edge than most , the studies of the art galleries in
Spain	LOCATION	being particularly close and appreciative .

		Twenty-four reproductions from photographs illum - inate the text .

		Mr.
Leonard WUliams	PERSON	does not appear sympa - thetic with the Spanish character , in his book en - titled '' Granada : Memories , Adventures , Studies , and Impressions . ''

		The author is concerned , of course , more particularly with the old Moorish kingdom ; but he finds time to write a tractate upon the gypsy of those parts , introducing into it one story worth repeating . ''

		Gyp.sy peddlers were hawking brooms about the streets and plazas of
Granada	LOCATION	, when one of them called the other to Lis side . '

		Speaking , ' he .

		said , ' with perfect frankness , I make my brooms miyself , and steal my rushes , my handles , and my `` ord for binding .

		Nothing proceeds from me except the time employed in manufacture .

		With these economies my lowest possible price is fifteen centimos , and yet you sell for twelve .

		How can you do it for the money ? ' '' '

		Why , ' replied the other , unabashed , ' you see I steal my brooms ready-made . ' ''

		A beautiful frontispiece in color from Mr.
A. M. Foweraker	PERSON	's painting of the
Alhambra	LOCATION	, together with twenty-four reproductions from photographs , make up the pictorial equipment of the book .

		One reads with some surprise the name of the late
Grant Allen	PERSON	on the title-page of a new book , '' Cities of
Northern Italy	LOCATION	, '' and with hardly less surprise the naive statement of his supposed colla - borator , Mr.
George C. Williamson	PERSON	, in the preface , from whicla it does not appear that
Allen	PERSON	's interest or share in the book ever went beyond the stage of suggestion , though he did prepare some historical guides dealing with the cities now treated .

		It would seem , therefore , as if the question needed some clear - ing up .

		Of the two volumes presented , the first deals entirely with
Milan	LOCATION	, and the second
Avith Verona	LOCATION	,
Padua	LOCATION	,
Bologna	LOCATION	, and
Ravenna	LOCATION	.

		There appears to be a remote kinship with
Allen	PERSON	's work on
Florence	LOCATION	, but it is with his scheme rather than his style or treatment .

		The illustrations , including two plates in photogravure , consist of reproductions of the art and architecture of the region dealt with .

		Mr.
Ernest C. Peixotto	PERSON	holds closely to his title , '' By Italian Seas , '' throughout the pleasant and informing book he has prepared both text and pic - tures for .

		The
Riviera di Ponente	ORGANIZATION	,
Genoa	LOCATION	, the
Riviera di Levante	LOCATION	, the Dalmatian coast to
Cattaro	LOCATION	, thence to
Naples	LOCATION	, and so on to
Sicily	LOCATION	and
Malta	LOCATION	, are included in his itinerary , from which it will be seen that he has wandered on and off the beaten track of tourists .

		Interesting in the extreme is the account of the marionett ' i of
Sicily	LOCATION	, '' almost invariably founded upon the same theme --
Ariosto	PERSON	's '
Orlando Furioso	LOCATION	, ' '' with the air of the age of chivalry most carefully preserved and reproduced .

		Nor is it quite reassuring to those engaged in the '' elevation '' of the English-speaking stage to learn that tliese puppet - shows , accurately costumed and with tlieir verses well rendered , are the habitual recreation of the poor in that sunny island .

		The illustrations are nearly four score in number , both full-page plates and drawings in the text , and tlie cover bears a striking design in gold and colors .

		`` How fortunate it is , '' observes Dr.
Eduard Strasburger	PERSON	, '' that even on the darkest days imagi - nation can raise us up above the clouds I '' Yet the seven journeys in
Italy	LOCATION	which he commemorates in his '' Rambles on the Riviera '' are so emphatically those of a scholar -- and first of all a botanist -- that one 's interest in his luxuriously printed and illustrated book is primarily scientific .

		Vast learning regarding the history of familiar plants is placed at the disposal of the reader , and accuracy is ensured by the reproduction in color of nearly every plant mentioned .

		THE DIAL 393 oted by
Louise Reusch	PERSON	.

		Printed as they are in the text , they present an unusually novel and attractive appearance .

		Of an entirely different and more conventional sort is the volume bearing the identical title of Dr.
Strasburger	PERSON	's , just noticed , but written by Mr.
Francis MUtoun	PERSON	.

		Its opening scenes are in
Provence	LOCATION	, whence the reader follows the author in his automobile joumeyings to
Marseilles	LOCATION	and
Toulon	LOCATION	, and it is not until near the close that the
Riviera	LOCATION	and
Monaco	ORGANIZATION	are reached .

		The book abounds in descriptions of natural scenery .

		One reads that at
Cannes	LOCATION	' • local * professors ' have a busy time of it , in season and out , teaching wliat they call the * id tome hritan - nique ' and the • argot Americaine . ' ''

		One wonders just what this latter can be , and if it is taught to the British as well as the French .

		A frontispiece in color and numerous full-page wash drawings are supplied by
Miss Blanche McManus	ORGANIZATION	.

		The binding and end-leaves are particularly attractive .

		Miss
Meakin	PERSON	's chapters of • • Travels and Studies in
Russia	LOCATION	'' have much of the charm that has been noticed in the letters of a good woman-correspondent .

		They are somewhat desultory and discursive , but iiiey contain nothing uninterestiug , and they cover fields ordinai `` ily left untouched even in a country so voluminously - s ^ - ritten of as
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It would seem as if it were an enormous distance , with a great climatic difference , from tbe
Riviera	LOCATION	to the lands of the Czar ; yet there is a Russian Riviera too , as Miss
Meakin	PERSON	shows in her chaptei `` S on the
Crimea	LOCATION	.

		Few of the proWnces of the empire are left untouched , and from every one of them comes information con - cerning the private lives and industries of the people which are ti-uly informing .

		The volume has numer - ous illustrations reproduced from photographs .

		Professor
A. V. Williams Jackson	PERSON	's ''
Persia	LOCATION	Past and Present '' is something more than a book of travel , for it contains much that is imjx -RRB- rtant to AssjTiologists in the way of scholarship , especially in regard to the original rock inscriptions at Behistan and elsewhere .

		So many men great in the various activities of life lie buried in Persian soU that the book abounds in accounts of famous tombs .

		Saadi .


Avicenna	ORGANIZATION	, and many another ancient and mediaeval notability ' , have their resting-places described and pictured here .

		There is little of impoilance in the
Shah	PERSON	's domains in the field of scholarship and lit - erature which Professor
Jackson	PERSON	does not touch , and his reproduced photos ^ plis are numerous and attractive .

		Miss
Gertrude Adams Fisher	PERSON	did not wander far from the haunts of white folk in '' A AVoman Alone in the Heart of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		though she was without a companion during the greater part of her journey .

		Her book , however , is more frank and outspoken than the books of most men regarding this much visited land , and impressions may be obtained from it that are hardly to be gained from any other recent work .

		She enjoyed her intercourse with the jxjlite islanders , and has only once to complain of discour - tesy -- when she came upon a country lad unawares and he apparently mistook her for an apparition .

		Many of the photographs in the work are as new as the matters they illustrate , and the book has sincer - ity and candor .

		Cannibalism appears only in the title of Mr.
A. E. Pratt	PERSON	's '' Two Years among
New Guinea Canni	LOCATION	- bals , '' and the people who figure in its pages seem to be mild-mannered and amiable .

		Now that
Africa	LOCATION	has been practically explored from end to end ,
New Guinea	LOCATION	remains the largest unknown tract of land on the habitable globe , and it has been ilr .

		Pratt 's good fortune to cover portions of territory in the Dutch portion of the island previously unknown .

		This was merely incidental to his main purpose as a naturalist ; and here , too , he met with marked success .

		One of his Christmas dinners is thus de - scribed : '' It ■ vraa probably one of the queerest that was ever set before an esdled Britisher .

		I left the task of preparing the meal entirely to
Sam	PERSON	-LRB- a native of
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , - who managed somehow to procure some waUaby , a piece of bacon , and biscuits .

		Instead of pudding we had a Cinghalese plnm-cake , made by
Sam	PERSON	's daughter , and a glass of claret rounded off the banqnet .

		We were not very festive . ''

		This book is fully illustrated ; and here , as else - where , the camera has been relied upon for much of the description .

		It is a long journey from the old
New England	LOCATION	of Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's youth to the canni - bals of
Papua	LOCATION	, but a common speech binds all the books together , and common race-traditions stand behind them .


Wallace Rice	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miscellaneous Holiday Books .

		Among the holiday publications of last season Mrs.
Edith `` Wharton	PERSON	's - Italian Villas and their Gardens , '' with pictures by Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	, will be re - membered as one of the loveliest and most sumptuous .

		This year a so-called companion volume has been issued by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	, having for its subject '' The Chateaux of Touraine . ''

		The text is by
Maria Hornor Lansdale	PERSON	; the sixteen coloretl illustrations are by
Jules Gudrin	PERSON	, and the others , in black and tint , over forty in all , are reproduced from photo - g ^ phs of sufficient artistic merit to make their in - clusion in so beautiful a volume eminently fitting .

		For the first and perhaps the ultimate appeal of the book is the artistic one .

		The quality of Mr.
Gu	PERSON	^ rin 's work is well known , and these drawings , for the making of which he took a special trip to
France	LOCATION	, represent him at his best .

		His object , as is easily evident , is to portray unusual aspects of the chateaux -- to make light and shadow and coloring suggestive of the sentiment that is individual to each one .

		The photographs therefore serve to round out the reader 's impressions , and also to make certain architectural effects and details clearer .

		The book is royal octavo in size , printed with red mnning-heads on fine deckel edged paper .

		The binding is of dark gi-een cloth , elaborately decorated in gold and colors .

		The work 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, is copiously indexed .

		Book-lovers , art-lovers , and travellers -- actual or would-be -- through sunny
France	LOCATION	, can not fail to be delighted with a book which , considered from all their several points of view , gives complete satisfaction .

		The writer of the text has evidently devoted i -RRB- ainstaking study both to the chateaux themselves and to the records of their history .

		Her facts are accurate and authoritative , and at the same time picturesquely presented .

		She has not , in her conscientious effort to master her subject , lost sight of its charm ; she clothes the dry bones of her history with flesh and blood , and thereby puts her readers under the spell of these romantic old castles where were enacted many thrilling dra - mas of the most fascinating period of French history .

		She has chosen twelve chateaux for exploitation , nine of them actually in
Touraine	LOCATION	, the others just over its border .

		But , as the preface assures us , we need fear no monotony either in description or his - torical association , since each of the twelve is as different as possible from the other eleven .


Chinon	ORGANIZATION	is a ruin , haunted by splendid memories of the
Maid of Orleans	ORGANIZATION	and a score of kings .

		Azay-le-Rideau is an exquisitely dainty exam2 -RRB- le of French renaissance architecture , standing serenely amidst its fine old trees , its brilliant flower-beds , and its lily-fringed ponds , whose still waters reflect its stately towers and pinnacles .

		Langeais is a feudal castle at its best , '' armed cap-k-pie as on the day when it gave refuge to the breathless little Bretonne Duchess rid - ing to her hurried nuptials with the king of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		In like manner the impression made by each of the twelve is unique .

		Together they are representative of one of the most fascinating but necessarily least accessible aspects of old-time
France	LOCATION	.

		With appetite whetted by a glimpse at the Touraine book just described , a critic is not in - clined to quarrel with the fate that has led other authors and artists to the same fair country for ma - terial . ''

		Castles and
Chateaux of Old Touraine	ORGANIZATION	and the Loire Country '' is published by
Messrs. L. C. Page and Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Francis Miltoun	PERSON	, author of a long series of books of travel issued by the same house , is responsible for the text , and his artistic col - laborator is Miss Blanche JNIcManus .

		Her studies of Breton types , and her sketches in wash and color of the chateaux and the country-side that environs them , while not so pretentious as Mr.
Gu	PERSON	^ rin 's , are charming of their kind .

		The scope of this volume is wider than that of the foregoing , and its method more nearly that of the guide-book .

		Readers who , fired by
Miss Lansdale	ORGANIZATION	's enthusiasm , contemplate a tour of the region , will find in Mr.
Miltoun	PERSON	a guide brim-full of information and suggestions for routes and itinerary ; while the stay-at-home traveller will have no need to complain of dulness or over - complicated detail .

		It is a pity , however , that Mr.
MUtoun	PERSON	should continue to present his material in so disorderly a form .

		His arrangement lacks both method and sequence , and his style has a qualified and uncertain ring that is very annoying .

		The tliird and last of the Touraine series is en - titled `` Touraine and Its Story '' -LRB- Dent-Dutton -RRB- .

		It is a handsomely-bound quarto volume , whose artis - tic feature is the colored illustrations fm-nished by Mr.
A. B. Atkinson	PERSON	.

		There are fifty of these , por - traying every aspect of country and vUlage ; and almost as many smaller black-and-white drawings are set in the text .

		The color-printing is excellent , and the artist 's choice and handling of material are at once beautifully suggestive and tlioroughly in harmony Avith the point of view of the text .

		This has been prepared by Miss
Anne Macdonnell	PERSON	, and in no per - functory spirit .

		Miss
Macdonnell	PERSON	loves the chateaux of Touraine so well that she does not limit herself to the usual round of a dozen or so of the most typical and imposing .

		Indeed , she finds more of the flavor of by-gone days in the lesser-known castles , where there are no guides to hurry the visitor , and where the shabbiness and quiet decay give the imagination free rein .

		It is to these that she takes her readers ; to the grim fortresses , also , that guarded the lands ; to the humble dwellings that nestled in the shadow of the lordly manors ; and to the rivers -- shy and silent or swift and rapacious -- that water this `` Garden of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		We wish that , with her taste for the pleasant by-ways of travel , and with the gift , besides , to make others see and enjoy what she has seen ,
Miss Macdonnell	PERSON	had devoted herself to the present - day aspects of Touraine rather than to its glorious past .

		She relates history and legend very well , but she describes even better ; and the art of good de - scription is rare .

		More than half the text is devoted to the chronological story of Tours and its neighbor - hood .

		The remaining chapters take the reader to various chateaux and churches , often leading him from one architectural monimient to the next , along the banks of a quiet stream .

		Thus her history sys - tematizes and rounds out the story of the twelve indi - vidual chateaux , as told by
Miss Lansdale	PERSON	, and her itineraries sometimes duplicate but often supplement the other writers .

		The tliree books , each with its own purpose and point of view , are alike in the in - spiration they furnish for a visit to a region as rich in historical association as it is picturesque and beau - tifiU in landscaj -RRB- e featm ` es .

		Those who remember Miss
Blanche Elizabeth Wade	PERSON	's last year 's book , '' A Garden in Pink , '' will be glad to know that her new one , '' The Stained Glass Lady '' -LRB-
McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		is written in the same happy vein .

		The thread of the story is very slight ; it relates the progi-ess of a friendship be - tween the Stained Glass Lady and the little boy who , seeing her first in church , noticed her resem - blance to a figiu'e in the window near which she sat , named her according y , and kept awake during a long sermon to wonder hoAv she would look in a halo in - stead of the white hat she was wearing .

		The quaint plays that the lady devised for her little friend after the two had become acquainted , the stories she told him , the talks they liad together , and the delightful ways she found for teaching him the things that shy and imaginative little boys need to learn , make up the substance of the story .

		But a bare account
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 395 of these facts does the book scant justice .

		A vivid descriptive touch , a whimsical humor , and a highly imaginative appreciation of nature combine to pro- dace a unique and decided charm , which a slight affectation of style rather increases than diminishes .

		Miss
Blanche Ostertag	PERSON	furnishes a frontispiece , cover vignette , and end-pages , all of which are conceived and colored in the quaint style suggested by the title .

		Miss
Ostertag	PERSON	is also responsible for the pretty and appropriate page-borders .

		Ten years ago !

		Mr.
H. M. Brock	PERSON	made a set of pen-and-ink illustrations for a volume of
Thackeray	PERSON	's ** Ballads and Songs '' : and in spite of all the good work that he has given us since , he has never done anything better tlian those drawings .

		It is a happy thought on the part of Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons to give these charming pictui-es a decennial revival by issuing a new edition of the '' Ballads and Songs '' in a prettily decorated but substantial binding .

		This last precaution is well taken , for here is a holiday volume tliat is sure to be well thumbed and long cherished by its fortunate possessors .

		It is unne - cessary - to say anj ` thing about the delightfully spon - taneous humor of Thackei-ay 's verses .

		As for Mr.
Brock	PERSON	's drawings , they are , like all his illustrations , really interpretative ; for Mr.
Brock	PERSON	is one of a few popular modem illustrators who , knowing their own best vein , ai'e content to keep well within it .

		There - fore his smallest taU-piece lias a meaning quite be - yond its office in filling up a blank space , and the most thoughtful reader finds a new interest and suggestiveness in pages that are punctuated by his happily conceived and daintily executed vignettes .

		There are more than a hundred illustrations , large and small , for the seventy-odd ballads and poems , besides headings for the tables of contents and of illustrations , and la ^ ^ sh incidental decorations .

		This is one of the really choice illustrated books of the year . ''

		Famous Actor Families in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is a volume of biographical studies written by Mr.
Montrose J. Moses	PERSON	and first printed in the * ' Theatre Magazine . ''

		Like that of the great orator , the speU cast by the great actor can live after him only as a vague tradition : but his character and personality - , his artistic career , the story of his great triumpl ^ , and some account of his peculiar methods , are all legitimate subjects of research and interest , tending to create a respect for the past of the stage that should have a good influence upon its present eleva - tion .

		Mr.
Moses	PERSON	's studies are preceded by gene - alogical tables showing the relationships between the various actors of each family .

		Each actor member is accorded brief mention , but the main part of the sketch is in most cases devoted to the one great actor -- e.g. .


Edwin Booth	PERSON	, our
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	, ISIrs .


John Drew	PERSON	,
Tyrone Power	PERSON	the elder , or
George Holland	PERSON	-- whose work is , so to speak , the centre of the family 's theatrical interest and activity .

		Mr.
Moses	PERSON	has taken great pains to collect and verifj - his material ; he has been given unusual opportimi - ties both to inspect rare manuscript and to reprint rare and interesting photographs , and be shows in his choice of subjects an excellent sense of propor - tion .

		An introductory chapter gives a desultory but entertaining account of the early days of the American theatre , and the various biographies throw a good deal of light upon the development of our stage , besides relating many interesting traditions of the older
London	LOCATION	play-houses .

		The book is attractively printed in two colors , with forty full - page illustrations .

		Another book which , probably to the surprise of most readers , proves to be largely about actors , is -RSB- yir .


Gustav Kobb	PERSON	^ 's '' Famous American Songs '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The songs of which l ^ Ir .

		Kobb ^ writes are the old-time popular favorites like `` Home , Sweet Home , '' `` Dixie , '' ``
Ben Bolt	PERSON	, '' and `` Old Folks at Home , '' with various patriotic and national songs .

		And it is astonishing to find that most of these , like most of the populai '' airs of the present day , were written for the stage , often by men who combined the professions of acting and of writing or adapting plays .

		The chief difference between these early song - writers and their followers seems to be that most of the former sold their wares for a paltry sum , and often neglected even to sign their work ; which is in striking contrast with the methods of the pros - perous song-writers of to-day .

		The accounts of the composition of the words and music of each song in Mr.
Kobb	PERSON	^ 's collection are supplemented by sketches of their authors ' lives .

		Photographs of the song - writers and of their homes , of famous singers who helped to immortalize them , and of autograph copies of several songs , serve to illustrate the book , which is tastefully printed and bound .

		The new volume in Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ' series , collectively entitled `` The Great Waterways of
America	LOCATION	, '' deals with the
Ohio River	LOCATION	, which the subtitle aptly characterizes as ' • a Course of Empire . ''

		Its author is Mr.
Archer Butler Hulbert	PERSON	, associate professor of American history at
Marietta College	ORGANIZATION	, secretarj - of the
Ohio Valley Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	, and author of several notable historical works .

		He acknowle < lges especial indebtedness , in the prepara - tion of the present volume , to the splendid collection of Americana recently presented to
Marietta Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege , which includes many clippings of tinique in - terest .

		The illustrations , which are muuerous , are from photographs , old prints , maps , and paintings , and are a distinct contribution to the value of the book .

		Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	brings to his work unusual quali - fications , for he unites a local interest and pride in the region of which he writes , with a large pers -RCB- > ec - tive .

		and accuracy and perseverance in research with a picturesque and pungent stj ` le .

		The Age of the Canoe , the Flatlx -RRB- at , and the Steamer , as he names the divisions of the
Ohio	LOCATION	's history , are each treated fully and entertainingly , in a fashion to vi ^ • ify the heroes of each period from La Salle ,
Boone	PERSON	, and the Clarks .

		to
St. Clair	ORGANIZATION	, '' Mad Anthony ''
Wayne	PERSON	, and the rest of the Indian fighters , who in their turn were supplanted by the heterogenous multitude of pioneers .

		Here not
indi %	PERCENT	- iduals but pei-sonal tj-pes 396 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, stand out in bold relief : conscienceless land-jobbers , honest surveyors , '' promoters , '' and the rough crowd of flat-boat men , sailors , and beachcombers who formed altogether '' as unique a hmnan element as can be found in all AVestern history . ''

		Thi-oughout is emphasized the great drama of conquest and ex - pansion in which , often unconsciously , all the varying company were actors .

		Among the lighter and more evanescent sort of holiday books , this study of the
Ohio River	LOCATION	has no place ; it will nevertheless prove a welcome gift to many persons who would care nothing for the more conventional variety of gift book .

		The handsome volume entitled '' American Coun - try Homes and their Gardens '' is calculated to im - press its readers with the fact that
England	LOCATION	is not the only country where people live a long way from their front gates .

		It is a folio of over two hundred pages , whose plates exhibit the best features of nearly fifty American country-places , scattered from
Maine	LOCATION	to
California	LOCATION	and from
Massachusetts	LOCATION	to
North Carolina	LOCATION	.

		The owners ' and architects ' names are generally given , and a plan of the estate often sup - plements the pictures of its most attractive aspects .

		All the houses are of the more pretentious kind of country-seat , such as ''
Blair	PERSON	Eyrie '' at Bar Harbor and '' Biltmore '' at
Asheville	LOCATION	; but they are artistic rather than showy , and prospective builders may get many hints from the book , even though they may be working on a much smaller and less ambitious scale .

		The only text is a brief and very suggestive introduc - tion by Mr.
Donn Barber	PERSON	, who packs into three pages a tremendous amount of information about the status and development of American architectm-e and landscape gardening , and puts the reader in the way of appreciating and profiting by the pictures .

		The book is edited by Mr.
John Cordis Baker	PERSON	and published by the
John C. Winston Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The press - work is excellent , and the decorated linen binding both substantial and attractive .

		Whittier 's '' Snow-Bound , '' a classic American poem if there is one , has been many times illus - trated , but a new pictorial edition of it needs no apology when it is as beautiful as the one issued this season by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Drawings by Messrs.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	,
John J. Enne	PERSON	- king , and
E. H. Garrett	PERSON	; a number of photographs , the work of Mr.
Herbert W. Gleason	PERSON	and others ; and floral decorations for cover and pages by Mr.
Adrian J. lorio	PERSON	, combine with superior printing to make a book of unusual artistic charm and merit .

		Another American classic to receive the tribute of tasteful illustration this year is
Longfellow	LOCATION	's '' Song of
Hiawatha	LOCATION	. ''

		This is issued by the
Bobbs	PERSON	-
Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	in large octavo , with pictures by Mr.
Harrison Fisher	PERSON	and decorations by Mr.
E. Stetson Crawford	PERSON	.

		The latter take the form of symbolic designs printed in pale green underneath the text , and giving an odd but pretty appearance to the pages without rendering them in the least illegible .

		One opens the volume with some distrust of Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	's ability to depict Indian character and legend ; we have come to associate him rather with the charms of the modern girl and her train of handsome and well-tailored admirers .

		But examination of the
Hiawatha	LOCATION	illustrations reveals an unexpected vein of mysticism and poetic sentiment , combined with a strong dramatic quality that is also new .

		Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	's Indian faces would perhaps be hard to duplicate on a reservation , -- but neither do Long - fellow 's Indians live in the commonplace humdrum world of reality : so there is no lack of sympathy between pictures and text .

		There is one full-page drawing , usually printed in colors , for each of the parts of the poem , and two smaller ones , which are equally suggestive and spirited .

		Altogether the new edition of `` Hiawatha '' is as pretty a gift-book as one could wish .

		We have long wonderetl how it is -RSB- -RRB- ossible to pi'o - duce j -RRB- ublications so luxurious in make-up and at the same time so inexpensive as the '' special numbers '' issued from time to time by '' The International Studio '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Nearly every modern process of reproduction is laid under lavish contri - bution in the pictorial equi -RCB- -RRB- ment of these volumes , while in tyjwgi-aphy , paper , and presswork they put to shame many art publications issued at several times their cost .

		The two latest numbers have for their subjects `` The Art Revival in
Austria	LOCATION	'' and `` Old English Country Cottages . ''

		The text of the former consists of fom * essays , by different hands , dealing with this interesting movement in its various phases of art , architectxire , and decorative art .

		There are over two hundred fine illustrations , many in pho - togi'avure and color .

		-- The book of '' Old English Country Cottages '' is an attempt to preserve some record of these antique buildings that form one of the chief charms of rural
England	LOCATION	.

		They are dealt with in the text by counties ; and while no attempt has been made to cover the subject thorouglily , a most interesting general outline has been achieved .

		Some 135 pen-and-ink drawings by Mr.
Sidney R. Jones	PERSON	, depicting general views and architectural detail with charm and marked artistic skill , are scattered through the text ; and in addition there are fifteen beautiful full-page plates in color , after paintings by Mrs.
Allingliam	PERSON	and others .

		Both of these volumes appear under the editorial direction of Mr.
Charles Holme	PERSON	, and doubtless it is to his fine taste that their excellence is due .

		Choicer gifts for an art-loving friend , at so modest a price , could not be found .

		`` Rosemary in Search of a Father '' -LRB-
McClure	PERSON	-
Phillips	PERSON	-RRB- belongs to the class of light and anmsing novelettes which seem to be sufficiently popular nowadays to engage the attention of more than one of our cleverest writers of fiction .

		Rosemary , with her pathetic insight into the affairs of her elders and her no less pathetic eagerness to set them right , is as charming a little person as has lately appeared in the world of fiction .

		The Angel , the
Fairy Fa	ORGANIZATION	- ther , and the Cockney nurse-maid
Jane	PERSON	, are all delightful , while the Rose Girl adds a spice of adven - ture to the tale , and the inevitable motor-car lends
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 397 a characteristic touch to the plot .

		Six charming illustrations by Mr.
William Hatherell	PERSON	, some tasteful decorations , and a gay cover , combine with the charm of the storj - to make this an eminently pretty and suitable Christmas gift-book .

		Another book of the same type is • ' A Maid in Arcady '' -LRB- Lippincott -RRB- , written by ^ Ir .


Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	, whose • • Kitty of the Roses '' and • ' An Orchard Princess '' many readers will remember with pleasure .

		The new story is longer and some - what more substantial than its predecessors , but equally graceful and amusing .

		The hero is a brief - less but ambitious young barrister oflf on a holiday with his motor-car .

		which , by opportunely breaking down , puts its owner in the way of discovering Arcady and its presiding genius .

		The Maid is both elusive and mysterious , as well as being , according to her own account at least , a very designing young person .

		But everything ends happily , and the two retire to
Arcady	LOCATION	, where , presumably , they live hap - pily for ever after .

		Mr.
F. J. von Rapp	PERSON	's colored pictures of the Maid , the hero , and their haunts , are unusually soft in coloring and careful in finish .

		Par - ticularly pretty are the little sketches which are occasionally , but not so often as to grow monotonous , Wgnetted into the generous margins .

		The cover is pretty and unique .

		Of the many delightful Christmas stories of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	, none is fidler of the joyous aban - donment to the good cheer that
Christmas	DATE	brings than his account of the
Pickwick Club	ORGANIZATION	's holiday fes - tivities at the Manor farm .

		Remembering that the • • Pickwick Papers '' were originally published in monthly instalments , the
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	have felt justified in printing the Christmas chapters by themselves in a handsomely bound and lavishly illustrated holiday volume .

		Mr.
George ^ VJfred Williams	PERSON	, who last year furnished the pictures for another Dickens Christmas book , contributes an in - teresting preface in support of his theory that the time has come when a realistic combination of the serious and the comic may fitly replace the extrava - gant caricature that was the only humorous style known to
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's original illustrators .

		Ten full - page plates , several of them in color , and a number of small line - < li-awings , present the Pickwickians and their friends , as well as the goblins of Mr.
WartUe	PERSON	's tale , in spirited and felicitous fashion .

		If the older generation clings to the
Pickwick Club	ORGANIZATION	that it remembers , younger readers , who are often repelled by the coarse humor of Leech and '' Phiz , '' will undoubtedly prefer Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's gentler methotls and more pleasing effects .

		A `` Thin Paper '' edition of classic poetry has been launched by
Messrs. Thomas Y. CroweU & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		with eight volumes , containing respectively the com - plete poems of
Burns	PERSON	.

		Keats ,
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Long	LOCATION	- fellow , and
Whittier	LOCATION	.

		and a selection from the work of
Browning	PERSON	.

		Each volume is provided with an introduction , generally in the form of a biographical sketch , with a few notes , and in some cases with an index to fii-st lines : and each has a photogravure portrait of the author , rubricated titie-page , deco - rated end-papers , and a silk marker .

		All are printed in fair-sized type on verj - thin paper , of good quality , and are uniformly bound in calf - finished limp ieather with gold stamping .

		The small size and dainty fin - ish of the edition will appeal to a large class of holi - day shoppers in search of a good and inexpensive book with a Christmas air about it .

		-- Issued by the same publishers , and similarly bound , printed , and embellished , except that the frontispieces are not authors ' portraits , are the • ' Thin Paper Two Volume Sets , '' of which five tides have so far been pub - lished , -- '' The Count of ^ lonte Cristo , '' • •
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' ' • Les Miserables , ''
Boswell	PERSON	's '' Life of
Johnson	PERSON	, '' and
Carlyle	PERSON	's '' French Revolution . ''

		Each of these works is ordinarily issued in from two to five good-sized volumes ; whereas in the thin paper edition they take up , box and all , no more room on the shelves or in a travelling-bag than the ordinary - novel .

		Yet the tj-pe is of good size and the print clear .

		Ever since the days of - ^ Isop and Reynard the Fox , the humorist , whether author or artist , has found an inexhaustible source of inspiration in the comic correspondences between the human and the animal world .

		Mr.
E. Warde BlaisdeU	PERSON	's animal drawings are conceived in the spirit of the fabulist ; that is .

		the satiric purpose is always evident , and his beasts , despite their fur and feathers , are more than half human .

		The new collection of Mr.
BlaisdeU	PERSON	's drawings , entitled '' Animal Serials '' and published by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is large octavo size , with appropriately humorous decorations on cover and end-papers .

		The serials are pictoriaL with just a word of running comment .

		They depict the foibles and fancies of Mr. and Mrs. Rabbit ,
Miss Hippo	LOCATION	- potamus , Colonel Lion , and the other beasts , in such telling fashion that it will be a faultless reader indeed whose pet failing is not satirized somewhere in the breezy pages of the book .

		-- Mr.
BlaisdeU	PERSON	's pictures are also a feature of Mr.
Burges Johnson	PERSON	's • • Beastly Rh \ - mes , '' which seem even funnier nowthan they did when they appeared without pictures in ' • Harj > er 's Monthly . ''

		^ Ir .

		BlaisdeU shows his versatUitj - by his pleasing delineations of the
Kinkajue	PERSON	, the
Aoudad	LOCATION	,
Gnu	ORGANIZATION	, and the Okap ^ .

		which are quite as satisfactory as his soulful drawings of the
Glad Young Chamois	ORGANIZATION	, the Large Oyster , the Fireside Elephant , and other fairly familiar beasts .

		Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's animal verses are as amusing in their way as his `` Rhymes of Littie
Boj	ORGANIZATION	's '' were in another fashion .

		The obvious comparison , which is not at aU to Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's dis - advantage , is with 3Ir .


Gelett Burgess	PERSON	, who furnishes a characteristic rhyme by way of introduction .

		-- Mr.
Frank Ver Beck	PERSON	's • • Book of Bears '' -LRB- Lippincott -RRB- is chiefly pictorial in its appeal , for the comment in verse and prose is not half so teUing as the Ulustrations which it accompanies .

		The volimie is dedicated to the '' poetical , fantastic , idealistic painter of animals , F , S. Church , '' with whose work Mr.
Yer Beck	PERSON	's has a close kinship , though it possesses also a distinct and pleasing individuaUtj - .

		A dainty Ulustrated edition of Mr ,
Kipling 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		398 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, '' They '' has been issued by Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will be recalled that when this story first appeared its curious combination of realism and mysticism , of flitting ghosts and thundering motor - cars , called forth a whirlwind of criticism , ranging from unmeasured praise to jeering scorn .

		Each reader had his own theory of the story 's meaning , which it was the dearest object of his life to force upon his friends .

		Thus , for reasons both intrinsic and extrinsic , the little story has been very popular , and has been translated into many tongues .

		Holiday buyers will welcome the first illustrated edition of it , with a decorated cover and fifteen colored plates by Mr.
F. H. Townsend	PERSON	, whose pictures are cer - tainly ornamental , if they do not go far toward elucidating the elusive mysticism of the tale .

		The printing is in large clear type , on one side of each page only .

		Full of breezy originality are '' The Adventiu'es of Joujou '' -LRB- Lippincott -RRB- , as Miss
Edith Macvane	PERSON	relates them .

		Joujou is the only daughter of the wealthy but bom-geois -RSB- -RRB- roprietor of Perfumery Poizelle , the shop Avith the largest gold sign and the finest crystal windows in all the
Rue de la Paix	ORGANIZATION	.

		Being but lately emancipated from a convent , she finds life at her father 's Norman chateau higldy diverting and ro - mantic .

		Her efforts to enjoy herself and to mai-ry the man she loves -- who happens , of course , to be her family 's bitterest enemy -- are ably seconded by an American girl who comes to the chateau to visit and opportunely falls in love with
Joujou	ORGANIZATION	's intended husband .

		INIiss
Macvane	ORGANIZATION	's style is piquant and tell - ing , and the story has atmosphere and vivacity .

		Some of the illustrations , which are by Mr.
Frank Ver Beck	PERSON	, are clever , but the color printing is poor .

		The book is gaily l -RRB- ound and decorated in red .

		One can scarcely imagine more alluring material for illustration than is furnished by Mr.
George W. Cable	PERSON	's '' Old Creole Days , '' or a more distin - guished and delightful method of utilizing the ma - terial than that of Mr.
Albert Herter	PERSON	in the new illustrated edition recently issued by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		Eight full-page pictures and foiu '' - teen smaller ones are beautifully reproduced in photogi'avure .

		The mechanical features are all of a high grade of excellence , and the volume has an air of dignity and beauty that well fits the charm of the contents .

		* ' A Japanese Blossom '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is the title of
Onoto Watanna	ORGANIZATION	's new book , which , like the others that have preceded it , is a simple and yet dramatic little story of life in old
Japan	LOCATION	, with the inevitable complication produced by an incongrvious American lover or husband .

		But while the situation may be tragic enough for a while .

		Miss Watanna always brings it to a happy ending , even when it involves , as it does in '' A Japanese Blossom , '' the horrors of war and the necessity of reconciling a family of little Japs to the strange ways of an American step - mother .

		The style of this publication is similar to that adopted for
Miss Watanna	LOCATION	's other books -- a dainty floral cover design , tinted page-borders sug - gestive of the oriental setting , and several illustra - tions in color .

		Readei-s , old and young , seem never to tire of Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	's child-verses .

		This year the
Bobbs-Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a delightful holiday edition of '' When the Heart Beats Young , '' a title that includes all the best of INIr .

		Riley 's child - verses , with many pictures in color by
Ethel Franklin Betts	PERSON	.

		The little folk of this artist are merry , red-cheeked country boys and girls , who wear pinafores and `` jumpers , '' torn straw hats and gingham sun-bonnets , and whose hands and feet are evidently quite as active as their imaginations .

		The pictures are pretty and appropriate , and fully within the comprehension of child readers .

		The mechan - ical features of the volume are excellent , with the exception of one very patent error in the printing of the title-poem .

		Every year Mrs.
Blanche McManus Mansfield	PERSON	's designs for the leather covers of the little `` Thumb - Nail Series '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- grow more artistic and satisfying , and every year the editors of the series hit upon exactly the right sort of thing to be re - printed in miniature volumes .

		This time their choice has fallen upon
Emerson	PERSON	's Essays on '' Friendship '' and '' Character , '' which are prefaced by Miss
Emma Lazarus	PERSON	's appreciation of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's personality ; upon Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	's `` The Man without a Country , '' with Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's introduction written in the year of our war with
Spain	LOCATION	and his preface to the edition of
1897	DATE	; and upon '' The Proverbs of Solomon , '' which are introduced by the illuminating chapter on '' The Proverbs of the Hebrews '' from Dr.
Lyman Abbott	PERSON	's `` The Life and Literatm-e of the Ancient Hebrews . ''

		It would be hard to imagine a more suitable gift for a fastidious book-lover than one of these dainty little reprints .

		In her preface to '' Fairest Girlhood '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , Mrs.
Margaret Sangster	PERSON	apologizes for adding to the multitude of books written especially for girls by explaining that she knows so many of them all over the world , and is so intimately acquainted with all their hopes and ambitions that she is , as it were , especially privileged to write for them . ''

		Fairest Girlhood '' is made up of a series of essays , aptly named and entertainingly written , dealing with many of the problems that beset the modern girl , -- from what to wear and what to say , to the larger issues of health , happiness , education , and the choice of a vocation in life .

		Mrs.
Sangster	PERSON	is a modern woman , and therefore has a strong sympathy for the modern girl and a real understanding of her needs and aspirations as well as of her possible limitations .

		The cover of this volume is especially pretty , and so are the drawings of various types of girlhood , by
Griselda Marshall McClure	PERSON	.

		Of whimsical booklets , meant merely for the diver - sion of an idle hour , the season has produced its full quota .

		Quite the cleverest that has come to our notice is Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	's '' Little Book of Bores '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Mr.
Herford	PERSON	has discovered twenty-four species of Bores , one for each letter of
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		399 the alphabet .

		His rhymes and pictui-es -- for !

		Mr.
Herford	PERSON	is as usual his own artist -- are inimitable .

		One may be assured of finding all his enemies and most of his friends among the Bores -- and jxjssibly he may discover himself there .

		-- '' The Altogether New Cynic 's Calendar for
1907	DATE	'' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- appears in its familiar dress of checked gingham , and is compiled and decorated , as usual , by -RSB- ^
Irs	ORGANIZATION	.


Ethel Watts-Mumf ord Grant	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	, and Mr.
Addison C. Mizner	PERSON	.

		On the whole , the twisted proverbs seem hardly as clever as usual , which is perhaps natural considering the di'ain that several previous years has made upon the collaborators .

		It is a pity that one vulgar illustration has been allowed to disfigure an otherwise amusing little book .

		-- Similar in conception to the '' Cynic 's Calendar '' is `` A Cheerful Year Book '' -LRB-
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with verses and aphorisms by i \ Ir .


F. M. Knowles	PERSON	, pictures by Mr.
C. F. Lester	PERSON	, and a prologue and epilogue by MLss
Carolyn Wells	PERSON	.

		Besides contrib - uting to the gaiety of its readers , this book fm-nishes three or fom '' lines wherein they may record the doings of each day , inspired to cheerfulness in the recital by the illustrated motto on the page opposite .

		It is not too much to say that anyone with a sense of humor will enjoy the ' • Cheerful Year Book '' ; its jests are merry without being in the least vulgar .

		-- '' Cigarettes in Fact and Fancy '' -LRB-
Caldwell	PERSON	-RRB- is a collection , made by Mr.
John Bain , Jr.	PERSON	, of the prose and poetry of cigarette smoking . ''

		The How and Where of Them , '' '' Puffs of Poetry , '' `` Facts and Fancies , '' '' Rings Blown in Rhyme , '' and '' My Lady and the Cigarette . ''

		are the titles of the five sections under which the material is grouped .

		The ardent defense of the cigarette , and its glorification in lighter vein , will please its devotees .

		The make - up of the book Ls attractive '' Knick-Knacks , '' from the press of the
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a compilation of amusing anecdotes , for which , -- so Mr.
Coggins	PERSON	, the compiler , assures us , -- he has raked , pii-ate-fashion , every craft sighted on journal - istic seas .

		Alternate pages of the book contain illus - trations of the anecdotes , by
Clare Victor Dwiggins	PERSON	.

		-- From the same publishers comes '' Wise and Otherwise , '' another collection of anewlotes and bon mots , which have been compiled by Mr.
W. M. Rhoads	PERSON	and illustrated by iVIr .


A. R. Bowker	PERSON	.

		The imique feature of the book is its flexible leather • cover , which , in shape as well as in decoration , simu - lates an owl .

		-- `` The Book of Spice , '' by * ' Ginger , '' -LRB-
John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is aptly described on its title - page as '' a work recommended to Sufferers who are tired of dipping their Daily Bread in the -RSB- MiIk of Human Kindness , and whose diet recjuires a Dash of High Seasoning ; Recklessly Ulusti-a ted . ''

		`` Gin - ger 's '' humor is naturally of an exuberant , not too carefully pruned or assorted type : but at its best it is really spicy .

		The '' reckless '' iUusti-ations are very funny , and the style of binding is unique .

		Daintily bound in blue and gold , with marginal dj-awings to match , and nine tinted illustrations ,
Messrs. A. C. McClurg	PERSON	`` feCo .

		's new illustrated edition of
Max Mailer	PERSON	's '' Memories , '' in Mr.
Upton	PERSON	's grace - ful translation , is indeed an elegant and tasteful re - print The pictures and decorations are by Misses
Margaret	PERSON	and
Helen Maitland Armstrong	PERSON	, whose artistic work needs , at this time , no introduction .

		Thus adorned and beautified , this quaint idyl , with its interesting old-world setting and its universal pathos , is notable among the choicer gift-books of the season . ''

		Colonel
Crockett	PERSON	's Co-operative Christmas '' -LRB-
George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a holiday novelette of the conventional type , varied in this case by the introduction of rather more novelty and less prob - ability than are customary in similar narratives .

		Mr.
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	is its author .

		Holly sprays on the cover , Christmas trees and Christmas puddings on the end-p -RRB- apers , two or three tinted illustrations , and pen-and-ink sketches in the wide margins , give an appropriate air of festivity to the little book .

		Notes .

Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		A text-book of '' Rhetoric and English Composition , '' by Professor
George Rice Carpenter	PERSON	, is published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and adds one more to the lengthen - ing list of excellent manuals for the teachers ' use .

		It is based , in substance , upon an earlier work of the author . ''

		Everyday Ethics , '' by Miss YAla ,
Lyman Cabot	PERSON	, is a book intended for schoolroom use , and appears to be an unusually sensible work of its kind .

		It is a book that any child might read with profit if it were not forced upon him in the form of '' lessons . ''

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		Messrs.
George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a second edition of '' The Bravest Deed I Ever Saw , '' being a col - lection of personal experiences by many writers , edited by Mr.
Alfred H. Miles	PERSON	.

		Among the contributors are
Lord Roberts	PERSON	, Admiral
Dewey	PERSON	, the Hon.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	, Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	, and Mr.
Frederick Villiers	PERSON	. ''

		The Value of Love '' is an anthology of brief pas - sages in verse and prose , prepared by the late
Frederic Lawrence Knowles	PERSON	, and now offered to the public under the sponsorship of Mrs.
Louise Chandler Moulton	PERSON	, who supplies it with an introduction memorial of its com - piler .

		The volume is a tasteful example of holiday book-making , published by the
H. M. Caldwell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's ''
William Blake	PERSON	: A Critical Essay '' was published
forty years ago	DATE	, and has long been out of print .

		He has at last sanctioned a new edition -LRB- or rather a reprint , for no changes are noted -RRB- , and of this Messrs.
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American publishers .

		It is a very welcome book , and all the more so because it comes at a time when there are many indications of a renewed in erest in
Blake	LOCATION	.


Richard Hildreth	PERSON	's ''
Japan	LOCATION	as It Was and Is , '' a semi - classic of a half-century ago , is still held in such esteem that Mr.
Ernest W. Clement	PERSON	has thought it deserving of a new edition .

		This he has prepared , with many supplementary notes , and the two volumes of the work in its present form are published by Messrs.
A. C. Mc	PERSON	-
Clurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are many illustrations , and there is also an introduction by Dr.
W. E. Griffis	PERSON	.

		Mr.
George Roe	PERSON	is the latest of those who , greatly daring , have followed after
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	in translating
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	.

		His version aims at a middle course in satisfying the claims of both letter and spirit .

		He contributes of his own an introduction and many learned notes .

		Marginal references indicate the location of the quatrains in other translations .

		The book is published in tasteful guise by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		A
First Book of Poetics	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Miss Martha Hale Shackford	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. B. H. Sanborn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a very small book , and a very elementary one , which makes the words on the title-page , '' for colleges and advanced schools , '' rather puzzling .

		A child should hardly be permitted to get into college without knowing considerably more about the subject than may be learned from this primer of poetics .

		Mr.
Peter Eckler	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	, publishes a volume called '' Last Words on Evolution , '' by
Professor Ernst Haeckel	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a translation by Mr.
Joseph McCabe	PERSON	, of a series of three lectures given by the author in Ber - lin , for the special purpose of replying to some of his latest theological critics .

		These lectures were delivered a little over a year ago , and it is interesting to note that only once before -LRB- in
1868	DATE	^ had the author ever addressed a popular audience .

		A selection of the '' Podsies Choisies de Alfred de Musset , '' edited by Mr.
C. Edmund Delbos	PERSON	, has been added to the '' Oxford Higher French Series , '' and is HOW published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		Other recent French texts are Pailleron 's '' L'Etincelle , '' edited by Professor

Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Les Cent Meilleurs Pofemes -LRB- Lyriques -RRB- de la Langue Fran -LRB- jaise , '' selected by
M. Auguste Dorchain	PERSON	, is a pretty little book published by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		One must not take a title like this too critically ; what the book really gives us is an anthology comprising a hundred pieces from
Charles d'Orl	PERSON	^ ans to
Heredia	PERSON	and Verlaiue , chosen for the most part with judgment , and chronologically arranged .

		French poetry would doubtless offer a hundred others '' equally as good . ''

		After an interval of four years , Professor
Edward G. Browne	PERSON	has published the second volume of his '' Lit - erary History of
Persia	LOCATION	. ''

		The period covered is from the beginning of the eleventh century to the middle of the thirteenth -- roughly speaking , from
Firdawsi	LOCATION	to Sa ` di .

		This is , of course , the richest period of all , and the volume is for that reason more generally interesting than its predecessor , although it is so weighted by the enormous erudition of the author as to be anything but light reading .

		It is expected that a third volume will complete the work .

		The publication belongs to the '' Library of Literary History , '' of which Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons are the American publishers .

		`` The `` Story of the Rocks and Minerals of Wiscon - sin , '' by Mr.
Publius V. Lawson	PERSON	, is sent us by the
Post Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Appleton	LOCATION	,
Wis.	LOCATION	.

		It presents in popular form the results of geological surveys of the state , and has many illustrations .

		This is a very useful book for educational purposes , and represents a type that we wish might be multiplied until a similar work for every state and territory in the country should be provided .

		Since the rock-formations of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	are the most archaic in the
United States	LOCATION	, it is quite proper that they should be first to receive such treatment as this .

		We may add that the author has himself done much useful work in the geological field , the results of which are here incorporated .

		The master-minds of the world go to their making , -- the greatest of living thinkers , workers , story-tellers , poets , and artists .

		One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand .

		By limiting oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year , all but a very small portion of the field is overlooked .

		C.The only sensible plan is to buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the things one wants most to see .

		This plan has been made practicable by What 's in the Magazines , a monthly publication which renders the mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy every-day reader .

		Each issue presents a bird 's - eye view of the maga - zine-contents of the month , with the aid of which one may gain in ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as though he had personally examined a copy of each .

		C .

		It is not a mere list of contents ; neither is it a complicated and confusing library index .

		Everything is arranged and classified , simply but exactly ; whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ - ers or merely looking out for good things in general , the arrangement is equally convenient .

		C .

		It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine - land , -- a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell ; and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person .

50 cents	MONEY	Q OCIOLOGY is a science in the making .

		It is also a ferment that is ah-eady helping to unmake the ^ individualistic theories of life which have dominated all moral doctrines for more than a century .

		People who are beginning to take notice that there is something wrong , either in their social philosophy or in the facts ; people who suspect that we have not yet found out the whole meaning of life , should look into the work of the sociologists .

		They are not building air-castles .

		They are doing their part toward making real analysis of life more specific , more systematic , and more comprehensive .

		This Journal , now in its twelfth volume , is not the organ of a theory of social reform .

		It is a clearing-house for the study of the facts of life according to a certain method .

		This method is examination of the workings of human interests , from their most elementary reactions in contacts of two persons , up to their largest combinations as institutions or civilizations .

		During the
last century	DATE	, analysis or abstraction of phases of phenomena has been carried to an extreme .

		The sociological method aims to supplement analysis of social relations with such synthesis that social interpretation shall cover the actual experiences of life rather than mere phases of life that have no separate existence .

The University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	was the - ^ idea of publication .

		To combine the vast amount of printing incident to a university with the publication of text-books , monographs , and , especially , journals for the promulgation of the results of the research of its own faculties and of investigators throughout the world , seemed an ideal well worth attempting to realize .

		That the founders planned wisely the experience of the fourteen years that have elapsed since the organization of
The University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	has amply demonstrated .

		During this period not only has it issued hundreds of books and pamphlets bearing its imprint , but its journals , under the editorial management of the various dejiartmental faculties , have everywhere become recognized as standard publications in their respective fields and as clearing-houses for the ripest scholarship at home and abroad .

ELFORD E. TREFFRY Since	ORGANIZATION	the last appearance of a reliable encyclopedia of familiar quotations many authors then unknown have come to be widely quoted , while many quotations then familiar are now known only to the erudite few .

		The cleaning out of ibis dead ijuood and substituting for it the actually familiar quotations of more recent ivriters - iXias one of the main ideas in the compilation of this nenu encyclopedia ; the immortal quotations , honuet ` er , are here given full justice .

		In spite of the omission of obsolete material this encyclopedia contains quotations from over one hundred more authors than does the best similar work .

		This work is more convenient than some older volumes of similar character owing to its exhaustive index -LRB- giving all the important words of a quotation instead of the first only -RRB- and to its arrangement by subjects instead of by authors .

		This will prove of great value to those seeking embellishment of essays , speeches , etc. .

		THE sociologists are working on the clue that human association -- or '' the stream of life , '' as it was called a generation ago -- is a process , made up of lesser processes , down to the v anishing of social relations in movements within the individual consciousness which make the problems of psychology .

		The goal of the sociologists is a statement of life in terms of the ultimate processes which are working out through the different incidents of human experience .

		Some of the sociolog ^ ts prefer to describe their work as a return to the ideal of social study proposed bv
Adam Smith	PERSON	, but developed by him only in the economic division of human activities .

		In the philosophy of the author of
The Wealth of Nations	ORGANIZATION	the activities prompted by the wealth interests were merely one of several departments of hiunan pursuits .

		In his scheme , accordingly , economic science was only one of an indefinite number of social sciences which must be worked out and correlated in order to furnish an adequate chart of actual social processes .

		For nearly a century the economic fraction of social science was culti - vated as though it were the whole .

		Sociology is not a rival of economics .

		It is essentially a method of investigation , with the aim of making the other social processes as intelligible as the economists have made the processes which terminate in the production of wealth .

		This Journal is a medium of publication for both general and special studies of social relations , as they appear from this pomt of view .

		NOTES 462 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 463 THE LOVE-T HEME IN FICTION .

		Enter , woman .

		Immediately the world begins to brighten and bustle and sparkle .

		Man 's Eden with - out Eve would be a dirty place , full of tobacco smoke .

		Nay , if it had not been for the urging of the ever-womanly he would have been content with cocoanuts and a strong tail to swing himself from tree to tree .

		All that man really wants of his own accord is to knaw at a great shin of beef , knock some other man 's brains out with the bone , and then plunge into meditation on the What and Why and Where of the universe .

		But his sweet tormentor appears , and he has to clean and dress himself and cultivate the courtesies of life , and turn his talents to practical account in order to furnish her with barbaric wealth of gold and gems .

		This essay is predicated on the fact that there is some difference between men and women , and that the sexes equally acknowledge this and are willing to do their duty in the station of life to which it has pleased Grod to call them .

		This view is not altogether fashionable to-day .

		Perhaps it was not fashionable in the
Athens	LOCATION	of old , when Aristophanes wrote his Lysistrata and Ecclesiazusm and Tkes - mophoriazusce ; or in
Alexandria	LOCATION	, when
Hypatia	LOCATION	preached rebellion to her girl acolytes .

		A lost tragedy of .

		^ ^ chylus is foimded on an incident which shows that even in mythical times the question of woman 's place and rights was to the front .

		The story is to the effect that the women of an island in the
Archipelago	LOCATION	rose one night and killed all their male relatives to the last child .

		That was thorough , and might be commended to our modern ladies .

		On the other hand , there is a novel by Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	called '' The Revolt of Man , '' which describes 440 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, a future revolution against the power of women .

		It is well to get these abnormal situations out of the way before beginning on our proper study .

		Man 's idol-worship of woman springs partly from his long years of submission to and reverence for his mother , and partly from the instinct for beauty which nature has implanted in him .

		The girl , in her grace and charm and softness and modesty , is a mystery to him .

		He is imperiously compelled to account her a higher being than himself .

		Her glance inspires him .

		His tongue is attuned to eloquence and wit ; his limbs
spring	DATE	forward for deeds of emu - lation or valor .

		That is the Sacred Love of the great painter .

		In its highest manifestations it be - comes the devotion of Dante for Beatrice or
Michael Angelo	PERSON	for
Vittoria	LOCATION	.

		On a lower but still high level it is the theme of most of the love poems of the world .

		Mixed with a good deal of Profane Love , it is the common stuff out of which domestic life is fashioned .

		The
South Sea Islander	LOCATION	, having wor - shipped his misshapen image of stone or wood for a year or so , takes it down , gives it a good thrashing , and then sets it back upon its pedestal and worships it some more .

		Men do this , mentally at least , with women ; for the need of adoration remains to the end .

		There is a question whether such romantic love as I have described is not a comparatively recent invention .

		It certainly does not come out strongly in Greek literature , where woman seldom finds her - self dominant , except in the case of
Helen	PERSON	, whose power is attributed to a goddess behind her .

		But the
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	, perhaps in its original state one of the oldest of human compositions , is the very ecstasy of romantic love .

		The questions of the purity and faithfulness of woman , and her consequent influence over men , are worked out in this poem as they might have been by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	or
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		And the same is true of
Kalidasa	ORGANIZATION	's Sakuntala , and even of '' The Toy Cart , '' though the heroine of this last piece is a courtesan .

		The power of woman to charm and inspire and lead man to the heights is probably as old as human nature .

		In the literature of the south of
Europe	LOCATION	-- leaving out
Dante	PERSON	and
Petrarch	PERSON	-- it is not much in evidence ; while the
Scandinar	PERSON	vian and Celtic literatures fairly blaze with the glory of this power .

		Siegfried and BrunhUd ,
Deirdre	PERSON	and
Naoise	PERSON	, the men and women of the Arthurian le - gends , are perfect exponents of romantic love .

		And the supreme poet of the North has given expression to a score of varieties of imaginative passion , from the tender fooling of
Orlando	LOCATION	and
Rosalind	PERSON	, the jealousy and devotion of
Posthumus	PERSON	and
Imogen	PERSON	, up to the blighted adoration of Othello 's gi-eat heart .

		Goethe is a good second in painting the overwhelm - ing power of good women over strong men .

		And with
Wagner	PERSON	, the devotion of woman is the redemp - tion of man .

		Sensuousness , as MUton saw , is the very essence of poetry .

		MUton himself , and his master Spenser , are perhaps more sensuous in their painting of the nude -- the nude touched , too , with passion -- than any other of our poets .

		There is no doubt they did i right .

		But is sensuality a proper subject for lit - erary treatment ?

		This is the sole meaning of all the discussions about morality in art .

		Nobody objects to the use of other evil agencies -- envy , hatred , murder , theft , and so forth , -- in fiction .

		It would be impossible to write a
Sunday	DATE	school story of two pages without some bad habit or vice in it .

		But Profane Love , the illicit relations of men and women , -- is that a fit subject for print ?

		The prints we see the most of -- the newspapers -- are full of it .

		I do not see why we should prevent great artists from using such matter , if they want to .

		In the first place , it is full of power , and crea - tive artists will seek power wherever it is to be found .

		In the second place , the Earth-spirit of Lust is the foil or complement to the
Divine Spirit of Love	ORGANIZATION	.

		He keeps the latter from becoming too thin and aerial , or too false and pompous , and sets him off in true relief .

		You can not paint a picture with white paint on a white canvas .

		All colors and shadows must enter into the composition of a pic - ture of the world .

		Personally , I prefer the creed of
Lovelace	PERSON	's lines , '' I could not love thee , dear , so much , Loved I not Honour more , '' to the creed of
Browning	PERSON	's poem , `` The Statue and the Bust . ''

		I prefer the girls of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to the problematic women with an unproblematic past who flourish in contemporary plays .

		But all are part of the show of the world , and I do not know where to draw the line between Moli ^ re 's '' School for Wives '' and
Casanova	ORGANIZATION	's Memoirs , be - tween
Goethe	PERSON	's `` Wilhelm Meister '' and
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's Contes Drolatiques , between ''
Tom Jones	PERSON	'' and Zola .

		The very worst of such books soon correct themselves by causing a surfeit , and we return with greater love to the pure delineations of imaginative passion .

		If love is the sun that vivifies the world , friend - ship is the moon and all the stars .

		In Greek lit - erature it has practically thrust love out of doors .

		The friendship of Achilles and Patroclus is a nobler and more beautiful thing than the love of
Paris	LOCATION	and
Helen	PERSON	.

		Orestes and
Pylades	PERSON	are examples of a bet - ter feeling than the hot and selfish love of man and girl .

		And the sisterly friendships of Antigone or Electra stretch down to us across the years with calm and healing charm .

		What situations there are in earth 's records of the friendship of men for men , of women for women -- or of men and women for each other !

		That circle of orators and poets and philosophers around
Pericles	LOCATION	; those other circles around
Augustus	LOCATION	, or Louis the Fourteenth , or the
Duke of Weimer	ORGANIZATION	;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's tavern companions ; Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's club , and a myriad other coteries , -- how they stand out in the light of
Time !	ORGANIZATION

		The world owes a great part of its good work to the mutual admiration and mutual help of friends .

		Of course the modern epic of friendship is `` The Three Mus - keteers '' of
Dumas	PERSON	.

		Courtship may be considered as the duel of sex .

		There is probably nothing in the world so proud
1906	DATE	-RSB- .

		THE DIAL 441 and self-sufficient as a high-spirited young girl .

		She will patronize the Pope , or pat a pyramid on the head .

		Before she can be brought to surrender , tamed to submission , there is verge and scope enough for great comedy .


Mirabell	ORGANIZATION	and MUlamant 's love-chase in
Congreve	ORGANIZATION	's `` Way of the World , '' and Di
Vernon	PERSON	's treatment of her rather loutish lover in
Scott	LOCATION	's novel , are examples .

		On the other hand ,
Rosalind	PERSON	's wooing of
Orlando	LOCATION	gives the woman as the aggressor ; and Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	has developed this theme to its full , and rather more than its full , extent .

		Desire without requital is a noble theme , albeit one that carries with it a slightly ridiculous air .

		In the old-fashioned novels the maiden pines away and the lover goes into the army and leads a forlorn hope .


Michael Angelo	PERSON	's love for
Vittoria	LOCATION	is an instance in real life .

		Tennyson 's '' Maud '' is per - haps the most thorough-going instance in modern poetiy .

		The whole theory of the Troubadour life and the later Courts of Love was based on this idea .

		Quarrels , reconciliations , love intrigues , the oppo - sition of circumstance , -- these are the spice of half the fiction of the world .

		The fact that the course of true love never did run smooth is a providential enactment for the sake of plot and situation .

		Few plays could get beyond the first act , few novels beyond the first chapter , if it were not for this quality in the constitution of things .

		Shakespeare pleasantly ridicules the whole matter in • ' The Mid -
summer	DATE
Night	TIME	's Dream '' with Puck 's ironical com - ment , `` What fools these mortals be I ''
Poe	PERSON	thought that the death of a beautiful and beloved woman was the highest theme that poetry could attempt .

		He has expressed it in `` The Raven '' so as to thrill all the world .

		But this matter prop - erly belongs to another study .

		Woman is the joy-giver .

		A great part of the realized happiness of life comes through her .

		Books that end well end in marriage .

		Yet it is the antici - pation of happiness which comes out most in litera - ture .

		Wedding songs are short .

		I can not recall any play or poem or novel which is one long epithalamium .

		Perhaps they would be dull .

		Woman is the guardian of life .

		As mother , nurse , guide , teacher , she holds a great place in literature .

		Andromache smiles to us across the centuries with Astyanax on her lap .

		Medea is an instance of per - verted maternity .

		Shakespeare is full of mothers -- the tragic
Constance	PERSON	,
Lady Macduff	PERSON	, the mother of
Perdita	LOCATION	,
Countess Rousillon	PERSON	, and many more .

		One of the most truthfully drawn mothers in fiction is Mrs.
Pendennis	PERSON	; and one of the most enchantingly portrayed is Lady Castlewood ,
Esmond	ORGANIZATION	's second love .

		Beyond and above all , there is the Mother of Christ to whom art and song have done homage for two thousand years .

		Woman is the organizer of the social pageant .

		SKe is the principle of cohesion which brings together the male atoms that would otherwise fly apart .

		And though without a hundredth part of man 's instinct for beauty , or his taste and power of conception and exe - cution , she compels him to bring all these gifts to her service ; she makes him build her beautiful houses and furnish them fittingly ; she makes him invent exquisite fabrics for her to wear , and dig up gems wherewith to adorn her .

		More than this , she turns him -- man himself , the
Orson	LOCATION	of woods and caves -- into an exquisite , into a courtier , into a dandy .

		Osrick and
Beau Brummel	PERSON	are her creation ; so are the wits and beaux that flourish in a thousand com - edies and novels .

		Finally , woman is the maker of home .

		I hardly know whether this can be considered a separate theme , though such poems as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's `` Hermann and Dorothea '' and
Burns	PERSON	's ''
Cotter	PERSON	's
Saturday	DATE
Night	TIME	'' really express the sentiment of home more than anything else .

		And the same sentiment dominates '' The Vicar of Wakefield . ''

		The home-making in - stinct is indeed almost the dominant one in woman .

		She goes about building her nest as inevitably and almost as unconsciously as a bird .

		This instinct peeps out of
Imogen	PERSON	's action in her brother 's cave ; it accompanies
Deirdre	PERSON	on her flight in
Alba	LOCATION	; it sits prettily upon Eve in her paradisiacal bower in
Milton	LOCATION	's epic .

		In a myriad interiors of a mj-riad novels and poems , woman sits enthroned the queen of a limited but imdisputed domain .

		The best kind of love , as I have tried to show , is based upon sacrifice .

		We bring presents of flowei 's and fruits to our idols , we offer up burnt sacrifices , and finally we yield them our hearts and lives .

		This kind of service can be given to other objects than women .

		We are rooted , almost as trees are , in the soil from which we
spring	DATE	; our frames are built out of its elements ; we bear the badge of its clime upon our brow .

		And love of country , patriotism , is the natural outcome .

		Literature is full of this theme .

		In the narrow states of
Greece	LOCATION	, duty to the state was almost the first obligation of life .

		Antigone is refused permission to bury her brother because he has sinned against his native land . ''

		The Persians '' of ^ schylus is a chant of triumph for Salamis .

		Virgil 's epic was written with the one view of the eternal emblazonment of
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Shakespeare 's En - glish histories were inspired by a like purpose -- at least , many of their most splendid passages breathe the fire of passionate love .


Walter Scott	PERSON	may almost be said to have created
Scotland	LOCATION	by his intense patri - otism .

		The theme of country love is treated by
Schiller	PERSON	in his '' William Tell '' and by Goethe in '' Egmont . ''

		There are innumerable other works in which it is the dominant note .

		Love of mankind -- philanthropy -- is in some sense a modei-n feeling .

		It is of course an ingredient in some religions -- the Buddhistic and Christian , -- but national and racial hatreds kept it long in check .

		It really seems to be a special growth of our times .

		Lessing 's '' Nathan the Wise '' is almost the earliest docimaent of it .

		--
Rousseau	PERSON	's propaganda the most effective one .

		The final scene of the second part of '' Faust '' is a summing up of philanthropy ; Hugo 's
Xes Miserahles	LOCATION	is an immense expression of it .

		Frankly , the sentiment is almost too vague and 442 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, vast to be a good theme for fiction .

		The love of fame , of glory , dictating heroism and personal action of various kinds , is a better one .

		Hotspur , impa - tient of the hour in which he could not fight , aspir - ing to pluck bright honor from the drowned moon ;
Falconbridge	ORGANIZATION	, pushing into the quarrel of kings ;
Cellini	PERSON	, sacrificing his metal household implements to fill out the mould of his Perseus ;
Chatterton	LOCATION	, fighting for fame in his garret , -- these are vivid and distinct figures of appeal .

		There are various oddities of love which may form a sort of comic afterpiece to this study .

		Such are the love of animals pushed to excess , the love of bric-a-brac , the collector 's mania , and so forth .

		Squire Western probably cared more for his dogs and horses than he did for
Sophia	LOCATION	, and
Scott	PERSON	's Antiquary certainly loved his black-letter ballads better than his niece .

		There is a delightful French story , '' The Porcelain Violin , '' which gives the collector 's mania to the life .


Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		The
Atlantic Monthly	LOCATION	's fiftieth birthday is an occasion for cheer to all who care for what is best and highest m our literature .

		It was in
November , 1857	DATE	, that this most distinguished of American magazines , under
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's editorship and with a staff of contribu - tors many of whose names are now famous in literary history , made its appearance in
Boston	LOCATION	, then the un - questioned literary and intellectual centre of the country .

		Stanehly true to national and especially
New England	LOCATION	traditions and ideals , without sensational or pictorial allurement , and with no very material changes in form or character , this modestly but tastefully clad monthly has for half a century held to its even and dignified course , enjoying a reputation for sanity and restraint , for refinement of manner and devotion to what sweetens and inspires and elevates , such as no other American magazine can claim .

		Scanning the roll of those associated with its honored past , and bearing in mind those of a later generation who are now bearing onward the torch , we feel that it is not too high praise to rank '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' by itself , in a class where there is none to hold even the second place .

		Announcements for the coming year give warranty that the old excel - lence of the magazine will suffer no decline .

		A special feature will be a series of articles by its living ex-editors , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	, and Mr.
Page	PERSON	, and by a few of its earliest contributors , notably Professor
Norton	PERSON	, Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	, and Mr.
Trowbridge	PERSON	.

		Not many are left who recall the appearance of the first issue of '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' with its ruffed portrait of Governor
Winthrop	PERSON	, and its imprint of
Phillips	LOCATION	,
Sampson & Com	ORGANIZATION	- pany , on the cover ; but these will cherish the memory of its honored past , while wishing for it even greater good and higher honor for the future .

		• • • A RETREAT FOR LITERARY WORKERS and other brain - weary and world-weary folk , -- a sort of conventual settlement of a non-religious kind , -- is planned by a Swiss gentleman named
Bignami	PERSON	.

		In a circular out - lining his project he invites those who feel a craving for retirement and isolation , and an opportunity to com - mime with their souls in quiet , to join him and others like-minded in forming a community , whose exact location seems not yet determined .

		Weariness of the struggle and discord and aimless rush of modern life , he argues , makes necessary such a retreat , and he hopes to gather together a congenial group of tired workers , literary men , joiu-naUsts , artists , scientists even , to enjoy fraternal intercourse in an atmosphere of tolerance , liberty , and friendliest brotherhood .

		This permanent or temporary colony , forming itself into a happy inter - national family , may perhaps engage in some artistic or Hterary labors , even publish a magazine or books ; but its main purpose is to find rest and spiritual refreshment , and a
Ufe	ORGANIZATION	of peace .

		Experiuients of this sort , though often tried and seldom or never successful , will always appeal to certain ardent souls who seek some means of making life better worth the living than they have found it in '' the rush , the hum , the shock of men . ''

		• • • Another author of the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	plays has been discovered , and now it is the Shakespeare-Bacon -
Rutland	LOCATION	controversy .

		A German scholar .

		Dr.
Bleibtreu	PERSON	, informs the learned world that the Earl of
Rutland	LOCATION	-LRB- 1576-1612 -RRB- -- who spent some years in
France	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, studied law at
Padua	LOCATION	, went on a mission to Den - mark in
1603	DATE	to represent
James I.	PERSON	at the baptism of the Danish crown prince , and employed his spare time there in getting up the local color for '' Hamlet , '' ac - tually meeting Rosencrantz and Guildenstern meanwhile -- wrote the plays and poems falsely attributed to '' the low comedian ,
William Shakespeare	PERSON	, who regularly got drunk at the Mermaid Tavern , '' and who for abundant convincing reasons could not possibly have produced the works ascribed to him .

		Should doubt still remain in any mind , Dr. Tiu-szinsky , the distinguished German lit - erary critic , will dispel it in short order .

		He declares the evidence collected by Dr.
Bleibtreu	PERSON	to be irresistible .

		It probably is -- to him .

		And yet , in the face of it all , a goodly nmnber of scholars of repute still obstinately cling to the Shakespeare heresy .

		• • • The ready recognition of literary merit , and tha eagerness of editors and publishers to welcome genius whencesoever it may hail , is a theory often urged , though naturally a little difficult of belief to those whose con - tributions are rejected .

		Some doubter of this class re - cently tried the experiment of copying , with changes of personal and place names , one of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's most popular stories , and sent it out to ten leading magazines of this country , by all of which it was politely declined with no indication that the hoax was discovered .

		Fi - nally the very publishers who had originally issued the story , after gravely weighing its merits for seven weeks , sent the practical joker a letter of acceptance and a check .

		Of course the check was returned and the manu - script recovered .

		One offered explanation of the ten rejections is that although the fraud was detected the editors were too polite to mention so rude a thing !

		• • •
John Keats	PERSON	's will is passing , or will soon pass , under the auctioneer 's hammer .

		The bit of paper con - taining the poet 's autograph testament was enclosed in a letter to his friend and publisher ,
John Taylor	PERSON	,
Aug.	DATE	.

		14 ,
1820	DATE	.

		The letter asks that a passage to Leghorn -- the voyage that took
Keats	PERSON	to his death -- be secured for him .

		Another letter , written by
Joseph Severn	PERSON	, the faithful friend who tended the poet on his death-bed , a portrait sketch of the dying man , also by Severn , a lock of the boy
Keats	PERSON	's hair , and the letter to

		THE DIAL 443 pauy the will .

		The short aud simple directions of the letter are as follows : '' My Chest of Books divide among mv friends .

		In ease of my death , this scrap of Paper may be ser ^ - ieable -LSB- sic -RSB- in your possession .

		All my estate real and personal consists in the hopes of the sale of books published or unpublished .

		• ■ • JXTDGIXG LITERATURE THROUGH THE NOSE is a method applied by a
New York	LOCATION	reader -- a woman .

		In select - ing her books from the library , it is said , she follows her sense of smell .

		A nose for news we have all heard of ; a nose for novels and poems and memoirs and histories is less common .

		Only books that smell of tobacco will suit this robust feminine reader ; and the stronger the nicotine exhalations , the better .

		A whiff of - musk or vio - let or heliotrope wafted to her nostrils would condemn a volume at once ; it would mean that the work was read only by women , and is not for her .

		The formula is simple : strong odor of tobacco -- strong literature ; delicate feminine odors -- weak namby-pamby stuff .

		Clearly , this woman has once been a girl , and longed to do the things and read the books her big brothers did ; and now the child is mother of the woman , and she im - proves her chance .

		We once knew a publisher 's reader who rejected a MS. , without even untying the package , on the ground of smell -- the combined fumes of rank tobacco and bad whiskey which it exhaled making too obvious the nature of the inspiration under which the romance or poem was composed .

		It was not this literary expert 's nose , it now appears , but his judgment , that wa.s at fault .

		If the odoriferous work could have been issued in all its original flavors , it woidd certainly have found favor in the eyes -- or rather in the nostrils -- of this discriminating
Xew York	LOCATION	reader .

		But are there enough noses like hers to make it worth while for pub - lishers to cater to them with their literary wares ?

		• • • A BIOGRAPHY OF
Hermas Melville	PERSON	, the first and per - haps still the best of the
South Sea	LOCATION	romancers , the charm - ing friend aud visitor of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, aud on the whole a man much to be admired , is forthcoming .

		His daughter .

		Miss
Elizabeth Melville	PERSON	-LRB- Fourth Ave. and
Eighteenth St.	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- is asking for letters by and reminiscences of her father , to be used iu preparing his biography .

		Juvenile conservatism in the matter of literary liUngs should make the once favorite '' Typee , '' '' Omoo , '' and '' Moby Dick '' still good '' sellers '' in the book market , although just now they appear to be outstripped by later creations of the same order but of inferior merit .

		Possibly a life of
Melville	ORGANIZATION	will do something toward re - storing these old-time favorites to their deserved place .

		• • • The probable effects of a gexeral cheapening OF BOOK-PRICES is an interesting point of discussion in the '' book war '' still raging in
London	LOCATION	.

		In urging the desirability , even for commercial reasons , of cheaper books , the '' Times '' adduces some interesting facts .

		It appears that in the past year a yoimg
London	LOCATION	pub - lisher , not of the '' Trust , '' secured a novel from each of twelve well-known authors -LRB- six English and six American -RRB- and published these books in a style equal to that of the ordinary 31.50 novel , but at a retail price of
fifty cents	MONEY	; and though the profit to all concerned was small on each copy , the low price sent the sales up to a figure that made the aggpregate gains unusnallv large .

		A still more striking example is cited in the enormous sale of ''
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	'' in cheap editions issued by a score of American publishers in the days before international copyright .

		The commercial prac - ticability of cheap editions of popular books has often enough been proved in scattering instances ; but a gen - eral great reduction could hardly insure correspond - ingly increased sales on all books .

		There is a limit both to the reading appetite and to the fvmd available for book-buying .

		The instances alleged by '' The Times '' might , we suspect , appear less convincing after a little scrutiny .

		The American editions of ``
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	, '' besides despoiling the author of her rights of royalty , were usually issued in such wretched form that , although sold for little , it was about all they were worth .

		And the concept of a copyrighted novel issued in the style of the ordinary § 1.50 novel , yet sold at a retail price of
fifty cents	MONEY	, may be acceptable to the somewhat heated intellects of the '' Times '' champions , but will hardly bear the test of the cold arithmetic known to the solvent Book Trade .

		Cheap paper and binding , and authors ' pittance , may not cost much , but they do eost ^ something .

		• • • To SYNDICATE THE PUBLIC LIBRARIES is a plan nOW proposed by
Librarian Canfield of Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		A scheme of cooperation somewhat after the plan of a commercial trust is held to be necessary in order to cope with the outpour of books and cover the literary field economically and without needless duplication .

		By specialization and a division of labor , the libraries of a large citv ' could doubtless increase their collective effi - ciency ; and this plan is already in partial operation in
Chicago	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	, and elsewhere .

		But somehow this movement seems impleasantly domi - nated by the same spirit that uses in reference to it the words '' syndicate '' and '' proposition . ''

		Perhaps it is not unfortunate that the smaller communities must still depend on their one librarj - , which , in an eclectic man - ner and within modest limits , wUl continue to aim at encyclopaedic comprehensiveness , and whose quiet al - coves the '' syndicate proposition '' has not yet invaded .

		• • • Genius for PERVAsn ^ ENESs in the world of let - ters is in a fair way to make Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	a for - midable rival even to the ubiquitous Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's emergence from the shelter of anonymity to acknowledge the authorship of one successful book after another , has prompted '' Pimch '' to declare him responsible for the '' Apocalypse , '' thus settling a dis - pute centuries old . ''

		The
House	ORGANIZATION	of Quiet '' -LRB- now in its tenth edition -RRB- , which was cordially commended in these pages on its first appearance about three years ago , '' - The Upton Letters , '' also most favorably noticed by hs , and '' The Thread of Gold , '' more recently urged upon our readers ' attention , are now admitted to equal rank and honors with ''
Walter Pater	PERSON	, '' '' From a Col - lege Window , '' and other of Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's signed works .

		Prophetic vision can be cheaply claimed after the flood - tide of popular approval has set in ; but it is gratifying to be able to point to printed proofs of critical appreci - ation of the above-named books in the days of their unknown authorship and comparative obscurity .

		Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's books seem to find favor with American readers , as appears from the announcement of new editioq ^ of his '' House of Quiet , '' with an author 's introduction , and of '' The Gate of Death , '' soon to be issued in this countrv .

		444 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Cb Mtta looks .

		More of the
Pke-Raphaelite Brotherhood	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The last briefs of the
Pre-Raphaelite Brothers	ORGANIZATION	are fast being turned in .

		Early this year the long awaited autobiography of the venerable Mr.
Holman Hunt	PERSON	was published ; and a most interesting supplement to it has been furnished this
autumn	DATE	in the very complete exhibition , in
London	LOCATION	, of Hunt 's pictures and drawings .

		Now come the personal reminiscences of one of the two surviving Pre-Raphaelites , Mr.
William Michael Rossetti	PERSON	, who , though he never realized , or apparently much tried to realize , the ex - pectations of the ''
P. R. B.	PERSON	'' that he might be - come an active and productive member of their painters ' guild , has certainly proved himself a competent champion and expounder of the faith .

		The '' Reminiscences , '' so Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	points out in his preface , make the eighteenth volume in which his personal recollections , `` more espe - cially as affecting other members of the family , '' have appeared .

		In fifteen out of the preceding seventeen volmnes ,
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	is the subject ; either some phase or other of his ver - satile genius is under discussion , or editorial and introductory matter is supplied for some of his poems or letters .

		Thus Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	may safely be accounted in some measure responsible for the fact , so deeply deplored by Mr.
Holman Hunt	PERSON	, that
Dante Gabriel	PERSON	's work , with its ex - travag-ances and vag-aries corresponding to those of its creator , has been so much in the public eye , and that he has generally been considered , on the mistaken authority of his brother and other prejudiced persons , the originator and best exponent of Pre-Raphaelitism .

		As was jjointed out in our review of
Holman Hunt	ORGANIZATION	's autobiog - raphy , already referred to , the whole dispute rests upon a vital difference in the understanding of the term Pre-Raphaelitism .

		Granted Mr.
Hunt	PERSON	's definition of the term , he is undoubtedly correct in considering himself the first and the best Pre-Raphaelite ; but he certainly does not use the word as
D. G. Rossetti	PERSON	and his followers used it , nor as the public has come to under - stand it .

		Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	does not revert to the old debate in this his latest volume .

		He seems to feel that his last word upon that , as upon many other matters , lias already been said , and he is apparently anxious not to be open to the • Some Reminiscences of William
Michael Rossetti	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated .

		charge of vain reijetition .

		He places a list of his previous contributions to
Rossetti	PERSON	literature in the preface to the present volume , and occa - sionally refers the reader to one or another of them for information concerning relatives or associates .

		The specific aim of these reminis - cences is to detail the facts of their author 's own life , which though uneventful was not without interest , and to hang upon this thread of auto - biography any recollections of personages of public importance which have been hitherto un - recounted .

		It may as well be admitted first as last that the general tone of these memoirs is a little dis - appointing .

		Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	is so afraid of saying something that he has said already , as well as of seeming either to blow his own trumpet or to cast undue blame on someone else , that his chapters decidedly lack color and movement as compared with much of his previous writing .

		The reason for this is probably two-fold .

		The fact that these are his last words makes him anxious that they shall be well-considered and discreet , and also that they shall omit nothing of possible value .

		The result is that his tone , always moderate , becomes almost painfuUy re - served , and that he includes many trivial ree -LRB- jl - lections too scant or superficial to be of any particular interest , but which load his biography with meaningless detail .

		Again , Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	is not used to holding the centre of the stage : that place belonged to his brother
Dante Gabriel	PERSON	, and after him to his sister
Christina ; William	PERSON	was too shy , as well as too good a judge of his own attainments , to desire or claim it .

		But by the plan of this work he is forced to focus at - tention upon himself , and he accordingly grows self-conscious and his style becomes formal and stilted .

		Nevertheless , we could ill have spared this biography .

		There are pages of discerning criticism and delightful reminiscence , and there are occasional illuminating phrases ; while the very defects of the book are faults for which we esteem its author .

		Exaggerated reserve is better than violated confidence or petty malice .

		Con - sidering the tone of much that has been said and written about
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	and his circle , it is small wonder that liis brother should prefer to err on the side of reticence .

		In regarding Mr.
William M. Rossetti	PERSON	as the convenient and accommodating scribe of the ''
P. R. B.	PERSON	, '' it must not be forgotten that his literary career had wider affiliations -- that the ill-fated '' Germ '' was far from being ty | -RRB- ical of his journalistic connections .

		It should be un - derstood that for forty-nine years , ending in
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 446
1894	DATE	,
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	held various appoint - ments in the
Inland Revenue Office	ORGANIZATION	, and it was only his not too abundant leisure that could be devoted to artistic and literary criticism , edito - rial work , encyclopaedia articles , and lecturing .

		To * ' The Critic , '' '' The Spectator , '' ' • The Acad - emy , '' and `` The Athenaeum . ''

		he furnished numerous ^ e ^ ` iews and exhibition-notices , some - times as a staff contributor , at others as an occa - sional waiter .

		Outside of his long series of books alx -RRB- ut his brother , most of which belong to the last eighteen years , his most interesting editorial work was that imdertaken for an edi - tion of SheUeys poems .

		This led to a meeting and a subsequent warm friendship with
Edward John Trela	PERSON	\ s-ny , who is one of the most pic - turesque figures in the '' Reminiscences , ' and to interviews with Mrs.
Hogg	PERSON	-- J ^ e
Williams	PERSON	when Shelley addressetl poems to her -- and with
Clare Clairmont	PERSON	.


Rossetti	PERSON	also edited a selection of W hitman 's poems for English pub - lication , and was among the first critics to champion the cause of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	in print .

		For critical work ,
William Rossetti	PERSON	has some decided temperamental advantages .

		He is mod - est , tactfid .

		cool , and dispassionate , not enthu - siastic and yet tending to a favorable verdict rather than to the opposite .

		On the other hand , while a fair critic he can hardly be adjudged to have the mind of a great one .

		His judgment of men and books seems superficial ; his phrases seldom bite to the core of the matter .

		In clos - ing an account of a meeting \ rith
Clough	PERSON	, one of whose poems he had reriewed in '' The Germ , '' he says : '' • He -LSB-
Clough	PERSON	J treated his youthful critic with much courtesy , but our interview closed without my feeling that I had gained any great additional insight into his personality . ''

		The reader 's thought reverts to this sentence at the close of many of
Rossetti	PERSON	's related inter - views .

		On the other hand , when he says of
Madox Brown	PERSON	, - * He kept on at painting with a well-developed sense of being very scantily ap - preciated , '' or of Bume-Jones .

		• ' His nature had the musical ring of glass , not the clangour of iron , '' one feels his power of apt characteriza - tion .

		His account of the relation existing be - tween himself and
Dante Gabriel	PERSON	is singularly accurate and vi \ ` id , and he makes his onati rather curioiLS personality felt on every page of his biography .

		Between his literary work , his i-ather * • ad - vanced '' opinions , his relationship with
Dante Grabriel	PERSON	, and later \ rith ^ ladox
Brown	PERSON	, whose daughter he married ,
Rossetti	PERSON	had a verj ' wide circle of literary and artistic acquaintance , and a small circle of very choice friends .

		Of the latter he writes , as usual , most entertainingly ; it is a pity that he was not wise enough to omit all mention of the former except in those rare cases where he makes his miniature portraits both vivid and significant .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	belongs , of course , to the delightfid and delightfully portrayed • ' inner circle . ''

		One of Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	's best anecdotes concerns the storm of abuse that greeted the publication , in
1866	DATE	, of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Poems and Ballads . '' ''

		In
1868	DATE	Mr.
Legros	PERSON	exhibited in the Royal Acad - emy an excellent picture of some monks or friars at their repast -- called ' The Refectory . '

		There was a tabby cat painted in the picture .

		In that year was pub - lished a pamphlet of Notes on the art of the season .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	wrote one section of it , and I the other .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	-- who is a great lover of cats -LRB- a fancy which I share with him -RRB- , and also -LRB- a fancy which I only very faintly share -RRB- of serpents -- vrrote of this painted quadruped as ' a splendid cat . '

		The picture was bought -- presumably before SMrinbume 's euloginm had ap - peared -- by a person of some distinction .

		^ lany years afterwards , in
1895	DATE	, I had occasion to look at this painting in the house of the heir of the original pur - chaser .

		To my surprise , the cat had disappeared . '

		Why , ' said I , * there used to be a cat in that comer of i the picture . ' '

		Yes , ' replied the owner , * there was ; but my predecessor , on seeing that
Swinburne	PERSON	had found a good word to say for the eat , got her obliterated forth - with . '

		Such was the feeling of the enlightened British world for • Poems and Ballads ' and the author thereof . ''

		The account of
Dante Grabriel	ORGANIZATION	's enthusiasm for
Browning	PERSON	is amusing . ''

		My brother , by readings , recitations , and preach - ments , imposed
Browning	PERSON	as a sort of dog ^ matic standard upon the
P. R. B.	PERSON	, meeting the readiest response from
Woolner	PERSON	and
Stephens	PERSON	, and -LRB- it may be in a rather minor degree -RRB- from
Holman	PERSON	Hunt ;
Millais	PERSON	, so far as I can remember , was too busy with his own affairs to do much reading , whether of
Browning	PERSON	or of anyone , -- he was however a devotee of
Keats	PERSON	.

		Madox
Brown	PERSON	proved mainly recalcitrant ; to
Dante Gabriel	PERSON	's rather scornful indignation , he continued to uphold
Longfellow	PERSON	as the first of living poets , next to Tennyson . ''

		Of
Browning	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	says in part : '' Both by the tone of his talk and by his personal manner ,
Browning	PERSON	set you very much at your ease .

		To be conscious of your inferiority was , save for the fewest , at once right and inevitable ; but he did nothing towards screwing the consciousness into you .

		He seemed to be al \ s `` ays simply and straightforwardly himself : brilliant and many-sided , not by any direct endeavour , but be - cause this pertained to him .

		At all points he was vivid and alert -- the turn of his head , his footfall on the floor ... To say that
Browning	PERSON	was eloquent in talk would -- so far as my experience extends -- be going too far ; he was also not rhetorical nor long-winded in ex - position ; but his talk included most of the good qualities short of eloquence -- especially masculine acumen and versatile promptitude ... The time flew fast in his company .

		He spoke but little about himself and his poetry , but gave information freely when asked .

		* ' 446 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Mr ,
Rossetti	PERSON	relates a curious juclg-ment of
Brownino	ORGANIZATION	's to the effect that he considered
Tommaso Salvini	PERSON	's CEdipus '' the finest effort of art he had ever beheld ; not only the finest in the art of acting , but in any art whatsoever , including painting , music , etc. '' Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	adds that he made this extraordinary statement `` in a tone of entire conviction . ''

		For
Ruskin	PERSON	, Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	has nothing but liking and admiration .

		He pardons many things to an over-sensitive mind and to feelings '' somewhat strained and overstrained , and a little liable to take a contrary or perverse bias -- in the sense that , when there was every fair presumption and anticipation that he would be well pleased and affirmative , he turned out to be pimctilious and negative . ''

		In general , Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	seems to have kept as clear as was humanly possible of the acrid disputes in which his impetuous brother and irascible father-in-law were continually becom - ing involved .

		He refuses , as has already been said , to discuss any of these quarrels save one -- that with
Buchanan	PERSON	-- in the `` Reminiscences . ''

		He necessarily mentions some of them -- always with regret both for the trouble and the breaches of friendship that followed .

		Most keenly does he deplore the stand that
Madox Brown	PERSON	took when the firm of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	,
Marshall	PERSON	,
Faulk	PERSON	- ner
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	was dissolved .

		Owing to Mrs.
Wil	PERSON	-
liam Rossetti	PERSON	's sympathy with her father , it was impossible , or at least not easy , for Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	to see anything of the Burne-Jones and
Morris	PERSON	families afterwards . ''

		But , '' he adds , `` from first to last I had never any quarrel of my own with any member of this group of my old familiars . ''

		Mr.
Rossetti	PERSON	has undoubtedly given us , in other volumes , the cream of his recoUections of his gifted brother , and yet
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	is the most inspiring figure in these chronicles , and the chapter on the early days at Cheyne Walk is the most brilliant in the biography , as that period was probably the happiest in the life of the chronicler .

		Interesting and quotable is the account of the origin and gi'owth of the `` Jap - anese mania , '' of the old-furniture craze , of the prints , the '' pots '' and the '' beasts , '' which , among them , engrossed so much of
Dante Gabriel	ORGANIZATION	's time and attention .

		The famous wombat , it seems , was discovered in the zoolog - ical gardens by
William	ORGANIZATION	and
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	.

		They inspired
Dante Grabriel	ORGANIZATION	to examine its charms -- its `` fat lumpish look and want of sculpturesque form '' -- and he in turn sent
Burne-Jones	PERSON	upon the same quest .

		Mr.
William Rossetti	PERSON	cherishes no illusion , common to brothers of genius , that , given the opportunity , he might have ranked with
Dante Gabriel	PERSON	and
Christina	PERSON	.

		Considering that his verse woidd never be more than '' passable , '' and that his paintings would never get above careful mediocrity , he definitely , and apparently without regret , withdrew from the arena .

		He realizes that his literary vocations and his most interesting friendships were both in large meas - ure due to
Gabriel	PERSON	's influence on a retiring , self-poised character , prone to accept unques - tioningly its limitations and its humble destiny .

		He takes credit to himself that , despite
Gabriel	PERSON	's magnetic and somewhat overpowering personal - ity , his opinions were his own , and his decisions were made in conformity to them .

		He woidd be the last to question the statement th ^ t his own life is most interesting when viewed as a sort of didl gray background for
Dante Gabriel	ORGANIZATION	's brilliant career .

		The '' Reminiscences ' fill two thick but surprisingly light-weight royal octavo volumes .

		Many of the illustrations are unique and inter - esting ; other are already familiar .

		Figures from
Rome	LOCATION	's Golden Days .

		* Although not the most profound and scholarly among Roman archaeologists ,
Signor Rodolfo Lanciani	PERSON	is certainly the one who has done most to make the antiquities and discoveries in
Rome	LOCATION	comprehensible and interesting to the world .

		His gift of skilful presentation of facts , and his power to communicate something of the enthu - siasm which he has himself felt in turning up the soil of the old city , have made his numerous books about Ancient

		Now he offers a beautiful book upon closely-allied subjects , with the title '' Golden Days of the Renaissance in

		The cen - tral figures of the book are five : .

St. Peter	ORGANIZATION	's accomplished such wonders in rescuing
Rome	LOCATION	from the degradation into which it had fallen ;
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	and
Raphael	PERSON	, supreme in art ;
Vittoria Colonna	PERSON	, the most cul - tured of sixteenth century women ; and
Agostino Chigi	PERSON	, the banker whose splendid financial abilities and great wealth gave him the surname of '' II Magnifico . ''

		THE DIAL , 447 naissance , and it has been assumed that every obtainable fact in connection with their lives must have been alreatly many times retold .

		But it now appears that there is a great deal of com - paratively new matter deduced from researches anions : obscure documents or the resrJts of happy • • finds '' in imexpectetl places .

		The fascinating chapter on
Vittoria Colonna	PERSON	,
Marchesa di Pescara	ORGANIZATION	, is an illustration .

		The stories of this lady 's powerful intellect , sincere piety , purity of mind and body , and friendship with ^ lichelangelo .

		are assumed to be familiar knowledge .


Signor Lanciani	PERSON	takes up the ques - tions of her burial and the mysterious disap - pearance of the remains , which have baffled the inquirers of three and a half centuries .

		Dying in the convent of the church of Saint
Anna de Fimari	PERSON	at
Rome	LOCATION	, she requested in her \ vill that she shoidd be buried in that church .

		Docu - ments of the time show that her \ s ` ish was in part carried out , the body being enclosed in a wooden coffin coated with tar and left on the floor of the church .

		But such was the cowardly fear that seized all those who had been asso - ciated with the deceased latly in her work of the Italian Reformation , lest the Inquisition should mvolve them in the disgrace with which her memor -RCB- ' was threatened , that the coffin was abandoned Tsdthout any of the usual impressive ceremonies of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		At this point , all traces ceased .

		In
1887	DATE	, when the demolition of the old church was ordered to make room for a new street ,
Signors Lanciani	PERSON	and
Visconti	PERSON	were commissionetl by the City CoimcLl of
Rome	LOCATION	to oversee the work , and they watched the removal of exery brick and stone down to the level of the foundations .

		Not only was no coffin coated with tar found , but there was no grave at all .

		This confirmed the sur - mise that the coffin had been secretly removed from
Rome	LOCATION	when the posthumous proceedings against the Marchesa were initiated by the In - quisition .

		Search began in other cities asso - ciated \ \ dth traditions of the
Colonna	PERSON	family , but no clue was obtainetl until A \ - ithin the pres - ent decade .

		It is now settled beyond doubt that the remains of this typical great Italian lady of the sixteenth century , the dearest friend that
Michelangelo	PERSON	ever had , now rest in the sacristy of the church of
San Dominico Maggiore	LOCATION	at
Naples	LOCATION	, by the side of the beloved husband whose death preceded hers by twenty-two years , and in accordance with the often-expressed wish in her poems that she might be reunited to him in her last resting-place .

		The story of the find - ing of this long-lost bier reveals the scholarly ingenuity and patience with which archaeolo - gists , b -RCB- ' following slight clues , often reach the most brilliant residts .

		Financially , the most powerful man in the world of these golden days was
Agostino Chigi	PERSON	.

		Gifted by nature with keen insight and great tact in the art of tratling , before he was f ort ^ * years old he had made a name for himself that impelled republics and kingdoms , Christians and infidels , popes and sultans alike to seek his help in money negotiations and in collecting their revenues and customs .

		Strange as it seems , no complete pub - lished biography of this remarkable man exists .

		In a general way , we have known that he had boimdless wealth , that he fostered art and artists , and that many splendid monimients of his taste and generosity still exist in
Rome	LOCATION	-- such as Ra - phaels Sybils , in a chapel of the church of
Santa Maria	LOCATION	della Pace , the chapel of our Lady of
Loreto	LOCATION	in the church of
Santa Maria	LOCATION	del Popolo , and the casino and gardens of the Villa Fame - sina .


Signor Lanciani	PERSON	has gathered from MS. authorities many new details of the great banker 's life .

		The story reads very much like that of the '' seK-made man '' of to-day , and shows that in
Rome	LOCATION	of the sixteenth century , as in
America	LOCATION	to - day , a key of gold will unlock many doors .

		This man , who lived to see his name inscribed among the great patrician families in the Libro dOro , had no lineage worth mentioning , and started in business with a partner when their aggi'egate capital was but little more than two thousand dol - lars .

		From the first , he was a bold speculator .

		Even in our days of money kings and railway magnates , we have nothing to match the stories of his countless enterprises at home and abroad , and of his gorgeous style of li \ ` ing in his villa on the banks of the Tiber , now known as
Villa Famesina	ORGANIZATION	.

		At one of his Lucidlean feasts , to prove that the same silver plate was not Used tvs-ice in the course of me meal , the dishes were thrown into the
Tiber	LOCATION	; at another , each of the twenty ' cardinals or foreign representatives was served on silver and gold plate , bearing his par - ticular coat of arms , crest , and motto .

		\ N-ith such accuracy on the part of the butiers that not one mistake occurred in the course of the meal .

		Each guest also was served with fish , game , fruit , veg - etables , delicacies , and Avines peculiar to his own country , these supplies being brought to
Rome	LOCATION	by messengers timed to arrive simvdtaneously from the foiu * corners of the earth on the very eve of the banquet .

		But these tales of a loud and vulgar display of wealth are atoned for by
Agostino	PERSON	's great and enduring services to art .

		He was a bom 448 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, collector , and his various residences were filled with pictures , statues , bronzes , busts , until there was no room for more .

		His characteristic con - nection with art , as with business , was originality of concejjtion .

		He gave the inspiring note , and the artists adapted themselves to it to the best of their ability .

		He protected such artists as
Raphael	LOCATION	,
Perugino	ORGANIZATION	,
Giulio Romano	PERSON	,
Lorenzetto	LOCATION	,
Bramante	PERSON	,
Sodoma	PERSON	, even in the face of the ill - will of popes and cardinals .

		When
Leo X. dis	PERSON	- missed
Sodoma	PERSON	from his commission to paint certain rooms in the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	, and substituted
Raphael	PERSON	,
Agostino	PERSON	felt the offense to his protege as a personal one , and at once set him to paint - ing his own bedi'oom .

		The result was '' The Wedding of Alexander and Roxana '' -- one of
Sodoma	PERSON	's most delightful works , seldom seen , however , as visitors are not often admitted to the upper floor of the
Farnesina	LOCATION	.

		Rich as this period was in noble creations of art , we should have lost some of its gTeatest achieve - ments without the ideas and the purse of
Agostino Chigi	PERSON	.

		The remaining figures which appear in this book are scarcely less interesting , and the two opening chapters , on '' The City '' and '' Life in the
City	LOCATION	, '' give the proper setting to the whole .

		In a backward glance , due significance is given to the act of Pope Gregory XL -LRB- 1377 -RRB- in leav - ing
Avignon	LOCATION	and restoring to
Rome	LOCATION	the seat of the supreme pontificate , of which it had been deprived for seventy-two years .

		It is said that the young Pope was so affected by the transi - tion from the gay and refined life of
Avignon	LOCATION	to the horrors of
Rome	LOCATION	that he died the follow - ing year , and that his memory was treated with contempt , as that of a weakling , by the Romans .


Signor Lanciani	PERSON	takes the death of this man as the period marking the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of tiie Renaissance .

		The transition from one to the other was neither sudden nor noticeable at first , but the simple fact of the head of the Church havinsr asrain taken up his residence in the city of the
Tiber	LOCATION	, where himdreds and thousands of pilgrims were expected to assemble from every part of the globe each quarter of a century , not only saved the city from abandonment or final collapse , but gave it a new lease of life and helped it towards its moral and material regeneration .

		The many matters which
Signor Lanciani	PERSON	has taken out of their semi-obscurity in the Italian archives of learned societies and made available to the English reader , the many stories which he has himself aided in unfolding , entitle him to not a little gratitude .

		Thirty-one full-page plates and sixty-one illustrations , many of them from rare sources and here published for the first time , are worthy accompaniments of these charm - ing pages of text .

		The 8el,f-Revelatio -RSB- s ^ of IjAFCADIO
Hearx	ORGANIZATION	* The thrill of pleasurable anticipation awak - ened by the annoimcement of the publication of '' The Life and
Letters of Lafcadio Hearn	ORGANIZATION	'' finds its fulfilment in the delight afforded by the book itself .

		In it we are given that pro- foundly interesting thing , insight into a noble , sensitive , and refined human soul .

		The revela - tion is of course but partial ; more than that were impossible , for , as
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	himself has said in one of these letters , '' No man , as a general rule , shows his soul to another man ; he shows it only to a woman , -- and then only with the assurance that she wo n't give him away .

		As a matter of fact she ca n't : -- the Holy Ghost takes care of that ! ''

		In all the world of letters there are few char - acters more striking than that of
Lafcadio Hearn	ORGANIZATION	.

		His personality was unique .

		The story of his life is in many ways a pathetic one .

		Sel - dom has notable achievement been accomplished in the face of greater difficulties and discour - agements .

		For the most part , the root of these lay within himself .

		The disability caused by defective vision he surmounted ; his incapacity for anything connected with business shut him out from many things for which he greatly longed , and made his life-journey an unceasing struggle .

		Yet in all the bitter experiences of his early years , when ill and half - blind , cast adrift by his relatives , and sinking so low that for awhile he had to seek refuge in a
London	LOCATION	workhouse in a vile quarter by the Thames , he resolutely kept on with his studies and never allowed the fire he had kindled upon the altar of the imagination to burn dim .

		The life of a man so shrinking and retired could only be written by one who had been for many years one of his closest friends .

		Mrs.
Wetmore	PERSON	-LRB- better known as
Elizabeth Bisland	LOCATION	-RRB- has wisely let the story be told for the most part in
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's own words .

		The unconscious self - revelation in his letters , and the exquisite fragments of personal recollection that were found among his papers after his death , need little by way of supplement from the hand of • The Life and
Letters of Lafcadio Hearn	ORGANIZATION	.

1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 449 the biogi-apher .

		That little , despite some un - evenness of workmanship and the occasional use of a word in a A ^ Tong sense , has been done very well , and vnth imderstanding and sympathy .

		Four chapters , comprising about a third of one volume .

		-- that is all there is of the introductory sketch , and even that is largely taken up with extracts from
Heam	ORGANIZATION	's writings .

		The rest of the book is made up of his letters , placed by themselves without comment .

		This imusual arrangement has both its advantages and disad - vantages .

		The gaps seem more pronounced , the transitions more abrupt ; but at the same time the strength and variety and beauty of these wonderful letters are made all the more apparent .

		Mrs.Wetmore is fortunately able to add some details to what was previously known about Heams early years .

		He was born in
1850	DATE	, in the Grecian island of
Lefcada	LOCATION	, after which he was named .

		His mother ,
Rosa Cerigote	PERSON	.

		was a beautiful Greek girl , for whom his father , Sur - geon-Major
Charles Bush Heam	PERSON	, conceived a passionate attachment that led to a romantic marriage .

		For a few years Dr.
Heam	PERSON	and his wife lived together happily , but after he took his famil -RCB- - to
Dublin	LOCATION	there was an estrangement followed by separation .

		Mrs.
Heam	PERSON	abandoned her children and fled to
Smyrna	LOCATION	vnth a Greek cousin whom she afterward married .

		Lafcadio was sent to
Wales	LOCATION	to Dr.
Heam	PERSON	's aunt , Mrs.
Brenane	PERSON	, and never again saw either of his parents .

		.

		All his life he felt this deprivation .

		Long years after , he wrote to the younger brother from whom also he was separated and whom he did not see again : '' Aud you do not remember that dark and beautiful face -- with large , brown eyes like a wild deer 's -- that used to bend above your cradle ?

		You do not remember the voice which told you each night to cross your fingers after the old Greek orthodox fashion , and utter the words -- ' In the name of the Father , and of the Son , and of the Holy Ghost ' ? ''

		When I saw your photograph I felt all my blood stir , -- and I thought , ' Here is the imknown being , in whom the soid of my mother lives , -- who must have known the same strange impidses , the same longings , the same resolves as I !

		Will he tell me of them ?

		There was another Self , -- woidd that Self interpret This ?

		... Wliatever there is of good in me came from that dark race-soid of wliich we know so little .

		My love of right , my hate of wrong ; -- my admiration for what is beautiful or true ; -- my capacity for faith in man or woman ; -- my sensitiveness to artistic things which gives me whatever little success I have , -- even that language-power whose physical sign is the large eyes of both of us , -- came from Her .

		... It is the mother who makes us , -- makes at least all that makes the nobler man : not his strength or powers of calcula - tion , but his heart aud power to love .

		And I woidd rather have her portrait than a fortune . ''

		The grand-aunt by whom Lafcadio was brought up was the widow of a wealthy Irishman , and an ardent convert to
Romanism	LOCATION	.

		Nothing that Heam ever wrote is more precious than the attempts he made to recall something of his ex - periences during those early days when he livetl under her roof .

		One of them tells of an occa.s - ional A-isitor to the house whom he was taught to call '' Cousin
Jane	PERSON	, '' and of her startling ad - monition one gloomy
winter	DATE
morning	TIME	when she disc!Overed that the child had no comprehension of God . ''

		At once she caught me up , placed me upon her lap , and fixed her black eyes upon my face with a piercing earnestness that terrified me , as she exclaimed : '' `` My child !

		-- is it possible that you do not know who God is ? ' '' '

		No , ' I answered in a choking whisper . '' '

		God !

		-- God who made you !

		-- God who made the sun and the moon and the sky , -- and the trees and the beautiful flowers , -- - everything !

		... You do not know ? ' ''

		I was too much alarmed by her manner to reply . ''

		` You do not know , ' she went on , ` that God made you and me ?

		-- that God made your father and mother and everybody ... ' You do not know about Heaven and HeU ? ' ''

		I do not remember all the rest of her words ; I can recall with distinctness only the following : '' ' And send you down to Hell to bum alive in fire for ever and ever !

		... Think of it !

		-- always burning , burning , burning , -- screaming and burning !

		scream - ing and burning !

		-- never to be saved from that pain of fire !

		... You remember when you burned your finger at the lamp ?

		-- Think of your whole body burning , -- always , always , always burning !

		-- for ever and ever ! ' ''

		I can stUl see her face as in the instant of that utter - ance , -- the horror of it , and the pain ... Then she suddenly burst into tears , and kissed me and left the room . ''

		Lafcadio was then aged not more than six , -- passionate , sensitive , impressionable , and living in the dreamland of the imagination from which he never entirely emergetl . ''

		For the best of possible reasons , ' he says , ' • I then believed in ghosts and in goblins , -- because I saw them , both by day and by night . ''

		It is not strange , there - fore , that some time after the event just narrated Cousin Jane shoidd have appeared to him in an apparition .

		She passed him in the hall and went into a bedroom . ''

		I ran after her , calling out ' Cousin
Jane !	PERSON

		Cousin Jane ! '

		I saw her pass round the foot of a great four - pillared bed , as if to approach the window beyond it ; and I followed her to the other side of the bed .

		Then as if first aware of my presence , she turned ; and I looked up , expecting to meet her smile ... She had no face .

		There was only a pale blur instead of a face .

		And even as I stared , the figure vanished .

		It did not fade ; it sim - ply ceased to be , -- like the shape of a flame blown out . ''

		These memories of lus boyhood were recalled , he says , only with much effort , and in telling them there was the consciousness that his later 450 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, and `` more artificial Self '' was trying to speak instead of the Self that was .

		In these boyish imaginings no doubt the interest he always felt in the ghostly and supernatural had its incep - tion .

		A lesser mind would easily have been unbalanced by it , but he was too deep a thinker to be thus led astray .

		Mrs.
Brenane	PERSON	's efforts to make a Catholic of Lafcadio met with no success .

		He was sent for two years to a Jesuit college in
France	LOCATION	, and later to
Ushaw	ORGANIZATION	, the Roman Catholic college at
Durham	LOCATION	.

		While there he met with the great - est misfortune of his life in the loss of the sight of one eye .

		About the same time , his rejection of
Romanism	LOCATION	led to a complete rupture with his grand-aunt , and he was plunged at once into the direst poverty .

		How he lived and how he met this experience is told in a letter to one of his Japanese pupils . ''

		When I was a boy of sixteen , although my blood relations were -- some of them -- very rich , no one would pay anything to help me finish my education .

		I had to become what you never had to become -- a ser - vant .

		I partly lost iny sight .

		I had two years of sickness in bed .

		I had no one to help me .

		And I had to educate myself in spite of all difficulties . ''

		Somehow he made his way to
New York	LOCATION	, where he managed to exist for two years , `` griev - ously tormented by grim realities '' which he did not know how to surmount .

		So , he says , '' I tried to forget them as much as possible , and romantic dreams daily nourished at a public library helped me to forget . ''

		Although his outward circumstances were gradually bettered as the years went on , he never ceased to live this dual life .

		To the end , the visions in which he revelled were verities scarcely less tangible than the facts of daily experience .

		It was in one of his later years that he wrote : '' Always having lived in hopes and imaginations , the smallest practical matters that everybody should know , I do n't know anything about .

		Nothing , for example , about a boat , a horse , a farm , an orchard , a watch , a garden .

		Nothing about what a man ought to do under any possible circumstances .

		I know nothing but sensation and books . ''

		Another of the early reminiscences tells of the journey to
Cincinnati	LOCATION	, where he began his literary career as a newspaper reporter .

		In
New Orleans	LOCATION	, whither he drifted a little later , he found a congenial atmosphere , and oppor - tunity for the incursions into strange lore of all kinds that had ever a potent fascination for him .

		To his friend
H. E. Krehbiel	PERSON	he wrote : '' This is a land where one can really enjoy the Inner Life .

		Every one has an inner life of his own -- which no other life can see , and the great secrets of which are never revealed , although occasionally when we create something beautiful we betray a faint glimpse of it . ''

		But in time the charm wore off .

		The Eden of his dreams was always in the unattainable elsewhere .

		Once he found it for a little while when he visited the island of
Martinique	LOCATION	.

		And later , in
Japan	LOCATION	, he experienced for one brief year the joy of actual realization .

		This was at
Matsue	LOCATION	, where he went as a teacher in the
Government	ORGANIZATION	school .

		There , to his great delight , he found that the manners and customs of
Old Japan	LOCATION	still survived almost luichanged .

		There he found his wife , and there he spent what was perhaps the happiest period of his life .

		Before the glamour faded , loss of health compelled his removal to a place where the winters were less rigorous .

		The thirteen years that yet remained were spent in the
New Japan	LOCATION	which had for him no illusions .

		The super-sensitiveness of the artistic tem - perament is a heavy handicap in coping with the world .

		That temperament
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	possessed in marked degree .

		From \ asible beauty he was shut out by his extreme near-sightedness , and so he turned to the beauties of the intellect .

		He be - came a thinker and dreamer .

		His aim was the writing of poetic prose .

		The creative impulse of the artist compelled him to work and gave him a keen sense of the value of time .

		Work forced by necessity he hated ; yet it was in work that he found his chief pleasure .

		And his work was good .

		From the nature of their subjects , his books have had a narrower circle of readers than they de - serve ; but it requires no prophetic eye to per - ceive that as the years go on the permanence of their place in literature will come to be recog - nized , and more and more they wiU be valued for the aptness and lieauty of their phraseology , the singidar felicity with which words were found to convey the most delicate shades of meaning .

		It would be impossible to give in a few words any adequate impression of the rare quality of the letters that make up the larger part of this book .

		The range of subjects upon which they touch is as wide as life itself .

		They reflect the varying moods of the writer 's ever alert and well stored mind ; they tell of his hopes and fears , of his aspirations , his sensations and ideas , his views about men and books .

		They are philo - sophical and even humorous by turns .

		Not one among them is didl .

		But this is not the secret of their power .

		It is impossible to read them and not feel acquainted Avith the writer -- with the real man behind the mask .

		He is no longer a vagiie somebody known onlj ^ by name and reputation , but one with whom we have been in close personal contact through the magic of his facile pen .

		THE DIAL 451 Old Evelyx ix Holiday Attike .

		*
John Evelyn	PERSON	died , a very old man , in
1706	DATE	, lea \ ang behind him in the library at
Wotton	LOCATION	, among other manuscripts , an ordered series of memoirs .

		In
1814	DATE	the mistress of
Wotton	LOCATION	, \ sadow of
Evelyn	PERSON	's great-great-grandson , showed this manuscript , which she regarded as a mildly interesting relic , to a librarian named
Upcott	PERSON	, who had Ijeen commissioned to catalogue the
Wotton	PERSON	books .

		He secured permission to pub - lish the manuscript , turned it over to
William Bray	PERSON	, an antiquarian of standing , and in
1818	DATE	the first edition was published .

		The first edi - tion of
Pepys	PERSON	did not appear until
1825	DATE	.

		Bray 's final edition appeared in
1827	DATE	; and this version has l ^ een frequently reprinted .

		In
1879	DATE	Mr.
Henry B. Wheatley	PERSON	attempted to get access to the original manuscript , still at
Wotton	LOCATION	; but the incumbent
Evelyn	PERSON	refused permission , re - marking that • ' Colbum 's third edition | the
1827	DATE	edition -RSB- of the diary was very correctly printed from the MS. , and may l -RRB- e relied on as giving an accurate text . '

		The Colbum edition was consequently reprinted , with a Life and a Bibliography by Mr.
Wheatley	PERSON	.

		This version , • • in order to commemorate the two hundredth anniversary of
Evelyn	PERSON	's death . ' ''

		is now reprinted ^ ^ dth new illusti-ations .

		Mr.
Wheatley	PERSON	deplores , in his Preface , the impossibility of getting a complete edition of the Diary .

		He plainly im - plies that his own version is as nearly complete as can be had under present conditions .

		^ Ir .


Dobson	PERSON	's edition makes it clear that this implication , however ingenuous , is misleading .

		Upcott , the original discoverer of the
Diary	ORGANIZATION	, retained his interest in it all his life .

		He actu - ally compared the
1827	DATE	edition ^ dth the original manuscript , '' by which many material omissions in the earlier quartos were supplied , and other not imim -RCB- x -RRB- rtant corrections made . ''

		These la - bors were made use of by
Forster	PERSON	-LRB- the biographer of Landor -RRB- in an edition published in
1850	DATE	.

		This Ijecame the
Bohn	PERSON	text , and is the text upon which Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	builds his new edition . ''

		It woidd be going too far , '' says Mr.
Dob	PERSON	- son , with his usual caution , '' to claim the addi - tions of Upcott as of any signal importance , -- many of them , indeed , by
Forster	PERSON	's own admis - sion , consist of ' trifling personal details , ' and • The Diary of

		In four volumes .

		New York : Imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		they are practically confined to the earlier por - tion of the first volume .

		But
Forster	PERSON	's text has long enjoyed a deserved reputation ; it was de - clared by the • Quarterly Review , * as late as
1896	DATE	, to ' leave little to be desired '' : and being demonstrably the fullest , it has been adopted in the present case . ''

		Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	retains , and somewhat extends , the modernized spelling of the
Upcott	LOCATION	-
Forster	PERSON	text , -- a blessing for all concerned , since
Evelyn	PERSON	`` s speUing is mainly a matter of chance .

		In facsimile taken from manuscript , such aberrations are of whimsical interest ; but for the general reader they are a nui.sance .

		The original misspellings ai'e retained in the ^ Tieatley edition .

		But what gives Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	's edition its importance is less its text than its '' editorial equipment . ''

		Mr.
Wheatley	PERSON	contributes a re - spectable life of
Evelyn	LOCATION	, but is otherwise content to reprint Bray , notes and all .

		Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	i ^ Tites a much better life , or Introduction , as he calls it ; and most of the notes , which are char - acteristic and illuminating , are his own .

		These are modestly imprisoned in brackets , while the notes of Bray and
Forster	PERSON	, however modified , go free .

		The numerous appendixes are as truly illustrative as the pictures , which are admirable both in kind and in reproduction .

		It is to be said that the illusti-ations in JVIr .

		Wheatley 's edition are very nearly as good , though not so numerous .

		One does not quite understand why , with no appreciable difference in thickness of paper , size of type , or number of pages ,
Air	ORGANIZATION	.

		Wheatley should need four volumes octavo while Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	needs but three .

		Both sets are at - tractive in typography and general appearance ; Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	's being nearly identical with his recent edition of
Fanny Bumey	ORGANIZATION	.

		It has been my business to .

		speak hei-e of these two editions of
Evelyn	PERSON	rather than of
Evelyn	PERSON	himself .

		But in looking them over I have found an old impression of him somewhat deepened .

		For I have kept stumbling upon passages of such boyish enthusiasm , such childlike curiosity , such -LRB- if it must be said -RRB- womanish excitement over trifles , as to transport me incontinent into the heaven of trivialities and quiddities where dwells that cheerf id contemporary and sometime gossip of
Evelyns	LOCATION	,
Samuel Pepys	PERSON	.

		One is sorry that EveljTi did not find place in his memoirs -LRB- as Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	rightly calls them -RRB- for so much as a mention of the bustling friend who paid him such imgrudged tribute .

		It is common to contrast them as the reverend signor and the garnUous chronicler of small Ijeer .


Evelyn	PERSON	, the counti-y gentleman , putting himself in conscious 452 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, black and white , is a more formal , possibly a more dignified , person than our busy
Pepys	PERSON	, babbling to himself under his breath of the infinitesimal things which take up the lives of most men , but which most men are too sheepish to mention even to themselves .

		But there are seasons when
Evelyn	PERSON	also babbles delectably ; he has the true Pepysian delight in novelties and gimcracks , trick fountams , grottos , fire-eaters , '' arithmetical wheels , quench-fires , and new harps . ''

		In describing such portents as the great fire and the gi'eater plague , to be sure , he attains a note beyond
Pepys	PERSON	; but the likenesses between them are as striking as the differences .

		With such fresh heart , alert step , and inquiring eye , men made their way through the fog and the mire of that much-despised day .

		Alas , not even our great-great-great-grandfathers can now teach us the secret of that youth .

		Travel , outside the covers of a book , often dispels some very pretty illusions .

		Waller teUs her story of a winter spent at
The Hague	ORGANIZATION	, with excursions to the usual points of interest , all set off with illustrations from paint - ings and drawings , and printed and bound in handsome form .

		A prominent part throughout is played by '' James '' --
James Moulton	PERSON	, archi - tect , supposed to be the wi-iter 's husband and to be competing for the new Peace Palace de - signs .

		He helps to make conversation and to break up the page into invitingly short para - graphs with an attractive sprinkling of quotation marks .

		Inevitably there is considerable de - scription of Dutch scenery , urban , rural , and aquatic .

		If such things must be undertaken with pen instead of brush , the author is fairly successful .

		Of the young Queen she gives this picture : '' I sat nearly opposite to her -LSB- at the opera -RSB- for three hours , and I had time to stndy the face of this yonng royal ruler .

		... At eighteen she was a beauty .

		At twenty-six she had aged nearly twenty years from that youth .

		It is sad , pathetic almost , to see such a change ; for to the young , life 's cup should be brimmed to over - flowing .

		This is the ' divine right ' of youth .

		Poor little queen !

		Too yoimg to bear the burdens of a royal name and what it entails ! ''

		Something of the unfading charm of
Italy	LOCATION	is caught in the pages of
Miss Wharton	LOCATION	's '' Italian Days and Ways . ''

		Her readers do not need to be told that -LRB- to quote from her opening chapter -RRB- '' it is inspiring to travel with a woman , no longer young , to whom the world and its inhab - itants still wear ' the glory and the dream . ' ''

		This , of course , she writes in reference not to herself , but to the elder of her two companions , to the younger of whom she later acknowledges herseK to stand in the relation of '' chaperon and temporary guardian . ''

		These sketches of scenes and adventures in
Rome	LOCATION	,
Naples	LOCATION	,
Flor	PERSON	- ence ,
Genoa	LOCATION	,
Venice	LOCATION	, and elsewhere in
Italy	LOCATION	, are clothed in epistolary dress of an informal but always gi'acefidly fitting pattern .

		The pic - torial accompaniment is from photogTaphs , and is not confined to the famous and familiar .

		Of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	's '' Twilight '' and '' Dawn , '' the remark is made that '' they seem to be slip - ping off the pitiable pedestals which support them '' ; and
Ruskin	PERSON	is quoted , to whom these figures spoke '' not of
morning nor evening	TIME	, but of the departure and the resurrection , the twi - light and the dawn of the souls of men . ''

		The latest addition to Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	's '' Highways and Byways ' '' series takes the reader to the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	.

		The greater part of the book , as some will recall and as a note explains , has already seen the light in '' Outing '' and other periodicals .

		The author moves northward from
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 453 the river 's mouth to its head - waters , pressing the bulb of his camera at short intervals , until he has produced sixty-three excellent photographs of animate and inanimate nature .

		From the chap - ter entitled ''
Mark Twam	PERSON	's Country '' -LRB- Hannibal ,
Missouri	LOCATION	-RRB- the following wUi interest all readers : '' The house the humorist lived iii still stands -LSB- a pic - ture is given -RSB- and is much the same as it always was -- a stumpy , two-storj - , clapboarded dwelling close to the sidewalk ... The senior
Clemens	PERSON	had a printing shop upstairs in the L of the house , and as there were several children the li \ ` ing rooms must have beeu pretty well crowded . '

		All the family was the nicest people you ever saw , ' I was told ; ' but they were very poor and the father died bankrupt when Mark was twelve years old . '

		On the next street lived '
Huckleberry Finn	PERSON	, ' whose real name was
Tom Blankenshipp	PERSON	.

		... In actual life he and all his relatives were a very rough lot , and when he left town it was to go to the penitentiary . ''

		The Huckleberry Finn house , too , is still stand - ing .

		Supplementary notes for the guidance of travellers increase the book 's usefidness .

		Its double A ^ Tappers , paper and linen , are artistic , and the linen one is durable .

		Another illustrated travel series receives an attractive addition in Mr.
Frank Roy Fraprie	PERSON	's '' Little Pilgrimages among Bavarian Inns . ''

		The author is said to liave taken a course of art study at
Munich	LOCATION	in preparation for some such tour with his camera as tliat which has residted in the present volume .

		His connection , too , with the `` American Amateur Photographer '' would lead one to expect good pictures from him ; nor is the ex -RSB- > ectation disappointed .

		The point of view appears always to be well chosen , the defi - nition is of the clearest , and the slightly bro ^ \ ^ ^ - ish tone of the prints gives them somewhat the effect of etchings .

		The descriptive and historical matter will interest both past and prospective travellers in a region where , to quote the author , are to be found '' scenery as beautiful as any in the Swiss Alps , a country where extortion from travellers is almost unkno ^ \ ^ l , and a hospitable and kindly peasantry , who still retain in large meas - ure the simplicity of life of their forefathers . ''

		Just as breathless , sparkling , superficial , and amusing as his Parisian sketches is Mi \
F. Berke	PERSON	- ley
Smith	ORGANIZATION	's snap-shot picture of
London	LOCATION	, entitled '' Li
London Town	LOCATION	. ''

		Very taking illustrations by the author himself , by Mr.
Phil May	PERSON	, Mr.
Frank RejTiolds	PERSON	, and others , are pro \ aded in abundance :
and %	PERCENT	vith their help , and that of the brisk and snappy narrative and descriptive mat - ter , one is transported to • • the DcatI 's Highway '' -LRB- Piccatlilly -RRB- , to that gilded palace of frivolity , the Gaiety Theatre , to the Empire and the
Alham	PERSON	- bra music halls , to the passing show at
Hyde Park	LOCATION	and the busy scenes of the Strand .

		A brief breathing spell at a near-by country house , and a mouthfid of sea-air at
Brighton	LOCATION	, are wel - come : and then we hasten back to our beloved boulevards , with a nightmare remembrance of the
London	LOCATION
Sunday	DATE	and less gloomy impressions of other things -- all of which it is well to have seen through the eyes of our observant artist - author .

		The very title of Mr.
Donald Maxwell	PERSON	's book , '' A Cruise across
Europe	LOCATION	, '' excites curiosity .

		There have been many a tour and run and scam - per across the much be-travelled continent , but surely never before a fresh-water voyage from
Holland	LOCATION	to the Black Sea .

		The preface declares that ' • of all the navigable throughf ares of
Europe	LOCATION	there is none so little known or so seldom used as the
Ludwig 's Canal	ORGANIZATION	, which lies in
Bavaria	LOCATION	between Bamburg and Kelheim . ''

		By this canal , which , we are told , was begun by
Charlemagne	PERSON	and is a hundred miles long , small craft may climb fifteen hundred feet above sea-level and cross the mountain-range separating the Rhine from the
Danube	LOCATION	.

		The passage through this waterway is described in a chapter fitly entitled '' nautical moimtaineering . ''

		The entire voyage , one of incident and adventure , including encoun - ters with the police , is well narrated , and still better illustrated by the author himself and an - other artist .

		One himdred pictures , large and small , and four maps , make a generous allowance .

		The heavy glazed paper renders the volume more inviting as a picture-book than as a book to read .

		Good literature and dazzlingly brilliant jjaper go not well together .

		The nouns and verbs in
Miss Whiting	LOCATION	's book of far - western ti'avel , '' The Land of Enchant - ment , '' have an easy time , so much of the bur - den is shouldered by the adjectives and adverbs , in various degrees of comparison .

		But our truly gigantic mountain scenery may well strain the powers of expression . ''

		The record of the ages , '' we read in a characteristic passage de - scriptive of
Pike	PERSON	's Peak , '' is written on parch - ment that will never crumble .

		The mysteries of the very creation itself , -- of all this vast and marvellous West ^ -- of infinite expanse of sea and of volcanic fires that swallowed up the waters and crystallized them into granite and porphyry , -- this very record of Titanic pro- cesses is ^ v ^ itten , in mystic characters , in that far upper air where the lofty Peak reigns in unapproachable majesty . ''

		More than half the book is devoted to Coloi-ado ;

		Apart from the enthusiasm -LRB- the Schw ` dr - merei ^ as the Germans would say -RRB- that ani - mates the narrative , and the wealth of imagery that adorns it , nothing new could be expected from this Pullman-car explorer ; but she has brought back some excellent photographs , and thirty-five are given in clean-cut plates .

		It is almost needless to add that quotations from the poets abound .

		Twenty-five years of observation and experi - ence in the desert have resulted in a remarkable and valuable work from the pen of Mr ,
George Wharton James	PERSON	, entitled '' The Wonders of the
Colorado Desert	LOCATION	. ''

		This vast territory of moun - tain and plain , thinly settled and showing but few signs of vegetable or animal life , is not in
Colorado	LOCATION	, as most readers would assume at the outset , but in
Southern California	LOCATION	, and it may truly be regarded as a part of Miss Whitings '' Land of Enchantment . ''

		Besides the very full and painstaking descriptive and historical matter of these volumes , there are given more than three hundred admirable drawings from nature , including a delicately beautiful colored frontis - piece , by Mr.
Carl Eytel	PERSON	, and numerous full - page photographic prints .

		A chapter , too , on Mr.
Eytel	PERSON	himself is one of the best in the book .

		Some portion of the writer 's enthusiasm for this vast expanse of aridity and heat and barren rocks and sands might perhaps be accounted for by his having studied it , in part , from a safe and fairly comfortable post of observation on the outskirts , '' within five and
a half hours '	DATE	ride from my
Pasadena	LOCATION	home , where library and pictures and piano and flowers and birds and congenial society all conspire to keep me , ' and whither , doubtless , they do occasionally call him .

		Between this and being athirst in the desert there must be a con - siderable difference .

		Yet Mr.
James	PERSON	evidently knows what it is to rough it , and he has written most instructively and entertainingly of his rov - ing experiences .

		The agricultural possibilities of this district , under artificial irrigation , are enlarged upon , and they are indeed marvellous .

		May they some day be realized , as indeed they have already begun to be .

		The dedication of the book `` to the Source , the Maker of Deserts , '' is a little startling , but becomes less so as one turns the pages descriptive of this land of wonders .

		The Philippine Islands are treated , descrip - tively , historically , industrially , commercially , and politically , by Mr.
Charles Harcourt Forbes	PERSON	-
Lindsay	PERSON	, at present a
Philadelphia	LOCATION	business man and writer , formerly of the English army .

		It does not appear that his book , entitled ''
The Philippines	LOCATION	under Spanish and American Rules , '' is based on personal observation and on study of Philippine problems in the islands themselves .

		Its character and tone may be gathered from the preface , in which the author says : '' For my statements regarding industries , resources , etc. , I have depended , in tlie main , upon ample sources of information afforded by the
U. S. War Department	ORGANIZATION	, having been taught by experience to regard them as the most reliable .

		I have avoided polemic discussion , becaixse there are others much better qualified than myself to pass opinion on the controversial questions connected with the
Philippines	LOCATION	; but that the reader ... may be satisfied , I have fully remedied the deficiency on my part by inserting a chapter of extracts from pub - lie addresses delivered by the Honorable
William H. Taft	PERSON	, '' etc. .

		Twenty-six photogravure illustrations from photographs are given , one of them being en - titled , with an attempt at grammatical harmony , `` Filipina Women . ''

		The book is dedicated , by permission , to Mr.
Taft	PERSON	, and his portrait faces the dedication .

		Mr.
Herbert W. Tompkins	PERSON	explains at the outset that his book , '' In Constable 's Country , '' '' is not an essay on Constable and his art .

		It is a transcript of impressions , penned , in the first instance , by the wayside . ''

		Nevertheless he gives occasional expression to his art theo - ries , as when , in discussing the painting , `` Flat - ford Mill , '' he is inclined to think that `` a land - scape may be truly ideal , apart from any inven - tion by the artist '' ; and also when he says of Constable : '' That he was a realist will hardly be disputed ; but how ideal the real may appear we perceive , clearly enough , as we turn the pages of ' Constable 's Sketches . ' ''

		The region described is , in general ,
Suffolkshire	LOCATION	.

		Literary and historical references enrich Mr.
Tomp	PERSON	- kins 's pages and help to relieve the inevitable tedium of verbal scene-painting .

		The fifteen reproductions of
Constalile	ORGANIZATION	's landscapes are in color , and , so far as a colored print can suggest the original , are not bad .

		The frontispiece is a portrait of the artist himself , from a tinted pencil-drawing by his own hand .

		A book luxuriously made for the holiday trade is Mr.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	's '' The Heart of
England	LOCATION	, '' with its forty-eight colored pictures by Mr.
H. L. Richardson	PERSON	.

		The ample page -LRB- ten by eight -RRB- , the heavy paper , clear type , broad margins , ornamental binding , and , above all , the many bright illustrations , form a strik - ing if somewhat gaudy combination .

		Rambling descriptive matter , with a sprinkling of poetry and philosophy , and an occasional backward glance at the '' old-fashioned times , '' serve to string the pictures together .

Miscellaneous Holiday Publications	ORGANIZATION	.

		All collectors of china will gloat over Mr.
W. Moore Binns	PERSON	's '' The First Century of English Por - celain , '' and the person who spends much time over the book and escapes without a bad case of the craze for ' • pots '' must indeed have been born without the instinct of a collector .

		Mr.
Binns	PERSON	was for years the art director of the
Worcester Royal Porcelain Works	ORGANIZATION	, and is at present managing director of sev - eral famous potteries .

		He explains that he is ' • a practical potter with artistic inclinations , who has had neither the leisure nor the means to enable him to aspire to the rank of a collector . ''

		In the prac - tical and technical side of his subject , which most amateur collectore find very baffling , he is therefore thoroughly at home , and his exact and careful distinc - tions will prove extremely useful to readers who aspire to be thorough students of the keramic art .

		If not a collector himself .

		Mr.
Binns	PERSON	is a friend of many collectors , who have put at his disposal unrivalled specimens of china to examine and illustrate .

		The British and
South Kensington Museums	LOCATION	, the Welsh Museum at
Cardiff	LOCATION	, and the
Worcester	LOCATION	Royal Com - pany have also extended special courtesies to Mr.
Binns	PERSON	.

		so that his study of late eighteenth and early nineteenth century English porcelain is likely to remain the authoritative work for the period .

		Mr.
Binns	PERSON	has command of a compact , nervous , and well-ordered style .

		He is technical without being involved or obscure , and his historical facts are pic - turesque in spite of full and accurate detail .

		In short , Mr.
Binns	PERSON	is a thorough connoisseur with a gift for imparting his enthusiasms -- a combination as rare as it is delightful .

		An introductory chapter equips the reader with some fundamental facts regarding pastes , glazes , and colors , and helps him to estimate correctly the value and significance of trade and workmen 's marks .

		Eighteen varieties of porcelain are then discussed in as many chapters , the longest naturally being devoted to the Bow ,
Chelsea	LOCATION	.

		Wor - cester , and Derby wares .

		A chronological table of the progress of English keramics follows , giving significant events and their dates between
1744	DATE	and
1848	DATE	.

		Three brief appendixes and a copious index of subjects complete the bulky folio , which is bound in cloth with a cover design suggesting the decolla - tions on
Dresden	LOCATION	china .

		One feature remains to be spoken of -- the exquisite full-page illustrations , seventy-seven in number , many of them printed in colors , and altogether furnishing the best possible substitute for a visit to the collections from which the pictm-ed specimens were taken .

		Indeed , color and form and pattern are so faithfully and artisti - cally reproduced that one feels almost as if he were handling cups and plates instead of turning pages , and the book will be prized as a real art-treasure by its fortunate possessors , quite as much as for its store of information .

		The work is imported by the
J. B. Lippincott Company	ORGANIZATION	, to whom American collectors certainly owe a debt of gratitude .

		Of the new edition of
Cellini	ORGANIZATION	's Autobiogi-aphy produced by -RSB- Mr.
D. B. Updike	PERSON	at the Merrj-mount Press , it may be said at once that no more distin - guished piece of book-making has come from an American press for a long while past .

		It occupies two octavo volumes , printed on soft toned paper from a large size of the type-face that Mr.
Updike	PERSON	uses so freely -- a graceful combination of ' * old - style '' and * ' modern '' fonts .

		The typography , while usually excellent , is not impeccable .

		We notice , for instance , a case in which the last line of a paragraph is made to begin a page -LRB- p. XV . -RRB-

		, where a slight change of wording would have made this impropri - ety unnecessary .

		The press-work is beautifully clear and even throughout .

		A few decorative initials in red add a charming minor note , and there is an ornate title-page to each volume designed by Mr.
Thomas Maitlaud Cleland	PERSON	.

		Especial praise must be accorded the forty or more photogravure plates scattered through the volumes ; these reproduce examples of
Cellini	PERSON	's handiwork , as well as old por - traits of himself and his contemporaries .

		The beautiful gold stamping on the covers is an adapta - tion from one of Mr.
Laurence Housman	PERSON	's desig ^ ns .

		As for the text , not much needs be said , except that the translation given is that of
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	, -- than which there is not now , nor is there likely to be , a better .

		Symonds 's extended introduction is reprinted in full ; and an introduction on
Cellini	PERSON	as artist and writer is contributed espe - cially for this edition by Mr.
Royal Cortissoz	PERSON	.

		This latter is an essay of fine critical quality and dis - ci-imination .

		It dwells particularly on
Cellini	PERSON	as an artist , and accounts convincingly for the paradox presented by the fact of an artist 's fame resting upon a work of literature rather than upon a work of art .

		Braggart and rascal though
Cellini	PERSON	was , his unique memoirs will never lose their charm .

		It is a rare pleasure to read them anew in the beautiful setting provided by Mr.
Updike	PERSON	, and with the fresh iUimiination of Mr.
Cortissoz	PERSON	' introduction .

		Bren - tano 's publish this noteworthy edition .

		As a result of
last spring	DATE	's disaster in
San Fran	LOCATION	- cisco , the enterjjrising publishing house of
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	found it necessary to migrate to the more con - venient , if less distinctive , precincts of
New York City	LOCATION	, and it is from thence that this firm 's publications for the present season issue .

		The '' Elder books '' have come to occupy so distinct a place in the minds of holiday book-buyers , that no apologj ' need be offered for considering them briefly in a paragi'aph by them - selves .

		Of the '' Entirely New Cynic 's Calendar for
1907	DATE	'' we had something to say in our last issue .

		Of -LCB- he other volumes to be considered , first mention must be given to '' Ye Gardeyne Boke . ''

		a collection of quotations about gardens and gardening gathered by
Jennie Day Haines	PERSON	from the literature of all ages .

		The volume is a large-sized octavo , boimd in green clotli , with decorative end-leaves in green and page borders by Mr.
Spencer Wright	PERSON	.

		Garden-lovers need look no fm-ther for an appropriate gift .

		-- Similar in size is
Miss Vera Goldthwaite	LOCATION	's collection of aphor - 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, isms from
Robert IngersoU	PERSON	, presented in an attrac - tively-made volume entitled `` The Philosophy of Ingersoll . ''

		The pungent quotations are arranged under various headings , so that it is possible in a few moments to get the gist of
Ingersoll	ORGANIZATION	's views on any main subject of human interest .

		-- In a volume which in paper , binding , and illustrations follows a unique color-scheme of tropical brown , Mrs.
Frank R. Day	PERSON	presents nine tales from the folk-lore of old
Hawaii	LOCATION	, the volume taking its title from the first story , '' The Princess of Manoa . ''

		Ten illustrations , printed in sepia and mounted on blank pages throughout the book , are contributed by Mr.
D. Howard Hitchcock	PERSON	.

		-- The five '' Mosaic Essays '' hitherto published by Messrs. Elder in separate booklets have now been brought together in a collected edition .

		The contents consist of brief quotations about love , friendship , hap - piness , nature , and success , chosen from many authors and woven together in appropriate sequence .

		Decor - ative end-leaves and frontispiece , as well as tasteful typography and binding , give the volume an unusual charm .

		-- The religious flavor is predominant in both ''
Sunday	DATE	Symphonies , '' compiled by
Jennie Day Haines	PERSON	, and '' Fear Not , '' arranged by ''
D. J. D. and E. W.	PERSON	'' The first of these is '' a collection of quotations , harmonious and helpful , for every
Sunday	DATE	of the year . ''

		The second consists of '' quotations of courage from the
Holy Bible	LOCATION	, followed by inspiring thoughts from later sources . ''

		Both booklets are no less unique than attractive in mechanical make-up .

		-- If Macbeth had been provided with the booklet en - titled '' Spots , or Two Hundred and Two Cleansers , '' there would have been no occasion for the profanity contained in his famous exclamation .

		Here are re - cipes before which the most obdurate spot must evap - orate , and the form of the booklet is dainty enough to grace any table .

		-- For younger readers are '' The Twins and the Whys , '' a '' fairy tale worth while , '' by
Susan F. Thompson	PERSON	; and two more of `` Johnny Jones 's '' inimitable copy-books with '' spelling by his mother , '' -- the `` Book of Nature '' and '' Wonders of the Deep . ''

		A stately edition of
Franklin	PERSON	's Autobiography , produced with all the skill and resources of the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	, commemorates most fittingly this year of the two hundredth anniversary of
Franklin	PERSON	's birth .

		The volume is a quarto in size , uniform in general appearance with the '' Life and Death of Cardinal
Wolsey	PERSON	, '' issued by the Riverside Press last year .

		There is no pretension of undue elegance about the book , yet in every detail its appearance satisfies the most critical eye .

		A baker 's dozen of portraits in photogravure , and several half-tone facsimiles of old pamphlets and documents , make up the illustrative features .

		Of very unusual interest is the frontispiece , a fine photogravure reproduction of the contemporary portrait of Franklin recently presented by
Earl Grey	PERSON	to the
United States	LOCATION	, and now hanging upon the
White House	ORGANIZATION	walls .

		This portrait has not before been reproduced in any book .

		The
St. Gaudens	ORGANIZATION	medal , struck off in commemora - tion of the
Franklin bi-centennial	PERSON	, is given in fac - simile reproduction on the two covers of the volume , the design being deeply embossed in leather and inlaid in the board covers , -- the obverse side in front , the reverse in back .

		A brief introduction re - counts the romantic story of the discovery and pur - chase of the original MS. of the autobiography by the Hon.
John Bigelow	PERSON	in
1867	DATE	, part of this account being told in the sprightly correspondence of
William H. Huntington	PERSON	, who acted as Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's agent in acquiring the MS. The text follows Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's fifth edition , and is therefore an exact reproduction of the original , even to a few mis - spellings .

		A unique two-volume edition of '' Romola . ''

		issued by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is described on its title-page as `` historically illustrated , '' -- which means that a hundred and sixty engravings of scenes and characters have been chosen by the editor .

		Dr.
Guido Biagi	PERSON	, librarian of the
Laurentian Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Florence	LOCATION	.

		To reproduce the setting of the story and suggest the extent and character of the material from which
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	constructed her wonderful romance .

		Dr.
Biagi	PERSON	furnishes an occasional note , and also a twenty - five page introduction , explaining his project and tracing , by means of the author 's diaries and his own investigations in the archives of the
Magliabecchian Library	ORGANIZATION	, the stages of her research through the streets of the city and the records of its past .

		Without this introduction , many of the illustrations would seem supei-fluous ; but after reading it , each one takes its place as a contribution , more or less important , to the complex fabric of history and tradition with which the author 's two trips to
Florence	LOCATION	, in
1860	DATE	and
1861	DATE	, equipped her .

		Dr.
Biagi	PERSON	considers this work , in spite of its imperfections , `` the most classical romance of modern English literature . ''

		The illustrations , nearly all of which are from photographs specially taken for this edition , show panoramas and plans of the old city , engravings of Its ancient buildings , some of which are now demolished , photographs of its ai `` t treasures , contemporary portraits of
Savonarola	LOCATION	and the great men of his time , and facsimiles of the author 's orig - inal manuscript .

		Sir
Frederick Burton	PERSON	's portrait of
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	forms the frontispiece for this hand - some edition of what is her most monumental , though perhaps not her greatest , work .

		Discriminating book-lovers have learned to look forward each year to the new volumes in the Dent -
Dutton	PERSON	series of '' English Idylls , '' which combine dainty decoration and appropriate and delightful illustration with a fine taste in the choice of material for reprinting .

		The new titles this winter are `` The Household of Sir Thomas More , '' perhaps the favor - ite among Miss
Anne Manning	PERSON	's delightful novels , and '' Christmas at Bracebridge Hall , '' reprinted from `` The Sketch Book '' and '' Bracebridge Hall . ''

		Both books are illustrated in color by Mr.
C. E. Brock	PERSON	.

		Washington Irving 's sketches of an old - time English Christmas have been reprinted a count - less number of times before and often illustrated ; but Mr.
Brock	PERSON	's work is so sympathetic and indi - vidual as to lend distinction to this new edition .

		His
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 457 English sei-vants , villages , and children , and the Christmas party at the hall , become even more real and charming than they were before .

		The intro - duction to this volume presents a brief biogi'aphical sketch of
Irving	LOCATION	, and a graceful tribute to his sym - pathetic observation of rural
England	LOCATION	.

		The editor of Miss
Manning	PERSON	's novel has devoted his inti'oduc - tion to showing how skilfully she has `` transmuted and heartened '' the history which she found in
Roper	PERSON	's `` Life of Sir Thomas More '' and elsewhere , preserWng the maximum of historical fidelity , and yet mingling enough fancy and imagination to vivify the facts and make the people of the history books real and living .

		Mr.
Brock	PERSON	's pictures for this volume also are singularly successful .


King Henry and Queen Anne	ORGANIZATION	, Sir Thomas ,
Hans Holbein	PERSON	, and Eras - mus , appearing in company with the dainty
Marga	PERSON	- ret
Roper	PERSON	and her little sisters , lose their formal historic asjiect and take a more distinct place among the dear and delightful people of fiction .

		Many readers will like to make or renew acquaintance with
Miss Manning	PERSON	's work through the medium of this alluring reprint . '

		• Dem Good Ole Times , '' by Mrs.
James H. Dooley	PERSON	, is a gaily bound royal octavo , full of tales in negro dialect of the glorious days '' befo ' de war , '' issued by Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Daddy
Ben	PERSON	.

		the supposed raconteur , is a sort of second Uncle
Remus	PERSON	, only that his listener is his little black gi'andchUd , and instead of the adventures of
Brer Rabbit	ORGANIZATION	and his friends
Daddy Ben	ORGANIZATION	tells stories of life in the big house -- of his master 's bi-avery and his mistress 's goodness and beauty , of the children 's pranks and the young people 's dancing and riding and courting , or of the merry-making in the cabins , where ' '' dar was always some kind er frolic on han ' .

		Ef twor n't a funeral , twuz a possimi-hunt , less 'n twuz a prar-meetin ' , or a dance , -- sho ' to be one or tuther . ''

		Accordingly , one of the stories is a `` pos - sum tale '' ; another is about a certain famous * • sweet - tales times , '' and stiU others cluster about the '' ole - tirae Crismus , '' and the Sunday-school '' befo ' de war '' whose battles came very near to the big house and add a touch of adventure to several chap - ters .

		All the stories are full of the genuine negro humor that sometimes comes so close to pathos .

		Daddy
Ben	PERSON	has a fine contempt for '' fi'ee niggers , '' and a polite scorn for the mistaken notions enter - tained by '' Mr.
Roosumfeltum	PERSON	un dem folks in
Washington	LOCATION	, '' which he takes every opportunity to vent .

		Each of the eleven chapters is accompanied by a dainty full-page picture in colors , the work of Miss
Suzanne Gutherz	PERSON	: and each is introduced by a decorated title-page and an appropriate heading in black-and-white by Miss
Cora Parker	PERSON	.

		Whatever previous knowledge we have had of the
Caradoc Press	ORGANIZATION	, situate in
Chiswick	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	, has been based upon '' The
Acorn	ORGANIZATION	, '' a quarterly miscellany of art and literature patterned somewhat upon '' The Yellow Book , '' though quite without the decadent tendencies of that much-discussed publication .

		Now , however , we have two volumes bearing this imprint which make it evident that the Caradoc Press must be reckoned with in any account of present-day English printing .

		These volumes , presenting in tJie way of text `` The Compleat Angler '' and `` The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' are similar in size and general appearance .

		Both are set in the same face of type , a modification of the
Jenson	PERSON	cut so much in vogue with amateur printers .

		The paper is hand - made , a trifle stiff for a small octavo volume , but otherwise of excellent quality .

		No fault may be found with the press-work ; and the brown leather binding , bearing almost no decoration , is unique and tasteful .

		Etched frontispiece portraits , and several small etch - ings in the text of '' The Compleat Angler , '' form a distinctive and artistic feature of the books .

		These etchings , together with the decorative borders and initials , are the work of Mr.
H. George Webb	PERSON	, who seems to be the chief jiersonality behind the Press .

		It should be said that both of these reprints follow the variable orthography and punctuation of the originals , and that they contain no editorial matter of any sort .

		Each edition is limited to 350 copies .

		It would seem that the success of Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	's `` The Open Road , '' published some three or four years ago , has served to set a new fashion in anthologies .

		Within a fortnight we have re - ceived no less than four compilations all modelled upon the same pattern ; that is to say , each is a col - lection of good verse and prose of all sorts , intended as a little -RCB- x > cket companion to sustain and pleasm ' e those who go on pilg ^ nage -- or , as in one of the present cases , thase who stay at home in the city .

		One of these books is a new compilation from Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's own hand ; one is in many ways a better book than '' The Open Road '' ; while the other two are good collections of their kind , but too obviously imitations to be taken vei-j * seriously .

		Of Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's new volume , '' The Friendly Town '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , nothing but good may be said , although -- as is inevitable with any anthology -- the reader will wish that some things had been included in place of some that are given .

		The selections cover a wide range , and many of them have but a remote relation to the urban spirit in literature ; but they all serve Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's purpose , and go to make up a volume that should find a place imder every reading-lamp .

		The decora - tive cover and end-leaves are unusually attractive .

		-- While similar in appearance and genei-al arrange - ment to `` The Open Roatl , '' Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	's '' Tlie Pilgrim 's Way '' is compiled upon a somewhat different plan , its pui-pose being to proi-ide the way - farer with good counsel rather than pleasant read - ing -- though both ends are attained .

		Uneri'ing good taste is evident throughout the collection , as might liave been expected from so skUful a hand as that which formed `` The Oxford Book of English Poetry . ''

		Not the least of the volume 's charms is the compiler 's fine little prefatory essay ; while the details of typography and paper could not well be bettered .

		-- The idea of both Mr.
W. G. Waters	PERSON	's '' Traveller 's Joy '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- and Mr.
Alfred H. Hyatt	PERSON	's '' The Footpath Way '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- is obviously 458 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, based upon '' The Open Road '' ; and the first-named book goes so far as exactly to copy the mechanical form of Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's volume in practically every detail .

		This is unfortunate , since it will prejudice some readers against what are in themselves most agreeable little compilations .

		It is to be noted that Mr.
Waters	PERSON	has made his selections in large part from early and less well-known writers who seldom find place in collections of this sort .

		Among a little group of holiday booklets to which , as one of them puts it , there is `` no admittance except on pleasure , '' first place belongs to '' Mis - representative Women '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which Mr.
Harry Graham	PERSON	has dared to do for the fair sex what he has already done for '' Mere Men , '' namely , describe a few famous characters in humorous verse .

		As Dame Rumor , Mrs.
Christopher Columbus	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Grundy	PERSON	are among the subjects to whom his sprightly muse does honor , the reader need fear no lack of variety .

		A few clever illustrations add a festive touch to the book .

		-- '' The Foolish Almanac , 2nd '' -LRB- Luce -RRB- shows no falling off from the excellent standard of foolishness set by its predecessor of last year .

		There is enough genuine fun between its gay covers to provide a good laugh for every day in the year , and the pictures by Mr.
Wallace	PERSON	Gold - smith are no less clever than the text .

		-- '' Over the Walnuts and Wine '' -LRB-
Caldwell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
James Clarence Harvey	PERSON	, is shaped to represent a cham - pagne bottle reposing in its appropriate bucket of ice .

		While Mr.
Harvey	PERSON	's verses and epigrams are a bit uneven , they have not a little of the sparkle and zest that we naturally look for in such a setting .

		A decorative border in tint surrounds each page , and there is a frontispiece .

		-- Something of the cham - pagne flavor belongs also to the collection of toasts brought together by Miss

Helen Alden Knipe	PERSON	, appears on every other page .

		-- '' Who 's It in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
B. W. Dodge & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is described on its title-page as '' a sort o ' biography of certain prominent persons , with some facts about them hitherto unpublished in a work of this nature . ''

		It is mildly amusing in general quality .

Altemus	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr ,
Philander Chase Johnson	PERSON	.

		Others besides practical politicians will derive an occasional good '' pointer '' from these '' helpful hints on the science of not getting the worst of it . ''

		A type of gift-book which seems to grow more popular every season is that of the brief essay or ser - mon , usually by some well-known writer , presented in a booklet at once inexpensive in price and elegant , often luxurious , in appearance .

		Among the publi - cations of this sort , those of
Messrs. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		hold first place , for both number and quality .

		This firm 's output for the present season , of which it is impossible to do much more than give a list of titles and authors , includes the following volumes : '' The World 's Christmas Tree , '' by the Rev.
Charles E. Jefferson	PERSON	; '' American Character , '' by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	; `` The Happy Family , '' by Dr.
George Hodges	PERSON	; '' Putting the Most into Life , '' by Mr.
Booker T. Washington	PERSON	; '' Great Riches , '' by President Eliot of
Harvard	LOCATION	;
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's Essay on Friendship ; '' Tlie Beauty of Kindness , '' by Rev.
J. R. Miller	PERSON	; Dr.
Hale	PERSON	's '' The Man without a Country '' ; '' Saint
Francis	PERSON	of
Assisi	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	; and ''
Germelshausen	PERSON	, '' translated from the German of Friedrich Gerstiicker by
Clara M. Lathrop	PERSON	.

		All of these vohimes are choicely printed in red and black , and several contain photogravure frontispieces .

		Of equal attractiveness with these are two volumes from the
American Unitarian Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tion , -- `` Life 's Enthusiasms '' by President
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	, and '' The Shepherd 's Question '' by Mr.
Burt Pastes Howard	PERSON	; the l -RRB- inding of each of these is particularly artistic and pleasing .

		From Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	we have Dr.
George Hodge	PERSON	's `` The Pui ` suit of Happiness , '' and
Frank Norris	PERSON	's '' The Joyous Miracle . ''

		Messrs.
McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	send us Mrs.
Sara A. Hubbard	PERSON	's `` The Re - ligion of Cheerfulness , '' and from the Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	we have Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	's '' The Americanism of
Washington	LOCATION	. ''

		Inexpensive as are all the volumes mentioned in this paragi'aph , they combine attractive - ness of make-up with high quality of text in such measure as to render them ideal gift-books of an unassuming sort .

		Calendars and year-books are perennial accom - paniments of the holiday season .

		Among this
autumn	DATE	's varied selections one of the prettiest and most unique is '' All the Year in a Garden , '' a cal - endar for nature-lovers , compiled by Miss
Esther Matson	PERSON	and issued in a dainty and suitable binding by
Messrs. Thomas Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Matson	PERSON	has hunted her quotations in all sorts of delightful nooks and by-ways of nature litei-ature , and her gleanings have a distinct flavor of piquancy and originality .

		A photogi'aph of a garden or a flower accompanies the quotations for each month -- '' Daily Joy and Daily Peace '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- contains the gen - erous allowance of three or more brief but inspiring sentiments for every day in the year .

		Miss
Rose Porter	PERSON	is the editor .

		The little book is daintily bound in white and gold , and there are twelve illus - trations from famous paintings `` A Longfellow Calendar '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- contains extracts , descriptive or didactic , from the poems of our favorite Ameri - can singer .

		A beautiful photogravure portrait of the poet forms the frontispiece .

		-- Mr.
H. B. Metcalf	PERSON	has endeavored to produce in '' Gems of Wisdom for Every Day '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- a volume not of fami - liar , but of unfamiliar quotations .

		The thoughtful reader will approve his selections , which cover a wide range of ancient and modern literatm-e .

		Blue page-borders and the checked denim cover with its pretty paper label furnish somewhat of a novelty in the way of decoration . ''

		The Face in the Girandole '' is the title of a book that will make an ideal present for the friend
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 459 who goes in for old furniture .

		DaintUy bound and decorated and prettily illustrated , with an attractive touch of romance in its slender plot , it is a novelette that almost anybody might like to spend an idle hour upon .

		But the lover of old furniture wUl '' gloat over it .

		He wUl recognize in Mr.
William Frederick Dix	PERSON	.

		its author , a kindred spirit , with fine appreciation of all the subtle joys of the old-furniture fad , including an interest in the dealers who cheat you and the friends who buy away from you the things you have been secretly bargaining for .

		Such readers will criticize Mr.
Dix	PERSON	's dogmas about Sheraton and
Chippendale	ORGANIZATION	, add bits out of their own experience to his amusing '' furniturosophy , '' sigh regretfully that they can not compete with his hero for the treasures in the old house at
Mendham	LOCATION	, and start out forthwith on a determined search for a girandole .

		Mr.
Dix	PERSON	has shown a good deal of astuteness in choosing his title : collectors who do not know just what a girandole is will be particularly eager to read his book .

Moffat	PERSON	.


Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	, Page & Company have fm -- nished an unusually sumptuous setting for Mrs.
Tryphosa Bates Batcheller	PERSON	's '' Glimpses of Italian Court Life . ''

		The dark green cover is heavily dec - orated in gold to simulate the clasps used in mediaeval book-making .

		The frontispiece is a photogravure portrait of Queen
Elena	PERSON	of
Italy	LOCATION	, to whom the book is dedicated by special permission .

		The other pic - tures are half-tones of unusually fine quality , made from photographs , and a few water-colors .

		They in - clude views of
Rome	LOCATION	,
Naples	LOCATION	, and some other Italian cities and villages , and a great many portraits of Mrs. Bat < ; heller 's Roman friends , many signed with a few pleasant words of appreciation and friendship by their donors .

		Mrs.
BatcheUer	PERSON	has chosen to write her remi - niscences of a notable visit to
Rome	LOCATION	, with brief stops on the two journeys through
Italy	LOCATION	, in the form of letters to her mother and father , and to one or two intimate friends .

		The personal note is therefore strong , and the narrative is rambling , informal , and thoroughly readable .

		Mrs.
BatcheUer	PERSON	does not as - sume the office of guide to the wonders of the im - perial city .

		Occasionally she writes of delightful but rather perfunctory expeditions * ' to see the sights , '' made at the instigation of an indefatigble American friend .

		But more interesting , both to writer and reader , are the glimpses of the Roman court and so - ciety life , to which Mrs.
Batcheller	PERSON	's musical talents and social position gave her entrance .

		She was ac - corded the honor of a special presentation to the two
Queens	LOCATION	of
Italy	LOCATION	, and to the Pope .

		She went to a court ball , met many distinguished Americans and members of the diplomatic circle , saw some private theatricals in which a princess played the part of ' • leading lady , '' attended many splendid : balls during carnival week and many notable concerts all through the
winter	DATE	, and saw the inner splendors of many lovely villas and f aijious palaces .

		All these novel experi - ences she writes of in a sprightly conversational style , with an enthusiasm which , although sometimes a little overdone , yet adds to the charm of the book .

		It will - appeal especially to those who are interested in the musical society of
Rome	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	.

		In the volume entitled '' With
Byron	PERSON	in
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClm-g -RRB- , Mrs.
Anna B. McMahian	PERSON	deals with
Byron	PERSON	as she has previously dealt with the
Brown	PERSON	- ings and with
Shelley	PERSON	, -- that is to say , she has brought together and arranged in logical sequence such portions of the poet 's verse and letters as are associated with his life in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Of all the English poets who have adopted
Italy	LOCATION	as a foster-mother , Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	considers that
Byron	PERSON	's absorption into the country was the most obvious and complete .

		The years of
Byron	PERSON	's residence in
Italy	LOCATION	, from
1816	DATE	to
1823	DATE	, constituted the ripest and most prolific period of his life .

		It follows , as the compiler sug - gests , that the letters and poems here presented form perhaps the best material upon which to base an individual opinion regarding one who , of all English poets , has been most praised and most reviled .

		A distinctive feature of the volume is the series of sixty illustrations , reproduced in half-tone from photo - grajjlis of Italian art , architecture , and scenery ; these throw a vivid illvmaination upon most of the impor - tant allusions in the text .

		Besides the reg ^ ar edi - tion in cloth , Mrs.
McMahan	PERSON	's book appears in an edition on large paper limited to 250 copies .

		It is this latter that we direct particular attention to here , as a gift-book whose attractions are not surpassed in their way among the season 's publications .

		The text is printed on Italian hand-made paper of fine quality , with the illustrations on Japanese vellum .

		The binding is of dark paper boards and vellum back , bearing on the front cover a rich Jleur de lys design in gold .

		In all respects the volimie is a con - spicuous example of fine bookmaking . ''

		The Art of the
Dresden Gallery	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Miss Julia de Wolf Addison	PERSON	, is the sixth volume in a handsomely illustrated series of guides to the principal galleries of
Europe	LOCATION	, which
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are pub - lishing , and makes Miss
Addison	PERSON	's thii-d contribution to the series .

		In plan it is similar to its predecessors ; it consists of notes and observations upon a large number of the finest paintings , both ancient and mod - ern , in the royal collection at
Dresden	LOCATION	, arranged in schools or grouping together the works of one or tvvo great mastei-s .

		In the main , it is possible to adhere to this plan and still follow the arrangement of the pictures in the gallery , diagrams of which are fur - nished the reader .

		Where deviation from the regular route is necessary , the location of the pictures is clearly indicated , and every effort is made to render a tour through the gallery pleasant and profitable , and to save those toilsome searches after inconspicu - ously hung masterpieces , which all European travel - lers remember to their sorrow .

		On behalf of the large number of art-students who must get their knowledge of great paintings from books about them , the ac - counts of the pictures are descriptive as well as criti - cal and historical , and fifty tinted half-tones illustrate the greatest and most characteristic works of the col - lection .

		An interesting history of its formation and grovrth serves as introduction to the opening chapter . '

		460 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, The text furnishes as much detail as the ordinary traveller will care for , and he will find it of a more manageable and useful sort than that offered by most guides and catalogues .

		The binding is both hand - some and durable , and the volume not over-large or weighty .

		Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	's compilations of extracts describing various cities and countries or famous ob - jects of art and architecture are too familiar to need further introduction .

		This year she has added a work upon
Rome	LOCATION	to the series which already includes vol - umes about
Paris	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
Venice	LOCATION	,
Japan	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
Holland	LOCATION	; and to her art series , one entitled '' His - toric Buildings of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The latter has been prepared , so the preface tells as , in response to many requests ; and it is sure to prove particularly success - ful , since it covers a field comparatively untrodden .

		Miss
Singleton	PERSON	uses
America	LOCATION	in its broadest sense , and it is astonishing how much interesting material she has gathered .

		In our own land , our most his - toric and most beautiful churches are included , from
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Alexandria	LOCATION	to the curious Bee-Hive Tabernacle at
Salt Lake City	LOCATION	.

		A few typical old - time homes are described , several of them closely associated with
Washington	LOCATION	, besides a number of forts , many of our national and municipal civic buildings , several famous college halls , and two monuments .

		The Palace of
Chapultepec	LOCATION	, the cathe - drals of
Mexico	LOCATION	and
Havana	LOCATION	, and the
Church of St. Anne de Beaupr ^	ORGANIZATION	in
Canada	LOCATION	, have all the picturesque - ness of the old-world shrines , and ought to be more familiar to Americans than they are .

		Miss Single - ton has shown more than her customary ingenuity in unearthing vivid descriptions of the buildings , and the book is , as usual , amply illustrated from photographs .

		-- The selections in the Roman volume not only describe the most famous buildings of the city and give glimpses of some of its beautiful envi - rons , but also include accounts of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	, of the rise of modern
Rome	LOCATION	, of social life in the cos - mopolitan city , of holy week , the yearly carnival , and the weekly rag fair . ''

		Rome Revisited , '' by Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, is the final selection -- a sort of summary of all the multiform impressions that have preceded it .

		The volume will make an excel - lent guide-book for tourists , and those who have not seen
Rome	LOCATION	and do not expect to see it will enjoy the vivid and interesting descriptions and gain much comprehensive information , well distributed between topography , history , architectiu-e , and manners and customs .

		The illustrations are many and excellent .

		-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- In '' The Story of Pocahontas and Captain
John Smith	PERSON	, '' told and pictured by Mr.
E. Boyd Smith	PERSON	, that delightful colorist has abandoned clever farce to enter the higher domains of semi-historical por - traiture .

		In a series of twenty-six colored plates , full of spirit and beauty , and not without sly touches of humor at the expense of everybody concerned , he has portrayed the various episodes in the stirring story of our first international romance .

		As usual , the drawings are accompanied by very brief textual comments .

		The pictures are bound up in a thin quarto , with one of Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's designs inset on the cover , and specially decorated end-papers and title - page .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's style is unique ; all pliases of it get full play in the new volume , and his particular genius for animal drawings loses nothing by being relegated to the corners of the pictures .

		Indeed the drollery of Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's corners is always the most delightful feature of his work .

		Messrs.
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the book , with typography and color-work well up to their customary high standard . ''

		The Dogs of War , '' Mr.
Walter Emanuel	PERSON	tells us , was the greatest dogs ' club in the largest city in the world .

		All its members were mongrels except Mr.
Emanuel	PERSON	's own dog , a thoroughbred field spaniel , whose friendship with a neighbor 's nonde - script cur , known to his admiring followers as the Captain , led to the admission of this one aristocrat into the Captain 's club . ''

		The Dogs of War '' were pledged to attack at sight all thoroughbreds who gave themselves airs or offered insult to plebian canines .

		Naturally `` Ears , '' as the Captain named his aristo - cratic friend , had more battles to fight than any other member , for all mongrels hated him and all thorough - breds looked upon him as a traitor .

		But his courage and liis admiration for the Captain , -- who seems to have been as unworthy the adulation lavished upon him as many hvmian heroes , -- never faltered ; and when the Captain died he grew suddenly old and spiritless -- and fell to writing his memoirs .

		Mr.
Emanuel	PERSON	allows `` Ears '' to tell his story exactly as he pleases , even though he has included some scathing remarks about his master 's '' silly ways . ''

		His great - est failing as a raconteur is his lack of humor ; but his artistic collaborator , Mr.
Cecil Aldin	PERSON	, does his best to atone for this by making a great many very funny pictures of the '' Dogs of War , '' their friends and their foes .

		A volimae of '' Prose You Ought to Know '' -LRB-
Revell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has been edited by Mr.
John R. Howard	PERSON	with an intelligence and originality that will make it acceptable even to the avowed enemy of the ordi - nary book of extracts .

		Mr.
Howard	PERSON	has had a wide experience in the work of compilation .

		His aim in the present volume is to gather , from a wide range of authorship and subject-matter , a series of brief excerpts , each of which shall be typical of its au - thor 's best style , and , besides exciting a momentary interest , shall '' at least hint at the richness of an essay , a tale , a history , an oration . ''

		The selections are longer than mere aphorisms , being from one to four pages in length .

		They are chosen with refer - ence to a quality that many compilers do not under - stand , -- namely , a really fine and forceful style .

		Milton ,
Sydney Smith	ORGANIZATION	,
Henry Clay	ORGANIZATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, Bulwer Ly tton ,
Kane	PERSON	,
Sterne	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, and
Gough	PERSON	, among the seventy-five names in the table of contents , will suggest the somewhat unusual variety of fare which the book offers .

		Each selection is preceded by a pithy paragraph of biographical data .

		Colored mar - ginal borders and a pretty cover give the air of festivity which most people demand in books of

		461 serioas import , when they are intended for Christ - mas giving . ''

		The Swarm , '' -- the subject of the most fascinat - ing and dramatic portion of
Maurice Maeterlinck	PERSON	's marvellous study of '' The Life of the Bee , '' -- is the title of a little booklet decorated by Mr.
Anthony Euwer	PERSON	and published by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The separation of these chapters from their setting seems fuUy justified , for the author 's splendid phi - losophy and careful observation are no less evident in this portion of the book than in the whole ; and these chapters will serve to introduce '' The Life of the Bee '' to many persons who have missed the pleasure of reading it hitherto because they do not discriminate between
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	and the aver - age modern nature-writer , whose emphasis is quite different and less to their taste .

		The cover is ap - propriately and not too lavishly decorated .

		The colored designs which underlie the type are so sub - dued as not to interfere with easy reading , and they have the right tone to harmonize with the essayist 's .

		Altogether this is one of the choicest of the season 's bibelots .

		Those who ai-e famUiar with Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's scholarly and readable work , ''
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	, '' will be glad to learn of the new edition issued by the
Lippincott Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Lee	PERSON	has revised his text to bring it strictly up to date , and has added considerable information which historical researches since
1890	DATE	have brought to light .

		Three years ago Mr.
Lee	PERSON	was chosen chairman of their executive committee by the Trustees of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Birth - place , so that his acquaintance with the town and its memories is even more intimate , and his interest greater , than when his book was first published .

		Among the mass of modern Shakespeariana , which grows vaster with every publishing season , it is a relief to find one book on
Stratford	LOCATION	that deals with the town for its own rather than for the great poet 's sake .

		This picturesque account of
Stratford	LOCATION	's early history , -- its old markets and fairs , its nobility , its gmld , its village sports and industries , -- serves not only to make a setting for the life of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, but also to bring out much that , having nothing to do with him , is nevertheless quaint and characteristic in the most popular pilgrimage-place in all
England	LOCATION	.

		The new edition is adequately and pleasingly illustrated , chiefly by Messrs.
Herbert RaUton	PERSON	and
Edward Hull	PERSON	, and very tastefully boimd .

		`` The Story of the Bible '' -LRB- Winston -RRB- , by Rev. Dr.
Jesse L. Hurlbut	PERSON	, well known to visitors to Chautauqua and readers of `` The Sunday-school Times , '' is meant to be put into the hands of older children , and to be used by parents who find it dijBfi - cult to tell Bible stories effectively , in instructing children too young to read the book for themselves .

		It contains seven hundred and fifty pages , on which one hundred and sixty-eight complete stories , each independent of the rest , but all together forming the continuous Bible history , are told .

		The lan - guage is simple , direct , and wherever possible bib - lical .

		Hard words are explained , doctrines and moral applications not found in the original avoided , and no imaginary scenes or conversations interpo - lated .

		There is certainly a perennial demand for a book of this sort , and it would be hard to find a wiser , more tactfid , or more skilful adapter than Dr.
Hurlbut	PERSON	proves himself .

		The numerous illustrations , which include a few colored plates and nearly three hundred half-tones , will undoubtedly be a decided attraction in the eyes of young readers .

		A notable edition of
Charles	PERSON	and
Mary Lamb	PERSON	's '' ■ Tales from Shakespeare '' comes in two volumes , bound in green cloth with tasteful gold stamping , with
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's imprint .

		The two frontispieces are authors ' portraits ; and the illustrations , one to each of the twenty plays , are photogravure reproductions of engra ^ ` ings from the paintings of
Reynolds	LOCATION	, Mac - lise , Sir
John Gilbert	PERSON	,
Snirke	LOCATION	,
Ilbetson	LOCATION	, WestaU , and others .

		The quaintness and spirit of the designs will appeal more strongly to adult than to youthful read - ers , as will the introduction , from the pen of IVIr .

		Alfred Ainger and bearing the date
1878	DATE	.

		But , as Mr.
Ainger	PERSON	points out , when a genius writes for children it is inevitable that children of a larger growth shall also like his work . '

		• The Happy-Go-Lucky '' is one of those delightful German romances , lying in the middle distance be - tween fairy-land and this workaday world of ours , for which the German nation seems to have a pecu - liar genius .

		Many years ago , ALis .


A. L. Wister	PERSON	translated this story from the German of
Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff	PERSON	; and now the
Lippincott Company	ORGANIZATION	publish a new edition in holiday dress .

		The illustrations in color and tint by
Philipp Grot Johann	PERSON	and ProfessorEdmund Kanoldt reproduce the quaint foreign atmosphere of the story - ; and the marginal drawings by Mrs.
Eva Nagel Wolf	PERSON	are iUiistrative as well as decorative .

		Many readers will enjoy these `` leaves from the life of a good-for - nothing '' in their new garb .

		Four of
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's delightful stories of the old
Province House	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	have been gjrouped under the general title '' In Colonial Days , '' copiously illustrated by Mr.
Frank C. Merrill	PERSON	, ornately bound , and published with the imprint of
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hawthorne 's pellucid style is suffi - ciently picturesque to prove of infinite suggestive - ness to an artist , and Mr.
Merrill	PERSON	's pictures , redo - lent of old times and customs , and yet full of life and spirit , are evidently the fruits of congenial and sympathetic effort .

		Anybody would enjoy the Tales in their new setting , which ought , however to prove particularly acceptable to younger readers .

		If one has entered on his list of friends an epi - cure for whom some holiday remembrance must be provided , nothing more fitting could be found than the two companion volimies , ''
Louis	PERSON	's Salads and Chafing Dishes '' and ''
Louis	PERSON	's IVIixed Drinks '' -LRB-
Caldwell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The author is Mr.
Louis Muckensturm	PERSON	, a chef of long experience , and it is his genial -LRB- if not intellectual -RRB- face that looks out upon us from the frontispiece of each volimie .

		The recipes of which the books are composed look well in print , and the 462 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	- , form of the volumes is refreshingly removed from conventional cook-book ugliness .

		Sumptuously bound in limp ooze leather , with page-borders whose swirling lines and suggestive symbolism , printed in a shade to harmonize pleas - antly with the cover , make an attractive frame for the text , the `` Love Poems '' of Lord
Byron	PERSON	are as elegant a piece of book-making as one could wish .

		Whether or not Byronic love is still sufficiently in fashion to justify so luxurious a reprint is an inter - esting question which the reviewer is not called upon to settle .

		But it would be difficult to imagine a more harmonious and effective setting for these mellifluous lyrics than has now been provided by the publishers of this little volume .

		-LRB- The
H. M. Caldwell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Since some of the illustrations for Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ' holiday edition of '' The Last Ride Together '' are so good , it is a pity that others should be lacking in both appropriateness and artistic merit .

		In attempting to illustrate one of
Browning	PERSON	's strongest and most beautiful love lyrics , Mr.
Frederick Simpson Coburn	PERSON	has set himself an heroic task ; but several of his pictures , which are effectively printed in sepia on parchment-finished paper , show spirit , suggestiveness , and a real gift of imagination .

		Quite the daintiest volume we have seen this season is a selection from the '' Lyrists of the Resto - ration , '' ma4e by
John Constance Masefield	PERSON	, and published by the
Frederick A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	in a new series called '' The Chapbooks . ''

		In its chaste white vellum binding , tied with white leather thongs , this diminutive volume suggests somewhat those products of the early printers which so warm the collector 's heart .

		The selections seem to have been made with discrimination , and there is an interesting introduc - tory essay .

Dec. 16	DATE	, KEEPIKGiUP WITH THE MAGAZINES without giving all one 's time to them is a task of ever-increasing difficulty .


$ LThis	MONEY	is decidedly the magazine age .

		The number , variety , and high quality of our periodicals are nothing less than amazing .

		The master-minds of the world go to their making , -- the greatest of living thinkers , workers , story-tellers , poets , and artists .

		One must fall hopelessly behind the times if he fails to keep in touch with this treasure realm of knowledge and entertainment ; yet so vast is its extent that few can hope to cover it first hand .

		By limiting oneself to a few periodicals taken by the year , all but a very small portion of the field is overlooked .

		C.The only sensible plan is to buy each month single copies of those magazines that contain the things one wants most to see .

		This plan has been made practicable by What 's in the Magazines , a monthly publication which renders the mass of current magazine literature completely accessible to the busy every-day reader .

		Each issue presents a bird 's - eye view of the maga - zine-contents of the month , with the aid of which one may gain in ten minutes as good an idea of what the current periodicals contain as though he had personally examined a copy of each .

		C .

		It is not a mere list of contents ; neither is it a complicated and confusing library index .

		Everything is arranged and classified , simply but exactly ; whether one is hunting up special subjects or the work of special writ - ers or merely looking out for good things in general , the arrangement is equally convenient .

		C .

		It is a vest-pocket Baedeker to magazine - land , -- a periodical that brings all other periodicals into a nutshell ; and so must prove indispensable to every busy intelligent person .

		We could fill ^ Sou ^ nc ' `` sp ` ration .
