		Liberty , melody , passion , fate , nature , love , and fame are the seven chords which the poet 's hand , from its first almost boyhood touch upon the l \ Te , has swept now for two score years with music that has been blown through the world . ''

		Thfese words strike the key-note of Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	's appreciation of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poetry -- a book in form , an essay in dimensions , and a nugget of pure gold in critical quality .

		We are indebted to Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	for many precious earlier gifts -- for much noble verse of his own and for much finely-tempered discourse upon the verse of other men -- but to no piece of his writing more than to this , in which the poet speaks of the poet straight to the heart of all who love poetry .

		We started to read Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's essay with some misgivings .

		He has been charged with defective sympathies , with putting too much of the
New England	LOCATION	conscience into his judgment of
Poe	PERSON	, for example , and of other writers in whose temperament the puritan spirit has no part .

		We are not sure that this charge is jus - tified , but the plaintiffs at least have a case .

		Remembering the utter failiu-e of LoweU to do anything like justice to the poet of ''
Atalanta	LOCATION	, '' we feared lest his latest successor might exhibit the same sort of spiritual blindness .

		On the other hand , there stootl Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's record as a lover of SheUey , and to share the inspiration of
SheUey	ORGANIZATION	is to have the franchise of the poetic kingdom of heaven .

		We recalled , moreover , cer - tain of Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's earlier poems which distinctly showed the mark of the Swinbumian influence .

		Considered thus in its a priori aspect , the question of what the critic would have to say about the greatest of living poets seemed a little doubtful , but wliatever misgivings we may have felt were soon disjielled .

		The words set at the head of this article were alone sufficient for that pm-pose , and they were foimd to be supple - mented by many others which left no doubt concerning the writer 's sympathies .

		Such words , for example , are these : '' Strength is dominant in his genius : the things of strength are in his verse ; it is English genius and English strength .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, racial in lyric power , in free intellect , in bold speech , -- none more so -- and English also in its poetic scholarly tradition . ''

		And besides these general appraisements , there are such specific dicta as the following : '' The stream of his rev - olutionary song is unmatched in volume , splen - dour , and force ; it has flowed life-long , and still wells ; it is blended of many loves of per - sons and histories and memories , of time and of eternity ; it is a great passion , great in personal intensity , great in its human outreaching and uplifting aspiration , great in sincerity . '' ''

		He achieves the most genuine appearance of belief in the gods that has fallen to the fortune of any English poet , perhaps of any poet in any niod - ern literature . '' ''

		Such poetry -LSB- as ` Tristram ' -RSB- brings back that early world in which old
Triton	ORGANIZATION	blew his wreathed horn , and not in a vision only , but as the everlasting life of nature and man . ''

		In view of the grotesque misconception of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poetry that is still current with a large section of the public , the critic who deals honestly and intelligently with him is under bonds , as it were , to cast his gauntlet boldly in the face of ignorance and prejudice .

		This Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	does without hesitation .

		`` He is a very thoughtfid poet '' is his simple but adequate correction of the stupid notion that the author of '' Hertha '' and '' The Last
Oracle	ORGANIZATION	'' is a poet of sound without sense .

		Those who condenm the poet for exaggeration , whether in praise of Hugo or censure of
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	, will do weU to weigh the coimter-opinion that his study of Hugo belongs to '' a treasure of intui - tive criticism such as no other English poet has left , '' and the characterization of the '' Dirae '' as '' curses to rejoice the heart , '' which '' mark their victims indelibly for heU . ''

		Mr.
Wood	PERSON	- berry says with entire truth that criticism of this poet hitherto '' has never been adequate , just , or intelligent . '' ''

		The truth about him is the exact opposite of what has been widely and popularly thought ; weakness , affectation , exotic foreignness , the traits of aestheticism in the debased sense of that word , are far from him ; he is strong , he is English , bred with an
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean mind it is true like SheUey , like Gray and
Milton	PERSON	, but in his own genius and temperament and the paths of his flight charged with the strength of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Such statements as these clear the air won - derfidly .

		They are mspired criticism ; and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	has been the victim of so much crit - icism -LRB- if it deserve the name -RRB- of the dull and uninspired sort tliat its drone still lingers in our ears .

		Sound and fury , debased sensualism , vacuity of thovight -- these are honestly sup - posed by many well-meaning jjcople to be the essential attributes of his work .

		Soimd and fury , and we think of the severe and tempered style of ''
Mary Stuart	PERSON	'' ; debased sensualism , and we recall the austere idealism of '' The Pil - gruns '' ; vacuity of thought , and we wonder - ingly repeat the deep gnomic utterances of '' Hertha '' and '' The Last
Oracle	ORGANIZATION	'' !

		But of course the people who use these glib plu-ases are either imacquainted with the poet 's reaUy significant work , or they are to be reckoned among the imf ortunates who are impervious to the appeal of pure poetry .

		This latter class is a larger one than is commonly suspected , for there are great numbers of readers everywhere who think and say that they love poetry , when what really attracts and impresses them is some adventitious quality that has little to do with poetical character .

		The comfortable conserva - tism of a
Wordsworth	LOCATION	, the domestic sentunent - ality of a
Tennyson	LOCATION	, the cryptic moralizing of a
Browning	PERSON	, bring to the works of these poets a host of admiring readers who mistake for aes - thetic satisfaction the delight with which they greet the echo of their own sentiments or prej - udices .

		We are not saying that these three are not gi'eat poets , for that they unquestionably are ; but we are asserting with much confidence that they woidd be no less great as poets were their writings divested of nearly everything that makes an appeal to nine-tenths of their atbnir - ers .

		They would lose their popidarity , no doubt , and become merely poets for poets , and for the small minority of those others who , without pos - sessing for themselves the creative facidty , are still of the elect whose spirits are finely touched to fine issues , and whose ciunulative verdict determines the final rank of every poet in the hierarchy .

		Landor is one of the greatest En - glish poets despite his failure to win popular applause ; Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	is one of the great English poets despite all the efforts of the '' homy-eyed '' to prove that he is not by their damnable iteration of catchpenny phrases .

		Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	, himself a poet of distinction , sees this fact cleai ` ly enough , and gives abundant reasons for the faith that is in him .

		It is a fact , moreover , that has already been seen by nearly all the competent critics of the present genera - tion , which is equivalent to saying that the only contemporary judgment which will count in the \ dtimate reckoning has already ranged itseK upon the side of those who have , through good

Woodberry	PERSON	's simple clos - ing words , '' there are , in the wide world , here and there a few -- a nmnber that will increase ever with passing generations , and is even now perhaps manyf old greater than the poet knows -- in whose hearts his poetry is lodged with power . ''

		THE PRINCIPLES OF BOOK ADVERTISING .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		The questiou of the advertising of books has recently become one of interest , through discussion in the liter - ary journals , and the opinions and experiences made public have been of considerable value .

		The Dlax has expressed itself soimdly on the subject , especially in the issue of
December 1	DATE	.

		It occurs to me that the consideration of the general question of the proper methods to be followed in the advertising of books has not been placed upon a foun - dation as broad as it may profitably be placed .

		The Dial asks this question : '' Do the principles that apply to the advertising of shoes apply also to the advertising of books ? ''

		If the question had been , Are the methods that are foimd effective in the advertising of shoes adequate for the advertising of books ?

		there would be no groimd for an argument dissenting from the proposi - tions laid down in The Dial article ; or , at least , the intelligent reader would have recognized the logical force of the concliLsions drawn from such a premise .

		But the principles that xmderlie advertising apply with equal force to all advertising , whether of shoes or of books .

		It is because the discussion of advertising does not , in this case and usiuilly , consider principles that confusion often residts .

		The student of advertising recognizes the fact that it is the confusion of principles with methods that leads to nearly all the differences of opinion existing with respect to advertising , is at the bottom of mixch of the futile discussion , and is respon - sible for the differing views expressed by those who have recently written upon the subject .

		The failure to discriminate between principles and methods accounts also for a majority of the failures in advertising , and for a large proportion of the improfitable margins recognized as the residt of even what are known to be on the whole successfiU campaigns .

		While it is an old shibboleth of advertisers that there are no well-defined principles underlying advertising , considered scientifically , it is beginning to be recognized that that shibboleth is merely an expression of ignor - ance rather than a demonstrable proposition .

		It is quite true that as yet there has been no definitive and authoritative formulation of the principles that tmder - lie advertising , but there is steadily accumidating a mass of material which will soon make such formula - tion possible .

		To those students of the question who have carefully followed the work of the psychologists in several of the American , English , German , and French imiversities , it is already evident that enough has been uncovered relative to the workings of the human mind to form a basis for at least an intelligent discussion of what those principles are , and to indicate with some degree of certainty the chief lines upon which a fundamental credo of advertising must be con - structed .

		It is in the nature of a fascinating recreation to ex - amine the work of the professors of psychology , for the purpose of discovering therein those habits and tenden - cies of the mind that may be appealed to by adver - tising , and which may be relied upon to come into some degree of activity when the sympathetic suggestion arouses them .

		As it would be too long a process care - fully to indicate what has been established bearing upon this advertising problem , in this brief note , may I be allowed to affirm that the work of the psychologists , as revealed in the printed reports of several vmiversities and in their writings , suggests to me that all advertising depends for its power upon three broad qualities , which may be defined as attraction , suggestion , and assertion .

		The quality of attraction must arrest the eye of a reader who may not be conscious of any desire to read the advertisement ; the quality of suggestion must come into play the instant the eye is arrested , and carry the reader 's attention along the line of sequence to the assertion , which is the final vital element of the adver - tisement -- the argument and appeal which furnishes to the reader the purchasing motive .

		The effective adver - tisement must attract the eye , suggest something by its most obvious printed expression , and assert the full force of its argimient by that to which its attractive and sug - gestive elements induce attention .

		This progressive influence of the advertisement has been pretty well established by the experiments and in - vestigations of the psychologists .

		It is easy to conceive that there are many members going to the composition of each of these elements .

		That of attraction , for ex - ample , involves some most interesting new facts that have been recently discovered in optics ; or , more ex - actly , in relation to the action and capacity of the eye in the act of reading .

		Certain forms of type are more willingly noted by the eye than other forms .

		A cer - tain nimiber of printed letters is taken cognizance of at one '' fixation '' of the eye -- one glance , or without a movement to bring other groups into focus .

		Lines within certain definite limits of length are easily read , while those that are longer subject the eye to a strain that it resents .

		The form of the advertisement , con - sidered as an object intended to please and attract , must be in accord with the artistic principles of compo - sition -- balance , proportion , harmony , color , etc. .

		The psychological elements of the two remaining qualities of the advertisement -- suggestion and assertion -- are more complex and varied , and would require much space to state them .

		They are of more final importance than those psychological elements I have named as being inherent in the advertising quality of attraction , and therefore may make a more emphatic appeal for the attention of the student .

		I think it will appear evident to any one who gives the matter thought that the principles affecting adver - tising are universal in their application , equally oper - ative in shoe advertising and book advertising .

		The methods of applying these principles differ .

		It is too often the fact that no attention is given to the prin - ciples , and none too much to the methods .

		The trouble with much current book advertising is that it seeks to THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, appeal to people who are not interested in books .

		The merchandising of books is a problem by itself .

		Once a year -- at the holiday season - -- books are sold as mer - chandise .

		The stress of the requirements of the season drives many people to the book-counter , where they buy books for presents , with little thought or concern for the literary contents .

		At other times books are sold as literature , and there is nothing to justify advertising - attempts to sell them on other gromids .

		How to reach the small proportion of book-buyers existing in the mass of the people , is the problem the publisher has to consider .

		It is a question of method , not of principle .

		I think that it must be admitted that the relative proportion of book-buyers has steadily increased since progressive publishers began the policy of advertising in mediiuns having general circulations , such as the better class of newspapers .

		It is certam that there are potential book-buyers , many of them , among newspaper readers .

		It is not my belief that the publishers who have done good general advertising have suffered there - for .

		In looking the field over , without special prepara - tion , it seems apparent that nearly all of the large publishing houses -- those supposed to be financially strong , and successful with their books -- are liberal users of advertising space in the better newspapers .

		The reason for the inefficiency of book advertising , if it is more inefficient than other advertising , does not seem to me to lie in the choice of mediums so much as in the methods employed ui preparing the advertising .

		The great bvdk of book advertising appeals only to such resolute buyers as are determined to seek out books to minister to their developed and acknowledged literary appetites .

		It is not calculated either to create a literary taste or to arouse a dormant literary appetite .

		And , after all , the object of book advertising is to pro- mote the sale of books , not merely to notify book lovers where they can obtain satisfaction .

December 20 , 1905	DATE	.

		Messrs.
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce that they have just completed arrangements with
The University Press	ORGANIZATION	of
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, for the publication , in con - jmietion with Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	, of a work of more than ordinary interest .

		This is
Molmenti	PERSON	's ``
Venice	LOCATION	: Its Individual Growth from the
Earliest Beginnings	LOCATION	to the Fall of the Republic , '' now appear - ing in
Italy	LOCATION	under the imprint of the Instituto Italian © d'Arti Graflchi .

		The author ,
Signor Pompeo Molmen	PERSON	- ti , a senator at
Rome	LOCATION	, is a gentlemen of high social standing , and the leadmg historical writer in
Italy	LOCATION	at the present time .

		The translator is to be Mr.
Horatio F. Brown	PERSON	, liimself an authority on
Venice	LOCATION	, whose books on that city , and the distinguished position he has held there for nearly twenty years as '' British Archivist , '' have won for him the reputation of knowing more about
Venice	LOCATION	than any other living Englishman .

		The work will be issued in three sections of two volumes each , the first entitled ''
Venice	LOCATION	in the Middle Ages , '' the second `` Venice in the Golden Age , '' and the tliird `` The Decadence of
Venice	LOCATION	. ''

		Each volimie will contain forty full-page plates and a frontispiece in full color printed in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The volumes will be distinguished typographically by being printed in the beautiful Italian type cut by
Bodoni	ORGANIZATION	, which the Uni - versity Press has just revived .

		Besides the library edi - tion , there will be an edition on Italian handmade paper , with the illustrations printed on Japanese vellum .

		CHARL.es liAMB 'S IjATEST BIOGRAPHER .

		* To have at last a fiill portrayal by a loving liand of '' the most lovable figure in English literature '' is cause for no small congratulation .

		Mr.
Edward V. Lucas	PERSON	's eleven hundred octavo pages , with their many portraits and other illus - trations , give not only an elaborate life of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, but an almost equally detailed account of his alter ego ,
Mary Lamb	PERSON	, and very full sketches of the friends with whom he talked and walked , drank a convivial glass , and cracked a harmless joke .

		That the biography is constructed after the most modern methods , as compared with Tal - fourd 's ,
Barry Cornwall	PERSON	's , and aU previous lives of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, its very length and general appearance sufficiently indicate .

		The care and skill with which references to persons and places have been hunted down , and all available sources of information explored , become increasingly manifest as one turns the pages and notes the frequency and fidness of quoted matter .

		In a final and authoritative life , to accompany the same author 's scholarly edition of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's works , this is as it shovdd be , although the man of little leisure might prefer a shorter , more fluently narrative treatment of the theme , with fewer insertions of autobiogTaphic matter from the easily accessible Letters and Essays .

		In other words , as Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	lias shown himself to be the ideal editor and annotator in his recently - published seven - volume edition of Lamb 's works ^ so here he demonstrates his unequalled qualifica - tions as a compiler of all discoverable material bearing on the life-history of his chosen author .

		The method adopted was the best for the pur - pose in view ; and as the chief charm of aU previous accounts of the inimitable Elia has been due to the more or less of seK-portrayal introduced into their pages , so here again the chapters that most delight are those wherein Lamb himself lias been allowed , with least of editorial assistance , to tell his own story .

		To
Mary Lamb	PERSON	also , to
Crabb Kobinson	PERSON	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, the
Cowden Clarkes	ORGANIZATION	,
Hazlitt	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	, De Quincey ,
N. P. WiUis	PERSON	,
John WUson	PERSON	, and countless other contemporaries of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, we ai-e made debtors for a touch here and a stroke there toward the completion of the fidl-length portrait .

		THE DIAL finLshing touches to this careful likeness , and the final uupi * ession is one of unsurpassable com - pleteness .

		Not that other and shorter studies , like those of
Canon Ainger	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Percy Fitz	PERSON	- gerald .

		vnH henceforth be superfluous ; but the prosecution of research can hardly be carried beyond the point now reached , nor is it likely to be attempted .

		Without too much poking about in the gene - alogical dustbins , the biographer introduces us briefly and plea-santlj - to honest
John Lamb	PERSON	and his little fanuly at No. 2
Cro \ s-n Office Row	ORGANIZATION	, and to the excellent Samuel Salt .

		Bencher of the
Inner Temple	ORGANIZATION	, to whom the elder Lamb acted as assistant and servant .

		All that relates to
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's education at
Christ	LOCATION	's Hos - pital is of course faithfully reproduced from the Letters and the Essays , with additional inform - ation from various sources .

		To show with what painstaking devotion to detad the biographer has executed his task , let us call attention to the table -LRB- an en \ ` iably long one -RRB- of holidays which the blue-coat boys enjoyed a century and
a quarter ago	DATE	, and which -RSB- VIr .

		Lucas sets down in chronological order to give the reader a realiz - ing sense of the frequency with which our little pupd from the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	must have trotted back and forth ` tvs-ixt parent and pedagogue .

		Sun - dry bits of information , even as to the hebdom - adal bill of fare and the hours of bedgoing and uprising , ai-e gleaned from
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, themselves likewise wearers of the blue coat .

		Another noteworthy Christ 's - Hospitaller was
Charles Valentine Le Grice	PERSON	, a vnt and punster dear to
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's heart , who at
Tal	ORGANIZATION	- fourd 's request wrote out some reminiscences of his famous schooKeUow .

		A passage from his pen is worth requoting here as recalling some of the jjecvdiar circmnstances that helped to de - termine
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's character . ''

		Lamb was an amiable , gentle boy , very sensible and keenly observing , indulged by his schoolfellows and by his master on account of his infirmity of speech .

		His countenance was mild ; his complexion clear brown , with an expression which might lead you to think that he was of Jewish descent .

		His eyes were not each of the same colour , one was hazel , the other had specks of grey in the iris , mingled as we see red spots in the blood-stone .

		His step was plantigrade , which made his walk slow and peculiar , adding to the staid appearance of his figure .

		I never heard his name mentioned with - out the addition of
Charles	LOCATION	, although , as there was no other boy of the name of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, the addition was un - necessary ; but there was an implied kindness in it , and it was a proof that his gentle maimers excited that kindness .

		His delicate frame and his difficulty - of ut - terance , which was increased by agitation , unfitted him for joining in any boisterous sport .

		The description which he gives , in his ' Recollections of Christ 's Hospital , ' of the habits and feelings of the schoolboy , is a true one in general , but is more particularly a delineation of him - self -- the feelings were all in his own heart -- the por - trait was his own : ' While others were all fire and play , he stole along with all the self - concentration of a young monk . '

		These habits and feelings were awakened and cherished in him by peculiar circumstances : he had been bom and bred in the Inner Temple ; and his pa - rents continued to reside there while he was at school , so that he passed from cloister to cloister , and this was all the change his young mind ever knew . ''

		On the subject of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's romantic passion for '' Alice W '' Mr.
Luca.s	PERSON	offers the fol - lo ^ ^ ing : '' To come back to
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, whom we left on
February 8 , 1792	DATE	, laying down his pen in the
Examiner	ORGANIZATION	's office at the
South-Sea House	ORGANIZATION	for the last time and returning home with his earnings .

		Whether or not he had heard of the opening for him at the
East India House	ORGANIZATION	, I can - not say ; but he did not enter that company 's employ until
April	DATE	oth ,
two months later	DATE	.

		To this we come shortly .

		At the present moment there is a more roman - tic topic for consideration , for my impression is that Lamb filled part at least of the interval by visiting his grand - mother , and at the same time began to cherish affection for the girl whom he afterward called Alice W -- , but who is thought to have been
Ann Simmons	PERSON	of
Blenheims	LOCATION	, near
Blakesware	LOCATION	.

		My reasons for believing this to be the case are , -LRB- 1 -RRB- that on
April 5 , 1792	DATE	, he passed into harness from which he never escaped , except for annua l holidays -- at first , probably , very brief ones -- or single days when he could not have reached Widford ; and -LRB- 2 -RRB- that Mrs. Field died in
August , 1792	DATE	, thus closing Blakesware to her grandchildren .

		We have no knowl - edge of any other friends with whom Lamb could have stayed after her death , while it is hardly likely that so yoimg a clerk could have afforded to stay at Mr.
Clem	PERSON	- itson 's inn at
Widford	LOCATION	, except very occasionally . ''

		A phase of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's inner self that is seldom dwelt upon has to do with his religious or more properly his theological beliefs , so far as he had any fixed belief .

		In later life , as his biographer remarks , his religion ceased to be articulate and became merged in conduct ; '' but in his twenty - first year his interest in
Priestley	PERSON	and his L ^ ni - tarian and fatalistic creed was intense , '' writes Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	; and still further : `` To the end , I think , although this point is a little vague .

		Lamb remained nominally a Lnitarian , a profession of faith to which probably he was first led by his
Aimt Hetty	PERSON	-LRB- a constant attendant at the Essex Street chapel -RRB- , and in which he was fortified by
Coleridge	PERSON	. ''

		In one of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's earlier letters to
Coleridge	PERSON	he writes : • • I have seen
Priestley	PERSON	.

		I love to see his name repeated in your writings .

		I love and honour him almost profanely . ''

		The tragical event of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's young manhood receives of course fidl treatment .

		But in spite of calamity and grief one must push on and fid - fill one 's destiny ; and
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's destiny , as we are assured , was to \*
Tite	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the
November	DATE	fol - lowing that awful 21st
September , 1796	DATE	, hLs 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, interest in writing had revived , and he sent to
Coleridge	PERSON	the fragments of verse that he wished to have printed with his friend 's poems and dedi - cated to his sister .

		Thenceforward he turned more and more to authorship for solace .

		As to the adoption of the famous and often mispro - notmced pseudonym , a letter from
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	to
John Taylor	PERSON	the publisher , written in
July , 1821	DATE	, con - tains the following pertinent passage : '' Having a brother now there -LSB- at the
South-Sea House	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- , and doubtuig how he might relish certain de - scriptions in it -LSB- the essay on the
South-Sea House	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- , I clapt down the name of
Elia	LOCATION	to it , which passed ofP pretty well , for Elia himself added the function of an author to that of a scrivener , like myself .

		... I went the other day -LRB- not having seen him for a year -RRB- to laugh over with him at my usurpation of his name , and fomid him , alas !

		no more than a name , for he died of con - sumption eleven months ago , and I knew not of it .

		So the name has fairly devolved to me , I think ; and 't is all he has left me . ''

		In the adoption of a pseudonym Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	finds a possible explanation of '' the difference between the comparative thinness of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's pre-Elian writings and the Elian richness and colour . ''

		For , he adds , '' there are some writers -LRB- paradoxical though it seems -RRB- who can never express themselves so freely as when , adopting a dramatic standpoint , they affect to be some one else . ''

		And a similarity in this respect is traced between
Goldsmith	PERSON	and
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	.

		In both writers the innocent imposture served to fortify a feeble courage and overcome a natural diffi - dence .

		Before dropping this subject , it is inter - esting to note a remark once made by
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	himself , that `` Elia '' forms an anagram of `` a lie . ''

		Among matters of not the first importance , the whole story of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's quarrel with
Lloyd	PERSON	, in which Lamb was somewhat involved , and which has already been related in Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's ``
Charles Lamb	PERSON	and the Lloyds , '' is rather tiresomely repeated here .

		Yet it need not be regarded as a total waste of printer 's ink , so sweetly unquarrelsome by natural tempera - ment does Lamb appear through it all .

		Even Scotchmen , with whom he professes to entertain '' imperfect sympathies , '' he can not roundly vitu - perate when he tries .

		Contrast
Carlyle	PERSON	's \ m - fortunate characterization of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, harshly abusive and opulent in epithet , with these gentle strictures from
Elia	ORGANIZATION	's pen on
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's country - men : '' I have been trying all my life to like
Scotchmen	PERSON	, and am obliged to desist from the experiment in despair .

		They can not like me -- and , in truth , I never knew one of that nation who attempted to do it ... The bram of a true Caledonian -LRB- if I am not mistaken -RRB- is consti - tuted upon quite a different plan .

		His Minerva is born in panoply .

		You are never admitted to see his ideas in their growth -- if , indeed , they do grow , and are not rather put together upon pruiciples of clockwork .

		You never catch his mmd in an imdress .

		He never hints or suggests anything , but imlades his stock of ideas in per - fect order and completeness ... His imderstanding is always at its meridian -- you never see the first dawn , the early streaks .

		-- He has no faltermgs of self - suspicion . ''

		From some recollections of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
J. Fuller-Robinson	PERSON	, published forty years ago in `` The Guardian , '' we quote the following as given in Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	's pages : '' I was admitted into a small and pleasantly shaded parlour .

		The modest room was himg romid with fine engravings by
Hogarth	PERSON	, in dark frames .

		Books and magazines were scattered on the table , and on the old - fashioned window-seat .

		I chatted awhile with Miss Lamb -- a meek , intelligent , very pleasant , and rather deaf , elderly lady ... '
Elia	PERSON	' came in soon after -- a short , thin man .

		His dress was black -- a capacious coat , knee-breeches , and gaiters , and he wore a white neck-handkerchief .

		His head was remarkably fine , and his dark and shaggy hair and eyebrows , heated face , and very piercing jet-black eyes gave to liis appearance a singularly wild and striking expression .

		The sketch of him in
Eraser	LOCATION	's Magazine gives a true idea of his figure , but no portrait , I am sure , coidd do justice to his splendid coimtenance .

		He grasped me cordially by the hand , sat down , and taking a bottle from a cupboard behind him , mixed some rum-and-water .

		On another occasion , his sister objected to this operation , and he refrained .

		Presently after , he said , '
May	DATE	I have a little drop now , only a leetle drop ? ' '

		No , be a good boy . '

		At last he prevailed , and took his draught . ''

		And so on , with much more that is well worth picturing out before one 's mind 's eye .

		Like so many of liis comitrymen .

		Lamb won popularity in
America	LOCATION	before he had become popidar in
England	LOCATION	.

		His '' Essays of Elia '' had little vogue among English readers until long after the writer 's death , whereas in
America	LOCATION	, as Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	says , they so pleased the public on their first appearance here in
1828	DATE	that the pub - lishers ,
Carey	PERSON	,
Lea and Carey	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, hastened to issue a second series of their own compiling , wherein they generously included , along with selections from
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, three essays from the pens of
Allan Cunningham	PERSON	and
Barry Cornwall	PERSON	.


N. P. Willis	PERSON	, in talking with Lamb in
1834	DATE	, found that this American success had gratified the English essayist not a little , and that he was well pleased with the Second Series , despite the error in its compilation .

		The modest and judicious suppression of self which Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	has exercised in the accom - plishment of his task is deserving of praise .

		The fitting word is supplied at need , but he has wisely refrained from emulatmg those long - winded orators who make their introduction of a \ asiting celebrity the occasion for seK-display .

		EuROPEAX Diplomacy ix its BEGrvxryGS .

		* The raison d'etre of Dr.
Hill	PERSON	's `` History of Diplomacy , * ' as given by the author in his preface , is that , although special questions and particular periods of diplomatic history have been ably presentetl , no general history of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean diplomacy exists in any language .

		At the outset the author was confronted with two practical problems of no small moment .

The Struggle for Universal Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		Xew York :
Longmana	LOCATION	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		first arose out of the vast field of research pre - sented by the archives now at the command of the investigator .

		The second was to determine the proper point of departure .

		Dr.
Hill	PERSON	can not accept the Peace of AVestphalia as the starting point of diplomacy , but rather it must be re - garded as the result of long preparation .

		Accepting this view .

		Dr.
Hill	PERSON	begins his story with a description of the organization of
Europe	LOCATION	under the old Roman Empire .

		The system of government is described at some length because it furnished the model for the organization of the church , which was the next power to aim at universality .

		Even amid all the confusion of the Barbarian invasions this idea of universal empire never lost its hold upon the imagination of thinking men .

		The significance of the so - caUed fall of the empire -LRB- 476 A. D. -RRB- lies in this , '' that it serves to fix in the mind the substitution of local and racial authority in western
Europe	LOCATION	in place of the waning influence of universal imperial rule . ''

		It separates the period of the old Empire from that long period of change and effort to secure order through the organization of the Barbarian kingdoms , the revived Empire , feudalism , the influence of the church , which finally resulted in the great national states of modem times .

		One of the most interesting studies in
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean history is the birth of the modem states and their realization of nationality through a slow and painful process .

		The idea of universal empire had so dominated the world that the new idea had a desperate fight for existence .

		The old idea did not perish in a day , with the fall of
Rome	LOCATION	; for some time longer the West felt itscK a part of the Empire which centered about Byzantium .

		To be outside the Empire was to be outside the pale of civilization .

		With such unity there could be no real field for diplomacy .

		But gradually the feeling of real unit -RCB- * became less strong .

		The East looked down upon the West as barbarian , and religious differences be - came more and more accentuated .

		The head - ship of
Rome	LOCATION	in religion was now asserted , and the Pope claimed the supremacy for himseK over all the orthodox West , and at times even asserted it over the Arian heretics of the
East	LOCATION	.

		But even this claim was not put forth in its entirety all at once .

		It arose somewhat gradu - ally from the actual condition of things .

		For a time the Pope remained at least the nominal subject of the eastern Empire , but soon became the only effective authority in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Finally , when
Leo III	PERSON	.

		put his ban upon image worship in
Rome	LOCATION	, opposition broke out into open rebel - 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, lion .

		Papal diplomacy now had its birth in the policy of
Gregory II.	PERSON	, who wished neither to destroy the Lombard power , when
Liutprand	PERSON	was seeking to unite
Italy	LOCATION	in one kingdom , nor to annihilate the influence of the Emperor , but rather to increase his own prestige by playing off the one against the other .

		As the interest and power of the eastern Emperor decreased in the west a substitute had to be provided to check the
Lombards	LOCATION	, and this
Gregory III	PERSON	.

		found in
Pepin	LOCATION	, King of the
Franks	PERSON	.

		This marks the first instance of interference in Italian affairs by a northern j ^ rince , -- a practice followed there - after for centuries , to the detriment of both nations .

		The Pope was seeking to establish his own temporal rule in
Italy	LOCATION	, and in so doing in - augurated a policy wliich was a strong barrier to national growth .

		It was not until more than half a century after the last of the phantom emperors that
Germany	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	realized na - tional unity .

		The usurpation of the imperial chair by a woman ,
Irene	PERSON	, gave a fitting opportunity to revive the empire in the west .

		Disorder had become chronic in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		In the hope of secur - ing a power capable of curing this , the Pope crowned Charlemagne on
Christmas	DATE	day , 800 , and invested him with the diadem of the
Caesars	ORGANIZATION	, only it was now the ''
Holy Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		But herein were sown the seeds of a long and bitter contest , -- the struggle for supremacy be - tween the Empire and the
Papacy	LOCATION	.

		Should the Popes be allowed to make and unmake tem - poral riders , or shoidd they be subject to the civil power ?

		Along with this went the great ques - tion as to whether the world empire should live again , or whether great states shoidd develop along national lines .

		One thing which boded weU for the growth of nationalities was the custom of dividing king - doms by inheritance , like so much real estate .

		After the death of Charlemagne his great em - pire was divided up .

		After a contest among his heirs , diplomacy was called into play , and an arrangement effected at Verdim which Dr. Hill thinks '' the most important international document ever written '' in its influence upon European history .

		On the west was a territory of tolerable geographic and ethnic imity which was soon to develop into the powerful state of
France	LOCATION	; on the east the territory of the later
Germany	LOCATION	.

		In between , the kingdom of the Emperor Lothaire stretched from HoUand to
Rome	LOCATION	, possessing neither ethnic nor geographic unity .

		Upon the death of Lothaire his imcles of the east and west di \ ` ided up his inheritance and began to court the favor of the Pope for the imperial dignity .

		It is not to be presumed that
Rome	LOCATION	was an indifferent spectator to these struggles .

		Even her own citizens were divided , some contending for the civic freedom of the city , others for the supremacy of the Pope , and still others for the supremacy of the Emperor .

		As a result ,
Italy	LOCATION	was the scene of disorder after the coronation of Charles the Bold .

		There the conflict of author - ity was sharpest .

		The whole story of Italian politics was smnmed up in an epigTam by the Bishop of
Cremona	LOCATION	, -- '' The Italians always wish to have two masters , in order to hold each of them in check by the other . ''

		In attempting to follow this principle for the conservation of its o ^ vn power , the papacy sometimes gained , but often fell a victim to the general anarchy .

		Passing over the greater part of this struggle , it is interesting to come to the appearance of
Venice	LOCATION	on the scene as practically marking the birth of modem diplomacy .

		There , in
May	DATE	, 11 7 7 , met '' the first European congress in which independent civic conunimities had ever freely represented their own rights in the presence of princes -- the prototype of the great interna - tional congresses of a later time . ''

		Venice was careful to select men of eminent qualification to represent her interests , to instruct them in the arts of diplomacy , and consequently soon be - came '' the school and touchstone of ambassa - dors . ''

		Secrecy and urbanity were the cardinal principles of Venetian diplomacy , and this sys - tem was soon to be put in practice by all the Italian states , the numerous city-states so het - erogeneous in character and inspired by motives so diverse .

		Each city within itself was the seat of intrigue , owing to the mutually hostile ele - ments of tradesmen , artisans , the official aris - tocracy , and the feudal nobles whose swords threatened the population in the streets .

		The espionage and intrigue of partisans within the city were extended to the relations with neigh - boring cities . ''

		To know the intentions of one 's neighbor , to defeat his hostile designs , to form alliances with his enemies , to steal away his friends , and to prevent his union with others , became matters of the highest public interest .

		Less costly than war , diplomacy now , in large measure , superseded it with plot and counter - plot . ''

		And when these failed , the foreigner was called in to increase the general complication .

		Out of this system was born the conception of '' equilibrium '' as a necessity of defense .

		The transitory alliances and counter-alliances of the Italian princes and republics give us the real
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11 '' prototype and epitome of what all
Europe	LOCATION	was soon to become upon a g ^ rander scale . ''

		The natural correlate of all this would have been a code of public law to reg ^ ulate the intercourse of these states with each other , but such a thing was not vet possible .

		The moral sense did not demand it .

		but its birth was witnessed on the sea , where the demands of commerce made it imperative .

		The customs of the sea were re - duced to ^ vriting in the '' Tables of Amalfi , '' which later gave place to the '' Consolato de -RSB- Mare * ' -- the `` first example of law international among the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		Such in its larger outlines is the story Dr.
Hill	PERSON	has told in his first voltune .

		In reality it contains a great deal of matter which has only a very remote connection with diplomacy .

		If it were really new , it might be justified as neces - sary to a proper understanding of the main theme , but a great deal of it is not new .

		and indee < l may be found in the ordinary text-books on European history .

		Despite the formidable array of sources and authorities cited at the end of each chapter , the work does not impress one as making any really noteworthy contribution to historical knowledge .

		It is valuable , however , for bringing into one view the larger facts of the period treated , and emphasizing their influ - ence upon the gro ^ ^ - th of national states .

		Much may be expected of the succeeding volvmies , which will deal with a period when diplomacy was coming into its own .

		it is too early to predict ; but it is difficult to believe that any - thing \ ^ - ill be accomplished more important for intellectual progi-ess than the establishment of the doctrine of evolution on a scientific basis .

		This great work is justly credited to
Darwin	PERSON	, but with his name must always be linked that of
Wallace	PERSON	, who independently thought out the theory on which
Dar \ s-in	ORGANIZATION	's work is based .

		Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	occupies a unique position among scientific men .

		isolation , and never being tied down as many men are by professional or official custom and etiquette , he has always been recognized as an independent .

		Orthodoxy is not peculiar to the church ; it is a tendency common to all organi - zations , and in a large measure necessary for their continuance .

		At the same time , it is a perpetual obstacle to progress , and the hetero - dox are the true prophets of the dawn .

		Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	has lived to see part of his once hetero - dox opinions become orthodox , while others are still rejected by the majority as unworthy of consideration .

		Consequently , to the ordinary '' well-behaved '' scientist , he seems to be a sort of double personality , a mixture of genius and absurdity .

		In the case of any man of great intellectual power , it is not to be expected that all his opin - ions will be justified by subsequent knowledge .

		Darwin was undoubtedly in error in respect to certain matters ; and presumably the same will have to be said of
Wallace	ORGANIZATION	.

		But this should not blind us for a moment to the immense service performed , or should we hastily assume that the opinion of the day is correct .

		I recall a little matter which well illustrates Dr.
Wal	PERSON	- lace 's power of reasoning , and at the same time the shortsightedness of naturalists .

		Some fif - teen years ago there was in preparation a new edition of '' Island Life , '' in which Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	discussed the animals of the
British Islands	ORGANIZATION	, and argued that there ought to be some species and varieties peculiar to
Britain	LOCATION	.

		Lists of sup - posed peculiar forms were prepared , but zoolo - gists and botanists were alike skeptical .

		Some were '' probably not distinct , '' others '' would certainly be found on the continent . ''

		The general attitude was one of incredulity or even contempt .

		Since that time , however , particular groups have been studied much more carefully than ever before -LRB- follo \* ` ing the methods intro - duced by certain American naturalists -RRB- , and although it is true that some of the kinds for - merly listed must be stricken out , a whole series of insular forms has been detected among the mammals , which were supposed to be * • perfectiy known '' !

		Only last year , even , a very distinct new species of mouse was recorded .

		Dr.
Wal	PERSON	- lace has thus been justified beyond his expecta - tions , and when the same careful methods are applied to the whole of the British fauna and flora , the results \* ` ill no doubt be such as would make the orthodox nineteenth-century natural - ist stare .

		I refer to this matter , because I have some personal knowledge of it , and because it shows 12 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, how facts which are perfectly evident when brought to light , may remain undiscovered be - neath our very noses .

		Probably the most objectionable of Dr.
Wal	PERSON	- lace 's opinions , in the eyes of orthodox science , are those relative to spirtualism .

		Without knowing anything particular about the matter , most people will exhaust their language of abuse upon this subject .

		Those scientific men who reject the whole body of evidence are proclaimed as sound of mind , though their methods of re - search may have been such as woidd be called ridicidous if applied to any other subject .

		Those who become convinced that there is something not explained by known '' laws of nature '' are held to have '' a screw loose somewhere , '' though they may be known masters in research , such as
Crookes	LOCATION	,
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	,
William James	PERSON	, and
Wallace	PERSON	.

		It is perfectly evident , and thor - oughly recognized by all those who have given much attention to the matter , that the laws gov - erning spiritual existence can not at present be defined .

		It is held that the '' supernatural '' is as '' natural '' as anything else , but it is con - fessedly difficidt to comprehend .

		Some day , perhaps , there wiU arise a Darwin of spiritual - ism , who wiU put the whole subject on an intel - ligible basis ; and then it will be seen that we were groping in the dark before like the pre - Darwinian evolutionists .

		It will be clear to the reader that the life of such a man as
Wallace	PERSON	can not fail to be of sur - passing interest .

		Like
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, he has chosen to present it to us in considerable detail , and with absolute frankness .

		In it , we trace the development of generalizations from apparently trivial beginnings , and are presented with a pic - ture of past times , which seem now so remote as to be almost prehistoric .

		There is a good deal of matter in the book which does not strike one as being particularly valuable or important ; but on the other hand , the variety of subjects discussed , and the wide human interests of the author , cause it to appeal to a far larger circle than the usual biography of a man engaged in the investigation of technical matters .

		The splendid courage and honesty exhibited can not fail to be inspiring , even to those who do not agree with the views advocated .

		They teach a lesson which is sorely needed by the present generation , with its altogether too slavish sub - servience to the powers that be .

		It is interest - ing to find that with aU this , there went a shy - ness and timidity in the presence of others , which was never quite overcome .

		In discuss - ing certain humiliating and Ul-suited pvmish - ments of childhood , attention is called to the right of each individual to have his personality respected , even in blame .

		It is remarked that this is far better recognized in
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	than with us . ''

		With them this principle is taught from childhood , and pervades every class of society , while with us it was oidy recognized by the higher classes , and by them rarely extended to uiferiors or to children .

		The feeling that demands this recognition is certainly strong in many children , and those who have suffered imder the failure of their elders to respect it , can well appreciate the agony of shame endured by the more civilized Eastern peoples , whose feelings are so often outraged by the total absence of all respect shown them by their European masters or conquerors .

		In thus recognizing the sanctity of this deepest of human feelmgs these peo - ple manifest a truer phase of civilization than we have attained to .

		Even savages often surpass us in this respect . ''

		-LRB- Vol .

		The author 's travels in
South America	LOCATION	and the
Malay Archipelago	LOCATION	are not described at great length , because he long ago published books about them .

		The best part of his
South Ameri	LOCATION	- can collection was lost through the burning of the ship on the homeward voyage , of which a graphic account is given .

		Only some drawings of palms and fishes were saved ; the latter have recently been examined by a specialist , and it turns out that many of the species have never been obtained again to this day .

		A short chap - ter is devoted to the memory of
H. E. Wallace	PERSON	, a brother of Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	, who went out to
Brazil	LOCATION	to assist him in his work , and died of yellow fever at
Para	LOCATION	.


Herbert Wallace	PERSON	was not a nat - uralist , but was very fond of writing verse , and several of his productions are printed .

		In one of them we fuid the lines : '' For here upon the
Amazon	LOCATION	The dread mosquito bites -- Inflames the blood with fever , '' etc. .

		At that time , of course , it was wholly unknown that the mosquito carried the germ of yellow fever ; but these lines seem curiously prophetic .

		The journey to the Malay region was more successftd from every point of view .

		The mate - rials obtained were enormous , including almost inmunerable new species .

		Some of the insects have not been described yet , from the lack of specialists to study them .

		Although
Darwin	PERSON	and
Wallace	PERSON	might have been considered rivals , the fact that they had independently worked out the same theory never led to anything but warm friendship between them .

		Each always tried to give the f idlest credit to the other , and
Wallace	PERSON	called his book on the theory of evolution '' Darwinism . ''

		Stress has sometimes been laid on the fact that
Wallace	PERSON	disagreed with
Darwin	PERSON	about several matters ;
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 these are discussed fully in the Life , but it is shown that they were insignificant in compari - son with the great and fundamental agreement .

		Darwin 's last letter to Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	is given , and the latter adds this interesting comment : '' This letter is to me , perhaps , the most interesting I eyer received from
Darwin	LOCATION	, since it shows that it was only the engrossing interests of his scientific and liter - ary work , performed under the drawback of almost constant ill-health , that prevented him from taking a more active part in the discussion of those social and political questions that so deeply affect the lives and happiness of the great bulk of the people .

		It is a great satisfaction that his last letter to me , written within nine months of his death , and terminating a correspond - ence which had extended over a quarter of a century , should be so cordial , so sympathetic , and broad-minded . ''

		In 1886-7 Dr.
Wallace	PERSON	^ ^ sited
America	LOCATION	, travelling from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		He gives a fiUl accovmt of his experiences , with many observations on matters biological and sociologi - cal .

		I should like to quote his conclusions at some length , but it is impossible in a short no - tice .

		While enthusiastically admiring the gran - deur and beauty of the
Kocky Movmtains	PERSON	, the
Calif	LOCATION	omian
Sierras	LOCATION	, and other regions , and fully appreciating the good qualities of
America	LOCATION	and Americans , he deplores the spread of sordid com - mercialism , and the way in which man has in so many places destroyed the beauty of nature .

		The same is true in
England	LOCATION	, he says : '' Both countries are creating ugliness , both are de - stroying beauty ; but in
America	LOCATION	it is done on a larger scale and with a more hideous monotony '' -LRB- p. 193 . -RRB-

		The book is well illustrated ; but one can not help wishing that instead of some of the plates which have little to do with the narrative , or little intrinsic value , we could have been favoretl with portraits of some of the great naturalists with whom the author was associated .

		Not the least welcome is the sketch that informs us about the modest -LRB- in every sense -RRB- beginnings of one of the newest immortals ,
M. Rene Bazin	PERSON	; and not the least interesting is the study of the short stories of
Zola	ORGANIZATION	, in which Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	discovers that deep
spring	DATE	of idealism that put on strange disguises in the novels of the Rougon-Macquart series , but asserted itself so clearly in his last works .

		In spite of this wide variety of theme and com - plete lack of sequence and connection bet ^ ^ een the papers , the residting book does not lack a certain kind of unity .

		This results partly from the imfailing qualities of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's style : and partly from the point of riew from which the sub - ject is uniformly regarded , which is the '' incom - plete and indirect '' point of view of '' one who paints a face in profile . ''

		If the task essayed is thus a modest and restricted one , it is not on that accoimt easy .

		The two blocks of stumbling are clearly indicated in the preface when Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	thus defines his purpose : `` ♦ I have tried to preserve that attitude of sympathy , of general comprehension , for the lack of which some English criticism of foreign authors has been valueless , because proceeding from a point of view so far out of focus as to make its whole presentation false ; and yet I have remembered that it is a foreigner that takes the portrait , and that it is for a foreign audience , not for a native one . ''

		What I have sought in every case to do is to give an impression of the figure before me which shall be in general harmony with the tradition of French criticism , but at the same time to preserve that independence which is the right of a foreign observer , and to illus - trate the peculiarities of my subject by references to English poetry and prose . ''

		14 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, It goes without saying that the programme thus traced is admirably realized .

		Few men of English speech could bring to its accomplish - ment so happy a gift of characterization , so engaging a style , so much intelligence and sympathy , so large a stock of precise informal tion , so extended an outlook over the long and wide expanse of modem literature .

		To what other , indeed , coidd a committee of discrimina - ting French critics have turned so confidently with the invitation to address the Societe des Conferences of
Paris	LOCATION	on '' The Influence of
France	LOCATION	upon English Poetry '' ?

		We shoidd be very ungracious indeed were we to lament that the profiles are not something different , and that if we have made already a first-hand acquaint - ance with the subjects whom he introduces he does not lead us much further into their intimacy , or thi'ow upon the intricacies and obscurities of their message , if such there be , a more searching illumination .

		We are glad to take them grate - fidly as they are , and to feel that in their kind they could hardly be better .

		Never have the fea - tures and expressions of the familiar faces that pass in procession before us been caught more nicely or fixed on canvas more dexterously .

		And even when those of whom Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	discourses are old axjquaintances , we shall get something more than an aesthetic pleasure from his compan - ionship .

		We can hardly listen half an hour to his well-informed talk without receiving manifold in - struction .

		There are even two or three positive additions to the sum of knowledge .

		Thus , in the study of de Vigny , our knowledge of the extent and promptitude of his response to En - glish influences is enlarged at several points ; and in the paper on the '' Portuguese Letters '' much exact information , drawn from conceal - ment in the papers of a provincial society , is turned to account for establishing the source and original sequence of these letters .

		In view of all this it wiU not detract appre - ciably from the interest of the general reader who is likely to take up such a volume at all that almost every page betrays the professional bias of the man of letters and of the historian of literature .

		The men and works observed are viewed in their historical connections , as mo - ments in a changing and developing theory and praxjtice of poetic art .

		That is inevitable , of course , when Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	is dealing with poets like
M. Henri de Regnier	PERSON	,
Stephane Mallarme	PERSON	, or M. Paid Fort , who have been much pre - occupied with the teclmique of their art .

		But when speaking of de Vigny also he is much in - terested in the question of his artistic originality and his relations to the main literary influences of the time .

		It is as a historian of literature that he insists , with rather too much emphasis , we suspect , on the immediate and great influence of the '' • Portuguese Letters '' on prose style , both in
England	LOCATION	and in
France	LOCATION	.

		It is as a historian again that , by way of preface to his sympathetic sketch of
M. Rene Bazin	PERSON	, he comments with much shrewdness on the '' curious condition of the French novel '' at the particidar moment in question .

		It is preeminently as the historian of English literature that he appears in the address on '' The Influence of
France	LOCATION	ujx -RRB- n English Poetry '' which here sees the light for the first time in its original English form .

		Within the brief limits of such an address no attempt is made , of course , to enimierate all the debts that English poetry owes to
France	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	rather tries to distinguish broadly between two different ways in which English literature has borrowed from its neighbor , and the more con - spicuous residts in each kind .

		These two kinds of borrowing are , the one superficial , the other material ; the one of '' color , '' the other of '' substance . ''

		The sub - stantial borrowing is that exemplified by the drama of the Restoration ; imitation is gross and slavish , and individuality has been resigned .

		This is the sign of an unliealthy condition . ''

		These are cases where an exliausted literature , in ex - treme decay , is kept alive by borrowing its very body and essence from a foreign source . ''

		On the other hand the times when a literature takes on a color from a foreign source are likely to be moments of health and vigor .

		This second man - ner of influence Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	illustrates by the ex - ample of the Roman de la Rose and the part of the French poets in forming the talent of Chaucer , and again by Pope .

		The address is suggestive , especially of questions .

		We find our - selves wondering if literature is really conceived of as a living organism , imposing itself upon the series of individuals that seem to produce it , which would be to out-Brimetiere
M. Brune	PERSON	- tiere 's evolving literary species .

		Or is this impression but one of those illusions that the insufficiency of hmnan speech is constantly creating for us ?

		Does Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	mean any - thing more , after all , than that your small talent imitates crudely and slavishly , and your great talent originally and creatively , whether the models be imported or domestic ?

		Suggestive as the address is , it is not the part of the book that will be most enjoyed , even by those who may have a kind of professional in - terest in literary history .

		It is perhaps when X

		It was all excessively amusing -LSB- he has been dining with a mixed company of lyrical sjTnbolists at a res - tatirant of the Latin Quarter -RSB- , but deep down in my consciousness , tolling like a little bell , there continued to sound the words , ' We have not seen
Verlaine	PERSON	. '

		I was losing all hope , and we were descending the
Boide	PERSON	- vard , our faces set for home , when two more poets , a male and a female , most amiably hurried to meet as with the intoxicating news that
Verlaine	PERSON	had been seen to dart into a little place called the
Caf	ORGANIZATION	^ SoleU d'Or .

		Thither we accordingly hied , buoyed up by hope , tuod our party , now containing a dozen persons -LRB- all poets -RRB- , rushed into an almost empty drinking-shop .

		But no

		M. Mor ^ as then collected ns round a table , and fresh grenadines were ordered . ''

		Where I sat , by the elbow of
M. Mor	ORGANIZATION	& `` , I was op - posite an open door , absolutely dark , leading down , by oblique stairs , to a cellar .

		As I idly watched this square of blackness I suddenly saw some ghostly shape flutter - ing at the bottom of it .

		It took the form of a strange bald head , bobbing close to the ground .

		Although it was BO dim and vague , an idea crossed my mind .

		Not daring to speak , I touched M. Mor ^ as , and so drew his attention to it . '

		Pas un mot , pas un geste .

		Monsieur ! '

		he whispered , and then , instructed in the guile of his race , insidious

		rose , making a vague detour towards the street , and then plunged at the cellar door .

		There was a pro- longed scuffle and a rolling down stairs ; then M. Mo - r & s reapjKjared , triumphant ; behind him something flopped up out of the darkness like an owl , -- a timid shambling figure m a soft black hat , with jerking hands , and it peeped with intention to disappear again .

		16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, has come to the end of her tether , the moral of her story is embodied in an impressive paragi'aph . ''

		It was no longer , however , from the vision of material poverty that she turned with the greatest shrinking .

		She had a sense of deeper impoverishment -- of an inner desti - tution compared to which outer conditions dwindled into insignificance .

		It was indeed miserable to be poor -- to look forward to a shabby , anxious middle-age , leading by dreary degrees of economy and self-denial to gradual absorption in the dingy communal existence of the boarding-house .

		But there was something more miserable still -- it was the clutch of solitude at her heart , the sense of being swept like a stray uprooted growth down the heedless current of the years .

		That was the feeling which possessed her now -- the feeling of being something rootless and ephemeral , mere spin-drift of the whirling surface of existence , without anything to which the poor little tentacles of self could cling before the awful flood submei ^ ed them .

		And as she looked back she saw that there had never been a time when she had had any real relation to life .

		Her parents too had been rootless , blown hither and thither on every wind of fashion , without any personal existence to shelter them from its shifting gusts .

		She herself had g ^ wn up without any one spot of earth being dearer to her than another : there was no centre of early pieties , of grave endearing traditions , to which her heart could revert and from which it could draw strength for itself and tenderness for others . ''

		This is SO fine and true that it reconciles us in part to the complex of empty talk and petty intrigue and ignoble aim through which , as through a desert waste , we have toiled to reach it .

		But the question remains persistent whether it was worth while to describe at such length and with such infinite pains the career of any woman of whom it must be said in the end that she had never had any real relation to life .

		We are much inclined to doubt that it was worth while -- for a writer of Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's ex - ceptional gifts .

		`` The Northerner , '' by Miss
Norah Davis	PERSON	, is a novel of the new South struggling with the old , of the modern infusion of enterprise into the shiftless - ness of the past , of the conflict between rational ideas and crusted prejudice .

		The protagonist of this con - flict is a northern capitalist settled in
Alabama	LOCATION	as the owner and manager of the street railway and light - ing plant of a small town .

		His ways are not the ways of the natives , and he incurs their hatred .

		This leads to such unpleasant consequences as social os - tracism , underhanded conspiracy to ruin his business , and the actual wrecking of his establishment .

		The situation becomes so strained that only the precau - tions of his two or three friends save him from a summary disposal at the hands of the mob .

		The negro problem , and the iri-ational temper of the pop - ulace in any question that concerns a negro , figure largely in the story , and prepare the way for a lynch - ing scene that is described with ghastly picturesque - ness .

		The author seems to have gained a singularly subtle insight into the southern way of regarding the color question , but leaves it hardly less a mystery than before to the analytic intelligence .

		The book has a softer side , also , and embodies a charming love - story , in which the hero comes out as successfully as his failiu-e is complete in other respects .

		It is an un - usually strong book , with an unusually strong man for its central character .

		Just a love story -- and a particularly nice one -- is what we have in ''
Lynette	PERSON	and the Congressman , '' by Miss
Mary Farley Sanborn	PERSON	.

		Lynette is a young woman who lives with her mother in a
Washington	LOCATION	boarding-house , and is employed in one of the gov - ernment departments .

		She is a Virginian , and not the least of her cliarms is her soft and appealing southern speech , which is so reproduced in the text as to make its delicious accent sound in ovu ' ears .

		The congi'essman is from
Michigan	LOCATION	, and is a wid - ower with two half-grown boys .

		He is besieged in the citadel of his affections by a pettish and opulent beauty who has distinctly vixenish characteristics , and his acts sometimes verge upon indiscretion .

		But his love for
Lynette	PERSON	is the real thing , and saves him from the assaults of her designing rival .

		We do not quite like
Lynette	PERSON	's daring experiment , which leads her , under an assumed name , to enter her rival 's service as a maid , in order that she may find out whether the former is really deserving of the con - gressman 's regard .

		The situation is , however , deftly managed , and not as unpleasant as it would seem from this description .

		The Rev.
James M. Ludlow	PERSON	, who achieved a brilliant success with '' The Captain of the Janizaries '' about twenty years ago , and who has since been moderately successfvd with certain historical romances upon bib - lical themes , is to be congratulated upon his return to a subject similar in type to that of his first and best book .

		His new romance , ''
Sir Raoul	PERSON	, '' is a story of the Fom-th Crusade , and of its diversion , through Venetian intrigue , from its primary object to the raid upon
Constantinople	LOCATION	, which resulted in the brief res - toration of the
Emperor Alexius	PERSON	, the temporary union of the Greek and Roman churches , and the estab - lishment of the Latin Empire of the
East	LOCATION	under
Baldwin	PERSON	.

		Here is material enough and to spare ; the richness of the material , in fact , is responsible for the chief fault of the book , which huddles one event upon another to confusing effect .

		Mr.
Ludlow	PERSON	's hero is a youthful knight of the Black Forest , who suffers disgrace early in his career , and is given out for dead , but who in reality remains very much alive , and par - ticipates , under an assmned name , in the exciting happenings with which the romance is concerned .

		The interest is sustained at a high pitch throughout , and the author 's knowledge of his subject seems to embrace both the broad historical issues of the period and a diversity of cm * ious matters of detail respect - ing such things as chivalry , topography , and the secret ways of
Venice	LOCATION	and
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		A neat and pointed style provides the story with an added element of attractiveness .

		Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	has given us a spirited ro - mance of
Fort Chartres	LOCATION	and
Detroit	LOCATION	in the days of the conspiracy of
Pontiac	LOCATION	, when Frenchmen were stiU clinging to a forlorn hope in their
Mississippi	LOCATION	valley outposts , and dreaming that a change in the political kaleidoscope might yet restore to them the dominion that had been lost forever when
Wolfe	PERSON	had scaled the rock of
Quebec	LOCATION	four years earlier .

		Losers ' Luck , '' by ISIr .


Charles Tenney Jackson	PERSON	?

		is a storj ' of '' the questionable enterprises of a yachts man , a princess , and certain filibusters in
Central America	LOCATION	. ''

		The yachtsman , a reckless American millionaire , with a trio of his friends , is kidnapped in the harbor of
San Francisco	LOCATION	by the princess and the filibusters .

		The yacht and its legitimate proprietors are hurried to the coast of
Central America	LOCATION	, the un - willing captives warming up to the enterprise as their indignation cools .

		This fact is to be accounted for by the winsome charm of the princess and the dare - devil characteristics of the yachtsman .

		They are soon plunged into the thick of a revolutionary upris - ing , and some very prett -RRB- - scrimmages ensue .

		The revolution is a failure , and the heroine for whose beaux t/eitx the yachtsman has committed himself to the dangerous enterprise , has the bad taste to prefer a Spanish to an American lover , which leaves the yachtsman disconsolate .

		Nevertheless , his last re - mark is to the effect that he would like to do it all over again .

		This lively book may be described as a blend of
Bret Harte	PERSON	and Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	, and the mixture is commendable .

		`` Twisted Eglantine . ''

		by ^ Ir .


H. B. Marriott Watson	PERSON	, is an English novel of the days of the Regency .

		A rustic beautj ' , who has character as well as charm , is the heroine , and her favor is assiduously sought by two persons -- one an impet - uous young soldier , her associate from childhood , the other an accomplished rake and dandy of the court .

		For a time the latter seems to prevail and when he succeeds in enticing the girl to
London	LOCATION	, and dazzling her with the spectacle of fashionable society , the hopes of her soldier lover are at low ebb .

		But when the ■ villainous intentions of Sir Piers are disclosed , and when at the call of the harassed damseL Faversham deserts from the army in Flan - ders and hastens to her rescue , the situation is changed , and the conventional romantic ending is assured .

		Despite his selfishness and his cjTiicism ,
Sir Piers	ORGANIZATION	is presented to us as so attractive a figure that we are almost sorry for his discomfiture .

		He puts his rival so neatiy in the wrong whenever the two men come into conflict , that we can not blame
Barbara	PERSON	from being tempted by his blandishments .

		Whatever the author may think of him in the char - acter of the moralist , there is no doubt that he fav - ors him in the character of the artist .

		And we are not abusing the word artist in this connection , for Mr.
Marriott Watson	PERSON	has never given us a fiiier character-study than this of
Sir Piers	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is hardly necessarj ' to say also , for those who are to any degree acquainted with his work , that the book has a distinction of style which sets it far above the level of most books of its class .

		Another novel of about the same period is -RSB- Mr.
WejTuan	PERSON	's '' Starvecrow Farm , '' which stands in sharp contrast to the sort of historical romance which we associate with his name .

		Here the her - oine elopes with the villain in the first chapter , but the villain is a very low scoundrel indeed , and his victim is soon undeceived .

		Soon abandoned by him , she has a variety of distressing experiences , which include a sojourn in jail , and a hairbreadth escape from a gang of cutthroats .

		Captain
Clyne	PERSON	, who loves her after a fashion , and who saves her from the consequences of her imprudence , is by no means a hero of the romantic type , but is so vast an improve - ment upon the fellow who had so nearly been the cause of her undoing , that she accepts him grate - fully in the end , after the usual measure of misun - derstanding .

		This is by no means the best of Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	's novels , but it has a considerable interest nevertheless .

		The appalling vulgarity of English lower-class society , its absolute aloofness from everything that gives a spiritual meaning to life , its utter imper - viousness to ideas of any kind , are the impressions that chiefly remain after reading ''
Kipps	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	describes the hero of this realistic narrative as '' a simple soul , '' but the description is inadequate , for he is represented as an esprit bomS beyond our powers of credulity , if we are to regard him as being in any way of a normal type .

		For experi ence will knock even the meanest of normal natures into some sort of conformity with a new environ - ment , but
Kipps	LOCATION	, born in povert
-RCB- %	PERCENT	and unexpectedly raised to affluence , shows no adaptability ' whatever , and proves incapable of sloughing off even the externals of the habit that has been fashioned for him by his instincts and his surroundings .

		Per - sistence of essential character under changed con - ditions is undoubtedly one of the deepest lessons of psychology - , but average human nature is capable of a good deal of transformation to superficial seem - ing .

		Kipps , the draper 's assistant , however , when he becomes
Kipps	PERSON	the opulent , courted by society , remains a shop-boy no less in manner than in soul , and this despite his most resolute determination to acquire the ways of the class into which he has been suddenly elevated .

		This serves the author 's pur - pose of humorous exaggeration , but it is not good science , and science is supposed to be Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's trump suit .

		Nevertheless , the story of
Kipps	PERSON	and his social mishaps is fascinating because of its merci - less analysis of the irredeemably vulgar type of mind , because of its truthfulness of sordid detail , and because of its satirical side-lights upon the fads and follies of the age .

		We can not easily forget , for example , such a characterization as that of one of the minor figures , the young man `` who had been reading
Nietzsche	PERSON	, and thought that in all proba -
18	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, bility he was the Non-Moral
Overman	PERSON	referred to by that writer . ''

		We are quite prepared , after this , to expect the eventual crash in the finances of
Kipps	LOCATION	, who has rashly placed his property under the management of the young man thus neatly described .

		The book offers many such bits of entertainment as this , besides displajang an almost Dickens-like gift for the portrayal of eccentric traits and types of character .

		The author of ''
Elizabeth	PERSON	and her German
Gar	PERSON	- den '' has given us , in '' ' The Princess
Priscilla	PERSON	's Fortnight , '' the most charming extravaganza imag - inable .

		The Princess
Priscilla	PERSON	, it seems , is a demure young thing who conforms outwardly to the life of the Grand Ducal court of Lothen-Kunitz , to the manner whereof she is born , but privately enter - tains her own views of things .

		Under the insidious influences of her tutor , the
Hofbibliothekar	PERSON	, an impossible idealist of grandfatherly age , she has learned to despise the worldly advantages of her lot , and to yearn for the simple life .

		The crisis is reached when a marriage is planned for her with a prince whom she does not know .

		She informs her astonished tutor that in flight must be her salvation , and that he is to be her accomplice and companion .

		This innocent soul , ti `` ansformed perforce into a con - spirator , plans their secret departure , and , good luck aiding them , the strangely-assorted pair of adven - turers make their way to
England	LOCATION	, and bury them - selves in a country village , where they obtain a rose-embowered cottage .

		They take with them
Annalise	PERSON	, reckless of the possible consequences .

		This menial seems a properly subdued and inoffen - sive person , but she has capabilities , and their devel - opment leads to the undoing of her mistress .

		But this is to anticipate .

		Settled in the village ,
Pris	LOCATION	- cDla proceeds to demoralize its inhabitants by means of what the scientific philanthropists call indiscrim - inate charity .

		She invites the neighborhood chil - dren to
Sunday	DATE	parties , feeding their sinful bodies and imperilling their immortal souls .

		She employs help at unheard-of wages .

		She ruins the character of the model pauper of the village -- a bedridden old woman -- by gifts of five-pound notes and bot - tles of rum .

		She causes both the son of the vicar and the son of the great lady of the parish to fall wildly in love with her -LRB- she ca n't help that , poor thing I -RRB- and thereby stormUy agitates the breasts of their respective mothers .

		It is all one bright dream of realized ideals until the money gives out , when clouds encompass the scene .

		Then Annalise be - comes obstreperous , reveals the whereabouts of the truants , and the prince appears to bear away his betrothed .

		It is a lovely story , and the fortnight which it describes is all too brief for om * enjoyment , although it proves quite sufficient to cure the prin - cess of her vagrant fancies , and to reconcile her to the existence upon which she had impulsively turned her back .

		`` The Flute of Pan , '' which is the latest of the inventions of that accomplished woman of letters , ``
John Oliver Hobbes	PERSON	, '' is also about a piincess , and is quite as fantastic a tale , in its way , as the one pre - viously under discussion .

		This princess , however , does not desert her principality '' , but , finding it threat - ened by armed invasion , imports a husband to com - mand her forces , and share with her the cares of state .

		He is an eccenti'ic Englishman of title and wealth , who has renounced the world of vanity , and is engaged in the pursuit of art .

		She finds him in his lodgings at
Venice	LOCATION	, and bends him , not altogether unwillingly , to her pm-pose , he , however , making the condition that when order shall be restored to the agitated realm , she shall abdicate , and retui-n to share his humble life as an artist in
Venice	LOCATION	.

		The subsequent narrar tive is occupied , not so much with warlike adventure as with the private misunderstandings which keep the two at cross-purposes for a long time .

		Briefly stated , each suspects the other of an illicit entangle - ment .

		When these dark suspicions are cleared away , and when the enemy is defeated , the princess car - ries out her part of the bargain in good faith , but in the end new difficidties arise which compel her and her consort to take up once more the burden of rule .

		The whole story is told in the vein of comedy , and is but a trifling performance .

		For the explanation of the symbolical title , we must refer readers to the book itself .

		A pleasing story of love , misunderstanding , and reconciliation is told by Mrs.
Alfred Sidgwick	PERSON	in `` The Professor 's Legacy . ''

		The professor is an eminent German authority on corals , and the legacy is his daughter , whom he leaves to the care of an Englishman of mature years , who has collaborated with him in the work which he does not live to com - plete .

		The Englishman offers marriage to the girl , as the simplest means of taking care of her , and she accepts , despite a girlish infatuation for a German musician .

		The scene then changes from
Fichten	PERSON	- stadt to a country estate in
England	LOCATION	, but relations between husband and wife remain strained , he not seeing that she has really come to care for him , and she not discovering the genuine love concealed be - neath his cold exterior .

		This device keeps the story going until it has attained the requisite length , when the mutual misunderstandings are cleared away .

		The story is , as we said at the beginning , a pleas - ant one , embodying no very deep passion or subtle analysis of character , but nevertheless an agreeable composition of nicely-adjusted parts .

James	PERSON	's familiar method , she has brilliantly suggested , if she has not always developed , its subtleties .

		Her heroine ,
Miss Desmond	LOCATION	, is a middle-aged recluse , a Bostonian Puritan , who has sacrificed her youth to an exacting old mother and has just awakened to the con - viction that she has never really lived .

		In this mood of tentative , half-frightened dissatisfaction and longing she is suddenly sumnaoned to chaperon a niece , -- ^ the sophisticated but unspoiled daughter of a thoroughly disreputable sister , -- on a Swiss tour .

		A week later the object of the sister 's latest love-affair comes by chance to their hotel .

		He finds in
Miss Desmond	LOCATION	the bodily appearance of the woman he had left in disgust , united to a spiritual beauty that he is in a mood to appreciate by contrast .

		The development of the theme is dramatic , though at times a little unsure ; and the characterization is uncommonly delicate and significant . ''

		The Passport '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Richard Bagot	PERSON	, is a rather slow-moving story of love and intrigue , in an Italian setting .

		A parish priest with a mysterious past is the ruling character .

		He has an interest , dating back to the time when he was a canon at
Rome	LOCATION	, in the young hero and heroine ; and he finally manages to convince the girl 's step-mother that young Rossano and not the gambling Belgian baron , d'Antin , is the more suitable husband for her charge .

		The baron has a coadjutor in the person of the
Abbd Roux	ORGANIZATION	, as great a scoundrel as himself , but not so clever .

		Peasant revolts add an ele - ment of variety to the plots and counter-plots of the villains .

		Mr.
Bagot	PERSON	's style is clever and finished , and one wonders a little why his book does not make more of an impression .

		It may be safely recommended as a good story , likely to carry the reader pleasantly to the end of its four hundred closely-printed pages ; but it lacks a definite , clear-cut motive that should give it force and value .

		Mr.
W. W. Jacobs	PERSON	's latest book , `` Captains All '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , is named after the first story in a collection of tales , only three of which are really nautical .

		But any disappointment that the reader may experience on this score is soon forgotten in his enjoyment of the au - thor 's humor .

		Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	makes the doings and say - ings of a certain type of English low-life irresistibly funny in the telling .

		His sailors ashore , his constables , night-watchmen , small shop-keepers , pigeon-shooters , and their wives and friends , are delightful studies , de - picted vrith the same penetration and the same joyous appreciation of the comedy of life that distinguish all Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	's work .

		It is hard to pick out any stories deserving of special mention , for the workmanship is very even ; but certainly none are better than '' The Constable 's Move , '' which teUs how Policeman
Evans	PERSON	's worst enemy unwittingly got him made a sergeant ; and '' The White Cat , '' the story of a strange legacy that brought as much trouble on its various owners as the proverbial white elephant . ''

		Land Ho '' -LRB- Haiper -RRB- is the title chosen for a collee - tion of Mr.
Morgan Robertson	PERSON	's sea stories .

		In several of these are told the adventures of
Scotty	LOCATION	, an original old fellow forced by circumstances to be deck-hand on a freight barge in
New York	LOCATION	harbor , but leading a life full of interest and excitement none the less .

		The sea , 8S
Scotty	PERSON	and the rest of Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's heroes know it , is a hard mistress , exacting a heavy toll of labor and sorrow and making little return ; and as a whole Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's book does not make cheerful reading .

		A strange case of souonambulism is the theme of '' The Cook and the Captain '' ; '' The Lobster '' and his friends are only amateur sailors , and a few stories at the end of the book have no connection with the sea or its folk .

		It is a pity that Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	does not occasionally choose to exploit a thoroughly pleasant theme .

		His style is powerful , but his insight is always exercised on gruesome situations .

		Mr.
Charles Major	PERSON	's new romance '' Yoluida '' -LRB- Mae - millan -RRB- resembles '' When Knighthood Was in Flower '' more than it does any of this author 's other books .

		There is a piquant and spirited heroine who braves everything for the man she loves , and the hero is satis - factory enough , though distinctly subordinate in the reader 's interest , as was
Brandon	PERSON	.

		The love affair leads the pair through many extraordinary perils and dilem - mas , but in the end the prince marries the princess ex - actly as their parents had planned , though the step is by no means taken out of deference to parental wishes .

		For some imexplainable reason Mr.
Major	PERSON	has chosen to have the story related by Count
Maximilian	PERSON	's tutor -- a method which has its disadvantages when a passion - ate , and let us hope a private , love-scene is to be con - fided to the reader .

		In spite of this mistake , however , Mr.
Major	PERSON	has written another good story , which his public will be glad to welcome .

		Miss
Margaret Sherwood	PERSON	's new novel , '' The Coming of the Tide '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has much of the choice pastoral quality of her earlier book , ''
Daphne	PERSON	. ''

		This latter tale was so charming that it helped to set a fashion in fiction-writing ; and perhaps it is only the host of perfunctory imitations that have come between to dull our appetites that makes '' The Coming of the Tide '' seem a little commonplace by comparison .

		It tells the story of a
summer	DATE	on the
Maine	LOCATION	coast , whither the heroine , a Southern girl , goes to forget a great sor - row .

		The plot , which is very simple , involves a study in heredity .

		The hero , a dreamy philosopher , is mor - bidly conscious of his inheritance of ancestral traits and ancestral quarrels .

		But the girl from
Virginia	LOCATION	makes him feel the joy of living , and understand the song of the tides .

		The charm of the book lies largely in Miss Sher - wood 's delicate humor , delightful fancy , and carefully finished , but never coldly classic , style .

		Like all of Mr.
Arthur Henry	PERSON	's stories , '' Lodgings in Town '' -LRB-
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is more fact than fiction .

		It tells how the author came to
New York	LOCATION	with a clean collar , eight dollars , and a poem , what he found in the city to hold his interest , and how he finally chose the obscurity of a mountain farm , in preference to material advancement in town .

		Much of the interest of the story springs from the keen analysis of
New York	LOCATION	's peculiari - ties , as Mr.
Henry	PERSON	, fresh from a strenuous career in the
Middle West	LOCATION	, interpreted them .

		But the core of the 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, book is its philosophy .

		If a man works not for money or for himself , but , '' searching events for the soul of them , '' takes imaffected pleasure in what he can do for other men , he can be happy anywhere -- and most easily perhaps in a Baxter Street tenement .

		The intimate , straightforward , and lively style in which Mr.
Henry	PERSON	writes , and his large and convincing optimism , make a strong appeal to the reader 's sympathy .

		The success scored by '' In the Bishop 's Carriage '' lends special interest to Miss
Miriam Michelson	PERSON	's new novel , `` A Yellow Journalist '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- .

		Like its predecessor this is a novel with a heroine ; and the new heroine ,
Rhoda Massey	PERSON	, has a strong individuality -- a pluck , perseverance , and a certain feminine charm be - neath her masculine energy -- that suggests
Nancy	PERSON	, minus the curious moral .

		attitude that made
Nancy	PERSON	so unique .

		Rhoda finds newspaper work as intoxicating as most girls do cotillons , and thinks of nothing but pleas - ing her chief and `` scooping '' her rivals .

		Reporting in
San Francisco	LOCATION	seems to furnish an abimdance of sen - sations , but the reader is not surprised when
Rhoda	PERSON	gives it all up to marry the reporter that she had always secretly admired , though professionally they were at swords ' points .

		After these many years Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	has writ - ten a sequel , or rather a continuation , of '' She . ''

		It is called '' Ayesha '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and is the story of the further adventures of Mr.
Holly	PERSON	, tlie real author of '' She , '' and
Leo Vincey	PERSON	in the momitains of
Tibet	LOCATION	, whither they went to seek the wonderful Spirit of the
Mountain	ORGANIZATION	.

		This time the token of verity which Mr.
Holly	PERSON	sends with his manuscript is the sceptre with which
Ayesha	PERSON	was wont to rule the shadows in her moimtain temple .

		The story opens with an account of a vision in which the lovely Ayesha tells her mortal lover how to return to her .

		The adventures of the trav - ellers are of no ordinary kind .

		Seven years of awful hardship are dismissed in a brief paragraph , and only the last crucial moments of the search are detailed .

		It will be interesting to see how the new '' She '' strikes twentieth century tastes .

		Mr.
Rupert Hughes	PERSON	, the author of '' American Com - posers '' and '' The Love - Affairs of Great Musicians , '' has turned his insight into the emotional make-up of the musician to account by writing a novel .

		He calls it '' Zal , '' which is a Polish word signifying the hopeless homesickness of the exile .

		The hero is a Polish musi - cian , named
Ladislav	PERSON	, who wins a slow recognition and then an overwhelming success in
America	LOCATION	.

		But it is his love affair with a rich American girl , rather than his concert career , that engrosses the reader 's attention .

		As a study of the artistic temperament '' Zal '' is very interesting , but Mr.
Hughes	PERSON	makes a mistake in forcing his hero to choose between saving his mother or his sweetheart from drowning .

		Such an episode can not be satisfactorily handled in fiction .

		Otherwise , particularly for a first novel , '' Zal '' shows very good workmanship .

		-LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- '' Lady Bobs , her Brother , and I '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is already familiar to readers of '' The Critic , '' where it appeared serially .

		Miss
Jean Chamblin	PERSON	has followed a passing fashion in using the letter form for her story , and in supplementing plot interest with animated accounts of life and scenery m the
Azores	LOCATION	.

		Her protagonist is a yovmg actress , who , being tired and so impressed with the futility of her dramatic efforts , goes off to rest in a far corner of the earth and finds there most of the people she has particularly wished to get away from -- includ - ing the inevitable lover .

		It is a pity that
Miss Chamblin	PERSON	has felt it necessary to resort to meaningless slang and cheap humor in order to enliven her heroine 's letters .

		In these days there is surely no good reason why an actress should not be represented as a cultured woman , exercising good taste in the choice of a vocabulary as in other matters . ''

		Child of the Stars '' is the mystical title of a some - what mystical tale by Mr.
Robert Valentine Mathews	PERSON	.

		The narrative altogether lacks miity , but at certain points it has decided charm in spite of its annoying in - consecutiveness .

		At first it purports to be the avitobi - ography of a man who began his life as a foundling in a Jesuit orphanage .

		Riimiing away one day , not because of unhappiness but merely to explore the neighborhood , he foimd a little girl playing by the river .

		After this the story is more hers than his , and the title is the name of a famous pictm-e which her faithless husband painted .

		The picture , again , is in no sense the pivotal point of the story .

		Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	has some mteresting material at his command , but he must either learn plot construc - tion or else avoid altogether the novel form .

		His '' ChUd of the Stars '' is a confusing hybrid , -- neither novel nor simple narration .

Edwin C. Hill Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Herman Bernstein	PERSON	, already known as the author of several novels of Jewish life , in '' Contrite Hearts '' -LRB-
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- presents still another picture of the simple yet picturesque manners of his people in
Russia	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Bernstein	PERSON	's tale is sincere and quite devoid of artifice .

		It tells the story of two Jewish girls , the apostate daughters of
Israel Lampert	LOCATION	, cantor and reader of the law in his village .

		Both gii-ls love Gentiles and are cast out from their father 's house .

		They go singly to
New York	LOCATION	, meet there by chance , and in the end renounce the new thought that is distiirbing their people 's ancient beliefs , and become reconciled to their old father .

		The story has a curious mterest , as an interpretation , from the inside , of a theory of life utterly foreign to the average reader 's ideas .

		Briefs ox

		A book of aood Holding that life is the test of thought , sense and not thought the test of life , Dr.
Henry	PERSON	sound ideals .

		yg ^ j ^ Dykg puts forth a volume of `` Essays in Application '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , being ideas and ideals tested by experience and removed from the domain of theory to that of fact .

		On an early page he refers feelingly to '' those hours of despond - ency and disappointment when the grasshopper and the critic become a burden . ''

		Nothing that is to be said of his book by the present critic will in the least intensify the gloom of those despondent hours ; for the essays are all excellent , both in substance and in form .

		The writer stands with both feet planted on the solid earth , while his '' dome of thought '' reaches , not into the clouds , but beyond them .

		In other words , practical good sense and lofty idealism are happily married in his pages .

		Wise counsel is offered on education , religion , literature , -- its production and its consumption , -- the simple life , and many other matters of universal interest .

		In his general reflec - tions on the progress of the world , he is optimistic , or , rather , melioristic and hopeful .

		`` Pessimism

		Three e ^ - U tendencies he finds in our modern world against which the spirit of Christianity embodied in a worthy literature can do much to guard us .

		These are the growing idolatry of military glory , the grow - ing idolatry of wealth , and the growing spirit of frivolity .

		The last-named tendency gives occasion for mildly rebuking a brilliant contemporary British essayist , much given to paradox , who will need no more particular designation .

		Touching on educar tion .

		Dr. van Ih ^ ke deprecates the term ' * finished scholar , '' which to him has a mortuary soxmd , like an epitaph .

		A book so admirably combining enter - tainment and edification is not published every day , or every month .

		The blot on ^ ^ '' The Indian Dispossessed '' -LRB- Little , our national Brown & .

		Co. -RRB- .

		Mr.
Seth K. Humphrey	PERSON	etcutcheon .

		describes the treatment by the
United States	LOCATION	government during the last three decades of the Reservation , or peaceful , Indian .

		The book con - sists principally of extracts from the reports of Indian agents and the Commissioner of Indian Affairs , con - nected by a thread of narrative .

		It is the old and famil - iar story of the ruthless occupation of Indian country by white men who recognize no right as belonging to the original owner .

		The Introduction briefly traces the steps by which the Indian was pushed back from the frontier , until finally there was no longer a frontier and he was then placed on the Reservation .

		The account of the treatment of the Reservation Indians is from the Indian point of view , and gives only one side of the question at issue ; but there is no doubt that , according to the reports of its own officials , the government has been guilty of criminal negligence and gross injustice in its ti-eatment of the peaceful red man .

		The author selects for discussion the cases of the
Umadillas	LOCATION	,
Flat Heads	ORGANIZATION	,
Nez Perces	LOCATION	,
Poncas	LOCATION	, and the Mission Indians of
California	LOCATION	.

		The history of the four first-named is the same : a treaty - is made with the
United States	LOCATION	securing to the Indians good reservations ; then come the white settlers who want the Indian lands : next the government , influenced by the politicians , forces the Indians to less desirable land , or to the Indian Territory -- ** the grave of the Northern Indian '' ; and then follows the gradual extinction of the tribe .

		The treatment of the civ - ilized Mission Indians seems to have been the worst of all .

		They had good homes , were peaceful and good citizens , yet the government would admit to them no rights at aU .

		-- or , in the language of the
Senate Committee	ORGANIZATION	, '' the Indian had no usufructuary or other rights therein which were in any manner to be respected '' ; and .

		the whites took their lands and homes .

		One of the final chapters describes the late method of dividing the spoils taken from the Indian .

		As long as there was a frontier the rule was , ' * first come , first served . ''

		Next , when reservations sur - rounded by settled territory are thrown open , the government fixes the day and hour , and thousands of home-seekers line up to race for homes , -- as was done at the opening of the
Cherokee Strip	ORGANIZATION	.

		Finally , the government makes use of the lottery , as in the case of the
Rosebud Reservation	ORGANIZATION	, to divide out the prizes , -- a method condemned as Ulegal by the national postal laws .

		The author disavows any in - tention of claiming that all men are equal or should be given equal pri \ Tleges ; but he maintains , how - ever , that ' • no man has a place or fair chance to exist under the government of the
United States	LOCATION	who has not a part in it . ''

		From the government , influenced by politicians , the author expects little consideration for the woes of the Indian .

		The proper way to secure relief is , he says , to '' instill in the public mind a deep persistent distrust of the
National Congress	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The ton of '' ^ ^ ^ personality ' and career of the son
Napoleon	PERSON	and of
Napoleon	PERSON	and
Marie Louise	PERSON	have Afarie LouUe .

		always attracted interest both histor - ically and as a matter of curiosity .

		A new study of his position and importance is now offered in a vol - ume by Eklward de
Wertheimer	PERSON	, entitled '' The Duke of Reichstadt '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , presented in a pretty binding decorated with the Napoleonic bee , and containing a nxmiber of excellent portraits .

		The volume is essentially an historical study , not a mere collection of gossip and rumor : for the author has made a careful search of many archives , understands thoroughly the historical setting , and is more con - cerned to give an account of the diplomatic intrigues centering about the Duke and his mother than to pre - sent a striking personal characterization .

		One learns , indeed , very little about the qualities and ideas of Reichstadt himself , for necessarily his ideas were of much less contemporaneous importance than were the ideas of such men as
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	and TaUej-rand as to what should be done with him .

		It is difficult to realize to-day that he really had so much impor - tance , and that courts and cabinets were agitated for fear of movements and conspiracies to place him upon the throne of
France	LOCATION	.

		The plans solemnly proposed -LRB- when he was but seven years old -RRB- that he should be forced into monastic life , or precluded from ever marrying , in order forever to cut off the Napoleonic heritage , seem absurd to-day ; yet to the 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, statesmen of that time his existence , even in the secluded circle in which he moved at
Vienna	LOCATION	, was a matter for constant surveillance .

		* Mr.
de Wert	PERSON	- heimer traces the principal events , and narrates these diplomatic manceuvrings , from the time of his hero 's hirth in
1811	DATE	through the twenty-one years of his life .

		Naturally , the central figure of the story is Metternich , -- the man whose patriotic statecraft is responsible for whatever seems heartless in the treat - ment of Reichstadt and of
Marie Louise	PERSON	.

		The lat - ter is in no sense excused by the author for her conduct toward
Napoleon	PERSON	, or in her later relations with
Neipperg	PERSON	, -- unless to portray her as a woman without imagination , or any perception of great prin - ciples , is an excuse .

		But personalities have little place in the author 's method .

		His work is not in - tended for the merely curious , but it is of real his - torical value .

		Our hearts do not leap up when we i ^ v ^ # : ios .

		behold a halo on the title-page .

		So says the entertaining author of '' The Pardoner 's `` Wallet '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and therefore he will perhaps not thank a reviewer for designating him as the Rev. Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	, especially as he has studiously shorn his name bare of all titles , sacred or profane , on his own title-page .

		But when the book-appraiser proceeds to balance this possible disservice by reminding the pm ` chasing public , should it need any such reminder , that the author of the book in question is also the author of '' The Gentle Reader , '' -- a fact also excluded from the title-page , -- possibly the Pardoner will grant the offender an in - dulgence from his well-filled wallet .

		Of these eleven essays , three , if we mistake not , have already ap - peared in `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' ; the rest appear to be new .

		We find here , as in the author 's earlier vol - ume , a succession of pleasing fancies and humorous conceits , steadied with a due ballast of sober thought and moral purpose .

		Common sense , alert observa - tion , a varied experience of life in divers longitudes of our broad land , gentle satire , delicate humor , all tastefully adorned with a sufficient garnish of liter - ary allusion , quotation , and anecdote , -- combine to produce a book that stimulates while it amuses , and promotes thought at the same time that it drives away dull care .

		The title finds its appropriateness in the fact that most of the chapters deal with faults and foibles that are not inexcusable , although open to friendly criticism .

		The essay that affords the purest intellectual delight is the jeu d'esprit entitled '' How to Know the Fallacies , '' wherein '' Scholasticus '' is represented as yielding so far to modern educational methods as to throw his treatise on logical fallacies into the form of a series of lessons in botany . ''

		Let MS go out in the sunshine into the pleasant field of thought , '' says the botanist-logician . ''

		There we see the arguments -- valid and otherwise -- as they are growing .

		You will notice that every argument has three essential parts .

		First is the root , called by the old logicians in their crabbed language the Major Premise .

		Growing quite naturally out of this is the stem , called the Minor Premise ; and crowning that is the flower , with its seed-vessels which contain the jjotentialities of future arguments , -- this is called the Conclusion . ''

		A genial first-personalism -LRB- unkind the critic who should call it egoism -RRB- pervades the book and admits one quite intimately into the writer 's confidence -- or at least seems to do so .

		Finally , Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	, to use the language of a brother divine , belongs to that best class of essayists who '' clarify life by gentle illumination and lambent humor . ''

		Among the greatest of the leaders of ofij ^ uari ^ s. English thought in the nineteenth century , and the greatest of all in the Unitarian denomination , was
James Martineau	PERSON	.

		It is fitting , therefore , that the centennial of his birth should be marked by the publication of an elaborate study of his life and work , prepared by Mr.
J	PERSON	,
Estlin Carpenter	PERSON	, an old pupil of
Martineau	PERSON	and for many years his co-worker in
Manchester College	ORGANIZATION	, and pub - lished by the
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is really a model of what a work of this kind should be .

		Fully to understand the achievements of a thinker we must know the conditions of thought which surround him and his effect upon those condi - tions .

		Martineau 's life covered nearly the entire century -LRB- 1805-1900 -RRB- , and his biographer furnishes from time to time graphic and illuminating sum - maries of the intellectual movements of those years .

		One of the best of these is the fourth chapter , devoted to '' Religion and Philosophy in
England	LOCATION	, 1805-1832 . ''

		In this , the poets are shown to have played a prominent part , --
Wordsworth	PERSON	, who `` led the way in the revolt against the mechanical inter - pretation of the world '' ;
Shelley	PERSON	, who `` prophesied the regeneration to be wrought out only by faithfulness and love '' ;
Byron	PERSON	, in ''
Cain	PERSON	, '' `` with sterner defiance hm ` ling his protest against the prevailing theology . ''

		With the year 1832 , another new era was at hand , with
Carlyle	PERSON	,
Tennyson	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	, and
John Henry Newman	PERSON	as its prophets . ''

		Through the medley of conflicting cries in science , philosophy , and Biblical criticism ,
James Martineau	PERSON	slowly realized the task to which he was called : -- to vindicate the great conception which he defined as ' the perennial In - dwelling of God in Man in the
Universe	LOCATION	. ' ''

		How he wrought on this great life-work ; how , gradually abandoning the language of the older generation , he denounced the method of interpretation in which he had been brought up ; how he was rebuked for destroying all external authority , and how he replied by pointing to an authority from within , resting on the nature , scope , powers , and source of reason , -- tjiese are the great events in the life-history of this great and original thinker .

		Closing the volume , we agree with the biographer , that `` among the English theologians of the nineteenth century none had cov - ered so wide a range ; none possessed so varied a knowledge ; none had more completely blended the highest efforts of speculation with graces of char - acter and the trusts of a lowly heart . ''


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 23 Professor
Edward Dickinson	PERSON	, of ti ^ atlSt ^ iu .

		OberlinCoUege has written a work called `` The Study of the History of Music '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- which we take pleasure in com - mending .

		It offers a straightforward and scholarly treatment of the subject , and is based upon the author 's practice as a lecturer in the institution with which he is connected .

		There are fortj ' - three chap - ters and a bibliography of works accessible in En - glish .

		Besides this general list of authorities , each chapter has valuable bibliographical notes upon its special subject-matter .

		`` We quote the following pas - sage from the introduction : '' The basis of the true study of the history and meanii ^ of any art is not the reading of books abont - works of art , but the direct first-hand examination of the works themsel ` ves .

		This dogma needs to be incessantly hammered into the heads of amateur students of music .

		If this book encourag `` d any - one to substitute critics and historians for the actual compo - sitions of the masters , then the author 's intention would be grossly perverted and his hopes disappointed .

		The first aim of the music lover should be to make himself acquainted with the largest | -RRB- ossible number of the best musical compositions . '' '

		Concerning this saying we would say that it is true , every word of it , but that such a warning is perhaps less needed in the case of music than in the case of any other art .

		Our observation has been that most young students of music neglect the history of the art altogether , and merely learn to '' play pieces . ''

		Of the place of those compositions in the history of music , of their aesthetic and ethical content , and of the significance of their composers , few amateur musicians have any notion whatever .

		A book that aims to remedy this defect deserves a warm wel - come , and need hardly fear that it will incline the balance of the student 's attention in the wrong di - rection .

		`` We have often urged that music should be studied in the way in which poetry is studied , which of course does not mean that poetry should be neg - lected for the sake of books about poetry , but that acquaintance with no poem is adequate that does not include acquaintance with its place and function in literary history .

		Some ethical - ^ those who know the active part gain * through taken by Mrs.
Florence Kelley	PERSON	in legitiation .

		^ jj ^ crusa ` de against child labor , ovei ^ work , and unsanitary conditions , will appreciate the value of a book from her pen which attempts to estimate the present value of `` Ethical Grains through Legislation '' -LRB- MacmUlan -RRB- , and which endeavors to suggest some of the many ways in which these already acquired gains may be increased many fold .

		The chief feature in the desired increase is the edu - cation of the employing , employed , and purchasing public in the rules which govern wholesome and _ honest labor , which tend to increase the public wealth , to strengthen the public health , and to strengthen the weaker members of the body politic .

		A discussion of these rules is the chief feature of Mrs.
Kelley	PERSON	's book , which is divided into seven sig - nificant parts : `` The Right to Childhood . ''

		`` The ChUd , the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and the Nation , '' `` The Right to Leisure , '' `` Judicial Interpretations of the Right to Leisure , '' `` The Right of Women to the Ballot , * ' `` The Rights of Purchasers , '' `` The Rights of Pur - chasers and the Courts . ''

		To these the author has added five appendices , containing decisions of various courts in eases having an important bearing on the subject , or some part of it .

		Most of the material in the book , on the subjects of child-labor , compulsory education , and the dangerous trades , has been pub - lished before in one form or another , and is known in detail , or at least in part , to all who are interested in social reform .

		It is well , however , to have the matter formulated and united into one common prob - lem of the right to labor and to leisure , as it is in nature .

		Mrs.
Kelley	PERSON	's book is , by the conditions of its subject , tentative .

		Its chief value lies in its sug - gestions for future improvement .

		_ , ^ A volume styled '' Greatness in Litr Pleasant paper * , A i - r '' < - l on lUerarv eratuTC and Other Papers -LRB-
Crowell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- theme * .

		consists of eight literary addresses prepared for various academic occasions by Professor ``
William P. Trent	PERSON	, and now collected for permanent preservation .

		The writer tells us that he does not call these papers '' essays , '' because that term '' con - notes to my mind a discursive charm which , per - haps , I could not impart to any composition . ''

		This statement is too modest by exactiy half , for , although the papers are discursive , they are undeniably charming , and none the less so because each one of them pursues a definite line of thought .

		Some of the subjects with which they deal are the question of literary greatness , the teaching and study of liter - ture , the relation of criticism to faith and of literature to science , and the love of poetry .

		Upon all these subjects the author has excellent things to say , and the manner of his discourse is both persuasive and engaging .

		His remarks upon the study of literature , in particular , should be taken to heart by the too large class of our teachers who still make literature a thing of terror to their students ; or , if not of terror , of desiccated substance and unattractive ex - position .

		`` We hope that his example will induce others '' to doubt the value of strenuous examinations and to appreciate more and more the necessity of trying to inculcate in students some of the high moral and spiritual truths taught by great writers , and to impart to them a taste for reading , a love of the best literature . ''

		The
Romany Word-Book	ORGANIZATION	.

		We do not know how many of the readers of '' Lavengro '' at the present day have an interest in the gjl -RRB- sy cult in which
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	was an adept .

		For ourselves , the verj - sound of
Romany	ORGANIZATION	has a sort of fascination which we readily pronounce in normal moments to be without much ground .

		There will probably be others who will be glad to see this re - print of the `` Romano Lavo-LiL , or Word-Book of the English Gypsy 's Language '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The original , although not a
raritj %	PERCENT	is not easily found ; and the present issue is an excellent substitute .

		When we consider the testimony of Borrow and 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	,
Leland	PERSON	to the appreciation on the part of the gypsy of a knowledge of the Romany tongue , we can easily see the value of such an introduction as this hook affords to the gypsy world .

		It is not , however , merely or chiefly a word-hook .

		It contains songs and stories in
Romany	LOCATION	and English , an account of various gypsy places of resort , and much other such material .

		Altogether it is an entertaining book , full of the spirit that makes '' Lavengro '' so attractive , and with a hit more of a serious definite character .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a two-volume edition of '' The Poems of
William Watson	PERSON	, '' with an introduc - tion by Mr.
J. A. Spender	PERSON	.

		The collection omits some of the poems mcluded in previous volumes , makes fre - quent alterations in the others , and includes a consider - able number of new pieces .

		It constitutes , for the present at least , a definitive edition of Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's work .

		A new edition of Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's impressions of
Oxford	LOCATION	, with fifty illustrations by various hands , is im - ported by the
J. B. Lippincott Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	is such a loving interpreter of
Oxford	LOCATION	, knows the city so well in all its moods , and invests his studies with so much color and so much human interest as well , that his papers are no doubt extremely difficult to illustrate suitably .

		The sketches in the present edition are repro - duced from the etchings and drawings of nearly a dozen diiferent artists .

		Some are delightfid interpretations of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	life and scenery ; others hardly deserve a place beside Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's text .

		On the whole they add something , though not so much as they easily might , to the reader 's enjoyment .

		Possibly book collectors , like poets , are bom rather than made , yet the innate love of books may be culti - tivated , or at least stimulated , by a knowledge of the technique of book-making .

		There is ample justi - fication , therefore , for Mr.
J. Herbert Slater	PERSON	's '' How to Collect Books '' -LRB- Maemillan -RRB- , which contains most informing chapters on manuscripts , paper , printing and printers , title-pages and colophons , book-binding and the famous binders , collectors and their famous collec - tions , book auctions , sales , and catalogues ; with admir - able illustrations , and a cover design copied from the bindings in the famous
Demetrio Canevari	ORGANIZATION	library of
Genoa	LOCATION	.

		This volume will be foimd to contain a feast of good things for every book collector .

		With the publication of Dr.
Samuel Bannister Harding	PERSON	's '' Essentials in Mediaeval and Modern His - tory , '' the
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	complete their series of '' Essentials in History , '' the four volumes providing the full course of four years ' work now given in all high schools of the better sort .

		The entire series is admir - ably plaimed and executed , and may be adopted in full confidence that no better set of books for the piurpose is now available .

		We note also in this connection the publication , by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of '' A History of Mediaeval and
Modern Europe	LOCATION	, '' by Pro- fessor
Henry E. Bourne	PERSON	, which is also a work em - bodying the best scholarship and the most progressive pedagogical ideals .

		Between the two books here men - tioned there is little to choose , and either is an immense improvement over anything to be had
ten years ago	DATE	.

		IN ` OTES .

		Mr.
Winston Spencer Churchill	PERSON	's biography of his father , the late Lord
Randolph Churchill	PERSON	, will be pub - lished by the
Maemillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	early in the present mouth .

		A new book from the pen of Mr.
Henry Wallace Phillips	PERSON	, author of '' Red Saimders , '' will be published this month by the
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The new story is entitled `` Mr.
Scraggs	PERSON	, '' and is the personal account of incidents in the strenuous life of one of
Red Saunders	ORGANIZATION	's friends .

		`` Incidents Attending the Capture , Detention , and Ransom of
Charles Johnston	PERSON	of
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' reprinted from the original edition of
1827	DATE	, with editorial matter by Professor
Edwin Erie Sparks	PERSON	, is published by the
Burrows Brothers Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their series of '' Narratives of Indian Captivities . ''

		Messrs.
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a revised edi - tion of '' A Handbook of
Modern Japan	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Ernest W. Clement	PERSON	.

		In its present form , this valuable work is brought thoroughly down to date by the addition of a chapter on the recently-ended war with
Russia	LOCATION	.

		There are two maps and many pictures .

		Messrs. '
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish a new edition of '' The Purple Land , '' by Mr.
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	.

		This charming narrative of life in
South America	LOCATION	is now twenty years old , but it has never had one-tenth of the readers it deserves , a defect which the present edition may help to remedy .

		`` The English Dialect Grammar , '' by Dr.
Joseph Wright	PERSON	, is published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	at the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is half Phonology and Accidence , and half Index .

		It includes all the dialects of
England	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Wales	LOCATION	, the
Shetlands	LOCATION	, and the Orkneys .

		The recent death of
John Bartlett	PERSON	, the former Bos - ton publisher , but better known as the compiler of
Bartlett	PERSON	's '' Familiar Quotations , '' has brought out the statement from his publishers that nearly a quarter of a million copies of tliis work have been sold since the first edition was published in
1855	DATE	.

		Two interesting numbers of the ''
Cohunbia Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity Germanic Studies '' now at hand give us ''
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
Harvey Waterman Thayer	PERSON	, and '' Types of Weltschmerz in German Poetry , '' by Dr.
Wilhelm Alfred Braun	PERSON	.

		Holderlin ,
Lenau	LOCATION	, and
Heine	PERSON	are the poets selected for treatment in the last-named monograph .

		``
Friedrich Schiller	PERSON	: A Sketch of his Life and an Appreciation of his Poetry , '' by Dr.
Paid Cams	PERSON	, is an illustrated volume partly reprinted from '' The Open Court , '' and now published from the office of that periodical .

		It is a book of popidar character , and very interesting in its presentation of the subject , to say nothing of the many illustrations .

		Mr.
Ernest W. Clement	PERSON	, well known for his books on
Japan	LOCATION	, and especially his '' Handbook of
Modern Japan	LOCATION	, '' has been appointed Acting Interpreter of the
United States Legation	ORGANIZATION	at
Toyko	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Clement	PERSON	has the confidence of the Japanese government as few Americans have , chiefly the result of a long residence in
Japan	LOCATION	, and an exceptional understanding of the Japanese mind and habit of thought .

		Messrs.
A. C. McChirg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	amioimce that they will issue next year a new edition of HUdreth 's ''
Japan	LOCATION	, Old and New , '' revised to date by Mr.
Clement	PERSON	, with an interesting introduction by Dr.
William Elliot Griffis	PERSON	.

		BRIEFER MENTION 52 NOTES 52 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 53 ACADEMIC WELFARE .

		It is hardly in accord \ nth the national tem - per to take alarm at any threatening aspect of the cultural atmosphere .

		Few are weatherwise in such matters ; and the influences that are precipitated upon the street from these tenuous realms make little impression in contrast with the more practical predictions of the local weather bureau .

		K the nation 's nutrition is endangered , and it is given out that the wheat crop is under the weather , the news is learnedly disciLSsed from Cabinet to comer-grocery ; and if the national circidation is feverish , physicians are simimoned to take the patients temperature with a Wall Street thermometer , and crowds gather alx -RRB- ut the hourly bulletins .

		But the most jaimdiced of yellow sheets would not add two points to the cubits of its headlines to report symtoms suggestive of academic disquietude .

		One must not intrude topics of the soul during business hours ; and corporations proverbially dispense \ s-ith the presence of that vmcongenial monitor .

		Even those for whom the things of the spirit have a meaning -- and our ILst of educa - tional benefactions is creditable , -- as well as those who are more directively entrusted with their management , reflect the national optimism that does not deal kindly with Cassandras of either sex .

		If things have come to such a pass that the trimnphant screech of the eagle must be momentarily hushed , our choice goes out to the presumably cheerful if deluded ostrich rather than to the croaking raven ; and if dangers grow so inconsiderately obviovLS that we are con - stantly stumbling against them , we have only to remember that `` Christian Science '' is an American discovery .

		One need not incur the odium of suggesting that the brains of the nation are segregated in the institutions of learning by recognizing that our Colleges and Universities represent the best organized provisions for keeping aglow the torch of cidture and handing it on with undiminished brilliance to those that come after .

		In the aggregate , the efifect produced upon the intel - lectual ideals and activities of the race by the influences that find origin and support in
Uni	LOCATION	- versity centres is sufficient to impart a national 32 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, significance to any conditions that seriously affect the acaxleniic welfare .

		The gathering - clouds betoken tliat the storm is likely to break most centrally over the discussion of the rela - tions of furtherance or hindrance that have come to exist between the administrative provisions for maintaining the life of Universities and the miderlying purposes for which Universities ex - ist .

		On so broad a question it doubtless behooves one to be content with moderate sympathy of aim and to be reconciled to some differences in measures .

		The response of mingled approval and dissent that woidd go out to any worthy pronoimcement anent this issue , woidd probably not have been sufficiently disturbing to ex - change silence for speech ; but when a singvdarly specious and unwholesome utterance upon the subject of the
University Presidency	ORGANIZATION	finds place in a company where all places are honorable , we confess to a reaction of protest that will out .

		The catchword under which `` The Atlantic Monthly '' -- usually a reliable fount of good sense , graceful statement , and eidightening ideals -- heralds this untimely message , is itself irritating . ''

		Why professors shoidd teach and not acbninistrate '' has a suspicious sound ; and it is not unexpected to find that the real issue thus evasively presented is whether the Uni - versity Professor is to be a helpless hireling who can not call his soid his own , or whether he is to be an independent scholar whose needs are properly met and whose services are fitly esteemed ; whether he is to find at hand , or himself aid to develop , an environment in which the acatlemic spirit can live and have a being , or whether he must be sadly content to expend his life-efforts under conditions needlessly un - favorable to the fruitage of what it lies in him to bear .

		It is the ever-vital question of what shall be first and what last , or even second .

		Compromise can not always be in one direction without the complete surrender of one interest ; and fairy godmothers can not be counted upon to intervene to restore CindereUas to their proper station .

		The practical man of affairs has a pecidiar prejudice in favor of holding a con - trolling interest ; and the real question at issue is how far those who best appreciate the needs of academic welfare shall be entrusted with the means of converting their knowledge into power .

		The view set forth with Philistine imconcern for its justice or its significance is that profes - sors are rather an imruly lot , troubled with ill - assorted notions of their own , that make them perversely insensitive to the categorical impera - tive of inspired legislation , or the divine vica - rage of favored millionaires .

		In some cases they have been known to refuse pottage even when offered upon a silver platter .

		Such blindness to the real interests of the
University	ORGANIZATION	argues congenital defect in the clan as a whole .

		And when it comes to such a pass that Facidties protest against what they choose to call the de - moralizing influences of gate-receipts and gTand - stands , wiKidly negligent of the fact that this is the readiest way in which the
University	ORGANIZATION	can get its name in the papers , it is certainly high time that the professor shall be kept busy teach - ing , while some wiser man , who can properly understand what the people want , shall direct the affairs of state .

		The academic '' boss '' is frankly advocated as the proper head for a
University	ORGANIZATION	in a demo - cratic land .

		Foreign exemplars in which Facul - ties so largely control their own affairs , are all misleading , because in the first place in their ignorance these benighted institutions have not discovered the simple efficacy of the '' win-at-any - cost '' one-man power , and because in this country the man who buys a ticket has the right to dictate how his Shakespeare shall be performed .

		Might is not only right ; but the highest truth lies in the recognition of the special providence that reigns over our brave and free domain by which the mere gift of power always brings with it the highest measure of wisdom .

		If a
Univer	LOCATION	- sity can not be conducted upon business prin - ciples by business men , it defies the national gods and must await its doom .

		Yet it seems at least a plausible position that the concerns of a
University	ORGANIZATION	are as individual as any other enter - prise , and that some sympathetic insight into the purposes and amis of such an institution is a prerequisite for participating in its atlminis - tration .

		This central moment of the situation , this supreme directive principle , the autocratic policy does not wholly ignore ; but it regards it as a secondary requirement , an easily-gained accom - plishment , that may be learned when occasion offers , or better , may be determined by a popular referendum .

		The annual Freshman crop will tell you whether the
University	ORGANIZATION	is filling its mission .

		AU that is needed to send the busy hum of cidture abroad in the land is the '' push '' of some clever manager of the
University de	ORGANIZATION	- partment store , sharp enough to observe which counters are crowded , and where the popidar salesmen are to be found , and to seciire their services for the least pay and the maximum sub - servience .

		Great is the reward of residts !

		and to him to whom students are not given , let his professorship be taken away !

		Let us raise the
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 33 salary of the professor of scientific horseshoeing , and take away fi'om the professor of Greek what little he hath !

		But in all seriousness , there is reallj ' sonie - thing to be said for the autocratic President ; but it can be acceptably said only by one who has an underlying sympathetic insight into the real needs of the academic life and who is pro- foundly regretfid .

		if he chance to be a
Univer	LOCATION	- sity President , that he can not more abundantly supply the conditions that he knows shoidd ex - ist , and to the realization of which his efforts are consistently directed .

		So long as he advocates the gagging of the profeasor and then jeers at him for his helplessness , the insxdt that he adds to injujy but emphasizes his imfitness for academic administration .

		The ti-aits of the individual that in this ^ ^ ew ai * e set forth as desirable for academic leadership are radically incompatible with the kinds of residts that are held out as the desirable ends of his afbninLstration .

		W ith these ideals we have but modest disagreement .

		They are worthy ideals in part , but are expressetl wath that v ^ agueness of form and fervor of utterance that is deemed the projjer tone to assume when the gallery is in attendance .

		It is that per - fectly conventional and custom-sanctioned lofti - ness of sentiment that the man of the street in the language of the sti * eet describes as finding expression through the uniLSual channel of his headgear .

		The effect of the whole is at once nidlified when the insensibility to the real con - cerns of academic life appears so conspicuously between the lines .

		Like ^ vise is there much to be said in defense of the present caste of the
University	ORGANIZATION	' Presi - dency .

		The powers which that official has come to exercise are in part the issue of circumstances that are regrettable but ine \ ` itable in so new a cidture as ours .

		There is much to conunend , and moi-e freely .

		to excuse in the manner in which the office has been filled , and in the dic - tatorial aspect that it has assumed in our educational development .

		But to glorifj ^ these shortcomings of our immatiuity .

		and to derive a model for the future from the misfortunes of the past , is whoUy to misread the evolutionary lesson .

		Those who have both an interest in and a knowledge of academic concerns will be the fii-st to acknowletlge the honor that is due to the President and to exjjress appreciation of his actual services .

		But this tribute is brought to the man who makes the best of his opportun - ities , who does not confuse might with right , or the feasible with the desirable .

		Worthy and practical compromise soils no man 's hands : but when the birthright is bartered for servility , and the sacrifice of ideals is the price of material advance , the spirit of corruption is astir and is none the less vicious for being cleverly or loftily disguised .

		As a matter of fact , it is simply im - possible that the interests of the cultural life should be safeguarded by any others than those whose lives are devoted to such pursuit .

		ThLs does not mean that leadership and organization and practical measures shall not find due place ; but it does mean that Boai-ds of Trustees can - not decide what ends Universities are to accom - plish , and then engage expert agents to carry out their decisions .

		The proper relation of Trustees , Faculty , and President is too large and too technical a question to be here tliscussed .

		Our concern Ls with the dignity of the academic life and the furtherance of academic welfare .

		Administra - tive measures can do much to make or mar the conditions under which the academic life is to be livetl .

		At present there is grave danger that what little honor and reward is left to this career will be lost to the next generation through the s -RCB- -RRB- ec-tacle of the harsh adversities that beset the undaunted or misguided enthusiasts that still gather in the quadrangle .

		The most seri - ous menace lies in that spirit of dependent ac - countability that dominates the professorial career in an American institution , and to which Mr.
Pritchett	PERSON	has calle < l timely attention .

		The academic peace came as a heritage to the pa.st but not to the present generation ; the academic freedom , not mainly of professional speech , but the pursuit of life with reasonable freedom from hari-assing restraint , is rapidly declining .

		No single influence is more intimately responsible for the decline than the unsuitable natiire of
University	ORGANIZATION	administration , that appears con - spicuously in the inconsiderate autocracy in which the President may legally indulge .

		The benevolent despot may justify means by ends ; but the more likely issue that has actually oc - curi-etl is the sacrifice of the professor to the demands for material advance imder presidential ambition for results that shall dazzle the crowd .

		It must likewise be admitted that the entire range of influences that shape etlucational opin - ion has cobpei-ated to bring to the Presidency the ti > - pe of individual that mildly or aggressively assumes the role that it is his due and duty to assume , if the text of the ' •
Atlantic	LOCATION	' * article is to prevail .

		In this very circmiistance lies the weakness and misfortime of the iLSual pi * ovisions for academic administration .

		That these issues have natiirallv resulted from the hurrietl deve 1 - 34 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, opment of our cultural progress , we entirely agree .

		But the further conclusion that the wi'iter draws , that these things are right because they are so , is an open bid for a fooFs paradise .

		The equipment of knowledge , sensibilities , and interest that makes a man an educator is not that displayed in a business meeting of the Trustees , or in the pompous appearance before intimidated teachers ; it is so imrelated to these that it must be the rarest chance to find a man of ripe educational endowment both able and willing to give so much of his energies to matters only incidentally belonging to his true metier .

		And the hopeful solution for present difficulties lies in the very spirit in which the really worthy
University President	ORGANIZATION	takes up his work , and as well in the further fact that more and more generally is fitness for such high office appraised with reference to such intrinsically academic qualities .

		Just how significant this brighter light along the horizon may be , and how cer - tainly it heralds the dispersal of the clouds , those given to meteorological prophecy may decide .

		Doubtless all this seems a needlessly severe arraignment of what is obviously a well-inten - tioned effort .

		As a sporadic indication of one man 's view of which way the wind is blowing and of how we should trim our sails to take advantage thereof , it deserves no more consid - eration than attaches to the opinion thus ex - pressed .

		But reputations are not such simple affairs ; and the sponsorship of the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' places these pages in the public eye with the jwestige of representing a conmiendable aspect of intellectual ideals .

		It is this phase of the situation that has dispelled a very natural im - pulse to hold our peace , and without seizmg the controversial pen to await a fitting oppor - tunity to replace what is regarded as a false ideal by a worthier one .

		If this seems unfair to the editorial liability of the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' let it be recalled tliat it has ever been the lot of Atlas to bear the burden of the world upon his shoulders , and that the editorial , like the pro- fessorial , responsibility is great .

		A BUNDLE of '' Simples from Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	's Garden , '' gathered by Mr.
Harry Christopher Minchin	PERSON	, is an appropriate publication of the tercentenary year of
Browne	ORGANIZATION	's birth .

		All of the anthor 's books are rep - resented in the selections , and the volume can hardly fail to accomplish its compiler 's purpose of suggesting '' to even a few readers some conception of the spiritual depth , mental hmiinosity , and moral sweetness which were united in the personality of Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	. ''

Blackwell	PERSON	, of
Oxford	LOCATION	, publishes the book .

		YEAR OF
CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITERATURE .

		-- I .

		The annual reports upon
Continental	ORGANIZATION	literature , hitherto collected in a single issue of `` The Athe - naeum , '' are now presented upon a new plan , being published one at a time in separate numbers of that periodical .

		Reports from
Germany	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
Spain	LOCATION	have thus far appeared in the current series , and these we now summarize for the benefit of American readers .

		Dr.
Ernst Heilborn	PERSON	, who writes of German liter - atiu'e , confines his attention to criticism , poetry , the drama , and the novel .

		He puts criticism first be - cause he thinks that it '' stands at the present mo - ment on a higher level than purely creative work .

		Its authors display a more vigorous and pronounced personality , it is more individual in expression , and its style has more colour . ''

		The works of three
Berlin	LOCATION	critics are chosen for discussion ,
Herr Paid Goldmann	ORGANIZATION	's `` Aus dem Dramatischen Irrgarten , ''
Herr Alfred Kerr	PERSON	's '' Das Neue Drama , '' and
Herr Felix Poppenberg	PERSON	's '' Bibelots . '' ''

		From the obscure and eddying dance of shadows these three literary personalities step forth and stand before us clear and firm in outline . ''


Herr Goldmann	PERSON	stands for specifically French ideals , and urges '' the necessity of returning to a definite and apjiroved stage - technique . ''

		He is also '' the sworn foe of naturalism in its German development , and is possessed by an ardent desire for gi > andeur , passionate action , colour , and form . ''


Herr Kerr	PERSON	is also '' rooted in roman - ticism , '' and his influence has been `` largely instru - mental in dethroning naturalism . ''


Herr Poppen	PERSON	- berg also `` consciously set his affections on roman - ticism from the very first , and has always been the opponent of realism with its lack of colour . ''

		This similarity of attitude on the part of all three toward the chief literary controversy of the day is certainly remarkable , and shows us that the romantic cause is by no means in so desperate a case as some of its foes would have us believe .

		In verse , nothing very important is chronicled .

		There are the collected poems of
Otto Erich Hartleben	PERSON	, who has just died , the ''
Reigen Schoner Frauen	PERSON	'' of
Herr Otto Hauser	PERSON	, '' Die Vier Jahreszeiten '' of
Herr Frank Wedekind	PERSON	, and the '' Galgenlieder '' of
Herr Chi'istian Morgen	ORGANIZATION	- stern .

		The two books last named belong to the category of fantastic or gi-otesque art .

		The litera - ture of the drama is notable for its reshaping of borrowed material .


Herr Beer-Hofmann	PERSON	's tragedy , ''
Der Graf von Charolais	PERSON	, '' is a free adaptation of Massinger 's '' The Fatal Dowry '' ;
Herr von Hof	PERSON	- mannsthal 's `` Das Gerettete Venedig '' is likewise founded on Otway 's '' Venice Preserved , '' while even
Herr Hauptmann	PERSON	's new dream-play , ``
Elga	PERSON	, '' takes its subject from one of
Grillparzer	ORGANIZATION	's tales .

		`` This is the story of a Polish countess who plays her husband false with the comrade of her youth .

		We see the count tormented by doubts and fears ; his suspicion becomes a certainty , and he confronts his wife with her paramour in the very spot where they have sinned .

		The latter confesses their guilt , while she denies it .

		There is but one way , declares
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 35 her husband peremptorily , by which she can save her life : she must kill with her own hand the child that has been be - gotten in adultery .

		At the moment , however , when she is actoallv preparing for this inb nman deed , her husband strikes her down .

		For this subject , full of horrors as it is ,
Haupt	PERSON	- mann has chosen the form of a '' dream-play '' ; it is presented in a series of visions seen by a Glerman knight who has taken refuge in the Polish cloister . ''

		Other plays are • * Die Bauerin , '' by
Frau Clara Viebig	PERSON	; `` Die MorgenrSte '' -LRB- the story of
Lola Montez	PERSON	in
Munich	LOCATION	-RRB- , by
Herr Josef Ruederer	PERSON	; `` Biederleute , '' by
Herr Robert Misch	PERSON	; '' Die Sieb - zehnjahrigen , '' by
Herr Max Dreyer	PERSON	; ''
Xebenein	PERSON	- ander . ''

		by
Herr Georg Hirschfeld	PERSON	; `` Maskerade , '' by
Herr Ludwig	PERSON
Fulda	LOCATION	'' ; and '' ` Im
Grilnen Baum	PERSON	ztir NachtigaU , '' the last work of Hartleben .

		A curious trick of this writer and some others , show - ing to what straits a straining for novelty may cany writers , is thus described : '' Their method is to employ a strictly realistic treatment in the earlier acts of a drama , and so obtain a comic effect in the portrayal of laughable characters and surroundings , and then , when the original comedy begins to drag , to transform it on a sudden into tragedy .

		Anything more inartistic than this it would be hard to conceive , for every tragic effect should be led up to by causes inherent in the theme proposed . ''

		Turning to fiction , we find interesting notes upon a number of books , but no description of anj-thing highly important ,
Herr Hans Miiller	PERSON	's ''
Buch	PERSON	der Abenteuer '' '' • makes an attempt to revive the old Italian tale in the manner of Boccaecio . ''


Frau Riccarda Huch	PERSON	's ' • Seif enblasen '' again shows that talented writer to be `` a genuine and original roman - ticist . ''


Herr Otto Hauser	PERSON	's '' Lucidor der Ungliick - liche '' embodies
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's ideal that `` we should fashion life itself into a work of art . ''

		Herr Lud - wig
Thoma	PERSON	's '' Andrea.s Yost '' describes a little
Ba	ORGANIZATION	- varian community with notable vigor and descrip - tive talent .


Herr Jakob Wassermann	PERSON	's `` Alexander in
Babylon	LOCATION	'' is a brUliant piece of historical romance which does not , however , realize the full significance of its theme .

		Dr.
HeUborn	PERSON	's general comment on the year 's output is put in a sentence of admirable truth that might , indeed , be applied to many other coimtries besides
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		If I had to characterize the literature of the past year in s few words .

		I should say that far too many literary fashions , which lead only to confusion , are followed , and there is a consequent lack of that naiveti which by the simplest means can shape an inner , personal experience into a work of art . ''

		Mr.
Valerii Briusov	PERSON	, who writes from
Russia	LOCATION	, begins his report as follows : '' It is impossible to say that literary life in
Russia	LOCATION	has been develoj '' ed in orthodox fashion during the last twelve months .

		The attention of all society has been so much occupied by the war with
Japan	LOCATION	and the revolutionary move - ment in the country , that readers were not likely to be in - fluenced by purely literary developments .

		On the other hand , current events have had their influence on literature , if we take that expression in its widest sense . ''

		Among the effects of this influence may be noted many translations of works upon political subjects , and the greater freedom of discussion resulting from a relaxed censorship of the press .

		Russian publicists call this new breath of freedom the '' Spring , '' and it has brought into free circulation such formerly contraband books as the works of
Herzen	ORGANIZATION	,
Tseher	PERSON	- nishevski , and the poet Og ^ riev .

		The most impor - tant event in contemporary literature has been the completion of Itlr .

		Merezhkovski 's ''
Peter	PERSON	and
Alexis	PERSON	, '' the concluding section of the great '' Christ and Antichrist '' trilogj ' . ''

		In the whole work the author exhibits a vast labour , which shows his great erudition .

		In his talent he is rather an essayist than a poet .

		The chapters devoted to the char - acterization of the great Russian emperor are magnificent -- a wonderful , and at the same time portentous , portraiture of the giant Tsar .

		The remaining chapters furnish living pic - tures of various sides of Russian life at the beginning of the eighteenth century .

		The language of the novel is condensed , carefully elaborated , and shows a good style .

		But
Merezh	PERSON	- kovski has not produced an artistic whole .

		He has not brought into complete form the material which he has col - lected ; he has been prevented by his desire to show that
Peter	PERSON	destroyed the Russian Church .

		The novel is not a shapely , well-proportioned statue , conceived by one artistic survey , but a museum of curiosities and mosaics . ''

		Mr.
Andrev	PERSON	's '' The Red Laughter '' is a tale deal - ing with `` the terrors of war and the madness of the masses . ''

		It is a psychological study rather than an epic picture .

		Mr.
Sologub	PERSON	has surpassed him - self in a book of '' daintj * little parables , recalling the fables of the East or the tales of Andersen . ''

		In '' The Return , '' by Mr.
A. Bieli	PERSON	, '' The strict continuity of our life is mingled with the illogi - cality of dreams , and is turned into a disconnected and mon - strous chaos ; the conditions of time and space are , as it were , obliterated , and dizziness seizes the reader , as at the beg ^ inning of an earthquake . ''

		`` The Duel , '' a novel by Mr.
I. Kuprin	PERSON	, is `` a tale of military life , representing the emptiness and petti - ness of the lives of Russian officers . ''

		A few short stories and a play by '' Maxim Gorky '' have not been particularly successful , and the influence of this writer seems to be declining .

		An extraordinary example of the closet drama is '' Tantalus , '' by Mr.
Ivanov	PERSON	.

		which , in the opinion of our critic , the an - cients would certainly have crowned .

		Lyrical verse is exemplified by the new volumes of Mr.
Balmont	PERSON	, Mr.
Block	PERSON	, and Mr.
Dobruliobov	PERSON	.


Don Rafael Altamira	PERSON	, writing of Spanish lit - erature , gives a lengthy list , as usual , of works in the fields of serious scholarship .

		Among these we note the varied literature of the
Don Quixote	PERSON	ter - centenary , including an important address by
Senor Menendez y Pelayo	ORGANIZATION	, and a posthumous essay by
Juan Valera	PERSON	.

		and many other books of Cervantes criticism , biography , philology , and bibliography .

		So much space is taken up by this enumeration that little is left for the miscellaneous output of the year .

		In fiction , there is '' La Quimera , '' by Sefiora Baz ^ n ; '' La Bodega , '' by SeiSor
Ib	ORGANIZATION	^ fiez ; ''
Aurora Roja	LOCATION	, '' by
Senor Baroja	PERSON	; and three new volimies of `` Episodios Nacionales . ''

		by
Sefior Grald	ORGANIZATION	< 5s .

		In the drama , there are new plays by
Senor Echegaray	PERSON	and
Sefior Graldds	PERSON	, but '' the leading names among the drama - tists are those of the brothers
Quintero	PERSON	and of the Catalan Iglesias . ''

		Castilian poetry has recently un - dergone a grave loss in the death of Gabriel y Gakin , a ' • young poet whose verses express the very essence of the Castilian country-side . ''

		MR.
SWINBURNE	PERSON	'S POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
Thk Dial	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		The editorial article in yoiir last number , entitled `` A Poet for Poets , '' suggests several interesting questions .

		As I have no especial knowledge of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's work , I shall not attempt to answer these questions , but I should be glad of an opportunity to submit some of them to you and to your readers .

		You assert in effect that Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poetry is still grotesquely misvmderstood by a '' large section of the public , '' and yoii imply that this misunderstanding is due `` to ignorance and prejudice . ''

		You complain that he is misjudged because '' sound and fury , debased sensualism , and vacuity of thought are honestly sup - posed by many well-meaning people to be essential attributes of his work . ''

		You seek to refute such a view by referring these '' well-meaning people '' to certain poems , which in your opinion show severity of style , or idealism , or depth of thought ; and you conclude that those who disagree with you have either never read
Swinburne	PERSON	's significant work , or that , having read it , they are impervious to the appeal of pure poetry .

		Now I may not entirely agree with these '' well - meaning people , '' but I confess that my sympathies go out towards them .

		Let us state their case a little more moderately , and I believe a little more correctly , and then ask ourselves if it has not at least an element of truth .

		Take their contention that Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poetry as a whole is lacking in depth , power , and originality of thought .

		It is not a convincing answer to this charge to be referred to two poems , which occupy possibly eighteen pages out of the eighteen hundred or two thousand printed pages of the complete edition of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poems .

		Whether these particular poems exhibit depth of thought or not , is beside the mark .

		In actual fact it happens that one of the two examples is a poor one , -- for there is nothing either new or profoimd in the chief thought of `` Hertha . ''

		The leading idea in this poem had been already used by
Emerson	PERSON	in his ''
Brahma	PERSON	, '' and m places
Swinburne	PERSON	follows
Emerson	PERSON	with surprising closeness .

		If you contend that '' Her - tha '' is a fine poem , we agree with you most fully ; but if you point to it as a contribution to thought , we reply that it is no more a contribution to thought than Her - rick 's injunction '' Gather ye rosebuds while ye may '' is an original contribution to philosophy .

		Agam , if '' well-meaning people '' complain of an unwholesome , feverish , and morbid atmosphere in Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's so-called love poems , it does not satisfy them to be told tliat in one short poem of a different class , '' The Pil - grims , '' there is '' austere idealism . ''

		The opposition may , I think , properly ask , in what poem or poems has Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	written of love not as a delirious pagan but as a high-minded gentleman , as
Dante Avrote	PERSON	of it in the `` Vita Nuova , '' or Shakespeare in Sonnet CXVI. , as
Wordsworth	PERSON	wrote of it at .

		rare moments , or
Brown	PERSON	- ing , or
Tennyson	LOCATION	, or
Burns	PERSON	?

		Permit me to make one suggestion in conclusion .

		There is a very simple way of meeting the charge that Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poetry is greater in mamier than in matter , in melody and in verbal cumiing than in any solid substratum of thought .

		I have seen in more than one recent criticism the unsupported assertion that Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	was a profoimd thuiker ; what I should like to see would be some specific statement of the exact na ^ ture of his contribution to thought .

		What answer does he give to the eternal riddles of the World-Sphinx ?

		Is it a thoughtful , a cheering , or a wholesome answer ?

		What is the natui-e of the '' etliical inspiration '' we are said to receive from his poetry ?

		He is known as the poet of Liberty , -- what has he contributed to the world 's thought on the complex question of human freedom ?

		Has he added one jot of sober thought to the lyric rhapsodies of
Shelley	LOCATION	, or to the blind revolt of Byron ?

		Has he ever approached the wisdom of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's treatment of this subject in the latter 's ode on ``
France	LOCATION	'' ?

		Has he , in brief , shown himself prof ounder than the lightest-brained enthusiast or the traditional Irishman who is always '' agin the government '' ?

		I believe that an answer to these questions would be a real help to many .

		It would help them to judge of the justice of Mr.
Coventry Patmore	PERSON	's declaration that in reading Mr.
S %	PERCENT	vinburne 's poetry it is '' impossible not to feel that there has been some disproportion between his power of saying things and the things he has to say . ''

		I should like to see these and kindred questions dis - cussed temperately and without recrimination ; and I should like the discussion to be based on the quality and character of Mr.
Swinbm-ne	PERSON	's poetry us a whole ; remembering , on the one hand , that it is easy to imder - value his great gifts , and that , on the other , it is easy , -- as Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	warns us , -- to be betrayed into an '' micritical admiration '' of his work .

Hartford	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	,
Jan. 11 , 1906	DATE	, -LSB- We print this communication , although it seems to do no more than repeat the shallow objections that have been voiced ad nauseam by many other unsympathetic critics .

		The points it makes are so worn that they have become blunt .

		To say with Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	that Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	is `` a very thoughtful poet '' is the exact truth , but it does not mean that he is a poet who has made serious original contributions to thought .

		What poet may be named who has done such a thing ?

		It is not the poet 's business to frame formal , philosophies .

		But we believe that Mr.
SAvinburne	PERSON	's work as a whole is as weighty , from the intellectual point of view , as that of any of his contemporaries .

		That is , it shows him to have thought clearly and steadily upon quite as many subjects , and to have as definite a body of opinions , as the best of them .

		Whether his answer to the `` eternal riddles '' is a `` cheering '' one or not is beside the mark .

		It is also beside the mark to censure him for not having aj ^ proached a given sub - ject in exactly the temper of some other poet with whom the critic is more in sympathy .

		It would be easy enough to give the lists of poems and passages which our correspondent calls for , if oiu - present space permitted .

		In naming one or two poems as typical , we by no means implied that there were not others of equal significance .

		And we regi'et to notice the evidences of unconscious prejudice -LRB- `` delirious pagan , '' '' lightest-brained enthusiast , '' '' traditional Irishman '' -RRB- that bear out the writer 's admission that he has '' no especial knowledge of Mr.

		Leaving out of account the vexed question of Home Ride for
Ireland	LOCATION	, the rights or wrongs of Irish tenants and landlords , and all such matters of politics as are likely to excite in the reader more or less warmth of opposition or agreement , one can not but pronoimce the book a hmiian document of imusual interest .

		Many of its details , to be sure , are such as a reader of no deep sjTupathies on either side of the great Irish question will omit ; and many others are of a nature that makes a personal acquaintance with the Emerald Isle necessaiy to their \ a ^ nd realization and keen enjopuent .

		He is stUl what many , in defiance of Dr.
Osier	PERSON	, will call comparatively yoimg , having been bom in
1852	DATE	.

		MaUow ,
Cork County	LOCATION	, is his birthplace ; there and in its vicinity his youth was passed ; and it was this town that first sent him to
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, in
1883	DATE	.

		Both father and mother , as well as two brothers and a sister , died in his early manhood , and the young man was left dependent on such mental equipment as a rather brief attendance at
Cloyne Diocesan CoUege	ORGANIZATION	and Queen 's College ,
Cork	ORGANIZATION	, together with much miscellaneous read - ing , hatl enabled him to secure .

		The account he gives of his earliest schoolmaster , whom he calls '' Attda , '' and of this tyrant 's '' • heavy box bludgeon delicately called ` the slapper , ' '' re - minds one of
George MacDonald	PERSON	's vivid picture of
Murdoch Malison	PERSON	, known to his trembling subjects as '' Murder ''
Malison	PERSON	, and his dreaded taws .

		The literary impulse had early asserted itself in our author , and he took to journalism as a duck to water .

		Reporter on the ''
Cork Daily Herald	ORGANIZATION	, '' contributor to the ''
Freeman	PERSON	's Journal , '' editor of '' United
Ireland	LOCATION	'' and of '' The Irish People , '' he brought an imtiring pen to the service of his country , and paid for his patriotism by more than two years of imprisonment , first and la.st .

		Indeed , he was prosecuted no fewer than nine times for politi - cal offenses .

		In
1898	DATE	he started a new agra ^ rian movement and foimded the '' United Irish League . ''

		Of his books , besides the one already named , the best-known are '' Irish Ideas '' and '' A Queen of Men . ''

		He has been in Parlia ^ ment intermittently since
1883	DATE	, being now , if we are not mistaken .

		Nationalist member for
Cork	ORGANIZATION	.

		To gain an idea of the stem training to which the yoimg patriot-author was subjected , take the following picture of faimly disaster .

		The \ \ Titer was twenty-six at the time to which these records of sickness and death and poverty refer : '' I stretched myself on the sofa in the sitting-room , the only room in the house where there was not some - .

		body dpng or dead , and tried to sleep .

		One familiar cough was now missing from the chorus .

		The others still from time to time broke through the sUence of the house of death , but not in any especially alarming way , and my mother had mercifully fallen into a deep sleep after her long watchings .

		About two hours afterwards I was awakened from a half-sleep by a particidariy violent explosion of coughing from the room where my younger brother was Ipng .

		The coughing cidminated in au awfid hollow sigh , which sounds as distinctly in my memory now , more than a quarter of a centurj - after , as it did on that
dreadfiU night	TIME	.

		Then there came a silence , more terrifying a thousand times than the coughing .

		I would 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, have given anything to hear the well-known cough again .

		... It was too late to give my mother any consolation by awakening her , and there was always the fear of the effect on my poor sister , whose cough alone now broke the stillness , save for an occasional attack of my own .

		I sat on the bed in the dark , with the dead , until the day - light , which it seemed never would come , and then , as I heard my mother move , went in to warn her not to frighten my sister .

		From that hour the overwhelming sadness of human life has never quitted me .

		If my hair had not grown white , when I looked in the glass , it was certainly another man , and a sad one , I saw there . ''

		As was to be expected , frequent glimpses of
Parnell	ORGANIZATION	are given in Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's pages , in addition to the frontispiece portrait of the man with which the book is provided .

		A bon mot of
Pamell	ORGANIZATION	's is quoted as characteristic of his hmnor .

		* '
Ireland	LOCATION	, '' he declared , '' is too small a country for a rebellion .

		There is not enough room to run away . ''

		He added that '' Wasliington saved
America	LOCATION	by running away .

		If he had been fighting in
Ireland	LOCATION	, he woidd have been brought to surrender in six weeks .

		Nowadays , with the railways ,
England	LOCATION	could sweep the country from
Cork	ORGANIZATION	to
Donegal	LOCATION	in six days . ''

		Here are a few passages from Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's note-book : `` Nov. l ^ th -LSB-

		Routed out at seven this morn - ing to go to
Tralee	LOCATION	with
Parnell	PERSON	and his fiery cross .

		Coldish reception in
Tralee	LOCATION	, but no colder than public feeling everywhere about everything just now ... ''
Nov.	DATE	.

		IQth .

		Parnell addressed a rough-and-tumble meeting , half farmers , half Fenians , with several tipsy interrupters and a preliminary alarm that the floor was giving way .

		He spoke imder cruel difficulties , but fired them all before he sat down ... `` Nov. nth .

		Returned by night-mail , and had end - less delightful glimpses of P. and of the real man ... He has captured me , heart and soul , and is bound to go on capturing .

		A sweet seriousness au fond , any amount of nervous courage , a delicate reserve , without the smallest suspicion of hauteur ; strangest of all , humoiir ; above everything else , simplicity ; as quietly at home with the girls in
Mallow	LOCATION	as with his turbulent audience in
Tralee	LOCATION	.

		We exchanged no end of confidences .

		As romantic as
Lord Edward	PERSON	, but not to be shaken from prosier methods .

		In any case a man one coidd suffer with proudly . ''

		Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's early investigation of the Irish landlord system made him painfully familiar with the sufferings of the peasantry .

		`` What , perhaps , was the most hatefid discovery of all was that the poorer the land and the meeker the tenant , the more merciless was his rent , and the more diabolical the oppression practised upon him .

		In the richer parts of the country , the system bred special evils of its own ; but the
Tipperary	LOCATION	peasant living on a generous soil often paid little more than half the sum per acre that was extorted from the small holder of
Mayo	ORGANIZATION	for the acre or two of similar quality which might be found , like an oasis , amidst the rocks and swamps which made up the rest of his holding .

		... A more cruel circumstance still , the poor western , evicted from the fertile lands which abound in
Connaught	LOCATION	, was more heavily rented per acre for the miserable motmtain patch to which he was banished than the big grazier or gombeen-man , in whose interest he was driven from his own fields , was asked to pay for tliem .

		The poorer landlords held the poorest parts of the country , and the rents were fixed not according to the poverty of the land or of the tenants who reclaimed it , but according to the necessities of the landlord , who did nothmg for the land except to rack-rent and mortage it . ''

		Amid such descriptions of hardship , in which the book almost of necessity abounds , it is a welcome relief to meet with the following refer - ence to present better conditions , even though the paragraph is relegated to the subordinate position of a footnote : '' Life has given me few happier reflections than that
Clare Island	LOCATION	, which I thus saw for the first time under all the terrors of hunger and squalid landlord oppres - sion , is now , owing to a train of circumstances of pecu - liar satisfaction to the writer , a happy commxmity of peasant proprietors , free forever from the shadow of famine , landlordism , gmiboat , or sheriff .

		I had the happiness of seeing the steamer , in which the agent and sheriff used to invade the island for rent , rotting to pieces on the beach near
Mallow Cottage	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- the author 's home -RSB- , its occupation and that of the sheriff-agent be - ing gone . ''

		In a chapter entitled '' A Newspaper 's Fight for Life , '' the author tells of his editing '' United
Ireland	LOCATION	'' from his cell in
Kilmainham Jail	LOCATION	.

		An extract will give a hint of the pecvdiar situation . ''

		It seems never once to have occurred to the Chief Secretary that the enemy against whom he was wildly flinging about his warrants was all the time doing his work from his own jail .

		My brother-prisoners included representatives from every county in the soutli , east , and west of
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		They were all allowed to receive their local newspapers ... My plan was to collect from each of the suspects his own local paper , together with their private letters , received by subterranean agencies , giving particulars not otherwise attainable .

		In this way my cell was converted into an information bureau , from which I was able weekly to dispatch many columns of exciting details , and many columns more of pungent comments , so that the paper , amidst all the crash and chaos m its editorial rooms , its printing staff , and its machinery room , became a more formidable foe , and the object of a stronger public interest than ever .

		... The Ladies ' Land League gave
Forster	PERSON	an addi - tional grudge against their body , by drafting a body of sweet girl graduates into
United Ireland	LOCATION	office to take the place of the outlawed men ; and most unselfishly and valiantly , for several months , they kept its accounts , and supplied some of its most piquant writings , and foUed the police raiders by a thousand mgenioiis fem - inine devices for circulating the paper . ''

		Then follows the story of the newspaper 's wan - dering existence , under government interdict , appearing now from a
London	LOCATION	press , a little later from one in
Liverpool	LOCATION	, then emerging serenely in
Glasgow	LOCATION	, next in
Manchester	LOCATION	, and even for a while being printed in
Paris	LOCATION	-- all much to the bewilderment of the British police .

		The Province of

Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	, and of a popular pride and hospitality which makes the traveller welcome and leaves him well-informed .

		Aside from the guide-books and other specific works of reference , the accounts in English of Provencal history , literature , and art have been neither very numerous nor comprehensive .

		Pro- fessor
Justin H. Smith	PERSON	's '' The Troubadours at Home , '' a scholai ` ly work , was more nearly con - cerned \ ^ ` ith the literary annals of

		In two volomes .

		Ulustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Sciibner	PERSON	's Sons .

		from
Carcassonne	LOCATION	to the
Riviera	LOCATION	.

		The author 's admirable handling of the life and history of the chateaux of the Loire in his former book '' Old Touraine '' was a sufficient guaranty that Pro- vencal themes would be treated with scholarship and sympathy .

		As he reminds us in the pref - ace , the history of
Old Provence	ORGANIZATION	has necessitated a somewhat different treatment , -- '' Only because I hare had towns to deal with instead of castles , and because I have had far more space to cover , both in territory and in time , than was involved in describing the chateaux in the districts of Tours and of
Blois	LOCATION	.

		The Seine seems full of commerce and of gov - ernment ; the
Loire	LOCATION	still mirrors the pleasure-palaces of the Valois court upon its golden stream ; but the valley of the
Rhone	LOCATION	has been the highway of the nations , the path of conquerors , the battle-field of the invader , and its boatmen still call one bank ' Empire ' and the other ♦ Kingdom ' ; though the names have long ago lost all sigfnificance in relation either to the east or to the west - em shore . ''

		The whole of the first volume is devoted to the period covering the ancient history of
Provence	LOCATION	, and including the occupancy of the Phoenicians , Greeks , and Romans , who have left traces on the soil of
Southeastern France	LOCATION	that are as remarkable , if not so numerous , as those to Ix - found in
Southern Italy	LOCATION	.

		Readers who oj -RRB- en the book unprepared by special study will be surprised , as they turn the pages and look at the many illustrations , by the abundant proofs of the consideration which this fair prov - ince enjoyed in the ' days of imperial
Rome	LOCATION	.

		We follow Mr.
Cook	PERSON	with deepening interest from town to town , studving the stately monuments which mark the victories of
Marius	PERSON	and
Caesar	PERSON	and the more peaceful glories of
Augustus	PERSON	and his successors .

		Among these , especial attention is given to the beautifid '' pyramidal '' memorial and arch at
St. Remy	ORGANIZATION	, and the more imposing but less pleasing arch at
Orange	LOCATION	, The theatres of Orange and Aries , built by Greek architects or under Greek influence , are finely contrasted with the great amphitheatres at
Nimes	ORGANIZATION	and Aries , which , only less capacious than the
Colos	PERSON	- seum at
Rome	LOCATION	, were devoted to the same bloody purposes .

		Of the few remains of Greek sculp - ture in
Provence	LOCATION	, !

		Mr ,
Cook	ORGANIZATION	discusses with most detail the two statues of Aphrodite known as the Venus of Aries and the
Venus of Nimes	ORGANIZATION	.

		To the former he gives ardent adhesion , and even makes her the subject of a poem in the Sapphic manner , prefixed to his first chapter .

		The last material trace of Greek life in Pro- vence is the beautifid temple at
Nimes	LOCATION	, absurdly called the '' -RSB- VIaison Carree . ''

		As an architect -LRB- Mr.
Cook	PERSON	is an F.S.A. -RRB- , the author dwells with loving minuteness on the chaste proportions of 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, this little structure , `` the greatest treasure of classic architecture north of the Alps '' ; and carefully explains for lay readers those various refinements and subtle irregtdarities which gave vitality to the best Greek architecture , and the absence of which leaves its modem imitations dead .

		He is probably right , therefore , in his con - clusion that '' this temple at
Nimes	ORGANIZATION	was ordered by Romans who had definite ideas about the plan they considered appropriate , but it was set up by an architect of the Augustan age who knew how to give the best effect to his work . ''

		Of strictly Roman works , we are called upon to admire , above arches and amphitheatres , the superb aqueduct near
Nimes	LOCATION	known as the
Pont du Gard	ORGANIZATION	, which Mr.
Cook	PERSON	calls the finest Roman aqueduct , not only of
Provence	LOCATION	, but of the world .

		He adds : '' The three tiers of arches , as Fergiisson points out , produce the same effect as an entablature and cornice upon a long range of columns , with the additional and stupendous feature that the whole structure spreads out wider and wider as it rises in height from its founda - tion .

		The full beauty of the work is therefore only appreciable from a little distance down the valley , where the slopmg hills above the stream add their sup - porting Imes to a picture which combines the majesty of nature with the daring skill of man .

		From here you realize how the Romans converted a merely utilitarian structure into an architectural screen of unrivalled beauty without the introduction of a single ornament or a single useless feature ... By such buildings as this did the Romans acqiure the constructive skill and magnificence of proportion which enabled them fear - lessly to plan buildings so vast in size , and to vaxdt spaces so huge , that the impress of their maker 's power has lasted while the rock on which they built them has endured . ''

		If we have lingered on the architectural por - tions of the first volume , it is because they are distinctly the most attractive .

		Mr.
Cook	PERSON	has felt it his duty to give much historical matter , from
Hannibal	LOCATION	to
Augustus	LOCATION	, that can be found in the books , and might have been condensed with no loss of interest and some gain in clear - ness .

		Taken as a whole , however , the volmne is a valuable contribution to the literature of the subject ; and being separately indexed , it may profitably be used by itseM , without reference to the second volmne ; to which we must now devote a few words .

		It treats of medisBval
Provence	LOCATION	down to its absorption into
France	LOCATION	in the year
1481	DATE	; and contains an interesting chapter on the three great fortresses of the South , --
Les Baux	LOCATION	, Car - cassonne , and Aigues Mortes .

		The reason for including
Carcassonne	LOCATION	, which is not strictly within the geographical limits of
Provence	LOCATION	, is that `` its most heroic history is inextricably associated with the horrors of the Albigensian crusade '' -LRB- of which Mr.
Cook	PERSON	proceeds to give us a lengthy account -RRB- ; and also , that '' no ex - cuse is needed for reminding the traveller in
Provence	LOCATION	that he is within reach of the most magnificent fortress in
Europe	LOCATION	, which has been held in turn by
Visigoth	LOCATION	,
Frank	PERSON	, and French - man , and is now restored , by a very miracle of tasteful knowledge , to all the primitive splendor of its rugged beauty , its isolated strength , its marvellously complex architecture . ''

		Avignon and its Popes , who divided with
Rome	LOCATION	the homage of
Christendom	LOCATION	during the fourteenth century , are given a fvdl and com - prehensive chapter ; and it is only a pity that Mr.
Cook	PERSON	found himseK compelled , for lack of space as he says , to cut short his description of beautiful VUleneuve .

		We could have better spared a Pope or two in order to have justice done to this fascinating old town , separated from
Avignon	LOCATION	only by '' the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone . ''

		Mr.
Cook	PERSON	does fidl justice to Provencal lit - erature and to its modern revival in the Feli - bres ; and quotes plentifully from
Mistral	LOCATION	,
Aubanel	PERSON	,
Roiunanille	LOCATION	, and the rest , generally with subjoined translations .

		From the '' gay science '' he selects and tells the stories of
Clem	PERSON	- ence and of Aucassin and
NicoUete	ORGANIZATION	.

		Good King
Rene	PERSON	and his court close the picture ; '' as an honest politician , his material successes were not so great as those obtained by more unscru - pulous players in the game of kings .

		His claim upon posterity lies rather upon artistic and intel - lectual gromids ; upon the serenity he showed in evil fortune ; the dignity with which he faced defeat ; the constancy with which he died , at
Aix	LOCATION	,
July 10 , 1480	DATE	, still in possession of his titles of inheritance and knowing that he pos - sessed them for the good of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		We gladly go with Mr.
Cook	PERSON	on a little jour - ney to the beautiful valley of
Vaucluse	LOCATION	, inunor - talized by its memories of '' Lovely Laura in her light green dress , And faithful Petrarch gloriously crowned . ''

		He contends , against received accounts , that
Laura	PERSON	did not meet Petrarch first in a church at
Avignon	LOCATION	, that she never married , and that she died of a chill instead of the plague .

		The book is weU printed ; though an obvious slip on page 17 of volume II , makes '' favoured '' out of '' fevered . ''

		More than a guide-book , and less , it is one of those aids to travel which , like Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's '' Rulers of the South , '' should lie by the side of Baedeker in even the smallest steamer trunk .

		THE DIAL 41 A RE-VALrATIOX OF SCHLLLER .

		* During the year just closed , the hundi-edth anniversary of the death of
Friedrich Schiller	PERSON	brought an almost embarrassing wealth of portraits , biographies , estimates , and apprecia - tions of the great German dramatist , forming an eloquent international expression of his far - reaching influence as man and poet .

		While the majority of these publications are mainly re-statements , in var ^ - ing form , of a sort of standard judgment as to the poet 's position in literature .

		Professor
Kiihnemann	PERSON	's book merits attention as a genuine attempt to contribute to a re-valuation of
Schiller	PERSON	for our own time .

		He sets himself a definite task of interpretation , unmixed with attempts to solve any questions of chronological detail , derivation , or literary relationship .

		Xot that he ignores such matters , as unworthy of consideration ; but he assumes that all such questions .

		haATng any vital signifi - cance for his work , have alreacly been satis - factorily answered .

		This elimination of much i ^ rele ^ ` ant discussion greatly simplifies and in - tensifies the total impression of the book .

		The central feature that unifies the author 's discussion is the prevailing attention focused from first to last upon
Schiller	PERSON	the dramatist .

		Professor
Kiihneman	PERSON	recognizes , more clearly than do most critics , the essential peculiarity ' of the poet 's genius .

		Even in the lyrics of the Anthology of
1782	DATE	, the occasional use of dia - logue , as in Hektors Abschied ^ reveals the antithetical and dramatic trend of SchiUer 's mind .

		The same capacity for perceiving ideas and relations spatially , and in conflict with each other , made for
Schiller	PERSON	the ballad-year ,
1798	DATE	, so signally successfid .

		For the ballad is at its best when saturated with the spirit of the drama .

		SchUler 's studies ia the fields of history and philosophy were consciously undertaken as a means to supply the dramatist with a solid substratrmi of definite knowledge .

		He saw in his own ignorance of life , present and past , the cause of a ratlical weakness of all his early dramas .

		These were almost exclusively the product of an exceptionally ^ - i ^ ^ d imagination nourished by its own fancies .

		Instead of taking : his cue longer from the spider , which spins her web out of her own body ,
Schiller	PERSON	began to imitate the bee , which makes honey out of the raw material furnished by the most widely divergent flowers imaginable .

		The History of the Thirty Years '' War , the History of the • ScHiLLEB .

		Von
Engen Kuhnemann	PERSON	.

		Munchen :
C. H. Becksche Verlags-Buchhandlang	ORGANIZATION	.

		Revolt of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, and other minor historical works , were merely the by-products of a mind that recognized in the drama its task of prime importance .

		The remarkable fascina - tion exerted upon the reader by these secondary works of
Schiller	PERSON	's pen is due to his wonderful power of distinct visualization and to the imagi - nation of the bom dramatist , that transforms the epic past into the dramatic present .

		Professor
Kiihnemann	PERSON	's clear perception of these facts leads him to a method of presentation that is equally just to the poet and attractive to the reader .

		The salient features of
Schiller	PERSON	's outer life-experience are given simply and ade - quately in a sequence dictated by the course of the poet 's dramatic career .

		The central sub - ject of the first hvmdred pages of the book is
Schiller	PERSON	's earliest drama , Z -RRB- ^ ie R'duher .

		All the suggestive discussion devoted to the poet 's family , childhood , and school and academy ex - perience , is so shaped and timed as to stand in vital relation to the later consideration of the play .

		In the school compositions , philosophical and scientific , as also in the letters of the young poet , our author finds proof of an innate mental tendency to proceed from large generalizations to their concrete application .

		This was doubt - less strengthened by the whole trend of the Karlsschule toward philosophical speculation and didacticism , in place of scientific experimen - tation and the development of individuality in the learner .

		It accepts as final truth a tradi - tional system of ethics , and behind this an equally traditional philosophy of the world .

		As a kind of reaction against the prevailing doc - trine of his teachers , we may regard
Schiller	PERSON	's over-emphasis on the material and the sensual , as the impelling force in human life , shown in his medical dissertations .

		In this he anticipates the cynicism of
Franz Moor	ORGANIZATION	in the R'duher .

		The Hduber is the most striking illustration conceivable of the tendency of the poet to proceed mentally from the abstract to the concrete .

		All efforts to portray human society and to reflect the world of reality are strictly subordinated to the tragic conflict between human will and the moral law of the universe .

		SchiUer saw this conflict in large outline , without confusion of detail ; and he succeeded , in spite of his igno - rance of dramatic technique and of real life , in giving us an impressive picture of his vision .

		Franz Moor , the blasphemous scoffer and de - nier , and Karl , the incensed and presumptuous reformer , who arrogates to himself the office of
Providence	LOCATION	, each meet characteristic defeat at the hands of the moral constitution of 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, things .

		God is thus vindicated , and is , as Pro- fessor
Kiihnemann	PERSON	says , the real hero of the play .

		The Titanic revolt and its dreadful consequences are conceived by
Schiller	PERSON	with such vividness and intensity as to render the R'duher , in spite of a plot of inconsistencies , contradictions , and absurdities , the most re - markable first attempt of any dramatist in the world 's history .

		The sins of the time , the va - garies in its philosophy of life , its social and political crimes , are , as our author points out , the objects upon which Scluller turns the searchlight of his various characters .

		Unlike
Shakespeare	PERSON	and
Hebbel	PERSON	, who portray the psy - chological steps by which an individual deviates from the narrow course that alone insures hap - piness and continued existence ,
Schiller	PERSON	sees men in masses and imiversalizes their relation to the fixed laws of the universe as he conceives it .

		Professor
Kiihnemann	PERSON	presents a close and suggestive analysis of the play , and continues with adequate attention to its inner and outer history and to its literary congeners among the poet 's predecessors and contemporaries .

		In approximately two hundred pages , he then fol - lows the development of
Schiller	PERSON	's art , from his flight from the
Karlsschule	PERSON	to his first residence in
Weimar	LOCATION	.

		Three dramas are the central subject of this part of the work .

		The author 's sketch of the distressing and cheering elements of the poet 's life in
Stuttgart	LOCATION	,
Oggers	PERSON	- heim ,
Bauerbach	LOCATION	,
Mannheim	LOCATION	,
Leipzig	LOCATION	, and
Dresden	LOCATION	, prefaces his consideration of Fiesko ,
Kabale	LOCATION	und
Liehe	PERSON	^ and
Don Carlos	PERSON	.

		Due weight is given to the mfluence of persecution , disappointment , ill-health , friendship , love , and popidar success , upon shaping the mind and work of the dramatist .

		Fiesko was conceived almost simultaneously with Die R'duber ^ and hence is the fruit of a similar psychological process .

		Yet our critic calls attention to several striking differences between these works .

		Die Rduher deals with contemporary life , and is nevertheless , in point of landscape , society , and individual portraits , almost wholly a work of the free imagination .

		Fiesko is based upon the life of the past ; and yet in it the poet has taken conscious pains to present a convincing picture of reality .

		The spirit of protest , so potent a factor in the texture of the li ` duher , yields here to an elaborate por - trayal of society and the world .

		To match the gigantic protest embodied m the fantastic rob - bers and their symbolic day of judgment , Fiesko presents the idea of republican freedom .

		A coup d'etat takes the place of the day of judg - ment , mth a corresponding drop in pitch and intensity .

		While
Karl Moor	PERSON	's outraged sense of right and justice is the mainspring of his action , Fiesko '' s love of freedom is so largely mingled with mere passion for glory and worldly ambi - tion as to render him almost unworthy of tragic pity .

		The action of the Rduher is pushed to a point where the moral order of the universe stands revealed triumphant in the opposite poles of humanity , represented by the brothers Moor .

		Thus the disturbed equilibrium is restored .

		The fall of Fiesko , and the continuance of the old regime iinder
Andreas Doria	PERSON	, offer by com - parison but a feeble solution of the problem .

		A reason for this deterioration .

		Professor
Kiihne	PERSON	- mann finds in
Schiller	PERSON	's fatuous belief that a realistic picture of a conspirac ; / , prompted by love of republican freedom , must necessarily be quite as significant as the imaginative picture of the Rduher .

		Professor
Kiilmemann	PERSON	emphasizes the success of the poet in giving to the motley forms and tendencies of his picture of social life imity and the semblance of reality .

		But he also shows the vmnaturally political bias of all these representa - tives of republican freedom . ''

		They feel and act not as natural but as political human be - ings . ''

		They are too often but incarnations of an abstract idea .


Schiller	PERSON	does not yet succeed in creating convincing characters , capable of acting like real men and women of flesh and blood , and also of embodying his poetic inten - tion .

		He too frequently permits them to sub - stitute for the views and expressions natural to them either their author 's conunent upon them or high-keyed declamation of the abstract ideas of their creator .


Schiller	PERSON	's next drama ,
Kahale	PERSON	und
Liehe	PERSON	, illustrates his power of discerning the sources of his previous success and failure , and of apply - ing this knowledge to a new problem .

		After his doubtfid experiment with Genoese history , he returned , in his third venture , to his own con - temporaneous country .

		German society as then constituted , with its class distinctions and class prejudices , and with its clash of class with class , is the source of the tragedy in this work .

		The conflict between the natural right of a man to love according to the promptings of his own heart , on the one hand , and the world of social convention and prescription on the other , is the occasion of the action .

		So we have here , as in the Rduher , a mighty spirit of protest , justified by notorioiis social abuses .

		As our critic says , if the poet 's premise of the natural right to follow
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 the lead of the heart in love is admitted , then the society he depicts stands convicted of crime .

		Professor
Kuhnemann	PERSON	praises the choice of sub - ject , the effective introduction , with its realistic picture of the
Miller	PERSON	family , the compact and well-balanced structure of the drama , and the full-rounded and dignified characters of Luise and
Ferdinand	ORGANIZATION	in the second half of the action .

		But he clearly sees the weaknesses of the play .

		Preponderance of theatrical instinct over clear poetic vision occasionally produces exigencies of the intrigue quite incompatible with the character of the men and women involved .

		The intrigue , by remaining in the foregroimd , deploying its ugliness , and precipitating the conflict during the first half of the action , condemns Luise and Ferdinand to passive roles , in which they fail to show any personality whatever .

		Moreover the persons of the inti-igue are a pliant coxcomb and two munitigated scoimdrels .

		The running satire of the poet through their words makes clear that they are deliberately Avithout conscience , ruth - less , and wicked .

		They might be otherwise , if they would .

		Hence they do not belong to the world of real men , whose virtues and vices are the necessary product of the natural law of their being .

		We miss , therefore , in their conflict with the children of light , that element of the inev - itable inseparable from the highest form of trag - edy .

		The whole remains rather a lyric cry of intense indignation against wanton oppression .

		In his interesting sketch of the position of
Schiller	PERSON	's Kahale und
Liehe	PERSON	in the history of occidental middle-class drama , from
Richardson	PERSON	through
Rousseau	PERSON	,
Lessing	PERSON	, etc. , to
Hebbel	ORGANIZATION	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and
Gerliard Hauptmann	PERSON	, our author emphasizes the unique relation of
Hebbel	ORGANIZATION	to
Schiller	PERSON	.

		The tragic element of middle-class life , as conceived by
Schiller	PERSON	, is not inherent in the life of the class as such , but hinges rather upon the accidental and temjjoral relation of class to class in the society and state of his own day ; whereas
Hebbel	PERSON	shows , in his
Maria Mag	ORGANIZATION	- dalena -LRB- 1844 -RRB- , that the narrow relations of middle-class life produce ine \ ` itably a narrow - horizoned and strait-laced ethical consciousness and sense of honor , which is at once the highest spiritual manifestation of this range of hmnan life , and , by its stem severity of judgment , the source of intense tragic conflicts .

		What Professor
Kiihnemann	PERSON	says of
Don Carlos	PERSON	-- of its genesis , its original conception and the completed work , the three dramas within the cU-ama , the
Eboli	LOCATION	scenes , and the catastrophe -- is all well worth while .

		We can mention here but two points of his discussion .

		In
Don Carlos ^ Schiller	PERSON	succeeds for the first time in dramatizing history .

		He sees the con - fiict between the cause of hmnanity and the Spanish Inquisition in the serene confidence of his new belief in the invincible power of good over evil .

		He no longer protests as a social pessiniLst .

		He acknowledges the necess ^ uy of reckoning with historical conditions and their upholders , as inevitable facts of life .

		They may be bad ; in that case they can and must eventually be changed .

		They may not yield without many a tragic sacrifice of the hopes , aspu-ations , and lives of good men .

		And this fills the beholder not with the spirit of revolt , but with compassion and tragic pity .

		Save for a few lapses into his old manner ,
Schiller	PERSON	draws the representatives of the Inquisition with as - impartial a distribution of light and shadow as he does the Prince and
Posa	PERSON	.

		They are all live men -- some of them even great men .

		This is striking proof of the increasing ripeness of the poet 's views of life and art .

		Our author takes exception to a widespread current view that does
Schiller	PERSON	a double injus - tice .

		This is the identification of
Don Carlos	PERSON	with the liigh-water mark of the poet 's dramatic art , and a misconception of that humanity which is here the object of his enthusiasm and his pathos .

		For , great as is the superiority of this drama over the earlier group of his tragedies , the gidf that separates
Don Carlos	PERSON	from the creations of his fidl maturity is still greater .

		And the humanity which is the especial care and inspii-ation of the Prince and his friend is no mere abstraction , as is commonly supposed .

		It means the power and originality of the per - sonal life , that maintains itself and is operative against all beniunbing and deadening forms and traditions .

		It means the right to one 's self , the freedom of the children of God in their creative enjoyment of the fulness of existence .

		Professor
Kiihnemann	PERSON	devotes about two hundi-ed pages to the period between
Schiller	PERSON	's first residence in
Weimar	LOCATION	and the completion of
Wallenstein	PERSON	, and the remainder of the book -LRB- something over a hundred pages -RRB- to the closing years of the poet 's life .

		The well-known outer facts of his experience in
Weimar	LOCATION	and
Jena	PERSON	, his love , friendships , and domestic life , his studies in history , philosophy , and the Greek drama , his professorship , his journalistic activity , his his - torical essays and philosophical poems , and his ballads , receive adequate attention in a natural sequence that is chiefly chronological .

		In an important sense , all these elements stand in a causal relation with that degree of maturity 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, reflected in his later dramas .

		Through the study of history , philosophy , and the Greek stage , he came into touch with the master-mind of Goethe and made possible that give-and-take friendship which proved so stimidating and help - fid to both men .

		The earnest effort of SchiUer to define to himself the difference between the natural working of his own mind and that of Goethe proved the occasion not only of the fh ` st real introduction of the friends to each other , but also of suggestive critical studies , em - bodied in the essay of
1795	DATE	, upon Naive und /
Sentimentalische Dichtung	ORGANIZATION	.


Schiller	PERSON	's obli - gation to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is generally emphasized by the critics ; they sometimes overlook , or at any rate fail to mention , the great obligation of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	to
Schiller	PERSON	during the eleven years of their joint activity .

		Professor
Kiihnemann	PERSON	is explicit upon both points .

		He says that
Schiller	PERSON	was brought by
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	into a new relation to things , -- a new relation to reality , -- and that
Goethe	PERSON	was enlightened by
Schiller	PERSON	as to the wealth of his own ideas .

		Goethe 's service consisted simply in meeting
Schiller	PERSON	familiarly and giving him a chance to comprehend and appropriate his habit of looking at things objectively and securing concrete mental pictures of the world and of human life .

		Schiller stimulated Goethe to re - newed poetic activity , called his attention to omissions of argument or to theses that needed more carefid elucidation , and made him aware of the unnoticed bearing of some earlier thought .

		And to the spur of
Schiller	PERSON	's encouragement and constructive criticism we owe the completion of the
First Part of Faust	ORGANIZATION	.


Wallenstein	PERSON	marks the beginning of a new period of dramatic activity in
Schiller	LOCATION	.

		It is essentially different from all of the poet 's earlier tragedies and from all previous productions of German literature .

		Professor
Kiihnemann	PERSON	speaks at length of the wealth of intellectual and emotional experience that immediately preceded and accompanied the genesis of this work .

		He mentions the various interruptions and changes of plan , many of which are reflected in the drama itself , and in
Schiller	PERSON	's correspondence from
January 12 , 1791	DATE	, to
March 17 , 1799	DATE	.

		He emphasizes the fundamental difficulties in - herent in the material -- the embarrassing wealth of facts to be communicated ; the various inde - pendent political plans of Illo ,
Questenberg	LOCATION	,
Oktavio	LOCATION	,
Buttler	PERSON	, and many others , to be coordi - nated ; a morally reprehensible undertaking of political ambition to be rendered imposing and attractive , in spite of its physical fadure through WaUenstein 's own clumsiness .

		And , most for - midable of all , perhaps , for
Schiller	PERSON	's art was the cold intellectuality , the hard-lined calcula - ting nature , of
Wallenstein	PERSON	himself .

		All the heroes of
Schiller	PERSON	's previous dramas are idealists of one sort and another .

		In
Wallenstein	PERSON	he recognizes the realist , a representative of a class to which the world belongs .

		This man must never appear really noble , and in no act of the play really great or full of dignity .

		Under the stress of necessity , he must try with shrewdness to hold his ground , but always without sacri - ficing himseK for the sake of lofty ideas .

		To effect the tragic shock , and awaken tragic pity through such a character , was the new task for
Schiller	ORGANIZATION	's art .

		His complaint to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, in the letter of
November 28 , 1796	DATE	, that destiny , in the proper sense of the word , still had too little , and
WaUenstein	ORGANIZATION	's own error too much , to do with his misfortune , has often been misunder - stood .

		Critics have quoted it to supjwrt weird theories as to
Schiller	PERSON	's idea of destiny .

		What he evidently meant , as Professor
Kiihnemann	PERSON	shows , was the need of substituting for the accidental clumsiness of the individual man the lofty , inner , unavoidable necessity of a life governed by fixed laws .

		Schdler 's aim in this drama is to present , in place of the splendor of eloquent details , a convincing picture of human life ; and in place of self - intoxication in soaring rhetoric , the tonic of simple concrete truth .

		His method is based consciously upon observation of Sophocles 's King -LRB- Edipus .

		He himseK calls it the method of tragic analysis .

		It consists in confining the visible action of the tragedy to an unfolding of the consequences of previous acts and occurrences .

		In
Wallenstein	PERSON	s Lager we have sharply individualized groups of characteristic soldiery , suggesting , in aU its fulness of life , color , and movement , the army .

		These jolly or quarrel - some , gambling , dancing , flirting , and carousing soldiers and hangers-on all appear in the per - spective of the mass to which they belong .

		The order of their appearance is chosen with consmnmate skiU , so as to give the semblance of reality .

		For the whole motley army of poly - glot troops , the as yet invisible commander-in - chief is the vicegerent of God on earth .

		Against their enthusiasm for him not even the fanatical preaching of the dull servants of the church is of any avail .

		It is a vivid genre picture , rival - ing the best work of the old Dutch masters , and furnisliing striking proof of the poet 's new skiU in objective delineation and in the dramatic use of masses of men .

		His success in this latter point is the fruit of an inborn tendency , shown
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 46 in all his earlier plays , under the discipline of in - tensive study of the Greeks and of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Schiller lays especial stress , in his study of
Wallenstein	PERSON	, upon the elements of history that mouldetl the man .

		In this , as Professor
Kiihne	PERSON	- mann urges , he differs radically from Shake - speare .

		The British poet would have focused attention throughout upon the demoniac nature of
Wallenstein	PERSON	's mind , -- upon the tragedy of unbridled , self - < lestructive ambition to rule .

		The surroundings of the man would have remained the xmaccented syllable .

		Schiller presents sym - bolically , through the general 's associates , that historical en ^ 4ronment under the influence of which
Wallenstein	PERSON	's temperament , self-confi - dence , ambition , and superstition succumb to temptation .

		Illo ,
Isolani	LOCATION	,
Buttler	PERSON	, and
Oktavio Piccolomini	ORGANIZATION	.

		each sharply individualized and pro ^ ^ ded \ ^ ` ith his o \ ^ ti philosophy of life , are chief among these associates .

		Each of them is in a sense a creature of the commander , em - bodying in characteristic fashion the demoniac principle of
WaUenstein	ORGANIZATION	's mind .

		Hence the hero of the tragedy is a sort of composite total of all these indi \ ` iduals .

		He is an organic part of that body of relations and influences , dominated by inmiutable laws , that is the destiny of man .

		His belief in astrology is the S -RCB- Tnbol of his o \* ti implicit confidence in the absolute necessity of things .

		But it is also a defect in his own nature , blinding him to the approach of his impending doom , that is plainly visible to everyone else .

		In this he resembles King -LRB- Edipus ; but while the Greeks conceivetl Destiny as a wholly super - human , inscrutable necessity , before which gods and men must bow ,
Schiller	PERSON	regards it as the unchanging regularity of the laws of life ^ sithout and within the uidi \ ` idual .

		Max and Thekla are the only idealists in the drama .

		They are bound to WaUenstein by ties of blood and affection .

		They reflect his emotional life , as the others reflect his iateUect and his ambition .

		In their uinocence and disinterestedness , they sym - bolize the Beautiful in human life .


Schiller	PERSON	's view as to the rightful place of the Beautiful and of Art in life , already expressetl in his phil - osophical \ NTitings , is hei-e dramatized .

		They are also a mirror in which the repulsive selfish - ness and faithlessness of the others , and the shadow of the approaching Nemesis , are seen .

		The transformation of their idyU into an elegy is part of the tragic catastrophe that over - whelms
Wallenstein	PERSON	.

		But
Schiller	PERSON	remained an idealist to the end of his life , and does not here imply , as Professor
Kiihnemann	PERSON	seems to think , that
Max	PERSON	and Thekla have no place in the world .

		What he does seem to imply is that a world of hard-lined realism and selfish stri ^ - ing , like that of
Wallenstein	PERSON	and his circle , whose one-sidedness excludes and crushes the idealists and the beautiful in life , is eo ipso a world of tragic catastrophes .

		We must pass over a wealth of suggestive and helpful discussion offered by our author in connection with this tragedy , and with the dramas of
Maria Stuart	PERSON	,
Die Jungfrau von Orleans	LOCATION	, Die
Braxit von Messina	PERSON	^
Wilhelm Tell	PERSON	, and with the important Demetrius frag - ment .

		The main feature of it all consists in tracing through these diverse materials and forms the substance of
Schiller	PERSON	's later concep - tion of human life , destiny , and dramatic style .

		From cover to cover , the book is fascinatingly \ ^ ` ritten .

		The author 's style is simple , flexible , and strong , but slightly marred by a few unne - cessary repetitions and infelicities of expression , that can easily be removed in a second edition .

		Its warm appreciation of the peculiarity of
Schiller	PERSON	's genius and intelligent insight into the essentials of good literature , ancient and mod - em , render it a worthy companion-piece to the same author 's Herder , and one of the most illu - minating and suggestive books yet written upon the greatest German dramatist .

		46 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, mustering of original and contemporary sources is a sufficient guarantee of inestimable worth , especially when an historian of our author 's tyjpe -- judicious , conscientious , and withal ac - curate -- has had the handling of them .

		The second war with
Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	occupied less than three years ; yet Captain
Mahan	PERSON	, pos - sibly because he is dealing with the history of his own country or because he is treading upon very familiar ground , has given it a propor - tionately larger amount of space than he gave his earlier themes .

		Precisely two-thirds of the first volume , or fourteen chapters of the entire work , are devoted to a discussion of the com - mercial complications that underlay the strug - gle , one chapter to a description of the theatre of operations and to a general criticism of the insufficiency of American resources , twelve chapters to the war itself , and a single chapter to a much abbreviated and rather superficial account of the peace negotiations .

		The material , except in the case of minor though contributory details , is not new , indeed much of it was sum - marized by Captain
Mahan	PERSON	himself in a series of articles -- advance sheets , so to speak -- that appeared two years ago in '' Scribner 's
Maga	PERSON	- zine '' ; but the presentation of it is so logical , so fascinatingly clear and unprejudiced , that the mi - pression conveyed is one of striking originality .

		The opening pages of the book have , in gxeat degree , the nature and scope of an introduction .

		They point out pre-revolutionary experiences and conditions as determining causes of later events , and in this they are extremely interest - ing .

		British thought with respect to maritime development presented , from
Cromwell	PERSON	's time down , a continuity that greatly impressed public opinion .

		A course of action long and successfully persisted in must perforce be right and just .

		Consequently the national consciousness never once swerved from the idea that the navy was the bxdwark of imperial power , and that , as it was recruited from the mercantile marine , the growth of the carrying trade must be a first considera - tion .

		The thirteen colonies had already shown commercial aptitude ; in the northeast they had developed shipping industries ; and now having obtained political independence , they were likely to prove formidable competitors in the naviga - tion of the world .

		It was necessary to curtail their opportunities .

		It was also necessary to fill in the gap that their revolution had made in the empire by developing the resources of other transatlantic dominions , particularly of
Canada	LOCATION	and the
West Indies	LOCATION	, whither the Tories whom loyalty had made exiles and to whom the home government felt somewhat indebted had found a refuge .

		Naturally enough , all measures having these things for their object were regarded with suspicion by the new republic .

		The provincial - ism that had formed a misconception of the pur - pose of the navigation laws was predisposed to designate the taking away of privileges enjoyed as colonists as a gross subversion of justice .

		Especial praise is due the author for that part of his book which deals with the more inunediate causes of the War of
1812	DATE	; for there he has with his accustomed impartiality placed the policy and conduct of
Great Britain	LOCATION	in proper perspective .

		This is a really strong point , a feature most distinctive .

		Other ^ vriters have usually regarded the irritating events of the period as instances of a lingering tyranny on the part of the mother country ; but Captain
Mahan	PERSON	has viewed them in their larger aspect , -- namely , in their relation to the Napoleonic wars .

		His treatment of the subject of Impress - ment is liighly conmiendable , due weight being given to the many extenuating circumstances .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	, the constant force of the succes - sive coalitions , was engaged in a life and death struggle with despotism .

		Her navy was her great , and alm6st her only , resource ; but the service in it was necessarily long and arduous and the pay was small .

		Desertions were ruin - ously frequent ; for across the
Atlantic	LOCATION	was a new country with all the economic advantages of a new country .

		British sailors , even before the Revolution , had manned its ships and knew of its facilities .

		Furthermore , there an easy naturalization system prevailed which was con - trary to all recognized principles of national allegiance .

		Nowhere , except in that infant com - mmiity , eager for settlers , had it yet been acknowledged that the power of expatriation resides in the individual .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	claimed the right to apprehend her own deserters ; but she never did claim the right to impress Ameri - can seamen .

		Cases of mistaken identity were , however , very nvmierous , owing to the fact that the people of the two countries , one in origin , were not yet distinguishable from each other by peculiarities of dress , speech , or mamiers .

		Brit - ish officers , moreover , greatly annoyed by a dis - graceful traffic in fraudident certificates of citizenship , were not inclined to take any great precautions against errors .

		In his strictures upon
Jefferson	PERSON	's policy of economy , seeming partiality for the French , and impotent measures of retaliation for national in - sidts , Captain
Mahan	PERSON	has been justly severe .

		Realizing that the
United States	LOCATION	was too much
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 47 engrossed in money-making , too much divided by conflicting sectional interests , and too much conti-olled by a peace-lo ^ nng president to take any chances in war .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	adopted with impimity such measures as woidd counteract the e ^ - il effects of the
Continental System	ORGANIZATION	, even though well aware that they woidd react dis - astrously upon neutrals .

		The only neutral of any consequence was the
United States	LOCATION	, and she was scarcely worth considering ; for
Jefferson	PERSON	's gunboat system had effectually prevented the growth of a regular na \ y .

		She might protest , but her protests were bound to be mere bluster .

		The wonder to us now is , that she could have so steadily drifted towards war and have made absolutely no preparation for it .

		Her embargo and non-intercourse laws failed of their object and operated against herself .

		Nothing could have been more to the purpose of
Napoleon	PERSON	than the American declaration of war in
1812	DATE	.

		Craft and subtlety had done their work .

		The pity of it aU was that the
United States	LOCATION	, griev - ously injured by both
France	LOCATION	and
Great Britain	LOCATION	, went to war with the wrong party .

		She , the exponent of liberty , had -- let us hope uninten - tionally -- played completely into the hands of the arch - < lespot .

		Napoleon , whose pretended revocation of the obnoxious decrees and con - temptible ante-dating to avoid a too glaring ex - posure of fraud and duplicity are all graphically narratetl by Captain
Mahan	PERSON	.

		It has been traditional in American history to consider the War of
1812	DATE	as a signal success for the aggrieved party .

		Opinions to the con - trary , although held by all first-class historians and supported by the best of evidence , have never reached the masses .

		There was no organ - ized warfare on the ocean , but the brilliancy of that on the Great Lakes and of single ship actions at sea has almost obscvired the real dis - asters on land .

		Upon the history - of hostilities proper .

		Captain
Mahan	PERSON	has probably said the last word .

		No one but a man rich in profes - sional experience could so ably deal with naval exploits .

		His criticisms of the army equipment are all well-substantiated , and his narrative bears close comparison with
Napier	PERSON	's ''
Peninsu	PERSON	- lar War . ''

		The sustained effort is , perhaps , not so great , but there is the same skill in dealing with technicalities , the same dramatic power in description .

		The whole is excellent reading .

		It is unfortunate that the final chapter of this really scholarly work is not in itself an impor - tant contribution to historical knowledge .

		We had every reason to expect considerable new light upon the negotiations at
Ghent	LOCATION	, and are disappointed that neither here nor in the
October	DATE	number of the `` American Historical Review '' has Captain
Mahan	PERSON	told us much more than we already knew about the influence upon them of European conditions .

		That it was great , we , although destitute of documentary evidence , feel pretty well assured .

		In no other way can we adequately explain
Great Britain	LOCATION	's change of front .

		The
United States	LOCATION	had practically ac - complished little by the war .

		The one thing she had set out to do she had failed in ; and
Great Britain	LOCATION	, relieved from embarrassment by the downfall of
Napoleon	PERSON	, was at first inclined to exact a humiliating peace .

		To what extent the attitude of the other Allied Powers or the transactions of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	com - pelled concessions is matter for conjecture .

		In point of literary merit , Captain
Mahan	PERSON	's latest extended production needs little comment .

		An occasional awkward or incomplete sentence occurs , but we notice this fact only because we dislike to see even so slight a blemish upon a style so nearly perfect .

		The index to the two volumes is not so good as it might be , but the table of contents is remarkably full .

		The dia - grams and maps are very instructive ; the illus - trations , lx -RRB- th half-tones and gravures , though few in nimiber , are in keeping with the general high character of the work ; and the half-tone portraits are all copies of authentic likenesses , some of them from paintings by

		Mr.
Harwood	PERSON	's praise of these things , and his eulogy of their creator , will strike some readers as excessive , and raise the suspicion that he also is a
Calif	LOCATION	ornian .

		It should be remembered , also , that Mr.
Burbank	PERSON	's triumphs are in kind hardly to be reckoned as new ; they are exactly in line with the work of all gardeners in all the centuries .

		Shakespeare teaches
Perdita	PERSON	to `` marry A gentler scion to the wildest stock , And make conceive a bark of baser kind By bud of nobler race . ''

		And Pliny tells us how , two thousand years ago , men '' in

		Peach trees have been known on occasion to bear apricots , and apricot trees to bear peaches ; and this without anybody 's suggestion .

		In fact , whence come all our cultivated grains and fruits ?

		Do these not represent the wise selec - tion and careful culture of scores of unknown gardeners all down along our ancestral way ?

		Mr.
Burbank	PERSON	's methods are not new , and to all the gardeners of the past is he indebted for the materials on which he has wrought his shining work .

		The diiference lies chiefly in the fact that our latest artist has carried his work so much further , and into imexpected fields ; that he experiments so much more widely , and on such a tremendous scale .

		Darwin called all this sort of work artificial , as opposed to natural , selec - tion ; Mr.
Burbank	PERSON	simply applies artificial selec - tion to hundreds of thousands of plants at one time , and then , by grafting , goes on to attain results much more speedily than has hitherto been done .

		Mr.
Burbank	PERSON	's work has been of the highest economic importance ; he has contributed largely to the wealth of his adopted State .

		But a great deal of his experimentation has had no com - mercial end in view ; he has been , in so far , a true investigator , seeking a better knowledge of the wondrous processes of the natural world .

		Much of his work , accordmgly , has scientific value .

		His successes and failures alike confirm or confute our accepted biologic theories .

		Does DeVries argue that species take origin in muta - tions , sudden departures from some supposed established type ?

Burbank	PERSON	will show him a thousand strange variations , nnitations , effected by cross-breeding ; do the supporters of

Santa Rosa	LOCATION	gardens seem to show an indiscriminate breaking up of all established characteristics of either species , as if in reversion to all the indefinite variations of the long history of the past .

		In the conduct of his experiments during these later years , Mr.
Burbank	PERSON	has largely consumed his own resources accumulated during long service as a professional nurseryman .

		For - tunately , however , for both science and hor - ticulture , the
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	for the promotion of research has lately come to his assistance , and experimentation may now go forward unhindered by embarrassment of any financial sort .

		.

		^ , volume about doubtless anticipated a piece oi au - tfie Phiiippiiies .

		thoritative work in Professor
F. W. Atkinson	PERSON	's book `` The Philippine Islands '' -LRB-
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	has had the best of oppor - tunities for observation .

		He was the fii ` st
General Superintendent of Education	ORGANIZATION	in the
Phllij	LOCATION	-RRB- pines ; and in the performance of his duties he was called upon to travel in almost every part of the Ai ` chipel - ago .

		In this way he was enabled to observe actual conditions at first-hand , while through his official position he was brought into direct contact with many Anerican officers and native leaders who knew of what they spoke .

		Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	's book , however , covers ground already made familiar by the reports of the
Philippine Commission	ORGANIZATION	, whUe it fails to touch upon those problems which are to-day central in the islands .

		Of a total of 412 pages , the author devotes about 100 to ancient Philippine his - tory and geography .

		Some 22 pages are then given to the history of the period 1896-1905 , but of these only about four pages -LRB- eliminating illustrations , and counting only actual type -RRB- describe matters relating to the American occupation .

		About 200 pages are occupied with climate , questions of public health , racial peculiarities , religion , etc. , after which there are 35 pages of routine description of our govern -
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 49 ment .

		The remainder of the book -- about 40 pages -- deals with Education .

		This latter section is by far the most valuable portion of the work , for here the writer has apparently felt at libertj ' to speak with somewhat less restraint than elsewhere , and to give expression to his own views .

		It is not an en - tirely hopeful outlook that he presents .

		He admits the lack of efficient native teachers , practically concetles that the American teachers who were first engaged were selected under conditions which made it hard to get the best results , and grants that industrial education has not been advanced to the point that insular interests require .

		However , he defends the policy of introducing English as a lan - g ^ nage of instruction - and maintains that the natives are anxious to learn it although the reasons assigned are chiefly the desire to hold office and to acquire the social position resulting from its use .

		In addi - tion , he favors the introduction of the language as a means of terminating the intellectual isolation of
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		The book as a whole , especially in its earlier portions , gives the impression of having often been read before , and follows with minute care the official view at almost every point Even the illustrations are the stock photographs which appear in all Philippine reports .

		IVIr .

		Atkinson , how - ever , is not whoUy able to maintain the optimistic attitude .

		In his conclusion , he points out that the civil government is still retarded by ladronism , while economic conditions have been greatly im - paired and '' unexpected weakness of character '' among some of the administrative officers has been a drawback to political confidence and advance - ment .

		In spite of all this .

		Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	maintains in his closing paragraph that * ' the outlook is bright for the Filipinos . ''

		though on what the observation is based does not fully appear from the book itself .

		There are few men whose life-story presents more of striking contraste and of the elements that lend interest to the telling than does that of
James G. Blaine	PERSON	; and it very appropriately opens the new series of `` Ameri - can Statesmen '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	.


Miffin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The au - thor , Mr.
Edward Stanwood	PERSON	.

		who had already won recognition for his editorial and historical work , does not approach his work as an academic task : he frankly states that he was an intimat * personal friend of ^ Ir .

		Blaine , and that he writes as one who believed in him and followed him .

		But he has shown so evident a desire to be fair in his discussion of the various bitter controversies that were waged around his chief , that we foUow him with interest and in the main with acceptance of his positions .

		It may not be out of place to say that the writer of this notice was one of those who left his party rather than vote for Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	, believing him to be an unfit man for the presidency ; but that he is now con - vinced that !

		Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	was charged with far more than he should have been charged with , and that the worst that can fairly be said of him is that his conduct in the financial transactions laid to him was A famotu Sepublican ttatetman .

		indelicate rather than dishonorable , while his life as a whole was actuated by real public spirit .

		The author takes up Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	's public life from his assimiption of the editorship of the '' Kennebec Journal '' in
1854	DATE	, at the age of twenty-four , and follows it through its various phases , local and national .

		But two other Americans have won such hearty personal allegiance to themselves and their fortimes as did Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	, and been the objects of such personal devotion .

		The '' Plumed Knight , '' as he was called by his enthusiastic followers , was for some fifteen years perhaps the foremost leader of the Republican party .

		He was a political leader of un - rivalled skill in attack and defense , a real statesman in some of his conceptions , a forcible speaker and a remarkable debater .

		He has in addition left behind him one historical work of great value .

		With all his successes , there were failures as great ; with his re - markable popularity , he encountered opposition such as almost no other public man has met .

		His career is well termed dramatic in its nature and develop - ment , and the present biographer has brought out skilfully its dramatic elements .

		Perhaps Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	's largest title to lasting fame lies in his work as Secre - tarj ' of
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		He led the way from the tradition ^ policy of isolation toward a new position of the
United States	LOCATION	in the affairs of the world , -- an im - perialist before the imperialism of these later days was even thought of .

		At that time his policy was criticised by the average conservative citizen as dangerous , though we have now actually gone much further in the direction that Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	merely dreamed of ; but he was the pioneer in the change , and in this and other ways he influenced the general tendency of the political thought of his countrymen .

		`` When a President of the
United States	LOCATION	presents for public inspection a book written by himself , the read - ing world may be expected to open it with keen curiosity , whatever the subject which it treats .

		President
Roosevelt	PERSON	's latest work , `` Outdoor Pas - times of an American Hunter '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is mainly a compilation of magazine articles and monographs which have appeared from time to time upon one of his favorite topics , American wild game and the pursuit and study thereof .

		Of the eleven chapters that make up the book , two -- `` A
Colorado	LOCATION	Bear - Hunt '' and '' Wolf-Coursing '' -- relate his experi - ences upon his outing last
Sprihg	PERSON	; the one entitled `` With the Cougar Hoimds '' details his adventures during his previous
Colorado	LOCATION	hunting-trip , in
1901	DATE	; '' Wilderness Reserves '' is devoted largely to the Yellowstone outing .

		These four chapters are com - paratively new : the concluding chapter , '' At Home , '' is quite so .

		The other chapters , aside from the one entitled ' * Books on Big Game , '' have been in circu - lation some time as monographs upon the deer fam - ily , but have been considerably revised for the purposes of the present volume .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's style is , as usual , practical and prosaic , almost un - imaginative .

		But the volume is well-nigh cyclo - Pretident Rootevelt at a hunter .

		50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, psedic upon the ground it covers .

		The author gathers large stores of information , and does not jump at conclusions .

		He is scrupulous as to the accuracy of the smallest details , paying as much at - tention to ascertaining the correct name of the tiniest bird that flits before him as to following the trail of the bear or cougar .

		In giving details of the actual chase and killing of the mountain lion , he includes much interesting matter regarding the habits of this animal and of the bob-cat , the character of the country hunted over , and the animal and plant life found there .

		Frequently throughout the book , and especially in his chapter upon the Yellowstone Park , Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	emphasizes the need for more national reserves , wherein nature shall be protected and the extermination of animal life prevented ; he urges forcefully that the Grand Canyon of the
Colorado	LOCATION	be made a national park .

		The chapter upon ' '' ` Books on Big Game '' wUl be foimd valuable to both the sportsman and the bibliophile .

		In the final chapter , `` At Home , '' the President gives a genial account of the out-door life of himself and family at Saga - more Hill , their excursions and their pets , and the wild creatures of
Long Island	LOCATION	.

		The volume is pro- fusely illustrated from photographs , and is dedicated to the veteran naturalist ,
John Burroughs	PERSON	.

		Pictures of There are few places of historic in - eourt life under terest which demand so much of the Louts XIV .

		visitor as
Versailles	LOCATION	.

		Many travel - lers are disappointed at seeing there nothing but an endless succession of rooms and miles of historical paintings .

		They are unable to look at the chateau and the park as the magnificent if somewhat tar - nished frame of a vanished picture , the court and government of the old Bourbon monarchy .


Bae	ORGANIZATION	- deker , in a few paragraphs , can not set them right .

		To such persons , Mr.
James Eugene Farmer	PERSON	's ``
Versailles	LOCATION	and the Court under Louis XIV . ''

		-LRB-
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- offers an opportunity of really understanding the place .

		The book wiU be of even greater interest to many who already know Ver - sailles , but wish to recall in detail the figures that once peopled these empty rooms and corridors .

		The book is arranged conveniently .

		The first two parts describe the chateau and the park , giving the his - tory and the use of the principal apartments and promenades .

		The description is enlivened by anec - dotes of the incidents which rendered each spot famous .

		The mixture of information and of enter - taining gossip is uniformly judicious , and as one passes from room to room , instead of feeling an in - creasing sense of weariness , one 's cm-iosity is piqued , and one wanders on further and further .

		In the third and fourth parts are described the king and the principal personages of his court .

		`` Here , as in the earlier portions of the volume , Mr.
Farmer	PERSON	has enriched his descriptions with long passages from
Saint Simon	PERSON	or from other writers of memoirs .

		The translations of
Saint Simon	PERSON	are so well chosen that for the ordinary reader they will serve the double purpose of informing him about
Louis XIV	PERSON	, and of showing this incomparable writer to the best advantage , -- that is to say , at
Versailles	LOCATION	, among the persons he commented upon with such delight - ful though occasionally damaging frankness .

		Prob - ably the most striking part of the whole picture is the mechanism of court life and the wonderful eti - quette which made it run smoothly .

		Altogether , this is an entertaining and instructive book , although devoid of pretension to profound interpretations of the
Age of Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ripe and mellow are the chapters AZZiZtT `` f M ^ - J ```` l S ^ ^ ^ ton 's `` Persons and Places , '' issued in a small illustrated volume by the
Broadway Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		His reminiscences are chiefly of the Augustan age of American literature .

		Concord and a few of the
Concord	LOCATION	writers receive most prominent mention , and it is plain that the hermit of
Walden	PERSON	is a prime favorite of his .

		One is much surprised to learn that , with all his admiration for
Emerson	PERSON	, whom he early met in person , and for other
New England	LOCATION	celebrities , Mr.
Benton	PERSON	had never until two years ago set foot in eastern
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Besides memories of a talk with
Emerson	PERSON	, whom the author as a youth drove thirty miles to hear lecture , the book gives recollections of
Horace Greeley	PERSON	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
C. N. Bovee	PERSON	, and
P. T. Barnum	PERSON	, and also chapters on
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Bryant	PERSON	, and '' Some American Hu - morists '' of half a century ago .

		Bostonians will be pleased with the compliment paid to
Boston	LOCATION	man - ners , on the street and in the street cars .

		The critical essay on
Bryant	PERSON	's poetry animadverts gently on the predominant '' sepulchral '' element therein ; but in calling
Bryant	PERSON	's style `` ponderous '' the author has perhaps not chosen the best word .

		Serious , often solemn , and even mortuary , it certainly is , but too exquisitely finished and musical - to be exactly ponderous .

		A couplet from
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Vision of Sin '' is given as '' Every minute dies a man , every minute one is born , '' which the essayist incidentally calls `` an extreme understatement of the actual fact . ''

		The true reading , with '' moment '' for '' minute , '' is not open to this criticism .

		Writing largely of things a part of which he was and nearly all of which he saw , Mr.
Benton	PERSON	can by no means be accused of producing merely the echo of an echo .

		Amonjj the eminent lawyers who Addresses from .

		° , ^ ^ p a lawyer 's during the past half-century have busy life .

		honored the bar of
New York City	LOCATION	by their sterling character and public spirit , few have deserved greater respect than the late
Frederic Ren ^ Coudert	PERSON	, a volume of whose addresses have just been offered to the public by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		Mr.
Coudert	PERSON	's way was to do the duty before him , and this did not bring it in his scope to lay the foundations for a place in literature that would last after his work in the flesh was done .

		His addresses were only occasional incidents in a very busy and very useful life , -- twenty-one in number dm ` ing a period of over a quarter of a century ; and five of
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 51 these were delivered in a single year ,
1873	DATE	, in a course before the
Catholic Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		We could wisli , then , that the introductory note , signed P. F. -LRB-
Paul Fuller	PERSON	, we presume -RRB- had been expanded into some - thing like an adequate biography .

		Mr.
Coudert	PERSON	was a man of broad and deep ciUture , thoroughly acquainted with the literatm ' e of
France	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	, and possessing a lucid , graceful , and effec - tive English style .

		It will be remembered that he was employed as counsel for the
United States	LOCATION	in the Belu'ing Sea Arbitration , and also in the
Venezuela Boundary	LOCATION	controversy .

		He was honored , too , with the offer of a position on the bench of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, but declined the honor .

		One finds in his addresses constant evidence of his charming per - sonality , of which we are told in the introductory note , '' His was indeed a blithesome spii'it , ever hovering a little above the dulness of our common traffic ; a kindly heart , ever a little aloof from the bitterness of daily strife , \ newing the failings of his fellows through the softening haze of an enduring sympathy . ''

Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, of whom we think after reading Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	's life of that woi-thy in the ' `` English Men of Let - ters '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Letters are quoted at length , written by this faithful representative to his constituents , and very little is said of the poetry upon which his reputation rests .

		It is not as if his literary work were the du-ect outcome of his politi - cal , for his lyrics , his best work , were written before he entered the Commons .

		It is only with reference to his satires that his political work is important ; but in this book
Marvell	PERSON	's politics are treated as of gi'eater import than his poetry .

		Some rather gen - eral criticism is given in the opening and closing chapters , and the reader is then referred to the ex - cellent and cheap edition in ' `` The Muses ' Library '' for the poems themselves ; but no serious apprecia - tion is attempted , either in relation to
Marvell	PERSON	's work considered absolutely or with reference to his con - temporaries .

		It woiUd have been worth while to treat MarveU with one eye upon the fantastic fol - lowers of
Donne	PERSON	and the other upon the pure lyr - ists of the period .

		In other words , we should have been very glad to have Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	's views on the poetry of MarveU , even if they were merely jier - sonal .

		The series to which the volume belongs is as much critical as biographical , and
Marvell	PERSON	is known to us to-dav more as a lyrist than as the Member for Hull . ''

		Miss
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	has departed in a convent from her accustomed field of essay - writing long enough to produce a book of charming autobiographical tales , called '' In our Convent Days '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is needless to say that these tales , slight as they are in form and matter , woiUd hardly have succeeded in making Miss Repplier 's name mean what it does in American literatm-e if they had come earlier in her career .

		But , Miss Repplier being known as she is , and for what she is , the stories of '' Marriage Vows , '' `` The Game of Love , '' `` In Reti-eat , '' and '' Reverend Mother 's Feast , '' suggesting some of the early influences which have led to the creation of some of our best essays , are of a peculiar and per - sonal interest .

		From their subject , they invite com - parison with Miss
Elizabeth Jordan	PERSON	's `` Tales of a Convent '' ; but MLss
Jordan	PERSON	's stories are more gen - erally himian , and better stories , ^ er se , -- although there is no one of them superior in poetic charm to the accoimt of the Archbishop 's visit as described in `` Un Congfe sans Cloche . '' '

		* In Our Convent Days '' gains in interest from the fact that besides the real Agnes the book contains the experiences of a real
Elizabeth	PERSON	, now well known as Mrs.
Elizabeth Robins Pennell	PERSON	.

		Biographies '' -LRB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , we find a life of Admiral Farragut , writ - ten by Mr.
John R. Spears	PERSON	.

		This series of war - hero biographies is announced as impartial because Southern subjects have been assigned to
Southern	ORGANIZATION	writers and
Northern	ORGANIZATION	subjects to
Northern	ORGANIZATION	writers .

		A life of Farragut is scarcely a fair test of this sup - * posed preventive against sectional bias ; but it gives the author opportunity to describe the services of the distinguished American admiral in a fair and ra - tional manner .

		Facts , well authenticated , occupy the space that is usually given to mere eulogy in small biographies .

		Equally praiseworthy is the avoidance of discussion of naval controversies .

		Farragut 's ac - tion in taking possession of
New Orleans	LOCATION	by force , his futile expedition up the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and the dramatic passing of the forts on
Mobile Bay	LOCATION	, are described without attempts at criticism or justifica - tion .

		Numerous maps and plans of battles illustrate the text .

		The author contributes , as he says , one unknown chapter to history , in that upon the war upon the
West India	LOCATION	pirates between
1819	DATE	and
1823	DATE	.

		He finds that these pirate ships , which have been supposed to be French , were in reality predatory vessels fitted out in the
United States	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	to prey upon Spanish commerce under the flags of Spanish-American insurgents .

		In its entirety , this biogi-aphy of four hundred pages may be classed among the best books of its kind .

Dawson	PERSON	is the author chapters on of a remarkably readable and intel - yreatnoveiitts .

Fleming H. ReveU Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a series of twenty chapters he dis - cusses the chief English novelists , from
Defoe	PERSON	to
Stevenson	PERSON	, adding a few remarks upon American novelists , a brief essay on * ' Religion in Fiction , '' and a concluding survey of the whole subject .

		The discussion is trenchant , the style pithy , and the judgment pronounced is usually temperate and sound .

		An occasional statement may strike us as 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, a rhetorical exaggeration , but in the main the criti - cism is intelligent and compact .

		The book is quite as much a history of English fiction -LRB- with certain lacunae -RRB- as it is a series of studies of individual writers , for the author is careful to indicate connecting links , and to follow the development of tendencies .

		The discussion does substantial justice to such authors as
George Eliot	PERSON	and Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, which is a pretty fair test of the balance of a critic of Mr.
Dawson	PERSON	's profession .

		We like particularly well the chapters on
Kingsley	PERSON	,
Reade	PERSON	, and Mr.
Meredith	PERSON	, and wish that we might also have had a chapter on
Bulwer	PERSON	, who is certainly deserving of one .

		The grouping of the familiar per - sons and events in new combinations can not fail to suggest some interesting reflections .

		Mr.
Helm	PERSON	has evidently had long and intimate acquaintance with
Balzac	ORGANIZATION	's people , and when general questions touch - ing the great novelist 's work and art present them - selves to him , his memory provides him at once with a series of pertinent illustrations .

		Mr.
Helm	PERSON	's method furnishes us with a number of unpretentious chats , that commend themselves by intelligence and * discrimination , and move in the middle region of appreciation between fanatical zeal and grudging recognition .

		Wouderfid doings with soap-bubbles , tops , and kites are described by Mr.
Meredith Nugent	PERSON	in his '' New Games and Amusements , '' published by Messrs. Double - day ,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		If a boy could really do all these things by following the directions given , he might pose as a veritable wizard among his fellows .

		But our own boyish recollections prompt us to anticipate for him a fair proportion of failures .

		However , the book is dis - tinctly novel in the suggestions offered , and is thus a pleasuig departure from its type , for most books of this sort are a rehash of their predecessors , and are filled with the time-worn tricks that a modern boy would scorn to occupy his time with .

		Mr.
Francis W. Halsey	PERSON	has done a real service to lit - erature in reprinting the first American edition -LRB- 1794 -RRB- of ``
Charlotte	LOCATION	Temple : A Tale of Truth , '' by Mrs.
Susanna Haswell Rowson	PERSON	.

		This moving tale of senti - ment has probably had more readers than any other work of fiction ever printed in this comitry ; it is still reprinted in cheap form , and the editor has collected over a hundred editions .

		This constant reprinting has resulted in a corruption of the text so great that Mr.
Halsey	PERSON	has found , by actual count ,
1265	DATE	errors in the best current edition .

		The work belongs to American literature , both because its scene is laid in this country , and because the author lived in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	for eight years of her early life , and then , retiu-ning later , was an actress and a teacher for her last thirty years or more .

		Mr.
Halsey	PERSON	has given liis edition a very thorougli equipment of historical aud bibliographical matter .

		THE DIAL 53 The recent award of the Nobel prize of 840,000 to the
Baroness Bertha von Suttner	PERSON	for her famous peace novel , '' Die WafFen Nieder , '' has so renewed popidar interest in the book that
Messrs. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish at once a new edition of their English transla - tion , bearing the title `` Ground Arms ! ''

Toronto	LOCATION	, send us the '' Speeches and Addresses , Political , Literary , and Re - ligious , '' of the Hon.
John Charlton	PERSON	, for thirty-two years a member of the
Canadian Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		They represent the public utterances of a man whose life has been a part of the history of

		Under the circumstances , a few brief remarks must take the place of the more extensive treatment that we would gladly have accorded to his distinguished career .

		The work of organization done by President

		He created a great imiversity system , in some respects the most compre - hensive in the entire country , kept it in working order , provided for its progressive development as the means became available , and left it as the lasting monument of his tireless energy and his arduous devotion to its cause .

		His personality inspired the confidence which placed large sums of money at his command , sums which were not solicited by him , as he frequently took pains to declare , but which were offered freely by friends of the institution .

		The principal , although by no means the only , source of this support was of such a nature as to expose both the institution and its executive head to a great deal of Ul-mannered criticism from the public press , and the burden thus unjustly laid upon President
Harper	PERSON	's shoulders was heavier than most people realized .

		That he bore it patiently and uncom - plainingly , even when it far exceeded the bounds per - missible in legitimate discussion , offers one of the finest illustrations of his eharacter .

		Another illustration is offered by the cordial relations which he maintained with his colleagues .

		Given a giant 's power by the confidence of his board of trustees , he knew how tyrannous it woidd be to use that power like a giant , and thus saved a situation which , as may be seen in the example of certain other institutions and executives , might easily have become critical .

		The conditions of his office made him the embodiment of that one-man power which is to-day the chief menace of our university life , but pride and arrogant self-seeking were so alien to his nature that he did not exercise the power in an offensive way .

		He never took the attitude of a superior being , but deferred readily to the opinions of his colleagues , and did not think of embarking upon any important new policy without first gaining the support of the faculty .

		His example in this respect might pro- fitably be imitated in other quarters .

		Besides the adverse criticisms already alluded to , attacks of another kind were constantly made upon him , and were met with the same admirable equanimity .

		The dreadful mistake of gi ^ - ing to the
University	ORGANIZATION	, by means of its charter , a sectarian label , was so minimized in its consequences by the President 's broadness of view as to bring no practical impairment to the efficiency of the institution .

		Yet for this he suffered a persistent on - slaught from the sectarian bigotry which thought it intolerable that freedom of opinion should characterize the life of a school thus designated by a '' theological trade-mark .

		But no fact is more evident to those who have known the
University	ORGANIZATION	intimately than that it has always stood unswervingly in letter and in spirit for the highest ideal of academic freedom .

		No theological test was ever applied to teacher or student ; no disability was ever laid upon either by reason of private opinion or public utterance .

		It would not be proper to close even so brief a char - acterization as the present without saying a word about President
Harper	PERSON	's last year .

		During that year he was under sentence of death , and almost constantly the victim of severe physical suffering .

		Yet this condition , which would have disheartened most men , and weak - ened the spirit of their labors , served only to arouse him to a renewed determination to accomplish all that might humanly be accomplished before the light failed .

		He continued tranquilly at his appointed tasks , and illustrated throughout his remaining days the truth of
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	's noble saying : ''
Homo	PERSON	liber de nulla re minus quam de morte cogitat . ''

		He thus vindicated the free - dom of his own spirit as he had before championed the spirit of academic freedom .

		Few men have been so tried , and far fewer have so well borne the test .

		It is safe to say that whoever watched his brave struggle with the ancient enemy of mankind came to feel , what - ever had been felt before , a redoubled admiration for the qualities of essential manhood that were then for the first time fullv revealed .

		BRIEFER MENTION 96 NOTES 97 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS ... 98 LIST OF NT : W BOOKS 99 THE LIBRARY IN THE SCHOOL .

		The effort to bring public libraries into coop - erative relations with public schools , which had its tentative beginnings about a quarter of a cen - tury ago , has since that time steadily progressed until the work of the teacher has gained numer - ous points of contact with the work of the libra - rian , and both schools and libraries have been benefited by the work .

		In many places , teachers are given special facilities for obtaining the books they need in their classrooms , and pupils are en - couraged to become card-holders at the libraries .

		Sometimes delivery stations are established in the schools themselves ; while in the libraries , special rooms are invitingly fitted up for the use of children , and special attendants provided to meet their peculiar needs .

		This is the briefest kind of summary of an extension of library activity that has accom - plished many good results , and may be expected to accomplish many more .

		But no amount of effort of this description can absolve the school from the duty of having a library of its own , and of enlisting library intelligence to put the books to their proper use .

		Now schools do not . ''

		as a rule , perform their duty in this respect , and their failure to perform it constitutes one of the most obvious present defects in their manage - ment .

		It is the purpose of the present article to indicate in rotigh outline what the schools ought to do , and what the friends of public education ought to insist upon until the needed reforms are secured .

		What we shall say will apply mainly to schools of higher grade , because elementary schools can not do very much in this direction .

		They can encourage a taste for read - ing good books of the juvenile class , and can see that such are made obtainable : they can also give children some elementary instruction in the use of books for study .

		For these purposes a few works of reference and a carefully-chosen circulating library shovdd suffice .

		But when the high-school years are reached , a far more thorough-going plan should be adopted .

		A general idea of what that plan should be , and some notion of its points of application to the ordinary high-school course of study , will be given in the present discussion .

		74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, A concrete example will serve to indicate our point of view .

		We have just now in mind one of the largest and newest high schools in one of our largest cities .

		It is a school occupying half of a city block , and costing upwards of a quar - ter of a
million dollars	MONEY	.

		It is a school providing an extensive variety of courses in mathematics , natural science , ancient and modern languages , history and literature , besides the courses in those so-called '' commercial '' subjects with which so many of our schools have been equipped of late years by way of a concession to the demand for what is hastily assumed to be a '' practical '' form of education .

		Now a full third of the space of the school -- practically one whole floor out of the three -- is set apart for the labora - tories in which are taught the courses in physi - ography , biology , physics , and chemistry .

		One small room constitutes the library , a room that will accommodate about thirty students at a time , and will hold barely twenty-five himdred volumes !

		Nor does this school offer a very ex - ceptional case .

		Many other high schools of its kind are in existence , or are now being built upon the same lopsided plan , and it is time to make an energetic protest in behaK of the cultural subjects and the proper provision for their pursuit .

		School authorities have become so used to this state of thmgs that they do not stop to think how absurd it is .

		Roughly speaking , we may say that the work of a typical high school falls into five classes , approximately equal in the amount of attention they receive .

		One of these five classes is the natural science group , another is the foreign language group , another is the his - tory group , and another is the English language and literature group .

		The fifth group is a mis - cellaneous assemblage to which everything else may be relegated .

		Now the all-important thing to be noted is that the library must be the labora - tory of two entire groups besides parts of others , or of fully one-half of the entire work done by students of the school .

		Yet in the tyjDical case we have outlined , the natural science group alone has something like twenty times the laboratory space assigned -LRB- in the library room -RRB- to the far larger group of the studies wliich are best called humanities .

		The disproportion between bread and sack in
Falstaff	LOCATION	's tavern score is the only parallel worthy of the occasion .

		We woidd not be taken as grudging in any way the most liberal provision of appliances for the teaching of science .

		In the endeavor to rescue education from the grasp of text-book rou - tine , scientific studies presented the first phase of the difficulty to be attacked , because their need of such rescue was the most urgent .

		To teach physics and chemistry from books alone , or with the aid of a few demonstrations by the mstructor , was a farcical proceeding , and it is an undoubted gain to have substituted therefor a more rational method .

		But that difficidty has been coped with , and now hardly exists .

		The urgent problem of the present is to provide the means for teaching history and literature by the direct use of their materials ; that is , to substi - tute the easy use of many books for the hard memorizing of one .

		Our schools are only just beginning to grapple with this problem , and its solution will not be reached untd the same meas - ure of facilities is afforded in this group of studies as it has long been taken for granted must be afforded in the scientific gi-oups .

		In other words , the teaching of history and literatirre must be carried on in a weU-equipped library , with constant use of the authorities , with the setting of tasks that can not be performed with - out the student 's own correlation of many printed sources of information , and with the kind of in - telligent guidance that can alone be given by the instructor who is himseK familiar with the methods and materials of historical and literary investigations .

		To bring about this desired result a school must have a library in which at least one-half of the class-work in history and literature may be done .

		The library must be large enough to acconunodate aU the classes that need to use it , which means that the space it occupies should be approximately equal to the space now occu - pied by the combined laboratories .

		It must be provided with many books , and often with many copies of the same book , wliich is quite as neces - sary a tiling to do as to provide many microscopes for students of biology and many balances for students of chemistry .

		And it must have a gen - erous appropriation for its maintamance , which means that the total sum annually available for school supplies ought to be apportioned about equally between library and laboratories .

		It is a matter of the barest justice that as much money should be spent upon books as upon biological supplies and chemical glassware and reagents .

		We believe that the most important thing now to be done for the improvement of our secondary education is to develop the human - istic studies upon the lines here suggested , and to make of the library the chief centre of the school 's activity .

		A school can do nothing more valuable than thus to accustom its students to the intelligent '
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 handling of books .

		The watchword of the last generation was an appeal to get away from hooks and into direct contact with things .

		This was justifiable in so far as it meant the getting away from text-books , and into contact with the real materials of knowledge , and the ap - peal has been fully vindicated in the case of the scientific subjects .

		Now in the case of history and literature , it must be remembered , the books themselves are the things -- not the student 's own text-book , which may here be as much of an obstacle or a nvdsance as it was in the other case , but the books that are used for investigation , for comparison , for criticism , and for the training of judgment and logical facidty .

		There is no respect in which work done with books in this sense may not prove as effective for the ultimate purposes of education as work done ^ ith the microscope and the balance .

		We regard this as an imderstatement of the truth , and would not hesitate to make a much larger claim .

		Furthermore , when we consider how much the education that is continued after schooltime is over depends upon the right use of books , we can hardly be too emphatic in asserting that something of that use should be learned in the school .

		Yet almost nothing of the sort really is learned .

		The average student in a high school does not know the difference between a table of contents and an index , does not know what a con - cordance is , does not know how to find what he wants in an encyclopaedia , does not even know that a dictionary has many other uses besides that of supplying definitions .

		Still more pitiful is his naive assumption that a book is a book , and that what book it is does not paiiicularly mat - ter .

		It is the commonest of all experiences to hear a student say that he has got a given state - ment from a book , and to find him quite inca - pable of naming the book .

		That the source of his information , as long as that information is printed somewhere , should be of any conse - quence , is quite surprising to him , and still more the suggestion that it is also his duty to have some sort of an opinion concerning the value and credibility of the authority he thus blindly quotes .

		If the school library .

		and the instruction given in connection with it , shovdd do no more than impress these two elementary principles upon the minds of the whole student body , it woiJd go far towards accovmting for itself as an educational means .

		That it may , and shoidd , do much more than this is the proposition that we have sought to maintain , and we do not see how its essential reasonableness may be gainsaid .

		FIELD LIBR ARIES .

		Every civilized nation has learned that education pays on the material side as well as on the higher plane .

		No wise statesman dares neglect it .

		Our free schools reach the remotest hamlet .

		Indeed , distri - bution of schools has been overdone , and like other states
New York	LOCATION	finds that many of its 11,000 school districts could wisely be consolidated ; for it would often be cheaper to transport the children from two or more of the weakest districts to a better school , than to attempt to support so many different buildings and teachers .

		Whatever the method , no intelligent man denies that every home must be reached with educational facifities .

		This education is for the young , in school , and for a limited course .

		It is of priceless importance , and well worth the many mUlions paid for it yearly .

		But there is another means of education quite as important , not for the young alone but for all , to be had at home instead of in school , and lasting not for a short course but through life .

		For this the term • • home education '' has wisely been chosen to differentiate it from school education , which is obtained not at home but in regular teaching insti - tutions .

		The problems of home education are com - paratively new .

		There is great lack both of men and money for its work .

		We must choose from many possible plans those that will give the best practical results from limited resources .

		In a comprehensive view of home education we find five distinct factors : libraries , museums , clubs , extension teaching , and tests and credentials .

		Of these any competent stu - dent is sure to find fibraries easily the most important , efl & cient , and economical , and the natiuul centre for the other four agencies .

		The growing recognition of this fact is shown by more than a hundred new laws concerning fibraries passed in
America	LOCATION	, and 402 gifts , made from private resources , aggregating 816,000.000 , in a single recent year .

		There has been nothing in educational history equal to this modern bbrarj ' movement .

		It has the most support and the least opposition , the most Uberal grants by taxpayers , the most generous gifts from philanthro - pists .

		We are astounded to find how much has been done for this side of education , but more astounded when we study deeper to see how fittle of what is needed has as yet been accomplished .

		We spend fabulous sums each year and are proud of oiu - sta - tistics , but we reach only a small proportion of those who most need help .

		Any observer who looks below the surface finds many houses in both city and coun - try where no good books are bought or read .

		Some people read nothing ; some only newspapers , and these often the poorest rather than the best ; some read magazines , good , poor , or indifferent ; but the number of book readers is pathetically small .

		There are some whole villages where not half a dozen of the best books find their way .

		There are coUegjes where the amount of the best reading outside the prescribed text-books is startfingly restricted .

		Stu - dents are too busy with required studies and other 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, duties , and as a result are graduated and sent out to swell the army of non-readers , though the reading habit would have been worth to them more than all the learning of their college text-books .

		We have learned that in education as in farming new soil gives the largest crops .

		A given amount of effort does double good when spent on the young rather than on adults .

		Profiting by this knowledge , we give more attention than ever before to the needs of children .

		Special rooms , and librarians naturally fitted and trained for assisting children , are being added to the best libraries .

		Home libra - ries reaching little groups `` with books and a friend '' are sowing good seed , but there is not more than one where a thousand are needed .

		The wise farmer who has more land than he can work properly looks over his territory and selects for first attention that which promises best returns .

		As we look over the library field ripe for the harvest on every side , we find the greatest need at present in the rural sec - tions .

		A little over haK of our people live in the country .

		They have a larger margin of leisure , fewer distractions , and fewer opportunities to get the best reading .

		They read more slowly and care - fully , and get more good from books tha ^ i their high - pressure city cousins , whose crowded lives leave little time for intellectual digestion .

		These facts are un - questioned , and one would think that philanthropists wishing to do the greatest good with a given sum of money would look to the country , rather than to the town where large numbers in a small territory make it easy to support public libraries .

		One might fairly expect that more than half the gifts for books and libraries would go to that half of the people who by common consent have most leism ' e for reading and fewest opportunities to get books ; but instead of hav - ing their pro rata share , which woidd have been about 52 per cent. , an analysis of the 402 gifts of a recent year aggregating
$ 16,000,000	MONEY	shows less than
one per cent	MONEY	, devoted to this rural reading .

		The explanation is doubtless that attention has never been properly called to the facts , and that the solu - tion is not obvious .

		A rich man who wishes to im - prove the reading of his fellows can build a library or stock it with books in a city , but he hardly knows how to reach rural homes even if he understands their pressing needs .

		As a partial solution of the problem , we started our
New York State	ORGANIZATION	system of travelling books , pictures , and collections , in
1892	DATE	.

		Remarkable re - sults have been secured , and the system , still growing rapidly , has been gradually but generally accepted as a permanent factor in education .

		A community which is too small , or which thinks itself too smaU , to own and support a public library may thus feel free to accept , for a small fee for transportation , a hundred of the choicest books for six months .

		Novelty has then worn off .

		A library , like a res - ervoir , becomes stagnant , and the interest of readers can be maintained only by adding new books at frequent intervals , or by changing the entire libra - ries in the travelling system .

		Thus the same books move on from point to point till they are actually worn out in service , giving larger returns for each doUar invested than has ever been found possible in any other field .

		This method , one of the most valuable in modern librarianship , does the greatest good at moderate cost .

		It is easy to devise ways of doing good , but most of them cost too much to be practicable .

		It is easy to devise inexpensive plans , but most of them are not effective .

		To secure efficiency at low cost is the great problem in all educational , religious , or philanthropic work .

		You may compel your horse to go to the water , but he will drink only if he wishes it .

		The best library , either jjermanent or travelling , is of little use to the man who will not read .

		It is well worth all it costs to supply books to those who are hungry for them , but we must not neglect the underlying problem of creating the appe - tite .

		Our system is not a complete success until it reaches most of the people for whom it was planned .

		The inexorable law of circulation , which applies to a community as much as to the blood , has taught us that we can not safely ignore the submerged tenth .

		Five Points filth may beget Fifth Avenue fever .

		Their folly may cause our funeral .

		If there is a cancer in the foot the poison will circulate to the heart and brain .

		A town is not safe because it has sewer mains through every street if the residents fail to connect their houses with them .

		Schoolhouses and teachers do not educate if the children stay away .

		Boards of health may compel reckless citi - zens to connect their houses with the sewer system , truant officers may enforce compulsory education laws , but statutes can not help us in our equally press - ing need of inducing people to read the best books .

		As in war and manufacturing , it is the man behind the machine or method that determines its efficiency .

		Much good is done by making books readily avail - able .

		The taste of readers improves by reading even without guidance , but the best results demand that behind the library 's books there shall be an earnest human soul , whose chief concern is to make other lives better and more useful , tlirough the influ - ence best exerted by good reading .

		The visitor in our little home libraries who meets once a week with the children , to give needed help ; the reference libra - rian , now so prominent a factor in the best libraries ; and the children 's librarian , one of the best of the new special workers , -- these are all practical recog - nitions of the fact that no magnificence of buildings , wealth of resourses and endowments , excellence of catalogues and indexes , or liberality of hours and rules , can ever take the place of the trained expert who is at heart the reader 's sympathetic friend .

		Such a helper may change the whole course of a life by giving the experimental reader confidence and stimulating interest at the first short interview .

		The man or boy who has been spending his evenings lounging about the country store or saloon and doubtfully tries the experiment of going to the library instead , should be handled with as much skill as the trout that approaches the bait , for he is
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 as easily frightened away .

		He needs a sympathetic helping hand across the stepping-stones of an un - tried stream .

		The range of books is vast .

		The new reader needs not only books , but a friend .

		A coun - try boy , who has never seen the city , dropped at night in the Grand Central station of
New York	LOCATION	may have skill and self-reliance enough to find his way safely , but he is infinitely better off if a friend meets him .

		In our best large libraries the reference and children 's librarians perform these functions , for the constituency is large enough to justify the expense .

		How are we to give at practical cost similar help to these scattered readers in rural homes who need it even more ?

		Obviously no one small community can afford to pay for the whole time of a competent guide to books and reading .

		The itinerant principle offers a solution .

		The travelling book must be supplemented by the trav - elling librarian , who can give a day or two each week or month to the locality too small to afford his entire time .

		The economic principle is sound .

		Hun - dreds of thousands of commercial travellers prove that business men find the itinerant principle the cheapest and best way to get their wares into com - munities too small to support a permanent store or agent .

		The missionary who has seven stations to each of which he gives one day a week , the judge who moves from point to point to hold his court , the orchestra or company who give only one or more entei-tainments in places too small to support a per - manent organization , illustrate the universal appli - cation of the principle which we must adopt in order to get best results at least cost .

		The commercial traveller does his best work only when he can carry Ms samples with him .

		People need object lessons .

		The travelling librarian must have with him a considerable collection of books for his house-to-house and individual work .

		He can do much good by gathering those interested in schoolhouses or churches for an evening talk , stimu - lating interest and good resolutions and giving help - ful suggestions ; but when he sits down with the family or an individual to talk about personal read - ing he must have open before him some of the books for which he is trying to create an appetite .

		As these are too heavy to carry about by hand , we must have a book wagon with horses or motor , holding perhaps a thousand volumes carefully selected for this peculiar work .

		With this equipment the man or woman with a genius for the work has a rare opportunity for usefidness .

		If it suggests the re - ligious colporteur distributing books and tracts , we must remember that only religious and educational work has ever moved deeply the human heart to missionary effort , and the work of which we are talking belongs clearly to this class .

		The book wagon would have its regular route , repeating its visit at intervals of perhaps two or more weeks .

		This book missionary would come to know his constituency as a pastor knows his people .

		He would learn natural abilities and tastes , and would become skilful in developing latent interests and leading promising readers steadily on to higher and better things .

		K on any trip he did not have in his wagon just the book wanted , he could record the need and bring the book next time from the central library from which his routes would radiate .

		He would invite his readers to visit the central library whenever they went to town and to feel free to ask for help in person or by letter .

		All would know that there was no commercial interest behind the work , and would feel confidence in asking gxiidance when they wished to buy books of their own .

		A book owned is much better than a book loaned .

		If the travelling librarian can in - duce his readers to apply their money to buying good books he will have done an educational work of incalculable value .

		To assist in this , endowments or gifts should pay necessary expenses of adminis - tration , so that any reader may have brought to him at wholesale cost any book among those it is espe - cially desirable to distribute .

		It is pathetic to see how books manufactured simply to sell are scattered through rural homes .

		People impressed with the value of good reading give their hard-earned money to clever agents who charge them high prices for books which ought to go to the paper-mill and not on the book shelf .

		The best way to cure this evil is not by declaiming against it , but by giving people the best books at cost instead of these poor books at high prices .

		The distribution of trash will stop as soon as it is unprofitable , for it is done only from pecuniary motives .

		No one who fully appreciates the great influence of books and reading can doubt that the money required to equip such a book wagon and to pay the salary of such a travelling librarian would yield very large educational dividends .

		The wagon , horses , and harness would cost about SIOOO , and the thousand suitable volumes would cost as much more .

		If as many books were in the hands of readers as in the wagon , so that while changing the books from house to house the wagon continued substan - tially full , the stock would be perhaps two thousand volumes .

		This investment would mean about
$ 3000	MONEY	, besides the salary and travelling expenses .

		This latter item would be small , for farmhouses would compete with each other for the privilege of keep - ing the wagon over night and having extra op - portunity to examine its resources .

		A man worth S3000 a year could use his time to good advantage in this way .

		There are men of real ability so deeply interested in the work that they would do it for much less if necessary .

		Age , experience , and other elements would determine the necessary salary , but it would be perhaps a moderate estimate to allow S3000 for the equipment of the wagon and S2000 a year for salary and expenses .

		When I first proposed this new work some five years ago the term '' field libraries '' seemed well suited to desig ^ te the idea .

		Admirable opportunities , with cooperation and needed super - vision , await the first gifts for launching this very practical enlargement of the itinerant principle .

		SOME BIBLIOGRAPHIC NEEDS AND POSSIBILITIES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		When Lawyer Pleydell compared Dominie Samp - son 's mind to a pawnbroker 's shop stowed with all kinds of goods , which , however , were piled in utter confusion , he supplied a simile that is not altogether inapplicable to the world 's store of knowledge at the present day .

		There is this distinction , however , that the latter case is not hopeless , for an effective remedy lies close at hand .

		During past centuries , various at - tempts have been made , more or less successfully , to classify all literature imder specific as well as general heads .

		It may well be asked if the science of bibli - ography did not exist , at least in crude form , long be - fore the invention of the printing press , for we are told that the clay tablets recently discovered in the library of the palace of Assur-bani-pal , at
Nineveh	LOCATION	, were duly arranged in accordance with the subjects to which they related .

		Bibliographers of the past , like pioneers , have assisted in the advance of civilization , but of the modern bibli - ographer and skilful prospector increased demands are made , for it suffices not that they should submit merely a skeleton outline of things examined .

		Many pertinent notes must accompany their respective reports , because upon their accuracy and comprehensiveness rests the subsequent investment of valuable time and precious energies .

		Even
Prescott	PERSON	's '' Conquest of
Mexico	LOCATION	, '' not - withstanding the original researches made by its accom - plished aiithor , would possess much less charm except for the labors of his predecessors in the same field .

		The bibliographer , however , is likely also to be a bibliophile , and the loves of the latter may sometimes conflict with the most useful work of the former .

		The American point of view , being essentially practical , in - sists that he was right who said : `` The only useful knowledge is the knowledge that is of use . ''

		Logically , therefore , the most useful knowledge is the knowledge that is of most tise .

		The
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, in its bibliographic and other departments , obviously takes this view of the matter , and endeavors to supply the people 's wants and to anticipate their needs .

		Consider , for example , the timeliness of one of its recent issues , a '' List of References on Primary Elections . ''

		Here is a good illustration of what can be accomplished , bibli - ographically , by a watchful observation of the trend of public affairs .

		The
State Library School	ORGANIZATION	at
Albany	LOCATION	, and some other similar institutions , make the presentation of an original bibliography compulsory as a condition of graduation .

		Some of these compilations find their way into print , and others are preserved in manuscript form .

		The com - pilation of special bibliographies of subjects of vital and current interest or permanent usefulness , seems really to constitute one of the most important phases of the work yet to be performed .

		There is now an imcomited number of such monographs in print , and the list is being augmented daily .

		To centralize this work , to establish a kind of bibliographic clearing-house , in
America	LOCATION	, is the step , a very essential one , that is most naturally next in order .

		How soon this step can be taken depends wholly upon the generosity of intelligent , representative citizens having the requisite means .

		It is problematical how much longer the
Smithsonian	ORGANIZATION	Institution can consent to act as a regional bureau , in the collection and preparation of material for the '' Inter - national Catalogue of Scientific Literature '' published by the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	, for the
International Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		The time will come , and that , perhaps , quickly , when it will be absolutely necessary to establish an American bureau of bibliography upon which will at once devolve many important tasks .

		Among needed imdertakings that have been suggested are an interna ^ tional catalogue of technological literature , which would prove of great interest and use in the
United States	LOCATION	, and a new bibliography of bibliographies .

		The latter , one of the projects informally considered by the Bibli - ographical Society of
America	LOCATION	as stated in a very interesting note by President
Lane	PERSON	, should prove to be the crowning work of bibliography , a veritable index to indexes , a kind of starting point for all serious investi - gations thenceforth .

		The general summing up of knowledge and the saving of time that such an index woidd insure , are elements too important to escape the attention of thinking people .

		In
1904	DATE	, there appeared from the
George Washington University of Washington	ORGANIZATION	, D. C , an announcement by President
Needham	PERSON	of the proposed establishment of a department of bibliography and library science , as soon as negotiations could be completed having in view an endowment of two hmidred thousand dollars , with which to start the work .

		This evident appreciation of the value of bibliographic research in the
United States	LOCATION	wUl not pass unheeded .

		The large libraries of many American cities offer a wonderful field for study , but what can compete with the facilities that are so accessi - ble at our national capital ?

		Students residing in the city of
Washington	LOCATION	would have advantages not else - where obtainable .

		The
George Washington University	ORGANIZATION	has by its proposition given a typical example of the spirit of modern American imiversity management .

		Conformable to that spirit , one may safely expect pro- ductive work , consisting of many invaluable contribu - tions to bibliography , to issue from the collective labors of the department when inaugurated .

		There is no question about the potential energy of a great body of enthusiastic students , and of their positive power under guidance .

		They will quickly seize the opportunity thus afforded for the performance of useful work , in the natural course of study , and the ultimate results will imdoubtedly be far beyond present estimation .

		Whether or not other educational institutions will add biblio - graphic research to their curriculum remains to be seen .

		The field , which is extremely comprehensive , might very wisely be approached inter-collegiately .

		It can not be thus approached too soon .

		The existence of a cen - tral bureau of bibliography woidd facilitate inter - commmiication between investigators and the exchange of data relating to monographs wanted or in prepara - tion ; all which would redound to the advancement of knowledge and good citizenship .

		The subject of cooperative cataloguing has proved to be of widespread interest , in evidence of which fact one needs only considt the pamphlet , issued by the Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, entitled '' Bibliography of Co - operative Cataloguing , '' by Messrs.
Torstein Jahi	PERSON	'' and
Adam Julius Strohm	PERSON	.

		An examination of this valuable collection , comprising 366 titles , is a necessary prelude to any serious study of the problem , which , as intimated above , is not without a solution .

		The difficidty is not so much to find a solution that will answer requirements fairly well , as to extract the best from all the plans
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 79 severally suggested , and finally to put the whole scheme into operation .

		Unrestricted cooperative cataloguing and universal or international bibliography are subjects that must necessarily be very closely related .

		It ap - pears to the writer that among the chief works , perhaps the chief work , to be undertaken by a central bureau of bibliography , woxdd be the compilation of a new bibli - ography of bibliographies , as mentioned above .

		To avoid frequent revision , it should be supplemented periodically by notices of additional bibliographies pub - lished subsequently or which may have been overiooked in previous collections .

		This problem , from an English standpoint , seems very nearly to have been solved by
Courtney	PERSON	's '' Register of
National Bibliography	ORGANIZATION	, '' re - cently published .

		Bibliographies need not be , and ought not to be , con - fined to works in the compiler 's mother-tongue .

		At least a fair working knowledge of other modem lan - guages is possessed by many who consult such works , and it may be observed in passing that the acquisition of an ability to comprehend printed German , French ,
Latin	LOCATION	, Spanish , or Italian , offers no insurmountable obstacles to the American student , if he is blessed with any leisure moments to devote to such fascinating study .

		Pure science is naturally one of the most attractive fields of bibliographic research ; while science , in its broadest meaning , well-nigh covers the entire realm of knowledge , including history .

		There is much that can be done in the collection of authorities on the local his - tory of American states , territories , counties , cities , and towns .

		These subjects of growing importance and interest merit the close attention of individual inves - tigators , of whose monographs , deposited in local libraries , facsimiles should be transmitted to the
Library of Cong	ORGANIZATION	^ ss for the benefit of a wider circle of students .

		These facsimiles might consist of ordinary -LRB- typewritten -RRB- carbon copies , though the '' black print , '' or '' vandyke , '' process furnishes a means of duplicating original manu - scripts very cheaply and acceptably .

		The publication of a bulletin by the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- proposed in the `` Library Journal , '' 30 : 858 -RRB- to report special bib - liographies needed or in preparation , woidd bring inves - tigators in touch with each other .

		It would do more , for such a bulletin would form a practical basis for cooperation .

		MR. SWIXBLTiNE AS `` A LO ^ T : POET . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of
The Dlvl	ORGANIZATION	.

		i The communication of Professor
Pancoast	PERSON	, published in The Dial of
January 16	DATE	, commands the respect of all who know how eminently he is qualified to discuss a question of comparative poetics , and it is to be hoped that the points which he raises against Air .

		Swinburne 's matter , as opposed to his manner , may be met temper - ately and without recrimination , as he suggests .

		Meanwhile , it seems to me that Professor
Pancoast	PERSON	's argument is weakened by reference to
Emerson	LOCATION	, Words - worth , and
Browning	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	is essentially and avowedly '' a love poet , '' and it is because of his supreme mastery of verbal melody that he excels all others in the virid and compact expression of erotic emotion .

		Now , while I have profound reverence for the names of both
Emerson	PERSON	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	, I should like to remark that if there could be anything funnier than
Emerson	PERSON	's essay on love it would be an erotic poem by
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		But when did
Wordsworth	PERSON	ever write a love poem ?

		Pro- fessor
Pancoast	PERSON	speaks of his doing so `` at rare mo - ments . ''

		Will he not tell us when these moments were ?

		The reference to
Browning	PERSON	strikes me as imfortunate becaiLse Professor
Pancoast	PERSON	cites him as one who writes of love as a '' high-minded gentleman , '' and not -LRB- like -RSB- ^ Ir .

		Swinburne -RRB- as '' a delirious pagan . ''

		Surely if a breaking down of conventions is to be taken into the count .

		Browning can give Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	aces and spades , for he not only makes love the supreme law of life , but brands as sin the usually accepted ethical rules established for its control -LCB- vide `` The Statue and the Bust '' -RRB- .

		It is hardly fair to confuse the sex motive , avowedly at the basis of the work of both
Browning	PERSON	and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, with that lofty intellectual passion which characterizes the poetry of some of the other writers whom Professor
Pancoast	PERSON	names .

		Neither does it seem quite fair to refer to some of the most exquisite pieces of metrical idealism in the language as '' so-called love P *** ™ ^ -

		Is the
February	DATE	number of '' The Printing Art '' Mr.
Lindsay Swift	PERSON	has some well-considered remarks on the `` Atrocities of Color Supplements '' -LRB- as issued by our Sim - day newspapers -RRB- which deserve a much wider and more general audience than the constituency of the excellent periodical in which they appear .

		Mr.
Swift	PERSON	's arraign - ment of this distinctively American nuisance is based on both ethical and artistic grounds .

		We should like to quote the entire article , but can find room only for a small portion . ''

		It is impossible to describe the vul - garity and insanity of their drawing and coloring ; and it can not be that the editors , who must be men of some ability , however devoid of scruples , approve of their own mischievous work .

		Even the newest of the rich dis - play some personal taste in their belongings and adorn - ments , and even editors may have artistic consciences .

		Their answer to criticism against their methods inva - riably is : The public will and therefore must have what it wants .

		I am not so sure about that .

		The public visits beautiful museums and libraries and seems to enjoy them ; it goes to churches where good music may be heard ; it will support a decent play and condemn a nasty one .

		But it can be debauched and can have its dawning sensibilities for art or anything else that is worth while blighted ; and there is no debauchery or blight , outside the domain of obvious immorality , more deadening to the public than this continually thrusting everything that is sordid , vulgar , and belittling before its uncultured but curious eyes .

		... It would not be so bad if these wretched perversions of so innocent and helpful a relish to life as the comic reached only persons of mature life .

		Even readers whose time is so valueless that they can afford to waste more than a glance at a
Sunday	DATE	paper must realize how worthless pictures of this sort really are .

		It is the children who suffer , for they absorb unconsciously the unsavory quality of such efforts to amuse , and are thus the involuntary victims of voluntary and responsible corruptionists .

		At a time when this country is seriously trying to implant a knowl - edge of and stimulate a taste for better tlungs , artistic and aesthetic , through exhibitions in museums , libraries , and even in
Sunday	DATE	schools , it is not a little disheart - ening to realize that every step in this direction gets a weekly setback through these colored atrocities . ''

		A Biography of
Carl	PERSON	, yl , e 's Biographer .

		* '' II n ' y a rien qui s ` arrange aussi facilement que les faits , '' says
Talleyrand	LOCATION	, and , curiously enough , the remark is quoted with approval by
Froude	PERSON	.

		Whether it is also a favorite quota - tion of his biographer , Mr.
Herbert Paul	PERSON	, is a matter of conjecture .

		Without asserting that his
Life of Froude	ORGANIZATION	exemplifies the facility of arranging facts to the best advantage , it is cer - tainly true that the book is highly eulogistic ; but what good biography is not ?

		If the biogra - pher is not in hearty sympathy with his subject , what zest can the reader bring to the perusal of his book ?

		And surely
Froude	PERSON	has been bit - terly enough and often enough assailed as a wilful perverter of facts to deserve a handsome presentation of the case by counsel for the de - fence .

		As a
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's Inn barrister and a lit - terateur of proved ability , Mr.
Paul	PERSON	appears to be exactly the man for the task to which he has put his hand .

		It is true , he claims to have had no personal acquaintance with the historian ; near the end of his book he describes his '' one and only experience of
Froude	PERSON	and his ways , '' which was confined to the overhearing of an after-dinner talk ; but he may be all the more trustworthy in his account of the man for not having experienced more intimately the charm that so many of
Froude	PERSON	's friends found in the historian 's personality .

		Three of the eleven chapters into which the author divides his book are especially note - worthy .

		In his first he presents a picture of the motherless boy 's harsh upbringing that will be new to most readers .

		In his fifth he gives a de - tailed and amusing account of
Freeman	PERSON	's fren - zied assaults on his commendably unretaliatory brother historian , which it is hard to read with - out taking sides against the aggressor and his '' ferocious pedantry , '' as
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	hap - pily styled it .

		His eighth chapter deals with the relations between
Froude	PERSON	and
Carlyle	PERSON	, and reviews briefly , and without violating good taste , the alleged indiscretions of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's biographer .

		Of course
Froude	PERSON	is vigorously defended , and even the most hostile reader can not but be im - pressed with the difficulties and embarrassments that beset the unfortimate literary executor .

		Other chapters , perhaps equally interesting , describe
Froude	PERSON	's student life at
Oxford	LOCATION	, his * The Life of

		twenty years of labor on his History , his visit to this country and his lectures here on
Ireland	LOCATION	, his South African experiences , and his Oxford professorship , to which he was appointed as
Freeman	ORGANIZATION	's successor .

		Turning back now to the first chapter , we find the author acknowledging himself , both as writer and as reader , no friend to genealogical details .

		So far so good ; but his contention that '' few indeed are the families which contain more than one remarkable figure '' might easily be met by a very respectable array of refutatory instances .

		Blood will tell , to some extent .

		How - ever ,
Froude	PERSON	's ancestry needs no apologies , although one may gladly enough begin with the subject proper of the book .

		Besides losing his mother -LRB-
Margaret Spedding	PERSON	-RRB- in early childhood , and having an unsympathetic father in the Arch - deacon of
Totnes	LOCATION	, little
Anthony	PERSON	was subjected to a peculiar discipline at the hands of his older brother
Hurrell	PERSON	, whom nevertheless he wor - shipped as '' a born leader of men . ''

		The fol - lowing passage has a certain significance : '' Conceiving that the chiM wanted spirit ,
Hurrell	PERSON	once took him up by the heels , and stirred with his head the mud at the bottom of a stream .

		Another time he threw him into deep water out of a boat to make him manly .

		But he was not stitisfied by inspiring physical terror .

		Invoking the aid of the praeternatural , he taught his brother that the hollow behmd the house was haunted by a monstrous and malevolent phantom , to which , in the plentitude of his imagination , he gave the name of Pen - ingre .

		Gradually the child discovered that
Peningre	PERSON	was an illusion , and began to suspect that other ideas of
Hurrell	PERSON	's might be illusions too .

		Superstition is the parent of scepticism from the cradle to the grave .

		At the same time his own facvdty of invention was rather stimulated than repressed .

		He was encouraged in tell - ing , as children will , imaginative stories of things which never occurred . ''

		The ill usage and want of sympathy experi - enced by the boy as pupU at
Westminster	LOCATION	, and also in the succeeding three years of home life , until his entrance at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	, might well have had a permanent and blighting influence on his character .

		`` Unhappily , in spite of the head master 's remon - strances ,
Froude	PERSON	's father , who had spent a great deal of money on his other sons ' education , insisted on placing him in college , which was then far too rough for a boy of his age and strength .

		On account of what he had read , rather than what he liad learnt , at
Buckfast	LOCATION	- leigh , he took a very high place , and was put with boys far older than himself .

		The fagging was excessively severe .

		The bullying was gross and unchecked .

		The sanitary accommodation was abominable .

		The language of the dormitory was indecent and profane .

		Froude , whose health prevented him from the effective use of nature 's weapons , was woke by the hot points of cigars burning holes in his face , made drimk by being forced to swallow brandy pimch , and repeatedly thrashed .

		He

		THE DIAL 81 was also more than half starved , because the big fellows had the pick of the joints at dinner , and left the small fellows little besides the bone ... Public schools had not yet felt the influence of Arnold and of the reform - ing spirit .

		Head masters considered domestic details beneath them , and parents , if they felt any responsibility at ail , persuaded themselves that boys were all the bet - ter for roughing it as a preparation for the discipline of the world - The case of Fronde , however , was a pecu - liarly bad one .

		He was suffering from hernia , and the treatment might well have killed him . ''

		Mr.
Paul	PERSON	's admiration of
Froude	PERSON	as historian is enthusiastic . ''

		He was not a chronicler , '' he admits , '' but an artist , a moralist , and a man of genius . ''

		And further , '' A paste-pot , a pair of scissors , the mechanical precision of a copying clerk , are all usefid in their way ; hut they no more make an historian than a cowl makes a monk . ''

		With a relish that it is difficult for the reader not to share , the biographer points out some rather surprising errors in
Freeman	PERSON	's ac - rimonious criticism of the man whom he chose so bitterly to revile under the shelter of anon - ymity .

		The style of his criticism Ls familiar to readers of the Review in which it appeared as the successive volumes of
Froude	PERSON	's History were published .


Freeman	PERSON	's professing of no ill - will , `` only a strong sense of amusement in bowling down one thing after another , '' re - ceives a curious comment in the marginal notes to his copy of the work criticised .

		It may furnish amusement to quote a few of these from Mr.
Paul	PERSON	's pages . ''

		Beast I '' is one entry , '' Bah ! ''

		another . ''

		May I live to embowel
James Anthony Froude	PERSON	! ''

		is a third fervent interjection . ''

		Froude is certainly the molest brute that ever wrote a book , '' is still another mode of expressing ' this '' strong sense of amuse - ment . ''

		Such revelations of temjjer hardly betoken the dispassionate calm of authoritative criticism .

		The whole story of this paper warfare -- a warfare in which , except for
Froude	ORGANIZATION	's late - appearing and admirably temperate rejoinder entitled '' A few words on Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	, '' the hostilities were almost all on one side -- serves to illustrate anew how weak is the cause that consents to employ the aid of sarcasm , innuendo , superciliousness , or even the milder forms of imperfect courtesy and half-candor that lie so perilously ready to the hand of critic or editor .

		The disingenuousness that may lurk even in the apparently innocent '' we fear , '' or '' we hope , '' or '' we trust , '' of one who argues for victory more than for truth , is a matter of daily illustration .

		It has long been charged against
Froude	PERSON	that in writing his History he made but the most cursory examination of valuable papers placed at his disposal at
Hatfield	LOCATION	.

		Perhaps the follow - ing letter to Lady
Salisbury	PERSON	will be illuminating : '' If
Lord Salisbury	PERSON	has not repented of his kind promise to me , I shall in a few weeks be in a condition to avail myself of it , and I write to ask you whether about the beginning of next month I may be permitted to examine the papers at
Hatfield	LOCATION	.

		I am unwilling to trouble
Lord Salisbury	PERSON	more than necessary .

		I have therefore examined every other collection within my reach first , that I might know clearly what I wanted .

		Obliged as I am to confine myself for the present to the first ten years of
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	's reign , there will not be much which I shall have to examine there , the great bidk of
Lord Burleigh	PERSON	's papers for that time being in the Record Office -- but if I can be allowed a few days * work , I believe I can turn them to good account . ''

		Furthermore , to those who allege that
Froude	PERSON	wrote without sufficient preliminary reading of authorities , Mr.
Paid	PERSON	declares that he '' neg - lected no source of information , and spared himself no pains in pursuit of it .

		At the
Record Office	ORGANIZATION	, in the British Museum , at Hat - field , among the priceless archives preserved in the Spanish village of
Simancas	LOCATION	, he toiled with unquenchable ardour and unrelenting assiduity .

		Nine-tenths of his authorities were in manu - script .

		They were in five languages .

		They filled nine hundred volumes . ''

		The hand - writing , too , was often well-nigh illegible .

		All of
Froude	ORGANIZATION	's voluminous transcripts from the
Simancas	PERSON	papers he is said to have deposited in the British Museum , as a sort of public check on his own fidelity in dealing with the sources of his narrative .

		The chapter entitied • •
Froude	PERSON	and Carlyle '' reveals a decidedly tangled state of affairs as existing after
Carlyle	PERSON	's death , in the matter of his piles of papers and his probable desire as to their ultimate disposition .

		Pathetic is poor
Froude	PERSON	's plaint in a letter to -RSB-
Max MiiUer	PERSON	, in the midst of all his troubles as literary executor . ''

		What have I done , '' he asks , '' that I should be in such a strait ?

		But I am sixty-four years old , and I shall soon be beyond it ^ . ''

		Unless we hold the stem doctrine of
James Mill	PERSON	, that only acts and not motives are proper subjects for judgment , it is impossible to refuse some measure of condonation to a well-intentioned offender .

		To know all is to pardon all , and when we once recognize in Froude the streak of literary freakishness that was peculiar to his genius , it is scarcely in human nature to be severe with him -- except that one must always censure anything that looks like wilful perver - sion of truth , or weak surrender to prejudice .

		The romancer gets the better of the historian in his case ; he has , in short , the defects of his qualities , and without those defects he would not have charmed precisely as he did his thousands 82 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, of readers , or produced a biography that , with all its favdts , has a fascination approaching even that of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's masterpiece .

		Yet this mnst not be taken as a whitewashing of
Froude	LOCATION	, or as excusing lenity on a biogi'apher 's part toward notorious swervings from the straight line of truth .

		Attempting to refute a familiar charge against
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Paul	PERSON	writes : '' Nothing annoyed
Carlyle	PERSON	more than to be told that he confounded might with right .

		He declared that , on the contrary , he had never said , and would never say , a word for power which was not founded on justice . ''

		This is rather amusing .

		Of course
Carlyle	PERSON	was annoyed .

		What man of sense and humanity would consciously uphold the mon - strous doctrine that might makes right ?

		Nev - ertheless a predisposition to discover right pretty uniformly on the side of might may be so ingrained in a man 's nature that he can not suspect its presence any more than he can look into his own eyes .

		As
Martineau	PERSON	long ago well expressed it , for
Carlyle	PERSON	, '' as for so many gifted and ungifted men , the force which will not be stopped by any restraint on its way to great achievement , -- the genius which claims to be its own law , and will confess nothing diviner than itseK , -- have an irresistible fascination .

		His eye , overlooking the landscape of humanity , always runs up to the brilliant peaks of power : not , indeed , without a glance of love and pity into many a retreat of quiet goodness that lies safe beneath their shelter ; but shoidd the sud - den lightning , or the seasonal melting of the world 's ice-barriers , bring down a ruin on that green and feeble life , his voice , after one faint cry of pathos , joins in with the thimder and shouts with the triumph of the avalanche .

		Ever watching the strife of the great forces of the universe , he , no doubt , sides on the whole against the Titans with the gods : but if the Titans make a happy fling , and send home a mountain or two to the very beard of Zeus , he gets delighted with the game on any terms and cries , ' Bravo ! ' ''

		If lives of men of letters are , to many read - ers , too often but dreary reading , it is a com - plaint that can not be brought against Mr.
Paul	PERSON	's life of
Froude	PERSON	.

		Whether it be that his sym - pathy with his subject has imparted to him something of
Froude	PERSON	's own consummate art as a literary craftsman , certain it is that he has produced a very readable account of one whom Sir
John Skelton	PERSON	enthusiastically described as '' the most interesting man I have ever known . ''

		Some Current Railway-Rate DlS CTTSSI OX .

		* The railroad-rate question is apparently faring distinctly better than did the monetary problem in one respect at least .

		This is that the atten - tion of careful investigators as well as of the general public was attracted to the subject prior to the time when it became an acute public issue .

		Enough had already been written , before the problem of government control of railway - rates became prominent in the public mind , to provide a body of material upon which investi - gators could fall back , and to furnish , what was even more important , a fund of experience in the inquiry indicating the points at which fm * - ther study and analysis was desirable .

		It has thus been possible , when the necessity came , for trained investigators to continue the preparation of information as to railway rates for use by legislators and by the public .

		On the other hand , it remains true that much of the study that has been devoted to the railroad problem , during the past few years , lias either rim along special lines or has been hidden in public docu - ments and court decisions .

		A real service both to the semi-technical world and to the general public , therefore , is performed by those who are prepared to gather up the results thus made ready for assunilation .

		Since President
Hadley	PERSON	's book on American raih ` oad transportation , fragmentary and incom - plete as it was , which attracted so much atten - tion some years ago , there has been relatively little in the way of comprehensive study of this question .

		The appearance of a group of studies , chief among which may be mentioned Professor
Johnson	PERSON	's valuable book of a year or two ago , was the beginning of a series of volumes which have now provided a body of literature for the enlightenment of that part of the reading public which wishes to inform itself upon serious ques - tions of current import .

		Merely to give a list of the titles of the books that shoidd be included in the group here described would be a consid - erable task ; but the publication within a few weeks of one another of books as usefid as Professor
Meyers	PERSON	's '' Government Regtdation of Railway Rates , '' Judge
Noyes	PERSON	's '' American Railroad Rates '' and Mr.
Haines	PERSON	's ''
Restric	PERSON	- tive Railway Legislation '' is itself notable .

1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 83 engineer and practical railroad manager .

		It is interesting to note that in certain respects these volumes , while they do not cover the same ground , come to similar conclusions .

		Professor
Meyers	PERSON	's book , already very fully discussed else - where , need not be further considered here .

		It stands in a somewhat different class from the two companion volumes , both because of its broader scope , the smaller practical experience of its author , and his greater dogmatism .

		The work of Judge
Xoyes	PERSON	and ^ Ir .

		Haines represents the ideas of the sane and conservative railway men of the eoimtry .

		As such , these two vol - umes are entitled to exceptionally close study not only because they embody the residt of actual experience , but because they evidently voice the ideas of those who know how legislation woidd affect a great industry .

		Of the two books , the broader , as the title denotes , is that of
Air	ORGANIZATION	.


Haines	PERSON	, the more inten - sive and special is that of Judge
Noyes	PERSON	.

		Both , however , have their main centre of interest , at least at the present time , in the question of how far government control of railroad-rates can be reaUy successfid .

		Judge
Noyes	PERSON	gives a lengthy and most care - ful study of the way in which rates grow up , of their limitations , and of the questions relating to classification and changes in rates .

		He points out clearly what conditions give rise to discrimi - nation , and analyzes the effect of the so-called ' • basing point '' ' system and similar plans .

		Just here , it is interesting to note Judge
Noyes	PERSON	's general conclusion , vs-ith regard to discrimina - tion , that the state of affairs existing in
1898	DATE	, when the
Interstate Commerce Commission	ORGANIZATION	re - ported that a large part of the railroad business was done upon illegal rates , has now come to an end .

		Personal discrimination , thinks Judge
Xoyes	PERSON	, is now practically over .

		He admits the continued existence of discrimination between localities , but believes that it is inevitable that some such differential rates shall exist .

		They restdt from the application of the `` principle of value '' in rate-making .

		The same ser ^ - ice may have a different value when rendered to different localities .

		When competition makes local dis - criminations necessary , they are justified by the value principle .

		As for discriminations between commodities , this is a problem of classification , and involves no hardship if what the author con - siders proper principles in rate-making are care - fully applied .

		The conditions that have brought about the present more satisfactory state of affairs as to personal discriminations , which , says the author , `` are opposed to aU good busi - ness principles and are whoUy indefensible and vicious '' are , according to Judge
Noyes	PERSON	, four in number : -LRB- 1 -RRB- prosperity , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the Elkins law , -LRB- 3 -RRB- railroad consolidation , and -LRB- 4 -RRB- a belated realization of the injurious effect of discrimina - tions .

		Evidently the author did not have in mind the existence of the pass system , when these words were written , but referred only to freights .

		It may be observed that his opinions , ^ as thus stated , are in substantial accord with those of the public officials in
Washington	LOCATION	who are charged with the duty of enforcing the rail - way legislation of the country .

		Continuing , he traces the effect of competition and combination , and shows how far rates vary and how far they are influenced by changes in equipment .

		3ilr .

		Haines naturally looks at the railroad question from the standpoint of an engineer and business man rather than from that of a lawyer or student .

		His chapters on railroad finance and railroad construction are enlighten - ing .

		He traces with some care the nature of the railroad charters that have been granted and the character of the restrictions by which it has been sought to regulate and control the growth of the great raUroad net of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In this connection , it may be observed that two of the most important things connected with the growth of the railroad system have not been the subjects of much if any restrictive regu - lation or legislation .

		One of these two points is the gauge of the roads , which , says Mr.
Haines	PERSON	, was made uniform by the railways , at their own instance , and at very substantial cost , while the other is the matter of route .

		The author 's chapters on railroad operation and on railroad traffic are less satisfactory than those already referred to , yet they furnish a good and clear review of these topics .

		In revie \* Tng the growth of a system of rate-making , Mr.
Haines	PERSON	adopts a historical method in part .

		In part , his treat - ment is analytical ; but , like Judge
Noyes	PERSON	, he r ^ fards rates as the result of practical competi - tion .

		The rate-maker , he says , '' does not origi - nate or create rates . ''

		In practice his rates are determined , as to reasonableness , by what the traffic will bear , and , where competition exists , by rival bidding for the busiaess .

		Discrimina - tion between places is regarded by Mr.
Haines	PERSON	, and also by Judge
Noyes	PERSON	, as to some extent a necessary incident .

		At times , it may become unjust or unreasonable , -- primarily when more is chargetl for the short haul than for the long one in the same direction .

		Regulation of rates is first considered from a historical standpoint by Mr.
Haines	PERSON	.

		He has a general chapter on the 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, regulation of rates through pooling associations ; then one on the work of
State	ORGANIZATION	railroad commis - sions , and then a chapter on pending legislation affecting interstate commerce .

		In Chapter XI .

		is given a theoretical discussion of '' State con - trol of corporations engaged in a public service , '' and lastly a final treatment embodying some '' Conclusions . ''

		The chapter in which Mr.
Haines	PERSON	parallels Judge
Noyes	PERSON	's discussion to some extent is that which deals with pending legislation .

		As already noted , the main present interest in both Mr.
Haines	PERSON	's and Judge
Noyes	PERSON	's work is in what they have to say of the present efforts at
State	ORGANIZATION	control of rates and their theoretical bearing .

		In a careful constitutional discussion , Judge
Noyes	PERSON	, as it seems to us , demonstrates the following ideas : The power of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and of the
State	ORGANIZATION	legislatures is limited by the com - merce clause of the federal constitution and by the fourteenth amendment .

		The making of rates by law is purely a legislative function .

		The legislature may act either directly or through a commission or other administrative body .

		Three limitations , however , of special character apply in the case of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	: -LRB- 1 -RRB- the division of the function of government into three depart - ments , -LRB- 2 -RRB- the fifth amendment , and -LRB- 3 -RRB- the provision against port preferences .

		The division of functions indicates that there must be no confusion of legislative , executive , and judicial functions , resulting from any act that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	may pass .

		The fifth amendment provides that no private property shall be taken , without due process of law or without just compensation .

		The provision against port preferences makes it plain that no preference to the ports of any one
State	ORGANIZATION	, resulting from the acts of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, will be held constitutional .

		The ultimate real test of the constitutionality of a law-made rate is , however , whether such rates are confiscatory .

		As a result of his reasoning along these lines , and of his application of them to existing legis - lation .

		Judge
Noyes	PERSON	reaches the conclusion that existing remedies for unreasonable charges are ineffectual as far as they go , and do not go far enough ; while because of his view that the adjudication of the reasonableness of a rate is a judicial fimction , of the further opinion that judicial and legislative functions can not be com - bined , and of the view that judicial functions can be exercised only by judges holding their offices during good behavior , he is led to think that most of our pending legislation , including the recent Esch-Townsend bUl , is impossible .

		The greater number of the measures now pro- posed require the exercise of judicial functions by the
Interstate Conunerce Commission	ORGANIZATION	and the exercise of non-judicial functions by the courts .

		Judge
Noyes	PERSON	's suggestion for legislation is the establishment of a special interstate commerce court which should ascertain whether or not a given rate is or is not unreasonable .

		In case a given rate were found unreasonable , this fact should be certified to the
Interstate Commerce Commission	ORGANIZATION	, which shoidd then , on the basis of the papers in the case and without further hearing , make a maximum rate to take the place of the unreasonable rate .

		This new rate should remain in force for a specified time .

		While Mr.
Haines	PERSON	does not go into any such complete analysis , or recommend any such de - tailed plan as does Judge
Noyes	PERSON	, there is noth - ing in his treatment that is not in accordance with the latter 's views .

		He does not believe in any quasi-judicial commission , nor does he seem - ingly believe that any general power for rate-mak - ing should be granted the
Interstate Commerce Commission	ORGANIZATION	mider existing conditions .

		Should a rate-making power be accorded to it , however , '' it shoidd be in fact a court of first instance , '' says Mr.
Haines	PERSON	.

		It should act solely on com - plaints .

		It should never prosecute of its own motion .

		It should be strictly impartial .

		In this view of the case .

		Mr.
Haines	PERSON	has evidently in mind somewhat the same thought as has Judge
Noyes	PERSON	, -- the creation of a real railroad court .

		He does not carry the idea further , and suggest the delegation of the rate-making function to some conunission as a separate and independent administrative body charged with the revision of given rates .

		But it is evident that this is an idea which -- granting the interference of gov - ernment in rate-making as unavoidable -- would be in harmony with the general tenor of his thought .

		These ideas as to railroad rate con - trol , therefore , with the reasoning which leads thereto , and with the abundant supply of in - formation upon allied topics which is provided in both books , are the chief contributions made to the pending discussion by two of the most careful of recent thinkers on railroad questions .

		THE DIAL 85 I A Defen ^ itive
Goethe Biography	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Ten years ago German scholars published sev - eral notable biographies of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, and others have since appeared .

		The single volume by
Eichard M. Meyer	PERSON	, for example , is a preisge -
Jcronte Arbeit	PERSON	, brief and at times trenchant in its critical estimates , a book for the student rather than the general reader .

		The needs of the latter were especially met in the two vol - umes by
Heinemann	PERSON	, a readable and attractive account of the ix > et 's life , environment , and works , and particularly valuable for the numer - ous pictures of places and people .

		Both these biographies appeared in the same year with the first volmne , and with the other works alluded to preceded the second volmne of Bielschow - sky 's Goethe sein Leben und seine Werke .

		Each of these various works has merits of its own , but none has taken the place that
Biel	PERSON	- schowsky 's may fairly claim .

		Its importance , as the best biography of the poet that has appeared , is so generally acknowledged that a translation has been called for , and this is now supplied by Professor
William A. Cooper	PERSON	of
Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The English-reading pub - lic is thus papng to the lamented German scholar the compliment that the Germans paid many years ago to Mr.
Lewes	PERSON	's '' Life and Times of Goethe , '' and as their translation of that book was long their most popular a < ?

		count of the poet 's life , so Bielschowsky 's book , by reason of its fuller and more accurate informa - tion , will now take the place in our libraries that Mr.
Lewes	PERSON	's held so long .

		Bielschowsky based his work upon the rich material made accessible by the opening of the Goethe archives and b -RCB- - recent philological in - vestigation ; but as he designed it for the use of the \ Nddest circles , he felt that the choice and selection of material was imperative .

		As he remarks in the preface to the first volmne , only details disclose the man and the poet , and the surest safeguard against error in the proper understanding of his works is afforded by ap - proaching them in relation to his life .

		This idea was further confirmed by his \ aew of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's character as t -RCB- `` pically presenting an intensified picture of humanity .

		He therefore entered into a detailed study of the circumstances and influ - ences that formed the poet 's character and con - trolled his career .

		He studied carefully all sources and exploited all new material ; but he • The
Life of Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

Albert Bielschowsky	PERSON	, Ph.D. .

		wisely excluded from his text , and relegated to notes , all critical discussion of the statements made .

		His original intention was to make of these notes a continuous scientific discussion of the facts upon which his narrative is based , but considerations of space prevented this ; and , as they stand , the notes sometimes amplify , and sometimes merely state authorities , regarding mooted points .

		It must be evident , even to the casual reader , that Bielschowsky possessed unusual penetration and acumen in psychological analysis .

		He de - velops his story much as a good novelist might , and so reveals the growth of the poet 's character in its various phases .

		In his critical estimates he uniformly leads up to the circumstances un - der which the work in question was produced ; and , in the case of the more important , he fol - lows this with a lucid and extremely sympathetic outline of its content .

		This is done in a way to hold the interest of the reader and to empha - size the central thought , and is followed by judicious criticism , either favorable or unfavor - able as the case may be .

		The treatment of Werther affords an admirable illustration .

		Goethe 's experiences at
Wetzlar	ORGANIZATION	, related in a previous chapter , prepare the way for an ac - count of his
Lotte	LOCATION	cult , of which the story is a poetic reflection .

		After outlining the plot , em - phasis is placed upon the point , so often unap - preciated , that everything in the story flows naturally from the character of the hero .

		The author further remarks the wealth of life de - picted , the firm though brief delineation of the various subordinate characters , and the wonder - ful naturalness and warmth that characterizes it , and concludes with an account of the effect of the story upon
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's contemporaries .

		Especially noteworthy in this whole treatment is the fact that the biographer makes his reader not simply comprehend but feel , as perfectly natural , the effect that
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's book produced ; he does not simply understand the situation , -- he sympathizes with it .

		Bielschowsky 's treatment of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's atti - tude toward the War of Liberation is charac - teristic of the sympathetic and yet judicial way in which he deals with the poet 's career .

		He makes clear the reasons why Goethe failed to respond to the enthusiasm against Napoleon by indicating his just appreciation of the political reforms brought about under French domina - tion , and the slight danger that he felt of any real loss of the essentially German spirit in education and literature .

		He also points out
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's idea of the effect of the Prussian or 86 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, Austrian supremacy that would result from the overthrow of the French , -- `` an emancipation not from the yoke of the foreigners but from one foreign yoke , '' as he expressed it . ''

		And yet , '' so the author concludes , `` the experienced Goethe was wrong . ''

		He imderestimated the power of national feeling , and did not appreciate that the German spirit must always be alien to the French , and hence under their tutelage could not but faiL in the full development of its inner individuality .

		Political reasons based upon the position of the Duchy of
Weimar	LOCATION	also had weight in determining
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's conduct and , to some extent , his sympathies , so that his contemporaries were neither surprised , nor did they expect him to act differently .

		They also realized the permanent value of his work and its power as a national force ; there is , further , no lack of evidence that
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's attitude was not the result of indifference .

		Thus
Biel	PERSON	- schowsky presents the poet 's position and the influences that determined it , neither entirely commending nor wholly censuring , but stating it in the light of contemporary conditions , rather than from the standpoint of the special pleader holding a brief for or against the poet .

		The chapter on
Goethe 's Lyrics	ORGANIZATION	is one of the most valuable and suggestive in the work .

		The poet attributed much of his power to the influ - ence of
Spinoza	ORGANIZATION	, whose conception of God , in - carnate in the world , involved the idea of the divine in all objects as necessary parts of the whole , but as more or less fidly manifested , in proportion as the object is moi'e or less com - pletely essential and enduring .

		But the essen - tial and permanent in Goethe was ,
Bielschowslcy	PERSON	argues , his nature as a poet , while that which was accidental and temporary found expression in the man of the world and of affairs .

		The poet saw as with `` annointed eye '' the ultimate truth in the contradictions and confusions of human life , while the man was often distracted and went astray .

		But it was in this very con - fusion and error that the poet often found the material that he treated as typical and symbolic , and thereby , as he said , corrected his conception of things .

		A long chapter on the various groups of lyrics foUows , tracing each poem , as far as possible , to the incident or experience that called it forth .

		Space forbids any detailed analysis ; rather the question suggests itseK whether the briUiant rhetorical discussion just outlined applies only to the poet 's method .

		May it not suggest an explanation of the strange contradictions that the story of his life affords , -- his calm serenity and generous nobility , his fickle passion and intense personal selfishness .

		Bielschowsky certainly does not think of it in this relation .

		He neither glosses faults nor faUs to teU the pain they caused .

		His attitude is in general one of cordial affection , that may dis - approve but is ready to forgive , but he offers no explanation of that subtle dual personality that any student of the poet must feel .

		The chapter on
Faust	ORGANIZATION	also deserves special mention , but this is only partially the work of Bielschowsky .

		At the time of his death he had completed the account of the genesis of the poem ; the balance of the chapter was written by his friend , Professor
Ziegler	PERSON	of
Strassburg	LOCATION	.

		In this portion the pages dealing with the clas - sical Walpurgisnacht and with Homunculus are especially to be commended .

		In their brief outline and frank censure of those elements in these scenes that are wholly without any real or fancied connection with
Faust	PERSON	, far better ser - vice is rendered toward the proper miderstand - ing of the poem than in any attempt to justify or explain them .

		Common sense and poetic insight are happily blended , and without any attempt to make out a symbolism that it is more than doubtful the poet ever imagined .

		Professor
Cooper	PERSON	's translation is , in general , a very satisfactory piece of work .

		He renders paragraph by paragraph , indeed sentence by sen - tence , excepting in one or two instances men - tioned in his preface .

		The language is usually well-chosen , and renders the thought , and in some degree the style , of the original .

		Occa - sionally a phrase or sentence smacks somewhat of the class-room , and a less literal rendering would have made the meaning clearer .

		For ex - ample , the phrase '' becomes absorbed with her -LSB-
Frau von Stein	PERSON	-RSB- in the bony structure of man , '' is an awkward way of saying '' studied care - fidly the structure of the human skeleton . ''

		So '' the irridescence of
Merk	PERSON	's nature '' -LRB- ^ Das Schillernde -RRB- hardly conveys to the English reader the idea of versatility which the context shows to be the author 's thought . ''

		The cor - roded -LSB- durchgeheizf -RSB- sons of the twentieth cen - tury '' is literal and meaningless ; so also '' the lapidary personality of Orange '' is hardly clear .

		Other instances , especially in the literal render - ing of figurative language , might be cited .

		It is also to be regretted that the page headings of the original have not been preserved ; they cer - tainly facilitate the use of the book as a work of reference .

		On the whole , however , the few trifling faults , imnoticed except by the critic in quest of such material , are so far outweighed by the conspicuous merit of the work that it is

		* Professor
Santayana	PERSON	's two notable books on '' The Life of Reason , '' which recently appeared , have been followed up promptly by two addi - tional volimies in the same series , which deal respectively vv-ith '' • Reason in Religion '' and ' ■ ' ■ Reason in Ai ` t. '' This leaves impublished only the final volume , on '' Reason in Science . ''

		Of the two latest volxmies , the one on '' Reason in Religion '' has the greater speculative interest , since it is in the problems of religion that the opposition cidminates between the general philo - sophical conception which Professor
Santayana	PERSON	represents , and that which more commonly passes current .

		As readers of the earlier books will recall , '' The Life of Reason '' is constituted by that realm of ideal values in experience which , springing from the soil of the natural im - pulses and passions , has for its task the bringing of these to a seK-conscious and harmonious ex - pression .

		It is no part of its business to leave us with an accovmt of what reality is beyond our experience ; rather , its sole function is the praxj - tical one of miderstanding and accepting and using the situation in which a moi-tal may find himself .

		This , of couree , is valid equally of the religious exjjerience .

		For the author , therefore , religion is frankly conceived as poetry .

		It is a symbolic rendering of the moral experience , which has its value by reason of its power to vitalize the mind and transmit by way of par - ables the lessons of life .

		Accordingly ^ , as be - tween religions there is a difference only of better and worse , never of true and false .

		It is the root defect in religion -- the tendency to forget that it is poetry , to arrogate to itself literal truth , and lay claim to be an objective state - ment of fact .

		In this way the myth , which was but a symbol substituted for empirical descrip - tions , becomes an idol substituted for ideal val - ues ; instead of a representation of experience as it shoidd be , it becomes a pretended infor - mation about experience or reality elsewhere .

		This always tends to confuse intelligence and dislocate sentiment .

		The essential harm of it is that by persuading man that the world really • The

		is such as his rather arbitrary idealization has painted it , the true value of the ideal is lost .

		Moral harmonies are not given , they have to be made ; and the curse of superstition is that it justifies and protracts their absence by pro- claiming their invisible presence .

		Thus God , for practical religion , stands only for that which makes for the Good .

		A theodicy which attempts to extend the divine to the entire world , and to prove that whatever is is good , breaks down the very distinction which gives goodness and the divine their hvmMn meaning , and reduces every - thing to the dead level of an unmoral naturalism or pantheism .

		The whole difficulty again lies in the supposed need of turning a practical moral ideal into an accovmt of the objective constitution of the universe .

		It is chimerical to expect the rest of the world to be determined by that moral significance which by its very nature is in terms of particular himian interests . ''

		The attempt to subserve the natural order xmder the moral is like attempts to establish a government of the parent by the child -- some - thing : children are not averse to . ''

		So that religion ought to be for each man , not a literal accoimt of what is or has happened , but the imaginative expression of those ideals which are most vital to his own nature .

		Each man may have his own loves , but the object in each case is different .

		So it is , or should be , in religion .

		Literal truth is as irrelevant , as it is irrelevant to an artist 's pleasure to be warned that the beauty he expresses has no objective existence .

		There is little space to consider the more par - ticular treatment from this general standpoint of religion in its historical expressions , though this contains much interesting matter .

		The earlier chapters take up the more primitive as - pects of the religious experience , such as magic , sacrifice , prayer , and mythology .

		Interesting also is the historical appreciation of Hebraism and of Christianity .

		The author 's natural sym - pathy is ^ nth the Greek rather than the Hebraic type of mind .

		Paganism seems to him nearer than
Hebraism	PERSON	to the
Life of Reason	ORGANIZATION	, from the fact that its myths are more transparent and its temper less fanatical ; and it is probable that there are elements in the Hebrew religion which he fails in consequence to give their just emphasis .

		It certainly is a question whether the religious position of the historical Jesus has the quite derivative and incidental signifi - cance which his generalizations -- following a popidar interpretation -- assign to it .

		Fully adequate or not , however , the analysis is acute enough and time enough to make very good read -

		The characterization of the Protestant ele - ment in Christianity is particularly happy , in its opposition to the Oriental strain of unworldliness and asceticism with which it has entered into un - stable combination .

		Professor
Santayana	PERSON	's vision is keen for the weaknesses of the Protestant and Teutonic temper , -- its emphasis on the supreme importance of success and prosperity , its con - ventional conceptions of duty and earnest ma - terialism , its cheerful optimism , its regard for profitable enterprise and practical ambition as a sort of moral vocation , its tendency to mistake vitality , both in itself and in the luiiverse , for spiritual life . ''

		The point is to accomplish something , no matter particularly what ; so that the Protestant shows on this ground some re - spect even for an artist when he has once achieved success . ''

		In the later chapters there follows an instructive analysis of the main as - pects of the religious life -- piety or loyalty to the necessary conditions of life , spirituality or devotion to ideal ends , and charity ; and in con - clusion there is a discussion of the ideal in - terpretation of immortality .

		The chapter on '' Spirituality and its Corruptions '' -- fanaticism and mysticism , namely -- may be recommended as a particularly good expression of that whole temperamental attitude toward life which is summed up in '' The Life of Reason . ''

		`` Reason in Art '' lends itself especially to quotation , and I can perhaps not do better than to put together as nearly as possible in the writer 's own words some of the points which are particidarly characteristic .

		There are two main aspects to the book .

		On the one hand , it takes up the arts in particular , and , tracing them back to a purely automatic and spontane - ous expressiveness , without ideal value , it tries to show how they come to take on more and more an ideal and rational significance .

		The most no - table thing about the treatment , however , is less its suggestions in detail toward an historical understanding of the arts tlian the general crit - ical attitude which underlies the volume as a whole .

		It woidd be hard to point to a more searching criticism of the irrationalities that enter into the artistic and aesthetic side of ex - perience , or a more effective dealing with the conmion fallacies by which these irrationalities are not merely overlooked but are exalted into essential conditions of art and beauty .

		Starting from the definition of art as that element in the
Life of Reason	ORGANIZATION	which consists in modifying its environment the better to attain its end , the book is a sustained argument against the view which would loosen the fine arts from this fun - damental connection with rational and -- in the end -- social and moral experience .

		The rose 's grace can more easily be plucked from its petals than the beauty of art from its subject , reasons , and use .

		The fine arts are butter to man 's daily bread ; there is no conceiving or creating them except as they
spring	DATE	out of social exi - gencies .

		Irresponsibility in the artist , the rest - ing content with the mere mystic glow of a per - sonal experience , must be fatal to a true and adequate art .

		To be bewitched is not to be saved , though all the magicians and aesthetes in the world should pronounce it so .

		The sponta - neous is the worst of tyrants , for it exercises a needless and fruitless tyranny in the guise of duty and inspiration .

		The earth 's bowels are full of all sorts of rumblings ; which of the oracles drawn thence is true can be judged only by the light of day .

		If an artist 's inspiration has been happy , it has been so because his work can sweeten or ennoble the mind , and because its total effect will be beneficent .

		Art being a part of life , the criticism of art is a part of morals .

		No personal talent avails to rescue an art from labored insignificance when it has no steadying function in the moral world , and must waver between caprice and convention .

		In form , then , art represents that which shoiUd be the goal of life -- experience harmon - ized , seK-justifying , the revelation of an intrin - sic value .

		Beauty gives men the best hint of ultimate good which their experience as yet can offer .

		Its defect lies in the fact that hitherto it has been content with its minor harmonies , and , immersed in them , has failed of any large grasp on reality as a whole .

		And so long as it needs to be a dream , it can never cease to be a disappointment .

		Its facile cruelty , its narcotic abstraction , can never sweeten the evils we re - turn to at home ; it can liberate half the mind only by leaving the other half in abeyance .

		In the mere artist , too , there is always something that falls short of the gentleman and that de - feats the man .

		The poet , at home in the me - divmi , is , in the world he tries to render , apt to be a child and a stranger .

		Poetic apprehen - sion is a makeshift in so far as its cognitive worth is concerned ; it is exactly in this respect what myth is to science .

		The poetic way of idealizing reality is dull , bungling , and impure ; a better acquaintance with things renders such flatteries ridicidous .

		A consequence of this is that a large part of our art is artificial and simply made to be ex - hibited ; it is therefore gratuitous and sophisti - cated , and the greater part of men 's concern
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 with it is affectation .

		A living art does not produce curiosities to be collected , but spiritual necessities to be diffused .

		What we call mu - seums -- mausoleums , rather , in which a dead art heaps up its remains -- are those the places where the Muses intended to dwell ?

		An artist may visit a museimi , but only a pedant can live there .

		But there is possible an art more ade - quate to the
Life of Reason	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such an art must be an achievement , not an indulgence .

		It will rise above the incidental dreams and immature idealizations of poetry as it now is , to a new and clarified poetry which , while having the power of prose to see things as they are and the courage to describe them ingenuously , shall also idealize in the true way , by selecting from this reality what is pertinent to lUtimate interests and can speak eloquently to the soul .

		Art , as mankind has hitherto practised it , too much resembles an opiate or a stimulant .

		It is a dream in which we lose ourselves by ignoring most of our interests , and from which we awake into a world in which that lost episode plays no further part and leaves no heirs .

		Life and history are not thereby rendered better in their principle , but a mere ideal is extracted out of them and presented for our delectation in some cheap material , like words or marble .

		The only precious materials are flesh and blood .

		The moments snatched for art have been generally interludes in life , and its products parasites in nature .

		To exalt fine art into a truly ideal activity , we shoidd have to knit it more closely with other rational functions , so that to beautify things might render them more usefid , and to represent them most imaginatively might be to see them in their tinith .

		To gloat on rhythms and declamations , to live last in imaginary pas - sions and histrionic woes , is an unmanly life , cut off from practical dominion and from ra - tional happiness .

		A lovely dream is an excel - lent thing in itself , but it leaves the world no less a chaos , and makes it by contrast seem even darker than it did .

		That beauty which should have been an inevitable smile on the face of society , an overflow of genuine happiness and power , has to be imported , stimidated artificially , and applied from without ; so that art becomes a sickly ornament for an ugly existence .

		True art is simply an adequate industry ; it arises when industry is carried out to the satisfaction of aU hmnan demands , even of those incidental sensuous demands which we call aesthetic , and which a brutal industry in its haste may despise or ignore .

		To distinguish and create beauty would then be no art relegated to a few ab - stracted spirits playing with casual fancies ; it would be a habit inseparable from practical efficiency .

		All operations , all affairs , would then be viewed in the light of ultimate interests and in their deep relation to hmnan good .

		The arts would thus recover their Homeric glory ; touching human fate as they clearly woidd , they would borrow something of its grandeur and pathos , and yet the interest that worked in them woidd be warm , since it wovdd remain unmistakably animal and sincere .

		Two Recext Books on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		* However disastrous the triumph of Baconian - ism may prove to all Shakespearian biography and to much Shakespeariaji criticism , it will not cause such books as Professor
Stephenson	PERSON	's on ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's
London	LOCATION	'' to depreciate in value .

		The
London	LOCATION	of '' Shake-speare , '' the pseudonymous playwright , is also the
London	LOCATION	of ''
Shaksper	ORGANIZATION	, the
Stratford	LOCATION	actor-manager . ''

		Wherefore , it behooves the scholar who would make a permanent contribution to the subject to be wise in time , and if he can not yet go with the Baconians , at any rate not to exclude him - self from a share in their triumph .

		Professor
Stephenson	PERSON	, however , has not been as wise as this ; while the substance of his book will be equally valuable , whichever way the future may decide the question , he himself gives too many indications of orthodoxy not to be liable to perse - cution when the heretics have their turn .

		And , to say the truth , the orthodox may look for scant quarter in that great day , for they have given none .

		We coiUd wish that Professor
Stephenson	PERSON	's book might commend itself as certainly to the lover of good letters as to the lover of history .

		Its style is hardly worthy of its theme .

		While we are far from wishing to be captious , we can - not praise the following sentences as likely to do honor to American academic culture : '' The plan familiar to us , from
Bacon	LOCATION	's essay Of Building , was followed by many of the Eli ^ - bethan bvulders , though lack of means to buUd , and room for the double court , in the

		90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, sentences are by no means unconunon ; nor is a '' false concord '' absolutely unknown .

		The Shakespearian reminiscence in `` a monument that age can not wither '' -LRB- p. 285 -RRB- , hardly pro- tects the expression from criticism ; and the am - biguity of the sentence quoted below , even in its context , is likely to give pause to the most alert of readers .

		Speaking of the fall of water be - neath
London	LOCATION	Bridge at certain hours , and of its effect on river traffic , the author says : '' If , in the journey , it was necessary to cross the bridge at mid-tide , the passenger had to land and wait '' -LRB- p. 63 -RRB- .

		To such slips , of course , any writer is liable ; but they ought not to occur in a work connected with the study of Shake - speare .

		It is too often forgotten that literary themes involve stylistic obligations .

		The proof - reading , for the most part , is satisfactory , though the first comma in the following clause conceals a well-known Elizabethan idiom : `` whether wheat be good , cheap , or dear '' -LRB- p. 132 -RRB- .

		The spelling of Spenser with a c -LRB- p. 243 -RRB- seems to have escaped both proof-reader and author .

		The index , as is usually the case , is not com - plete , and the usefulness of the book is thereby materially diminished .

		We have f oimd no miportant errors in mat - ters of fact .

		`` The despicable pedant from
Scotland	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 178 -RRB- is perhaps too severe a characterization of James the First , and it is certainly an exaggeration to say that Camden `` s Britannia '' to this day is the starting point of all study of ancient
Britain	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 122 -RRB- ; at least ,
John Ricliard Green	PERSON	did not think so .

		The author , undeterred by Mr.
Sidney Lee	PERSON	, asserts that '' in
1598	DATE	WiUiam Shakespeare was living in the parish '' of St.
Helen	PERSON	's -LRB- p. 205 -RRB- .

		The work is , of course , foimded on Stow 's '' Survey of
London	LOCATION	, '' of which the first edi - tion appeared in
1598	DATE	; and naturally the most interesting parts of it are the quotations from Stow and other contemporary chroniclers .

		But Professor
Stephenson	PERSON	has brought together a large amount of material scattered in modern works and reprints -LRB- p. v. -RRB- , and has illustrated it by frequent quotation from Elizabethan drama - tists .

		We could perhaps have spared some of his facts , many of which are neither important nor relevant , for the sake of a larger number of illustrative passages from the plays , '' The
Shoemaker	PERSON	's Holiday '' and '' The Knight of the Burning Pestle , '' for example , are mines of in - teresting allusion that coidd have been worked to advantage .

		We must not , of course , find faidt with Professor
Stephenson	PERSON	for not doing what he did not undertake to do , but we are per - suaded that his accounts of Elizabethan places and customs wovdd have been more vivid and interesting if confirmed by constant reference to dramatic literature .

		As it is , his book will render intelligible many an obscure allusion .

		It will not , however , give its readers a clear or a unified picture of Elizabethan
London	LOCATION	.

		We can fancy such a picture , a composition , not a catalogue , sufficiently detailed to have reality , and so vivified and harmonized by the construc - tive imagination as to leave upon the reader 's mind much the same impression as the pictur - esque old city must itself have left on all who had eyes to see it .

		This , perhaps , will be the delightfid residt of such work as Professor Ste - phenson 's .

		Meantime , we may be content with the glimpses that he gives us of rural
London	LOCATION	, and its '' fair hedge-rows of elm trees , with bridges and easy stiles to pass over into the pleasant fields , very commodious for citizens therein to walk , shoot , and otherwise to recreate and refresh their dull spirits in the sweet and wholesome air '' -LRB- Stow -RRB- ; the cottages in the suburbs '' for poor bedrid people , '' ' who lay '' in their bed within their window , which was toward the street , open so low that every man might see them , a clean linen cloth lying in their win - dow , and a pair of beads , to show that there lay a bedrid body , unable but to pray only , '' ap - pealing to the charity of the devout ; the fires burning in the city streets thrice a week to cleanse the air polluted by the refuse of the '' kennels '' ; and the bell of
St. Sepulchre	LOCATION	's toll - ing for the execution of criminals , while the bell - man read , as the malefactors passed the church , `` All good people pray heartily imto God for these poor sinners who are now going to their death for whom the great bell doth toll . ''

		In the chapter on the theatres , the author makes the interesting suggestion that the hut above the stage , which figures in several contemporary prints , contained the machinery that operated the traverse -LRB- pp. 320 , 323 -RRB- .

		The book is illustrated with many interesting and unusual prints , plans , and maps .

		Alto gether , it is a usefid addition to the library of the student of the Elizabethan drama .

		It is quite true , as Mr.
Isaac Hull Piatt	PERSON	re - marks in his '' Bacon Cryptograms in Shake - speare , '' that while the '' Shaksperians '' are in possession , they are not in undisturbed posses - sion .

		Mr.
Piatt	PERSON	's little book is the latest at - tempt to create such a disturbance .

		And at the outset we feel botmd to say that while we do not find Mr.
Piatt	PERSON	's argimients convincing , we quite
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 91 agree with him that the ' * Shaksperians '' who have taken part in the controversy have rather often confounded ridicule and refutation .

		Im - plications of asininity and idiocy no doubt '' • im - part a gusto , '' as
Charles Lamb	PERSON	woidd say , to the pages of the •
' Saturday	DATE	Review , '' but they are not war .

		We would not , therefore , lay our - selves open to the charge of failing to approach ' • Bacon Cryptograms * ' in a spirit of becoming seriousness .

		The book consists of eight more or less con - nected papers , the most important of which are '' The Bacon Cryptograms in Love 's Labours Lost , '' which deals with the Latin of Act V. , Scene I. , '' The
Bacon Cryptograms	PERSON	in the Shake-speai-e Quartos , '' '' and • • The Testimony of the

		Piatt 's tone is emi - nently moderate . ''

		I \* ` ish distinctly to deny , '' he says , '' that what I am about to present proves
Bacon	PERSON	's authorship of the Plays .

		WTiat I do claim , and I think in reason , is that they seem to constitute grounds for a very strong suspicion that he was in some manner concerned in their production or associated with them '' -LRB- p. 2 -RRB- .

		The argiunents presented are so detailed that it is impossible to do them justice in a brief summary .

		Roughly it may be said that Mr.
Piatt	PERSON	resolves the nonsense word '' honori - ficabditudinatibus '' -LRB- L.L.L. , 5 .

		44 -RRB- into '' ^ Hi ludL tuiti sibi , Fr .

		Bacono nati , ^ which may be translated , ' These plays , originating with
FrancLs Bacon	PERSON	, are protected for them - selves , ' or ' entrusted to themselves , ' '' of which it is doubtful whether the Latin or the English is more cryptic : that he finds the name
Bacon	PERSON	in the headpieces of the quartos of The Taming of a Shrew , The First Part of the Contention , and Richard 11 .

		; and that
Jonson	PERSON	's connection with the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	and his relations with
Bacon	PERSON	and ''
Shaksper	PERSON	, the actor-manager , '' '' seem to bring
Bacon	PERSON	pretty close to , at least , an editorial asso - ciation with the Folio . ''

		It must be admitted that in dealing with the last of these points he has taken a neat vengeance on Mr.
Churton Collins	PERSON	, whose paper on • • The Bacon-Shake - speare Mania '' in his '' Studies in Shakespeare '' must be cheerless reading to all Baconians .

		Mr.
Collins	PERSON	rashly asserts that • • there is not a par - ticle of evidence that
Jonson	PERSON	gave the smallest assistance to
Bacon	LOCATION	in translating any of his works into Latin '' -LRB- p. 352 -RRB- ; and adds in a footnote , referring to
Archbishop Temson	ORGANIZATION	's
Baconiana	LOCATION	, `` the only translator named is
Herbert	LOCATION	.

		* ' i ^ Ir .

		Piatt shows that a few pages further on ,
Tenison	PERSON	says . ''

		The Latin transla - tion of them was a work performed by divers hands ; by those of Doctor Hacket ... Mr.
Benjamin Johnson	PERSON	-LRB- the learned and judicious poet -RRB- , and some others ... '' We have already intimated that we do not find Mr.
Piatt	PERSON	's reasoning cogent or his posi - tions tenable .

		Yet it woidd not be profitable to imdertake a refutation here .

		As he truly says , '' the argument for the Baconian author - ship depends upon a vast mass of circumstantia evidence .

		It is not a chain , but a bundle of rods .

		Whether
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	can break it or not , remains to be seen ; but to pull out one or two of the weak - est of the rods from the bimdle and triumphantly proclaim their weakness does not materially affect the strength of the case '' -LRB- p. 101 -RRB- .

		But supposing one rod after another is withdrawn from the bimdle , here and there , by this student or that , and neatly broken ?

		In any given dis - cussion , we may admit that the body of testi - mony in favor of the Baconian authorship is not invalidated ; but when all the important argu - ments have been severally demolished , as we believe they have been , the case collapses .

		This , of course , assimies that the Baconians have irrefragable evidence enough to put the Shake - spearians on the defensive , which we are far from admitting .

		Let us take a rod or two at random .

		Mr.
Piatt	PERSON	quotes
Davies	PERSON	's sonnet to
Bacon	LOCATION	, the last lines of which are , -- '' My Muse thus notes thy worth in every line !

		With yncke which thus she sugars ; so .

		to shine , '' and comments , '' The allusion in the last line , ... to Shake-speare 's ' sugared sonnets among his
pri %	PERCENT	` ate friends ' seems very obvious '' -LRB- p. 28 -RRB- .

		To which we reply , only to a convinced Baconian .

		The name
Bacon	PERSON	, that he discovers in the head - pieces of certain quartos , is , we assert , visible only to the eye of faith .

		The discovery of a
Bacon	LOCATION	cryptogram at the beginning and end of Lucrece is -- we try to ' • deliver all with charity ' '' -- absurd .

		His interpretation of the Latin of '' Love 's Labour 's Lost '' is incoherent and unintelligible , and of the nonsense word still more nonsensical .

		His notion that the Lucy caricatures -LRB- he seems to be unaware that 2
Henry IV	PERSON	.

		contains one of the best -RRB- were suggested to the playwright by the
Stratford	LOCATION	actor-manager from his own experience , is , to put it mildly , fantastic .

		He believes the address '' To the Great Variety of Readers , '' in the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	, to be by
Bacon	LOCATION	, partly because it is '' tophea ^ y with legal phrases '' ; but he forgets that legal phraseology is a literary convention of the period , as the sonneteers bear witness .

		He cites the passage , dear to the Baconian heart , from Timber , in which
Jonson	PERSON	says of
Bacon 92 THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, that he `` performed that in our tongue which may be compared or preferred either to insolent
Greece	LOCATION	or haughty
Rome	LOCATION	, '' and reminds us that in the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	lines
Jonson	PERSON	applies almost the same words to the author of the plays .

		But
Jonson	PERSON	in both passages is imitating
Seneca	LOCATION	; the original contains the words insolenti Grce - ciae , and it is surely not remarkable that a scholar should apply to different persons an in - teresting literary allusion , especially when it con - tains a sonorous phrase into the bargain .

		Mr.
Piatt	PERSON	exclaims , we believe in jest : '' Think of it -- the author of Hamlet allowing his daugh - ters to be brought up without being taught to write !

		That fact alone is sufficient to put Mr.
William Shaksper	PERSON	out of court . ''

		If inatten - tion to the education of one 's daughters is to be regarded as a test of the authenticity of one 's works , '' Paradise Lost '' must no longer be at - tributed to that very neglectfvJ parent ,
John Milton	PERSON	, but to the '' syndicate of which
Elwood	PERSON	was president , '' referred to by Mr.
Churton Col	PERSON	- lins -LRB- `` Studies in Shakespeare , '' p. 333 -RRB- .

		Such are some of the rods , and such their frangibility .

		The Shakespearians may breathe a sigh of relief , and resimie their immemorial repose .

John C. Reed	PERSON	of
Atlanta	LOCATION	, for - influencein marly a Confederate soldier and a our history .

		member of the
Ku Klux Klan	PERSON	, is the author of an interesting volume called `` The Broth - ers ' War '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is not an account of the Civil War , but a philosophical explanation of the differences between
North and South	ORGANIZATION	during the nineteenth century , -- a treatise on the negro influence in American history .

		Mr.
Reed	PERSON	writes in the best of temper , out of the fulness of personal knowledge on some subjects and in curious ignorance on others .

		In his introduction he tells the South that it must recognize that slavery had to be destroyed because it stood in the way of national unity , and that it must now allow free and calm discussion of the race question ; on the other hand , the North , he says , must acknowledge that slavery was mainly a good to the blacks and an evU to the whites ; that the negroes of great ability are not fair representatives of their race but are tinctured with white blood ; that the
Ku Klux Klan	PERSON	did a great work in saving the South from Afri - canization ; and , finally , that the piu-ity and sin - cerity of the Southern ante-bellmn leaders must be conceded .

		Some of the topics treated are : Slavery as a disruptive force , and as a social and economic institution ; the struggle between free and slave labor ; the nationalization of the North and of the South , which practically resulted in two nations under one government ; abolitionists and '' fire-eaters '' ;
Calhoun	PERSON	,
Webster	PERSON	,
Davis	PERSON	,
Toombs	PERSON	, and `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin '' ; and the race question .

		In the long strife between North and South the writer 's opinion is that both sides were right , but he has small regard for the moral convictions of abolitionists and the principles of '' fire-eaters , '' whom he considers natu - ral phenomena .

		The `` powers unseen '' -- that is , natural forces , or evolution , -- fought on the side of the North and gave to that section the victory .

		Mr.
Reed	PERSON	, by personal observation and long experience in the Black Belt , was well acquainted with slavery , and is an authority on the present condition of the blacks ; but while he asserts the great advantages of free over slave labor , he seems not to understand the real economic evil at the basis of slavery ; nor does he explain exactly how slavery injured the Southern whites , though he states that it was an evil to the whites .

		In fact , like some other Black Belt writers , he seems to lose sight of the fact that the South had free as well as slave labor , that most of the whites were non-slaveholders , and that mainly upon this class fell the evils of the system .

		Speak - ing only of the mass of the blacks , he compares their condition under slavery with their present situation under the crop-lien , convict-lease system , and peonage , and decides that their later state is the worse .

		Though weak in his knowledge of the statistics and economics of slavery , he sees that it is better for the whites that the system was destroyed .

		Mr.
Reed	PERSON	states that in
Georgia	LOCATION	he has observed that the negro is losing ground in shops and mines , on the farm , and as a servant , and he believes that the race can not stand against the competition of the white .

		The small upper class of negroes who have won their economic freedom is left out of considera - tion .

		The book is valuable because it is written by one who is familiar with much that he writes about ; but there are many who will hardly agree with some of the conclusions presented .

		Convenient volumes that one can take to the fire , and that are cut up into short chapters that stimulate without taxing the brain , are always attractive to the book - lover .

		Sir
Lewis Morris	PERSON	, hitherto known to readers as a poet , now offers a collection of twenty-eight short papers and addresses , which he collectively entitles `` The New Rambler '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		`` He will , '' he says in his preface , referring to himself in the third person , '' be well content should his .

		attempts in prose meet with a measure of the suc - cess awarded to those which he has only heretofore made in verse . ''

		Merely noting by the way the curi - ous misplacing of '' only '' in this sentence , we pass on to the body of the book , which contains some very good reading .

		Especially commendable are his remarks on '' The Place of Poetry in Education . ''

Ruskin	PERSON	's Stones of

Milton	PERSON	and Spenser were unfortunate in the choice of a theme for their great poems .

		What he says , in his strictures on current criticism of poetry , about a '' conspiracy of silence '' among critics , is a familiar cry ; yet who but a dis - appointed poet would say it is not also a foolish and groundless complaint ?

		Sir
Lewis Morris	PERSON	, however , is far from being an unsuccessful poet , for he tells VIS on another page that his '' Epic of Hades '' '' ran through three editions of

Lord Tennyson	PERSON	, hastened to acknowledge the merit of the somewhat audacious new writer . ''

		Once upon a time , as Sir
Lewis	PERSON	will doubtless remember , an author who com - plained of this diabolical '' conspiracy of silence '' was advised to join the conspiracy .

		One whose books of poetry sell to the extent of Sir

		Ap - preciative and somewhat extended mention is made of Mr.

Archer Butler Hulbert	PERSON	, author of `` Historic Highways . ''

		In
1783	DATE	, before resigning from the army ,
Washington	LOCATION	wrote a friend : '' I shall not rest contented till I have explored the
Western Country	ORGANIZATION	and traversed those lines ... which have given bounds to a new Empire . ''

		Already , between
1748	DATE	and
1783	DATE	, he had made five trips to various parts of the western country .

		This last and longest journey , through western
Maryland	LOCATION	, western
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and northwestern
Virginia	LOCATION	, was un - dertaken in
September , 1784	DATE	, for two purposes :
Washington	LOCATION	wanted , first , to look after the extensive tracts of western lands belonging to him , which squatters were settling upon and speculators were offering for sale in
Europe	LOCATION	; and , second , as he had stated , '' to obtain information of the nearest and best communication between the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	and West - ern waters , and to facilitate as much as lay in my power the island navigation of the Potomac . ''

		The Diary is almost entirely a study of the western highway problem .


Washington	LOCATION	's belief was that '' there is nothing which binds one country or one state to another but interest '' ; and this '' cement of interest '' was needed to attach to the East the rap - idly growing West , whose people `` stand as it were on a pivot , and the touch of a feather would almost incline them either way . ''

		It was necessary , for political as well as commercial reasons , that the West be opened up to the
East	LOCATION	, and not be left to cast its lot politically and commercially with the Spaniards of the South or the British of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		And as a good Virginian ,
Washington	LOCATION	was con - vinced that the proper route from the
East	LOCATION	to the
West	LOCATION	lay through
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		The Diary shows that on this western trip he sought for and obtained detailed information about every river and creek and valley that could possibly be used for purposes of com - merce .

		After careful investigation , he concluded that an all -
Virginia	LOCATION	route to the West was not practicable ; but that
Maryland	LOCATION	, which was willing , and
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, which was unwilling , must also assist in the undertaking and share the benefits with
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	's part has been to edit care - fully the Diary , which has not before been published as a whole , and to add a careful essay on the '' Awakening of the West , '' which is , so to speak , a translation of the Diary into modern narrative , with explanations of the text .


Washington	LOCATION	's spelling of proper names was phonetic and eccentric , and for the general reader Mr.
Hulbert	PERSON	has performed genuine service in explaining the crabbed text and the picturesque orthography .

		According to him , the great value of the
Diary	ORGANIZATION	is to throw a side-light upon the
Washington	LOCATION	who was `` First in Peace , '' -- the daring explorer , the shrewd clear-headed busi - ness man , the '' first commercial American . ''

		whose influence upon American expansion and upon the policy of internal improvements was so profound , -- `` the greatest man in
America	LOCATION	had there been no Revolutionary War . ''

		_ - ^ , The soldier on parade should have jyi :
Osier	PERSON	* ^ in pithy his nerves under such control that paragraphs .

		^ spider might Spin its web over his face without causing so much as the twitching of a muscle .

		This perfect self-command , in small wor - ries as in larger anxieties and dangers , is repeatedly and emphatically enjoined upon the physician by Dr.
William Osier	PERSON	in his '' Aequanimitas , '' and else - where .

		From his numerous addresses and printed papers a handy volume of '' Counsels and Ideals '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has been compiled , with the author 's consent and cooperation , by Dr.
C. N. B. Camac	PERSON	.

		From the days of Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	, to go no further back , our polite literature has been en - riched with the productions of physician-authors , the humanities and the beneficent art of healing having 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, a certain natural inter-relationship , or consanguinity .

		To this noble line of wielders of both pen and scal - pel , to whom Dr.
Osier	PERSON	more than once refers with professional pride , his own name has ab-eady been added by the reading public .

		His claiming of
Keats	PERSON	as one of the physician-poets may at first produce a slight interrogative uplift of eyebrows ; but it ap - pears that the author of '' Endymion '' was in fact a licensed surgeon , however completely one may have forgotten his brief term of hospital practice .

		What most impresses one on examining this selection from forty-seven of the author 's fugitive pieces is not only the professional and practical wisdom displayed , and the breadth of view revealed , but also the wide read - ing in writers not commonly held to be a necessary part of a doctor 's library .

		Even a careless turning of the leaves of '' Counsels and Ideals '' brings to light many apt allusions to and quotations from
Plato	LOCATION	,
Aristotle	LOCATION	,
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Bunyan	PERSON	,
Sterne	PERSON	,
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
George Eliot	PERSON	, and numerous others .

		Of especial interest to young physicians , this book also attracts the general reader by reason of its fine literary quality , to say nothing of the sound substance to which this quality serves as a sauce .

		An instructive commentary on a certain pet theory of the author 's is furnished by the dates at which the forty-seven cited addresses and essays were delivered or published .

		Only one is dated ear - lier than 1890 , while fifteen belong to the years 1900-1905 .

		Take
1849	DATE	as a subtrahend , and be - hold the result !

		Romantic When a successful historical novelist episodes in turns historian in the sober sense , we
Illinois	LOCATION	hutory .

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ readable book .

		When he has for his subject so significant a region as the
State of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	, we may count also upon a remarkable degree of interest .

		This is the case of Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	, whose '' Historic Illinois : The Romance of the Early Days , '' has recently been pub - lished by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It remains to be added that the author has made use of a wide range of good authorities , and has not allowed imag - ination -LRB- save as far as picturesque effect is concerned -RRB- to get the better of fact .

		It is his bold but not ai > parently exaggerated contention that no State of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	surpasses
Illinois	LOCATION	in the romantic incidents of early days .

		These are full of color , action , and ad - venture , for above these peaceful plains and woods once waved the flags of four contending nations , while men of the white race and the red strove continually for mastery .

		A few of Mr.
Parrish	PERSON	's subjects may be mentioned to illustrate the richness of his field .

		There are the mound-builders , the
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	massacre , and the Black Hawk War .

		There are the explorations and adventm ` es of
Marquette	LOCATION	,
La Salle	LOCATION	, and
Tonty	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are the stories of the Spanish invasion , of
Clark	PERSON	's expedition , and of the Mormon expulsion .

		There are the narratives of lead - mining , border outlawry , and the struggle against slavery .

		And there are special chapters upon such subjects as the story of the capital , notable border characters , and old steamboat days .

		There are also many illustrations .

		Altogether the book is highly attractive , and wUl be found particularly useful in the schools , every one of which shoidd be provided with a copy .

		Mrs.
Boas	PERSON	's `` With
Milton	PERSON	and the
Milton	PERSON	and his Cavaliers '' -LRB-
James Pott & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not contemporaries .

		, .

		^ n • i - i an instructive or a well-written book .

		It is a compilation of familiar facts concerning seventeenth century notables , made in accordance with the theory that `` we must follow the lives of those of
Milton	LOCATION	's time who helped to make En - gland what he knew it '' in order that we may have '' some faint appreciation of the difticulties in which his lot was cast , and to which perhaps he owed the clearest insight poet has ever shown into the won - derful dealings of the Creator , and ` man 's first disobedience . ' ''

		The papers , however , are not con - nected in any way , and therefore fail to suggest the unified view of the period , at which Mrs.
Boas	PERSON	aims .

		The style is rambling and inconsequent , the paragraphing eccentric , and the author 's critical and interpretative comments feeble .

		The following is her remark on the style of Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	: '' He was a most industrious writer throughout his long life , and his works well repay careful study ... His style has a charm of its own , and one which left its mark upon the prose of the time at which he wrote . ''

		The author has not even the doubtful merit of a good strong prejudice on either side of the great seventeenth century struggle .

		The Latin dedication to the memory of Professor
York Powell	PERSON	, however , is charming .

		We are grateful , too , for the follow - ing passage on the child 's vision of the world , from
Traherne	PERSON	's `` Centuries of Meditation '' : `` The com was orient and immortal wheat which never should be reaped nor was ever sown .

		I thought it had stood from everlasting to everlasting .

		The dust and stones of the street were as precious as gold : the gates were at first the end of the world .

		The green trees when I saw them first through one of the gates transported and ravished me ; their sweetness and unusual beauty made my heart to leap , and almost mad with eestacy , they were such strange and wonderful things .

		... Boys and girls tumbling in the street were moving jewels : I knew not that they were bom or should die ... The city seemed to stand in
Eden	ORGANIZATION	or to be built in
Heaven	LOCATION	.

		The streets were mine , the temple was mine , the people were mine , their clothes and gold and silver were mine , as much as their sparkling eyes , fair skins , and ruddy faces .

		The skies were mine , and so were the sun and moon and stars , and all the world was mine ; and I the only spectator and enjoyer of it . ''

Silas A. Lottridge	PERSON	's `` Animal Snapshots and How Made '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		It occasions no misgivings about the author 's accm-acy , `` and causes even the ordinary reader little embar - rassment at his own ignorance .

		Lovers of nature - sensations may call the book commonplace , and so in a sense it is , for the animals it presents in text and pictures are those with which every farmer 's boy is familiar -- woodchuck , musk-rat , squirrel , fox , and raccoon , -- and the birds are those we all know .


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 95 There are no thrilling tales , except as the tragedies of all out-door life are thrilling to readers who have sympathies .

		The author does not even make as much as he might out of his heroic struggles for photographs of the shyer creatures ; indeed the obvi - ous faiJt of the book is that it does not emphasize the method of securing pictures enough to justify its title .

		But the very familiarity of the subjects endears them , and the author 's modesty is refresh - ing .

		The only danger is that the reader , taking comfort in much that he already knows , will miss the rarer quality of certain passages .

		There is plenty of implicit poetry in some of the descriptions , such as that of a tryst with the gray squirrels at dawn , when `` there is a regular tattoo of sounds on the forest floor , caused by tiny showers of dew shaken from the leaves , as the squirrels leap from the end of one slender branch to another . ''

		And as for originality , nothing more need be said than that Mr.
Lottridge	PERSON	placed a microphone in the wall of his bluebird box , and attached a telephone to it , so that he heard all the family conversations during the nesting season .

		The photographs are all enjoy - able , while a few of them -- that of a muskrat swim - ming , of a woodcock on her nest , and of a chicken - hawk • * at attention '' -- are triumphs of the art .

		„ ... The fourth volume of ` Mi .

		Herbert English men r - ''`` ^ i t - > and measures
Paul	PERSON	s '' History of Modern En - fromi876tois85 .

		gland '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- covers the ten years from
1876	DATE	to
1885	DATE	.

		As in the preceding volumes -LRB- previously reviewed in The Dial -RRB- the author 's method is that of strict chronological nar - rative , basetl on a study of
Parliamentary Papers	ORGANIZATION	and of the few biographies and memoirs so far available .

		His work is everywhere compact , but his terse and vigorous stj ` le gives emphasis to what might otherwise easily read like a mere summary of political events .

		In the present volume also , Mr.
Paul	PERSON	evidently feels himself much more familiar with the conditions he is studying and much more free to give a personal judgment upon the policies adopted or upon the acts of parliamentary leaders .

		He is himself a Liberal in politics and has been a Member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, so that his criticisms must necessarily be read with allowance for his point of view .

		Yet he is free in his criticisms of both par - ties , and his intimate knowledge of the inner work - ings of political life , and his personal acquaintance ' with the men he is describing , render such criticisms well worth while in themselves .

		In general he is inclined to attack the policies of the Tory partj - , and to criticise his own party simply on the ground of errors in political manoeuvring .

		As this history approaches the present time and becomes more per - .

		tinent to present-day conditions , it assumes a livelier tone , and many little-known but illuminative anec - dotes of men are introduced that serve to render the history itself much more attractive .

		Disraeli 's flippant yet piercing phrases ,
Gladstone	PERSON	's ponderous oratorical effects , or Bright 's clear-cut analyses of conditions , all help to leave an impress of the men themselves .

		The fifth and concluding volume of Mr.
Paul	PERSON	's work , approaching still nearer to the present time , should be of yet greater interest to those who wish an understanding of contemporary English politics .

		A contribution ' ^ ^ WiUiam
Lloyd Garrison	PERSON	centen - to the
Garrison	PERSON	nial anniversary has elicited from the anniversary .

		pg ^ ^ f Mr.
Ernest Crosby	PERSON	a little vol - ume entitled `` Garrison the Non-Resistant , '' which comes from the
Public Publishing Company of Chi	ORGANIZATION	- cago .

		Considering the history of the past few years , it is a fact of hopeful significance that such a char - acter as that of Garrison has received so generous and widespread recog ^ tion as the hundredth anni - versary of his birth has called forth .

		There are many who assert , and who doubtless honestly be - lieve , that
Garrison	PERSON	was a drag rather than a help to the anti-slavery cause , for the reason that his methods were not generally adopted , and because the actual freeing of the slaves came about as an incident of a policy to which he was ardently op - posed .

		Those who go below the surface know the shallowness of such a view .

		Just such an agitation as
Garrison	PERSON	led was absolutely essential to that re - vulsion of public opinion without which the freedom of the slave , by any method whatever , was an utter impossibility .

		We can not agree with Mr.
Crosby	PERSON	in his criticism of Gfarrison for not throwing las talents as a reformer into the cause of labor in its conflict with capital .

		Freedom or slavery was a clean-cut question of right and wrong ; there were good and bad people on both sides , but one side was essentially right in what it asked and the other essentially wrong .

		No such clearly definable issue has as yet appeared in the struggle between capi - talists and laborers .

		Also , while we agree with Mr.
Crosby	PERSON	in his ardent opposition to war , we can hardly assent to his view that G ^ arrison 's abolition - ism was a mere incident in his career as a non - resistant .

		Apart from these possible flaws , however , Mr.
Crosby	PERSON	has written a wholesome book for the times , and we hope that it will have a wide reading .

		Comments on - ^ Volume of 320 pages in which there things and places , axe thirty-eight essays or articles on books and men .

		^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ j ^ iy different and un - related as `` The Tannery at Mondoa '' and `` The Religious Significance of Precious Stones '' presents some difficulties to the reviewer which are not re - concilable to the usual critical standards .

		The final chapter , '' Chips from a Literary Workshop , '' adds fifty different topics commented upon in short paragraphs ; and all of this material goes to make up the latest published work of Mr.
Frederic Row	PERSON	- land
Marvin	PERSON	, `` The Companionship of Books , and Other Papers '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The author has here collected articles , essays , notes and scraps , often - times mere parag ^ phs or sentences about various things , -- books , places , and men .

		Some of the longer articles have been published in magazines ; others are here printed for the first time .

		To judge of the whole as literature is out of the question .

		To THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, read it as the note-book of a man well-read and broadly interested in a vast niunber of things , lit - erary and otherwise , is the best method of approach .

		Mr.
Marvin	PERSON	has covered a large field in his choice of subjects , and they sound well as titles , but are often disappointing in their imfolding .

		He fails to realize an ideal in the chapter on '' The Companion - ship of Books , '' but he is tender and sympathetic over the tomb of
Heloise	ORGANIZATION	and
Abelard	PERSON	and the story of Paolo and
Francesca	PERSON	.

		He is perhaps at his best when musing over the qualities of an old friend or some obscure hero .

		He becomes lugubrious when lingering in graveyards or writing about `` The Modern View of Death '' or `` Dust to Dust , '' etc. , etc. .

		Mr.
Marvin	PERSON	recalls to our minds a number of forgotten themes in a pleasant way , and says a great many good and wise things in a plain and simple manner .

		There is in his writings a little of the preacher and a little of the teacher and a good deal of the philosopher , but less of the literary man than one might expect to find in such a volume .

		A lively study ^ fortunate choice of subject and a of '' La Grande decided skUl in presenting it places Mademoiselle : ' ^ jae .

		ArvMe Barine 's ''
Louis XIV	ORGANIZATION	.

		and La Grande Mademoiselle '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- in quite a different class from the perfunctory and colorless studies of the heroines of the old French regime which are turned out in large numbers at every publishing season .

		It would perhaps be more diffi - cult to write a dull book about '' La Grande Made - moiselle '' than a brilliant one .

		But Mme.
Barine	PERSON	has made her heroine 's strange personality so vivid and individual , and has entered so thoroughly into the spirit of her mad vagaries and misgmded im - pulses , that the narrative has all the vivacity of fiction , though at the same time its historical care and accuracy are evident at every turn .

		This vol - imie takes up the career of Mile , de Montpensier where the same author 's previous study , `` The Youth of La Grande Mademoiselle '' dropped it , just at the close of the Fronde .

		MUe .

		de
Montpen	PERSON	- sier never lost the ideals of her youth and accepted the new regime of absolute monarchy and abased nobility only after a life-time 's hopeless struggle .

		Next to depicting her heroine , Mme.
Barine	PERSON	has been interested in making intelligible the enigmat - ical personality of the young king , so different from the old man of
Saint-Simon	ORGANIZATION	's `` M ^ moires , '' and in showing how he imposed his ideas of kingship , which were Spanish rather than French , upon his generation .

		Altogether , she has written a delightful study of a fascinating epoch .

		The translation , which is anonymous , is easy and unaffected .

		There are thirty illustrations from contemporaneous sources .

		Rose Eytinge was in the hey-day of her popularity during the `` palmy days '' of the American drama , -- the days of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	,
Lester Wallack	PERSON	,
E. L. Daven	PERSON	- port , and
Augustin Daly	PERSON	, of all of whom she was the associate and personal friend .

		She entered the pro- An American actress of the old school .

		fession when a mere girl ; success followed so fast that in a few years she was playing with Booth , of whom she has several pleasant personal anecdotes to relate in her entertaining autobiography , '' The Memories of Rose Eytinge '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The most interesting portions of the book deal with the larger professional career of Miss Eytinge , when she be - came one of the best known of our women players ; with her official residence in
Cairo	LOCATION	, as the wife of the American representative ,
George H. Butler	PERSON	; with her return to the stage as a member of the famous Union Square Company -- her ''
Rose Michel	PERSON	'' days ; with her triiunphs in
London	LOCATION	, where she became acquainted with
Charles Dickens	PERSON	,
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	,
Edmund Yates	PERSON	,
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gladstone	PERSON	, and others as well known .

		The book abounds in interesting bits of reminiscence , anec - dotes , and incidents of public characters , with side - lights on theii '' idiosyncrasies , -- forming the naive chronicles and observations of over half a century .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Two new volumes in the attractive '' Oxford Poets , '' published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, are the '' Complete Poetical Works of
William Cowper	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
H. S. Milford	PERSON	, and a reprint of the three-volume edi - tion of
Browning	PERSON	's poems issued in
1863	DATE	, with ''
Pau	LOCATION	- line '' and two short fugitive pieces added .

		Especially welcome is the Cowijer volume , which includes every poem of his hitherto printed except the translations of Homer and ''
Adamo	PERSON	, '' with full and careful editorial apparatus .

		These well-printed and inexpensive edi - tions of the poets deserve high praise . ''

		The American Catalog '' -LRB- sic -RRB- now sent us from the office of `` The Publishers ' Weekly , '' covers the five years 1900-4 inclusive , and is a thick volume of about fifteen himdred pages , each year being paged sepa - rately .

		It differs from the other volume of the same title in giving f idl title entries with annotations , instead of condensed titles .

		It is practically a reprint , sys - tematized into one alphabet for each year , from the weekly record of `` The Publishers ' Weekly , '' and is , of coxu-se , a work of mdispensable importance to librarians , editors , and booksellers .

		The publishers plan to issue a similar volume at the end of each five-year period . ''

		The Chief American Poets , '' edited by Mr.
Curtis Hidden Page	PERSON	, and published by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a companion volume to the same edi - tor 's '' British Poets of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It aims to provide not an anthology , but a corpus of the best work of the nine poets included , who are
Bryant	PERSON	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Whitman	PERSON	, and
Lanier	PERSON	.

		Since the volume has over seven himdred two-columned closely-printed pages , it is not impossible to give a fairly adequate representation of this number of poets .

		The work of the editor includes an introduction , footnotes , indexes , biographical sketches , and bibliographies .

		Each bibliography has four sections : editions , biography and reminiscences , criticism , and tributes in verse .

		The number of references here given is sufficient for a fairly complete study of each of the poets concerned , and it is particularly for this feature of the volume that we are grateful .

		THE DIAL 97
Lippincott	PERSON	's '' Complete Pronouncing Gazetteer , or Greographical Dictionary of the World '' has been for many years one of the works of reference absolutely indispensable to every school , library , and home , not merely because it has had no riyal , but also because it has been , in its successive editions , a work of such thorough execution ^ d admirable plan as to leave no room for adverse criticism .

		A work of this sort , of course , must be revised at intervals , and the book in question has now been given a very complete revision at the hands of Messrs.
Angelo	PERSON	and
Louis HeUprin	PERSON	.

		It is printed in new type from cover to cover just half a century from the appearance of its first edition .

		There are upwards of two thousand two-columned pages .

		No better idea of the great advances made of late in the field of artistic photography could be gained than from the volume called '' Photograms of the Year , '' published by
Messrs. Tennant & Ward	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		This is a collection of reproductions and criticisms of typical photographic pictures of the year just closed , compiled by the staff of the English '' Photographic Monthly , '' assisted by
A. C. R. Carter	PERSON	.

		There are re - ports from
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	,
Wid Spain	LOCATION	, besides a general retrospect of '' ITie Work of the Year '' and detailed accoimts of the two great Eng - lish exhibitions of
1905	DATE	.

		More than one himdred and fifty representative photographs , finely reproduced and printed , illiLstrate the pages of this interesting volume .

		The annual volume of proceedings of the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	, reporting the
Asbury Park	LOCATION	meeting of
last July	DATE	, has now been published , and will be foimd to contain a series of discussions , quite as im - portant as usual , of most of the educational topics of timely Interest .

		Even more valuable , in some respects , are the three special reports , separately printed , that accompany the main volume .

		The subjects of these reports are industrial education in rural schools , taxa - tion in its relation to education , and the present condi - tions of salary , tenure , and pension , under which the teachers of the
United States	LOCATION	are performing their poorly-rewarded labors .

		These reports ought to serve as the basis of an early improvement in the professional status of the teacher , and of a widened sense of respon - sibility in the matter of taxation .

		Particular interest attaches to the new volume of English '' Book-Prices Ctirrent '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
Elliot Stock	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- because of the unusual number of rare and valuable books which have been sold at auction during the sea - son of
1905	DATE	.

		Some sixty-nine works , most of them in sin - gle volumes , brought their owners over
# 24,000	MONEY	.

		Fust iind
Schaeffer	PERSON	's Psalter of
1459	DATE	, the Countess of Pem - broke 's '' Au Tonie , '' dated
1595	DATE	,
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	's '' Book called
Caton	PERSON	, '' and twenty-one
Shakespeariana	PERSON	were among the great prizes of the year .

		Another item of unusual mterest to collectors is the catalogue , running to ninety pages , of the library of the late Mr.
John Scott	PERSON	, of
Largs	LOCATION	,
Ayrshire	LOCATION	, whose volumes of English history , because of their extreme rarity , have an interest for the biblio - phile quite out of proportion to their market value .

		This new volimie of '' Book Prices Current '' has , like its predecessors , been very carefully compiled and fully indexed .

		The subject index which formerly stood at the beginning of the work has been united with the general index , and the whole now appears in one alpha - bet at the end .

		On the whole , bibliophiles will find the new volume more than ordinarily interesting and useful ; while to booksellers and librarians it is , of course , an ndispensable working tool .

Jonas Viles	PERSON	, and gives us nearly three hundred pages of carefully-selected text , besides the notes .

		Similar volumes of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Adams	PERSON	, 98 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	,
Franklin	PERSON	, and
Hamilton	PERSON	, are mentioned as being in prep - ai-ation .

		These books are a positive boon for teachers of history in our schools .


Herr Julius WolfP	PERSON	's rhymed narrative of '' The Wild
Huntsman	PERSON	, '' first published thirty years ago , has foiuid a skilful translator in Mr.
Ralph Davidson	PERSON	, and a sym - pathetic illustrator in Mr.
Woldeniar Friedrich	PERSON	, the combined product now making an English book pub - lished by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	. ''

		The Book of Photography , Practical , Theoretic , and Applied , '' edited by Mr.
Paul N. Hasluck	PERSON	, is pub - lished by
Messrs. Cassell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a big book of some eight hundred pages , encyclopaedic in scope , and abimdantly illustrated .

		It will prove a veritable boon to amateur and professional photographers alike .

		A pretty ''
Lewis Carroll	PERSON	Birthday Book '' has been compiled by Mrs.
Christine Terhune Herrick	PERSON	and is published by the
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are alternate blank pages throughout the volume , with selections from
Dodgson	PERSON	's inspired nonsense for each day in the year , and several of
Teimiel	ORGANIZATION	's drawings . ''

		The Bivouac of the Dead and Its Author , '' by Mr.
George W. Ranck	PERSON	, is a small book published at the
Grafton Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		While we are by no means certam that the poem in question is '' the greatest martial elegy in existence , '' it is important enough to deserve this treat - ment , and the accompanying commemoration of Theo - dore
O'Hara	PERSON	, its author . ''

		Specimens of Discourse , '' edited by Dr.
Arthur Lynn Andrews	PERSON	, is a new volume of the '' English Readings '' published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The contents are of a nature to illustrate the four fun - damental types of composition , and are consequently of a very miscellaneous character .

		The book is intended for students in high schools and the early years of college .

		Some time this month the Harpers wUl publish the first volume of a series to be called '' The
Mark Twain	PERSON	Library of Humor . ''

		It is the aim of the editor to in - clude not only representative selections from the works of the recognized f xm-makers , but to give full and right - ful place to those writers who while working in a wider field , have yet given expression to the purest humor .

		The first volume will be called '' Men and Things . ''

		Mr.
Clyde Fitch	PERSON	's play , `` The Girl with the Green Eyes , '' is published in book form by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, with due reservation of the rights of performance .

		While far from being a distinguished illustration of the literary drama , the play reads very well -- possibly better than it sovmds when acted .

		And we always welcome the appearance of acting plays in a form that permits of their being read at all .

		After several years ' preparation ,
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will shortly begin the publication of an important series of books dealing with contemporary political , economic , and social questions , to be called '' American Public Problems . ''

		The first volume is entitled '' Im - migration and its Effect upon the
United States	LOCATION	, '' and is the work of Dr.
Prescott F. Hall	PERSON	, for many years secretary of the
Immigration Restriction League	ORGANIZATION	.

		Neither this nor the volumes to follow are designed to preseht any particular theory or to uphold any especial doctrine .

		Each will contain a complete history of the question treated , in its political and legislative aspects ; with all the available facts pertinent to it , and a careful and impartial discussion of the policies advocated .

		The series is under the general editorial direction of Mr.
Ralph Curtis Ringwalt	PERSON	, of the
New York	LOCATION	bar .

		NOTES 132 LIST OF NTIW BOOKS 133 A POINT OF DE PARTURE .

		^ Ir .

		Lang once remarked , in his airy way , tliat the man who really cares for books reads them all .

		This , we believe , was said a propos of .

		some discussion or other about the ' * hundred best books , '' or alwut ' • courses of reading , '' or about • ' the pursuit of literature as a means of cidture . ''

		The theme has many names and guises , but in all of them it remains the same old theme .

		The anxious inquirer , when he seeks counsel of the pimdits as to how he may save the literary soul within him -LRB- assuming that he has such an organ -RRB- , is given lists of books , that he by no means wants to read , and well-worn tags , dated from
Bacon	LOCATION	to
Ruskin	LOCATION	, upon the philosophy of the subject .

		Despairing of these abstract instruc - tions , he suppresses his budding aspirations , and falls stolidly back upon the diet of hiLsks so freely , and in some aspects so alluringly , set before him by the public prints of the day .

		The young man or woman who has been the victim of systematic literary instruction in the schools is in little better case .

		He has been supplietl with critical standards , but they con - stitute to him no more than a barren f ormidary ; he has read the history of literature , which may have stored his memory with names and titles , but has not enriched him with spiritual gifts .

		Stretched upon the Procrustean bed of literary study , his members have lost their freedom of action , or have been ruthlessly lopped off because they did not fit the structure .

		The annals of dead and alien periods have been displayed before a mind quivering with ^ ` ital imprdses , and his interest in the poets has been suppressed by the historical and philological pedantries which their proper study entails , as he is given to understand it .

		That literature might yet become for him the very bread of life is the last thought with which he lays aside the books which have presented it to him in so unsympathetic and repellant a fashion .

		What may be done to save the soul thus so nearly lost ?

		The question is one of the most serious ones possible , and whoever succeeds in finding the right answer to it is sure of both appreciation and gratitude .

		Probably the first delusion to be dismissed is that any one answer , or even any hundred answers , will prove ade - quate .

		The matter is one for individual diag - nosis and prescription , not for the application of general rides .

		Or rather , this delusion , rightly viewed , is the synthesis of all the special delu - sions that take the form of book-lists , and study - courses , and cidture-sy stems .

		As for !

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's easy dictum , that is obWously a counsel of per - fection for the few , a petitio principii for the many .

		The problem is not how to deal with those who tndy care for books -- they may safely l > e left to their own explorations -- but how to help those who might learn to care for books under sj-mpathetic and intelligent guid - 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, anee .

		And it must frankly be admitted that a considerable fraction of those upon whom the experiment may be made will be found finally incapable of anything like a genuine love for literature , even when we frame a highly catholic definition of that expression .

		This atrophy of facidty is , however , in many cases more apparent than real , and it behooves us all to do what we can to promote the activity of the function when its failure is the result of either early abuse or lack of opportunity .

		We make no claim of profundity for such suggestions as we have to offer for the suitable treatment of these patients , and shall be quite satisfied if our remarks rescue a few young people here and there from the malpractice under which they have suffered hitherto .

		The heart of every person of sensibility goes out toward the many unfortimates who , under the impres - sion that they are acquiring cvdture , and that the value of the acquisition must be proportional to the painf ulness of the effort , are to-day toiling with artificially-planned courses of reading , or plodding through such formidable works as
Grote	PERSON	's '' History of
Greece	LOCATION	'' and
Carlyle	PERSON	's `` Frederick the Great '' and
Ruskin	PERSON	's `` Modern Painters '' -- to say nothing of such works as the '' Mahabharata '' and the '' Kalevala '' and the '' Niebelungenlied , '' which choice exotics invariably blossom in the '' gay parterre '' of every conspectus of the world 's best literature as recommended for earnest minds .

		Something - better than this , surely , it is within the jwwer of ordinary intelligence to conunend and urge ; the case calls for homely simples far more than it does for the ransacking of the pharmacopoeia in search of strange remedies .

		Our notion is , briefly , that interest and sym - pathy form the basis of all good advice about reading .

		Even so admirable a treatise as that of Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	upon '' The Choice of Books '' will not do much for the mind untu - tored and astray .

		Far more may be done by some simple suggestion , in the line of an interest already existing , made by some person with a sympathetic insight into the workings of the inquirer 's mind .

		This is the method by which library workers are to-day throughout the coun - try stimidating young readers , and unobtrusively leading them into the pleasant paths of literature .

		This is the method which teachers in the schools shoidd employ , and doubtless would employ , were it not for the paralyzing restrictions im - posed upon them by courses of study and lists of books for required reading .

		The framers of these deadly devices wiU have much to answer for when they are called to accoimt for their misdeeds before the bar of judgment .

		The pliilosophical basis of this method is of the simplest , and persuasion rather than force is its watchword .

		It assumes that everyone who has read at all has developed some special inter - ests , and that these interests may be deepened by judicious counsel .

		It should not be difficidt to divert by degrees the mind that has found pleasure in the tinsel and pinchbeck of '' When Knighthood Was in Flower '' to the sterling joys provided by
Scott	PERSON	, or the mind that has foimd satisfaction in the cheap buffoonery of ''
David Harum	PERSON	'' to the immortal art of
Dickens	LOCATION	.

		Taking the existent interest as the point of departure , and always working upward upon the line of least resistance , more may be aceomplished than is readily imagined , far more , certainly , than may be accomplished by viewing the subject of the ex - periment de haut en has , and expecting his tastes to conform immediately to standards that are to be achieved only after extensive reading and the exercise of much discriminating judgment .

		If something be asked for a little more com - prehensive than this process of replacing a poor novel by a better one , we offer for our final sug - gestion the following device .

		Take as the point of departure some book of the highest character that it is safe to choose , and one selected because it has the twofold merit of appealing to an already established interest of the reader and of tending to awaken broader interests of an allied nature .

		Then map out a plan of further read - ing for the express purpose of fortifying these dawning new interests , until by insensible de - gi'ees a new and widened horizon shall be found to have replaced the old contracted one .

		Many works of historical fiction , for example , are rich in these radiating interests , and might be made nuclei for a growth of culture that shoidd be at once painless and profitable . ''

		Westward Ho I '' '' The Cloister and the Hearth , '' and ''
Henry Esmond	PERSON	'' may be given as illustrations .

		Or , if it be safe to venture upon something more serious than a novel as the point of departure , how effective a use might be made of such a book as
Trelawney	ORGANIZATION	's memorials of Byron and SheUey , or one of Mr.
Morley	PERSON	's studies of the French philosophers , or a volume of
Symonds	PERSON	's history of the Italian renaissance !

		What vistas each of these books imfolds to an active mind , and what rich pastures does it open to cidtivation !

		And how easy it would be , in pursuit of this plan , under skilful guidance , to acquire almost without knowing it a fruitfid acquaintance with one of the most significant periods in the life of mankind !

		THE DIAL 111 THE DELIGHTS OF INDISCRIMINATE READING .

		A choice instance of a mind edacious of all human knowledge is found in Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	's uncle by marriage .

		Mi '' .


Robert Johnston	PERSON	, an elder in the church of his brother-in-law and Dr ,
Brown	PERSON	's father , the Rev.
John Brown	PERSON	, and a merchant and '' por - tioner '' in the little Lanarkshii-e village of Biggar -- as we learn from the author of ''
Rab	PERSON	and his Friends . ''

		This
Johnston	PERSON	, as is related at some length in the first volume of '' Spare Hours . ''

		not only intermeddled fearlessly with all knowledge , but made himself master of more learning , definite and exhaustive , in various departments , than do many univei ` sitj ' scholars in their own chosen specialties .

		* • Mathematics , astronomy , and especially what may be called selenology or the doctrine of the moon , and the higher geometr \ - and physics ; Hebrew ,
Sanscrit	LOCATION	,
Greek	LOCATION	, and Latin , to the veriest rigors of prosody and metre : Spanish and Italian .

		German , French , and any odd language that came in his way : all these he knew more or less thoroughly , '' writes his admii-ing nephew , '' and acquired them in the most leisurely , easy , cool sort of way , as if he grazed and browsed perpetually in the field of letters , rather than made f onnal meals , or gathered for any ulterior purpose his fruit * , his roots , and his nuts -- he espe - cially liketl mental nuts -- much less bought them from anyone . '' '

		Every personage in
Homer	LOCATION	, great or small , heroic or comic , he knew as well as he knew the \ Tllage doctor or shoemaker : and he made it a matter of conscience to read the Homeric poems through once every foiu - years .

		Tacitus , Suetonius .

		Plutarch ,
Plautus	LOCATION	,
Lucian	PERSON	, and nobody knows how many other classical and past-classical authors , he was familiar with , together with such modems as
Boccaccio	PERSON	.

		Cervantes -LRB- whose • • Don '' he knew almost by heart -RRB- .

		Addison , Swift , Fielding .

		Groldsmith ,
Walter Scott	PERSON	, down even to
Miss Austen	LOCATION	,
Miss Edgewoitli	LOCATION	.

		and
Miss Ferrier	PERSON	.

		But not with the characters of history and fiction alone was this > ` illage shop-keeper on intimate terms .

		All the minutest personal gossip of the parish , one is partly grieved and pai ` tly amused to relate , was rel - ished and assimilated by him .

		Poachers and ne'er - do-wells appealed to his sympathies , while on the other liand no one could more keenly enjoy a learned doctrinal discussion with the jiarish minister . ''

		This singular man , '' continues the chronicler , '' came to the manse every
Friday	DATE
evening	TIME	for many years , and he and my father discussetl everj-thing and everybody ; -- - beginning with tough , strong head work -- a bout at wrestling , be it
Caesar	PERSON	's Bridge , the Epistles of Phalaris , ... the Catholic question , or the great roots of Chiistian faith ; ending with the latest joke in the town or the
West Raic	LOCATION	, the last effusion of
Affleck	PERSON	, taUor and poet , the last blimder of - # sop the apothecary , and the last repartee of the village fool , with the week 's
Edinburgh	LOCATION	and
Glasgow	LOCATION	news by their respective carriers ; the whole little life , sad and humorous -- who had been bom , and who was dying or dead , married or about to be , for the past eight days . ''

		This ** firm and close-grained mind , '' indepen - dent of all authority except reason and truth , quick to detect weakness , fallacy , or unfairness , and ever insistent upon accuracy and clear thinking , served as a sort of whetstone on which the minister sharpened his wits at these weekly sittings .

		Of the bodily aspect of this interesting man one is glad to be told something .

		Short and round , homely and florid , he was thought by his nephew to bear a probable resemblance to
Socrates	LOCATION	.

		Careless in his dress , he habitually carried his hands in his pockets , was a great smoker , and indulged in much more than the Napoleonic allowance of sleep .

		He had a large , full skull , a humorous twinkle in his cold blue eye , a soft low voice , great power of quiet but effective sarcasm , and large capacity of listening to and enjoying other men 's talk , however small .

		It will readily be in - ferred that he was unplagued by the itch of author - ship .

		Like the cactus in the desert , always plump , always taking in the dew of heaven , he cared little to give it out Nevertheless , from first to last , many magazine articles and a few pamphlets , dealing with questions of the day , dropped from his pen : but such a man .

		as his nephew says , is never best in a book : he Is always greater than his work .

		There comes to mind another and much earlier devourer of all sorts of then-existent book-learning , but one possessed of far less pith and character , independent judgment and power of observation , than our canny Scotchman .

		MarsUio
Ficino	PERSON	, the Florentine , contemporarj ' with
Cosimo de ' Medici	PERSON	, and placed by him over the
Platonic Academy	ORGANIZATION	which the nobleman had founded not long before , distinguished himself by his ardent pursuit of all knowledge , but especially of that qxiintessence of all knowledge which we call philosophy .

		Though a
Canon of St Lorenzo	ORGANIZATION	and the avowed champion of Christian philosophy , he is said to have kept a lamp burning before
Plato	PERSON	's bust and it is certain that he produced a Latin translation of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's works that is still held in high esteem .

		Extending his studies over the entire field of ancient literature , as Pro- fessor
Villari	PERSON	tells us ,
Ficino	PERSON	eagerly devoured the works of every sage of antiquity .

		Aristotelians ,
Platonists	LOCATION	,
Alexandrians	PERSON	, all were read by him with untiring zeal .

		He sought out the remains of Con - fucius and Zoroaster -- and be it noted that this was in the middle of the fifteenth century , when such a search was something far different from what it is now in the twentieth .

		Leaping from one age to another , from this philosophic system to that , he welcomed all learning as grist to his mill .

		Not only did he become a living dictionary of ancient phi - losophy , so that his works are practically an ency - clopaedia of the philosophic doctrines known up to his time , but he was also versed in natural science , so far as such knowledge was then obtainable , and had received from his father some training in med - icine .

		He is especially interesting , however , as the incarnation of that spirit of exultation that was 112 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, aroused throughout
Europe	LOCATION	by the discovery of the literary treasures of antiquity .

		There is enough that is likable in him , as portrayed in Professor VUlari 's work on
Savonarola	LOCATION	, to make us forgive the incm-able pedantry of the man .

		For pedant he certainly was , so stuffed with ill-digested learning that he had lost the power of independent thought and was never content until he coidd make his ideas , if he had any , square with
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, or with Aristotle , or even with some ancient skeptic or materialist .

		And so we leave him , sadly deficient in native faculty , but possessed of an admirable thirst for knowledge .

		StiU another choice spirit , to whom nothing human was devoid of interest , is that genial hypochondriac who , to cure himself of melancholy , wrote one of the most fascinating , as it is one of the most fan - tastic , works of literature .

		Of the author of '' The Anatomy of Melancholy '' far too little is known .

		But there is in the ' * Athenae Oxonienses '' a quaint characterization of the man that is worth much . ''

		He was , '' says Wood , as quoted in the '' Dictionary of
National Biography	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` an exact mathematician , a curious calculator of nativities , a general read scholar , a thorough-paced philologist , and one that understood the surveying of lands well .

		As he was by many accounted a severe student , a devourer of authors , a melancholy and humorous person , so by others who knew him well a person of great hon - esty , plain dealing and charity .

		I have heard some of the antients of
Christ Church	ORGANIZATION	often say that his company was very merry , facete and juvenile , and no man of his time did surpass him for his ready and dexterous interlarding his common discourse among them with verses from the poets or sentences from classical authors . ''

		Bishop
Kennet	PERSON	, quoted also in the '' Dictionary , '' says of
Burton	PERSON	that '' in an interval of vapours '' he was wont to be extremely cheerful , after which he would fall into such a state of despondency that he could only get relief by going to the bridge-foot at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and hearing the barge - men swear at one another , '' at whic ^ h he woidd set his hands to his sides and laugh most profusely '' ; which will perhaps recall to some the passage in
Burton	LOCATION	's preface relating a similar practice attrib - uted to Democritus .

		Burton died at or very near the time he had foretold some years before in cal - culating his nativity .

		Wood records a report , cur - rent among the students , that he had '' sent up his soul to heaven thro ' a noose about his neck , '' in order not to falsify his calculation .

		Beneath his bust in
Christ Church Cathedral	LOCATION	, where he was buried , is this curious epitaph , composed by himself : '' Paucis notus , paucioribus ignotus , hie jacet Democritus Junior , cui vitam dedit et mortem Melancholia . ''

		To the eager devourer of all knowledge , the charm of this incomprehensible universe of ours is in one important respect much like the charm of a living person : it lies largely in what is below the surface and only approximately and doubtfully attainable by shrewd conjecture .

		In a human being it is found in those reserves of personality that constitute so large a fraction of true manhood and woman - hood .

		Should the cosmic scheme ever be so im - modest as to lay bare its secret to our gaze , we should be literally shocked to death .

		Thus the fasci - nation that lures to the pursuit of ultimate truth is the fascination of the unattainable .

		With the enlarge - ment of one 's sphere of knowledge , the surface pre - sented to the encompassing Unknowable , to use
Hei	ORGANIZATION	* - bei-t
Spencer	PERSON	's tigm ` e , is correspondingly increased ; whereby one 's sense of awe and mystery and won - der is by so much deepened and intensified .

		And although the further one progresses in knowledge , the more profound l -RRB- ecomes one 's conviction of ignorance , nevertheless there is a wholesome satis - faction in learning how little we really know .

		To attain at last to something like a clear and compre - hensive sm ` vey of the variety and profundity of our ignorance , is well worth the price of a lifetime spent in study .

		To master the domain of human knowl - edge -LRB- to say nothing now of ultimate truth -RRB- is no longer possible .

		All the gi-eater , therefore , our envy in contemplating those bygone dabblers in all then - existent branches of learning .

		They came nearer to the attainment of universal knowledge , so called , than will ever again be possible .

		Yet there is com - fort in the thought that the literatxu-e of power , the sum total of things warmly and humanly interesting and significant , does not gi * ow nearly so rapidly as the field of science and its unliterary literature .

		That the true hunger for knowledge is notably in - satiable , is of course easy to explain .

		Pjach added shred of information draws into view a tangled wel -RRB- of countless desirable acquisitions , so that the appetite grows with feeding .

		The domain of possible con - quest increases to the learner 's vision when once he is seized and swept away by the passion for research , in a geometrical progi'ession whose constant factor is large .

		It may be , finally , as we are often enough assured by good men , that this impossibility of satisfying the intellectual appetite is providential , and that the chief function of the insatiate craving for all knowl - edge is to point us at last to the exercise of other and higher faculties which shall in the end l -RRB- ring the peace that passeth understanding .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		A FINAL WORD ABOUT
MR. SWINBURNE	PERSON	AS `` A LOVE POET . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		When I ventured to ask some questions in your col - umns about Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poetry , I had no intention of enternig into any discussion which they might possi - bly provoke .

		But the very courteous comnuuiicatiou of Mr.
Francis Howard Williams	PERSON	, published in The Dial of
February 1	DATE	, seems to demand a response .

		As Mr.
Williams	PERSON	himself intimates , his coinmunica - tiou does not deal with the main question , but with a side issue -- or rather with several side issues .

		It is chiefly a protest against my mcidental references to Mr.
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113
Swinburne	PERSON	's love-poems .

		Not only does Mr.
Williams	PERSON	consider Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	`` essentially and avowedly a love-poet , '' but he claims '' that he excels all others in the vi ^ - id and compact expression of erotic emotion . ''

		Passing over this statement without comment , I will try to answer Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's questions , and in so doing I trust that I may make my position more clear .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	objects to my referring to certain love - poems of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's as '' so-called love-poems . ''

		This raises too long a question for a short letter .

		The word `` love '' as we commonly use it is xmdoubtedly broad and elastic enough to include those poems in the first series of '' Poems and Ballads '' which I had in mind .

		Tliere are many kinds of love and many classes of lovers .

		Speaking broadly , these poems are properly '' called '' love-poems , but -LRB- as I intended to suggest -RRB- they deal with love only , or chiefly , as a thing of the senses .

		In a familiar sonnet -LRB- CX ^ ^ . -RRB-

		, to which I have already referred , Shakespeare speaks of love as '' the marriage of true minds . ''

		This is incomplete , but noble .

		In another sonnet -LRB- CXXIX . -RRB-

		he lays bare another and a very different kind of emotion ; he does not call this love , but gives it another and a baser name .

		In one comprehensive line he describes this emotion as '' the expense of spirit in a waste of shame . ''

		Poems which sympathetically portray such an '' expense of spirit '' are '' called '' love-poems , but , in my judgment , their place is not with the true love-poems of the literature , which deal with a gift which is half di \ Tne in its nobler and more truly beautifid aspects .

		Is there not a basis of truth in the story of Tannhauser , as
Wagner	PERSON	pre - sents it ?

		The poet of Venusberg is deprived of his place among the Troubadours , the true poets of love .

		The poet of ''
Laus Veneris	PERSON	'' shows us human passion in its earthly and least exalted form , -- passion , with its inevitable successors , satiety , world-weariness , and de - spair .

		Whether such poems are true love-poems , or whether they profane the name of love , is a matter of opinion and definition .

		A few minor points remain to be noticed .

		I did not say or imply that
Emerson	PERSON	did , or could , write love - poetry .

		To that charge I plead not guilty .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	asks : '' ^
Vhen	PERSON	did
Wordsworth	PERSON	ever write a love - poem ? ''

		I referred , of course , to the little group of poems , which are sometimes spoken of as the '' Lucy '' poems -LRB- '' She dwelt beside untrodden ways , '' '' Three years she grew , '' etc. -RRB- , and to the poem beginning '' She was a phantom of delight . ''

		These masterpieces need neither praise nor justification , but it may be interesting to note that Professor
F. B. Gummere	PERSON	, in his little book on '' Poetics '' places them among the most representa - tive love-lyrics of the literature .

		I am sorry to be obliged to differ so often from Mr.
WUliams	PERSON	, but I can not agree with him about
Browning	PERSON	.

		I feel that the poet of that great apostrophe '' O Lyric Love , '' the poet who wrote '' By the Fireside , '' '' One Word More , '' and '' Love among the Ruins '' -LRB- to give only a few examples -RRB- , ranks with the true love-poets of the literature .

		He is the poet of love in its noblest aspect as '' the greatest good i ' the world . ''

		Even if '' The Statue and the Bust '' were an exception to this , the other poems woidd remain , but I do not regard it as an exception .

		The poem has puzzled many readers , and it is | -RRB- erhaps somewhat ambigiious , but I am con - strained to say that in this instance I think Mr.
Williams	PERSON	has failed to understand
Browning	PERSON	's meaning .

		Pre-Raphaelitism from a
Xew Axgle	ORGANIZATION	.

		* It is impossible to escape a certain feeling of disappointment io connection with Mr.
Holman	PERSON	-
Himt	PERSON	's long-awaited account of the Pre-Raphael - ite movement .

		Other chroniclers have pictured this as a dramatic , impassioned revolt .

		They have dwelt upon its splendid enthusiasms and generous hero-worship , its light-hearted gaiety and its spontaneous humor .

		Their lively me - moii * s have been full of clever anecdotes and entei-taining personalities .

		The Pre-Raphaelite painters have been invariably treatetl not merely as artists and poets but as men , -- eccentric at times and irresponsible , ^ ^ ^ th more energy in imdertaking a new project than patience and training for finishing it , but full , nevertheless , of the joy of living and of working , and of that many-sided responsiveness to the best things that is the characteristic spirit of the amateur , in the true sense of that misused term .

		And so interest in the Pre-Raphaelite movement has come to depend less upon approval of its poetic or pictorial expression than upon appreciation of the remarkable personality of the artists .

		But Mr.
Holman-Himt	PERSON	's idea is that we have j alreatly had far more of this sort of thing than is good for us ; that in the effort to render the movement fascinating and dramatic its real pur - pose has l -RRB- een lost sight of , and that in the maze of anecdote and personality dates have been distorted , followers have been confused with leaders , and truth has been outraged .

		His purpose , then , is to write a historj ' that shall be accurate , exact , and uupersonal , that shall show in plain prose how the Pre-Raphaelite painters worked among other English painters of their day , that shall explain what was their theoiy of art , what each Brother contributed to the movement , and how the critics and the pub - lic received his work .

		In particular the author wishes to correct certain dominant errors in the popular view of the movement .

		The book , therefore , has quite a different scope and inter - est from those with which its title challenges comparison .

		Both Mr.
Holman-Hunt	PERSON	's author - ship and his peculiar imderstanding of Pre - Raphaelitism lead to a heavy emphasis upon his own work .

		But he does not ^ ^ ish the book to be considered as autobiography merely .

		He clearly aims at getting a hearing with the peo - • Pke-Baphaeutism axd the Prb-Raphaelitb Bbothkk - HOOD .

Feb. 16	DATE	, .

		pie who have preferred
Rossetti	PERSON	's work to his own and who have regarded
Madox Brown	PERSON	as the chief source of
Rossetti	PERSON	's initial inspiration , -- who have accordingly been interested in the Pre-Raphaelite movement , without , as Mr.
Holman-Hunt	PERSON	thinks , in the least understand - ing it .

		Of course the whole controversy hinges , like most controversies , upon the definition of the terms .

		Mr.
Holman-Hunt	PERSON	means one thing by Pre-Raphaelitism ; and
William Rossetti	PERSON	, Mrs.
Bume	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	, and the general reader mean quite another .

		According to Mr.
Holman-Hunt	PERSON	, he originated , and he and his life-long friend
Millais	PERSON	talked over and agreed to battle to - gether for , the Pre-Raphaelite theory .

		This theory seems to have been simply the accurate and careful rendering of natural objects .

		Hol - man-Hunt carried it to its furthest point when he went to
Syria	LOCATION	, subjecting himself to imtold discomfort and a good deal of danger in order to paint sacred subjects in their proper environ - ment .

		But he worked out aU his backgrounds '' with the eye on the object . ''

		He took long walks over the moors with a lantern to study the right effects for '' The Light of the World , '' and even painted a large part of the picture by lamp-light , out-of-doors , in the damp chill of autunm .

		The original , unalloyed Pre-Raphael - ite idea , as Mr.
Holman-Hunt	PERSON	uses the term , does not seem to have gone deeper than the method of getting one 's data .

		It left the imagi - nation untouched , and therefore could not affect the imderlying conception of the pamting .

		His picture of '' The Scape-Goat , '' with its ob - vious beauties and obvious limitations , perhaps embodies the theory more fully , because more baldly , than any other one painting ; and an attempt to realize how
Rossetti	PERSON	might have treated the same theme will set the ideals of the two painters in illuminating contrast .

		But when , in
1847	DATE	,
Rossetti	PERSON	left
Madox Brown	PERSON	in despair at the dulness of forever paint - ing pickle-jars and came to
Holman-Hvmt	ORGANIZATION	's studio to work under his direction , the Pre-Raphaelite idea , which liad not yet received its name , was largely in the air .

		Rossetti received it with his accustomed enthusiasm , -- even Mr.
Holman	PERSON	- Hunt admits that he had a genius for feeling and propagating enthusiasm , -- and threw liim - self with eager abandon into the organization of a formal crusade against the conventional stand - ards and tyrannous Philistinism of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		It seems little short of amazing , considering the temperamental obstacles , that Hobnan-Himt and
Rossetti	PERSON	should ever have been drawn to - wards one another , or even imagined that they could pull together .

		From Holman-Hiuit 's point of view the Brotherhood was a disastrous failure .

		Rossetti was from the first utterly oblivious of his obligations to it .

		He confused minute ren - dermg of nature with mediae valism , which
Millais	PERSON	and
Holman-Hunt	ORGANIZATION	abhorred .

		As soon as he had raised a storm of opprobrium with his first ''
P. R. B.	PERSON	'' picture , which , contrary to agi * ee - ment , he exhibited in advance of
Millais	PERSON	's and
Holman-Hunt	ORGANIZATION	's , he coolly withdrew from the fray and never again exhibited at the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		But he did not stop with sins of omission .

		The rancorous criticisms of the Academy , put forth often anonymously by himself and his friends , ^ did them no harm , but greatly injured
Holman	PERSON	- Hunt and
Millais	PERSON	, whose idea had apparently been to conduct a peaceful , conciliatory cam - paign .

		Worst of all ,
Rossetti	PERSON	's showy painting ^ and great power of influencing younger men misled
Ruskin	PERSON	into naming him the leader of the movement , a designation that
Rossetti	PERSON	accepted complacently .

		As a matter of fact ,
Rossetti	PERSON	's '' Arch-Pre-Raphaelitism '' as his friends laugh - ingly named it , was merely arch-heresy in Hol - man-Hunt 's eyes , and since
Millais	PERSON	eventually abandoned the gospel that he had professed sO ' ardently , Holman-Hunt alone continued to paint after the true Pre-Raphaelite manner .

		While we are glad to do justice to Mr.
Hol	PERSON	- man-Hunt , and interested in comparing his point of view with those of other historians , we can - not willingly consent to his high-handed substi - tution of one stage of the movement for the whole story .

		A Pre-Raphaelite school tliat leaves out
Rossetti	PERSON	and accords merely a casual men - tion to
William Morris	PERSON	and Bume-Jones i '' indeed shorn of its glory .

		What Mr.
Holman	PERSON	- Hunt 's history fails to allow for is the personal equation and its marvellous power of developing a situation .


William Rossetti	PERSON	was one of the seven original
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		A comparison of his statement of the aims of the organization with
Holman-Hunt	ORGANIZATION	's will show that even at first there were different interpretations .

		It is impossible to imagine
Dante Gabriel Rossetti	PERSON	and
Holman	PERSON	- Hxmt understanding the simplest statement in precisely the same way , and as the new ideas were sown abroad largely through
Rossetti	PERSON	's magic influence , they were necessarily modified in the process , -- glorified or distorted accor - ding to the point of view .

		It never seems to occur to Mr.
Holman-Hmit	PERSON	that his conception of Pre-Raphaelitism makes it immeasurably less significant than it has come to be considered .


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 115 That the strongest proof of the virility and power of the movement was the way it grew to include new thoughts and adapted itself to new person - alities is to him inconceivable .

		He regards an idea as a static thing ; to give it life is to destroy its unity , and you must accordingly rename it at every stage .

		Holnian-Himt 's hostility to fiossetti is inev - itable , but there seems to be no better reason than jealousy for the former 's determined belit - tlement of
Ford ^ Vladox Brown	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is always difficidt to settle claims of priority ; and it is of small consequence , since both worked inde - pendently , whether Holman-Hunt or
Brown	PERSON	first arrived at Pre-Raphaelite conclusions .

		But Holman-Hunt is unwilling to give
Madpx Brown	PERSON	any credit for originality .

		He insists upon reducing him to the himible rank of fol - lower , declaring that when the Brotherhood was organized he was not Pre-Raphaelite , that he was never officially asked to join the Brother - hood , and that his instruction contributed very little , if anj ` thing , towards
Rossetti	PERSON	's develop - ment .

		Even if these contentions are fully justi - fied , we shoidd like Holman-Himt better if he had shown more generosity towards a rival .

		But it is high time to turn from the contro - versial to the narrative interest of the book .

		Holman-Hunt tells his story well , in a style more earnest than lively , and with a memory for detail that is trvdy marvellous .

		The Sj ` rian journeys , fidl of strange adventures and imique experiences , furnish some delightfid chapters .

		One of the greatest of the many difficidties incident upon the ignorance and superstition of the natives was the finding of trustworthy models .

		He tells an amusing story of a shop - keeper whose promise he secured to sit for a figure in the great
Temple	ORGANIZATION	picture .

		The Jew failed to appear , and
Holman-Hunt	ORGANIZATION	's interpreter explainetl his scruple thus : '' Well , YOU know the merchant 's name is
Daoud Levi	LOCATION	.

		On the
Day of Judgment the Archangel Michael	ORGANIZATION	will be standing at the gate of heaven , and the names of all faithful children of Abraham will be called out .

		... When
Daoud	ORGANIZATION	's name is called , if there were a picture of him , it might be that the likeness would arrive first , and this might be passed in , and the name struck off the roll ; and when he arrived to demand ad - mittance he might be told that
Daoud Levi	PERSON	has already entered in , and that he must be a pretender . ''

		Holman-Himt managed to keep a serious face while he inquired whether baptizing the por - trait with a Christian name would help matters any .

		The Jew thought it would : so , after the first few strokes .

		Hunt sprinkled the likeness with water and declared its name to be
Jack Robinson	PERSON	.

		After some alterations had been made the Jew feared that the baptized likeness had been destroyed , and insisted upon a re - christening .

		Needless to say , before the artist was through with him he proved to be as great a rascal as he was sophistical a reasoner .

		There are vivid reminiscences of
Thackeray	LOCATION	,
Tennyson	PERSON	, the Brownings , and the
Carlyles	LOCATION	.

		Tennyson particidarly attracted Holman-Himt , and the poet seemed to have treated him with unwonted consideration .

		He gives a lively ac - coimt of a walking trip through
Cornwall	LOCATION	, on which
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	,
Palgrave	PERSON	, and Val Prinsep were his associates .

		With his fixed dread of being lionized , the poet begged his companions , who were all much younger than he , not on any accoimt to call him by his surname .

		Palgrave paid no heed to this injunction diiring the day , but as he followed the poet about the cliffs he was continually shouting '' • Tennyson '' at the top of his Ivmgs .

		At the inn , however , he ostenta - tiously referred to bim as '' the old gentleman . ''

		Tennyson objected to this designation , and
Palgrave	PERSON	retorted that it was absurd to assume that his name would be noticed .

		Each time the discussion was renewed
Tennyson	PERSON	showed more temper , imtil finally there was an open rupture and
Tennyson	PERSON	retired to his room to pack . ''

		When the poet had gone
Palgrave	PERSON	said to us , `` You 've no idea of the perpetual worry he causes me . '

		Val ejaculated , ' Did you say that he caused you ? '

		`` Yes , ' he returned . '

		The last words that Mrs.
Tennyson	PERSON	said to me on leaving were that I must promise her faithfully that I would never on any accoimt let Ten - nyson out of my sight for a minute , because with his short-sight , in the neighborhood of the cliffs or on the beach of the sea , he might be in the g ^ atest danger if left alone .

		I 'm ever thinking of my promise , and he continually trying to elude me ; if I turn my head one minute , on looking back I find him gone , and when I call out for him he studiously avoids answering . ' '

		But you call him by his name ? '

		we pleaded for the poet . '

		Of course I do , for I find that his fear of being discovered gives me the best chance of making him avow himself . ' ''

		A few moments later
Tennyson	PERSON	appeared to apologize for the '' bickerings '' and to explain how Palgrave 's voice , '' like a bee in a bottle , '' had interfered with his opportunities for peace - ful revery .

		And next day he persisted in start - ing home , accompanied by the faithful
Palgrave	PERSON	, and arguing violently , as they drove off , against the need of Mrs.
Tennyson	PERSON	's caution .

		All of which goes to show that
Rossetti	PERSON	was not the only genius who tried his friends ' forbearance to the breaking point .

		There are a great many good stories and illuminating bits of criticism in the book which woidd well bear quoting , but these examples 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, must suffice .

		The great charm of the narrative lies in the connected and undetachable story of
Hohnan-Hunt	ORGANIZATION	's career , with its fine concentra - tion , its brave , conscientious pursuit of an ideal , and its gi-eat achievement in spite of heavy odds .

		If we yield one kind of admiration to
Rossetti	PERSON	and the circle of yovmg enthusiasts that he gathered about him , we can not but grant another sort to Mr.
Holman-Hunt	PERSON	.

		Where the others rushed gaily over obstacles , he labored with dogged perseverence to overcome them .

		Though his range of sympathy was smaller , he was scru - pidous in the discharge of every obligation .

		If his inspiration was less exalted and less bril - liant than theirs , he pursued it with an industry that they could not achieve and an indomitable courage that they could not better .

		Best of all he has kept his temper in the face of much provocation to lose it ; his attitude toward the Academy , toward the critics , and toward
Rossetti	PERSON	is admirably dignified .

		Few men , therefore , have had more promising material for an auto - biography , and there are no dull pages in the two thick volumes , though at times the narrative moves rather slowly , and the long conversations of by-gone years are a little stilted and colorless in repetition .

		The illustrations in photogTavure and half - tone are nmnerous enough to reproduce all Holman-Himt 's important works and a great mass of sketches and studies .

		There are also several portraits of the artist , and a large num - ber of pictures by his contemporaries , which are referred to in the text by way of showing the widespread influence of the true Pre - Raphaelite motive , as Holman-Hunt interpreted ^ * -

		* It can hardly be said that we have too many histories of education , or that we yet have suit - able text-books on the subject .

		The subject itself is comparatively new , and awaits satisfac - tory treatment both for general reading and for the classroom .

		Professor
Monroe	PERSON	's new book gives great promise , at first glance , of being a nearer approach to the desired text-book than any previous one : it is , as the author notes in the preface , several times as large as most of those now in use , and all will agree that these latter are quite too scanty ; it is published by a firm whose imprint is a guarantee of at least * A Text-Book in the

		By
Paul	PERSON	some marked excellence ; and its external make - up is all that could be asked .

		A general survey reveals at once two great virtues : a broad and yet sane and definite conception of the subject , and a rich body of material , in general well chosen .

		The writer has hit a happy mean between the narrow ideal of a '' history of peda - gogy '' on the one hand , and such a general and subjective view as that of
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	in his little '' History of Education '' on the other .

		The discussion everywhere recognizes the fact that education is an integral part of the whole development of humanity in history , and yet does not forget that it is dealing with education and not with the whole progress of thought and life .

		There are , however , some omissions and some faults in proportion .

		We are surprised to find an extensive treatment of such a remote topic as Chinese education , and not a word upon the more relevant subject of Hebrew education ; with the educational theories and practice of the Chinese our history lias had no contact or inter - action , while with the Hebrew there are many points of relation .

		Again , it would seem that to give the Middle Ages 126 pages and the Renaissance and Reformation only 90 is con - ceding too much to mere length of time instead of taking into account real historical significance .

		Vittorino da Feltre ,
John Sturm	PERSON	, and
Melanch	PERSON	- thon are disposed of in an average of two pages each , -- surely a scant recognition of their place in the work of actual education .

		The chapter-headings contain some question - able terms .

		Oriental education is set down as '' recapitidation '' ; is it not rather simply repe - tition or reproduction of type ?

		Indeed , it is hard to see why the sub-title of primitive edu - cation , '' non-progressive adjustment , '' does not fit Oriental education quite as well .

		Greek edu - cation is called '' education as progressive adjust - ment '' ; but did not
Greece	LOCATION	distinctly fail to adjust her education to new conditions and so succumb to national decay ?

		Plato 's pedagog - ical vision had no realization in actual Greek education , and we can by no means assert that its realization woidd have proved to be a pro- gressive adjustment .

		Locke serves as repre - sentative of the disciplinary conception of edu - cation , but in the process seems to us to suffer a certain narrowing and distortion , only par - tially corrected by admissions that he also rep - resents realism and naturalism .

		Closer examination reveals much that is excellent .

		We may mention particularly the treatment of Realism , which is broad and illu -
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 minafing in the highest degree .

		In the pages on
Rousseau	PERSON	and in the entire treatment of Herbart the author succeeds in giving in con - densed form and clear outline the essential con - tributions made by the two men to educational doctrine .

		Indeed , the whole book gives proof of the broadest and richest acquaintance with the field ; the great mass of material is in general handled in such a way as to show that ample knowledge of the subject which is the requisite of the scholar and the teacher .

		Thus the selection of material and the general treatment deserve high commendation .

		They are such as go to the make-up of the ideal text - book of the subject : and this fact makes it the more to be regretted that the book suffers from some serious favdts , which greatly lessen its value both for the general reader and for the student .

		All these faidts seem to be the result of one thing , -- haste .

		It is as though the au - thor had with aU due pains and care gathered his material and framed his plan , and then , urged by some sudden impulse , thrown the book together and rushed it through the press .

		The power and equipment which parts of the work show , to say nothing of other work of the same author , forbid us to think that the book might not have been of far higher excellence in its final form .

		As it is .

		there are flaws and errors on almost every page which sadly mar the quality of the book .

		The least important of these defects are petty errors , not exactly typographical , for they covdd by no means be charged to the printer , but rather such points as might easily be due to incompetent proof-reading ; as for example mis - spelled words , especially proper names , -- ' • Vit - terino da Feltra '' -LRB- pp. 398 , 399 -RRB- , '' Scotus Erigina '' -LRB- p. 278 -RRB- , • • Furstenschiden '' -LRB- p. 389 -RRB- ; '' ephoebi ' * for `` epheboi '' ' -LRB- p. 75 -RRB- ; and such slips of the pen as the statement that
Alexander	PERSON	of
Hales	PERSON	was the author of the '' Summa Theologiae '' -LRB- p. 305 -RRB- , while on a preceding page it is correctly ascribed to
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	.

		With such minor errors may be classed the fre - quent omission of important references .

		Long citations on pages 366 and 525 are not even ac - companied by the name of the work from which they are taken ;
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's • • Poetics '' ' is simply referred to as '' another work '' -LRB- p. 155 -RRB- .

		Defi - nite citation of chapter or page is the exception .

		It should not be forgotten that a text-book of this sort shoiJd be framed for the hand of the teacher as well as that of the student , and the critical and literary apparatus pro \ ` ided accordingly .

		We are not a little surprised to find the words '' Ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free '' ascribed to an '' Apostle '' -LRB- p. 140 -RRB- ; does our national ignorance of the Bible affect even university professors ?

		On page 75 the terms '' Iren '' and '' MeUiren '' are con - fused , although both have been defined on a preceding page in a quotation from
Plutarch	LOCATION	.

		But these points are insignificant compared with other and more serious errors .

		We are told that
Plato	ORGANIZATION	, in the '' Republic , '' ' • rejects all the Homeric poems '' -LRB- p. 136 -RRB- , and '' would eliminate the use of the poets altogether '' -LRB- p. 95 -RRB- .

		The re \ ` iewer can find no such declarations in the • • Republic , '' but finds on the contrary that
Plato	ORGANIZATION	says distinctly , after rejecting the '' pantomimic poet , '' '' we ourselves will make use of the more severe and unattractive poet '' -LRB- Rep. 398 A. B. -RRB- .

		Is it not seriously incorrect to charge the Greeks with an '' Oriental attitude toward womankind '' -LRB- p. 95 -RRB- ?

		The author as - sumes • • the absence of all thought of the gods or of the future life as having to do with either motive for or outcome of conduct in this life . ''

		Surely a moment 's thought would have brought to mind
Minos	PERSON	and Rhadamanthus , and the tenth lxx -RRB- k of the '' Republic , '' and numberless distinct and emphatic expressions in Greek myth and epic and drama and philosophy , which would show the assiuuption to be utterly false ; indeed it is hard to see how such a phrase could have been coined even in the greatest haste and heedlessness .

		A similar misconception as to the religious life of the Greeks is found on page 750 , where their education is said to have excluded all recognition of supernatural or religious ele - ment .

		The very reading books of the Greek boy .

		Homer and Hesoid , were full of just those elements : and
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's chief objection to parts of these poems is that their theology is untrue and that they are in consequence dangerous in the extreme .

		Moreover the whole life of the Greek , boy and man , was hedged about by the religious and supernatural element ; in school and out , the child was constantly under its in - fluence .

		Was it not largely the break-down in the religious element which brought about the educational crisis in the days of Aristophanes and
Socrates	PERSON	, and the subsequent decay of Greek life ?

		We are told that
Francis Bacon	PERSON	'' wrote nothing directly on education '' -LRB- p. 468 -RRB- ; as a matter of fact there are several considerable passages upon education in the '' Advancement of Learning . ''

		On page 732 we find the statement , concern - ing
France	LOCATION	, that '' religious instruction was given 118 THE DIAL -LSB-

		The past tense makes the sentence quite indefinite , but it is nevertheless misleaJding , in view of the fact that religious instruction was abolished in the government schools about
1882	DATE	, and a moral and civic in - struction put in its place .

		The account of the situation in
England	LOCATION	, though apparently brought down to
1903	DATE	, ignores the Act of
1902	DATE	, prob - ably by far the most important educational measure in the history of English schools up to the present time .

		Since that Act went into force it is no longer true that '' these two systems of State or board schools and Church or voluntary schools remain side by side '' -LRB- p. 734 -RRB- .

		On the question of religious education the book is pecidiarly unfortimate .

		We are told on page 59 that '' our schools to-day must elimi - nate the religious element '' ; is this not simply repeating a conunon misapprehension , that be - cause the public school must be unsectarian it must also be non religious ?

		At least the state - ment involves the prejudgment of a great ques - tion , and can only be defended by an exceed - ingly narrow definition of the phrase '' religious element . ''

		It is quite in accordance with this that we find
Rousseau	PERSON	's famous '' Confession of Faith of a Savoyard Vicar '' dismissed with the words '' we can devote no attention to it here , since it is aside from our main interest '' -LRB- p. 565 -RRB- .

		Nevertheless we are told that the question of religious education is a problem of very great impoi-tance -LRB- p. 750 -RRB- ; and we can not but wonder why it should be so completely excluded from the book .

		On the same page we read that '' Little or no attempt at solution is being made and little interest aroused . ' '

		Is there then no
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	, bending every energy to this very task ?

		And if the Catholic activities are out of the range of the author 's attention , he might at least have men - tioned the
Religious Education Association	ORGANIZATION	, org-anized in
1902	DATE	, and numbering in
1904	DATE	about
2000	DATE	members , very many of whom are educational leaders .

		It is surprising to find
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's doctrine of the education of women held up as the type toward which the twentieth century is striving -LRB- pp. 140 , 141 -RRB- .

		`` The differences lie in the difference of character , not in the difference of sex -- a man and a woman -- hence should have the same education . ''

		Is it not rather true that modern doctrine admits fuUy the differences of sex , and the consequent differences of educa - tion ?

		Even co-education is very far from mean - ing identical training , to say nothing of identical function in life , -- a part of Plato 's chimerical scheme for the training of women which Pro- fessor
Monroe	ORGANIZATION	woidd seem by implication also to approve .

		The style of the book must be dealt with briefly .

		Evidences that the author is no incom - petent writer are abundant ; many chapters , especially those already mentioned with com - mendation in the earlier part of this review , are clear and quite sufficiently polished ; but large portions of the work are marred in style appar - ently by the same haste that has played such havoc with the accuracy .

		Vagueness , obscurity , and ambiguity are frequent .

		There is often confusion in the summary of doctrine , as for example the treatment of
Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	on pages 553-560 .

		The title of this section is '' Three - fold Meaning of Nature in the
Emile	LOCATION	'' ; the three meanings are all there , but in such form that the student woidd have great difficiilty in apprehending them ; in fact only one who knew them in advance could well feel sure that he had detected them .

		The account of
Comenius	ORGANIZATION	's school system -LRB- pp. 492 f -RRB- , which might be made so perfectly clear , is seriously clouded by lack of clear progress and carefid use of terms .

		There are many minor defects of form , of which a few specimens may be given . ''


Locke	PERSON	is the founder of the naturalistic movement in education , for in many respects , as he freely acknowledges ,
Rousseau	PERSON	is indebted to him '' -LRB- p. 522 -RRB- .

		Who freely acknowledges ?

		Gram - mar and fact seem here to be at odds .

		There is a frequent unfortunate use of the phrase '' as with , '' -- thus , ''
Locke	PERSON	, as with
Rousseau	PERSON	, ostensibly supplanted authority by reason '' -LRB- p. 523 -RRB- .

		Not infrequently sentences are found which are not rhetorically coherent , as for exam - ple : '' As the most important of all English writers on the subject of education , or at least as ranking with
Ascham	PERSON	and
Spencer	PERSON	, the main thoughts of
Locke	PERSON	's treatise deserve presenta - tion '' -LRB- pp. 513 , 514 -RRB- .

		There are many of these blemishes , some obscure , some ambiguous , some merely awkward ; their frequency confirms the belief that great haste is the occasion of these faidts also .

		It is cause for genuine regret that a piece of work so well begun and with such great possi - bilities should be thus disfigured and damaged by a multitude of errors and blemishes , some indeed of importance , but most of them petty in themselves , and all avoidable by more care in writing , revising , and proof-reading .

		But with all its f axdts the book is probably the best thing available for college classes in the liistory of edu - cation .

		Vigilance on the part of the instructor
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 can do much to correct the errors .

		We can only hope for an early second edition , rigorously ^ e ^ ^ sed , and in parts rewritten .


Edward O. Sisson	PERSON	.

		Two AMERICAX MEX of liEXTERS .

		*
Lowell	PERSON	and
Lanier	PERSON	: the names chime pleas - antly , and with some significance , thus linked .

		At least two admirable studies recently pub - lished -- among the most notable offerings of a year imusually rich in biographical literature -- impress the reader with a definite feeling that this elder bard of
New England	LOCATION	, with his clear ideality of vision , and this later southern min - strel , with his fine perception of the spiritual sense of life , are closely akin in the lyric brother - hood .

		We will not push the parallel .

		The differences and discrepancies are palpable in the achievement of the younger poet whose fanej ' had liardly begun its second flight ;
Lanier	PERSON	's singing stopped in the poet 's fortieth year , just ten years before the life of Lowell cl -LRB- '' ed at the full age of seventy .

		Mr.
Greenslet	PERSON	's study of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	is admirably matle .

		The material at hand , including the recently-augmented edition of the poet 's letters , must have been almost embarrassing in its ful - ness to one whose purpose was to present \* dthin the space of a single volume a comprehensive view of the life of
Lowell	PERSON	and a consistent inter - pretation of his work .

		However that may be , the result is a compact record of this many - sided life and a really judicial discussion of the poet 's place in literatiure -- the first essentially critical biography of
Lowell	LOCATION	yet attempted .

		Our gleaning from the volume must be meagre .

		!

		Mr.
Greenslet	PERSON	's survey does not add materially to the vital facts of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's life as ah-eady familiar .

		There was , to begin with , the auspicious environment of Elmwootl -- the stately colonial mansion set in a '' bowery lone - liness '' which drew the bluebirds and the orioles and the robins , -- where the love of outtloor life was bred : and indoors there were books , -- his clergyman-father 's well-selected library , \ ^ ` ithin and among which he browsed knowingly : as a child he was read to sleep from • ' The Faerie Queene , '' and rehearsed its adventurous episodes to his playmates .

		Then came the four years of the Harvai-d student , coloretl by a few whimsi - cal breaches of academic decorum , of which •

		more is said , perhaps , than of the fact that in his own independent v ^ ` ay the youth was reading omnivorously in all the rich pastures -LRB- if one may in this connection so mix the metaphor -RRB- of the world 's literature .

		For three years he nerve - lessly pursued the law .

		At last he began to find himself , and , in
1843	DATE	, elected literature .

		Lowells verse received its first potent impulse in his love for Maria White ; but definite inspi - ration came , with the development of his demo - cratic instincts and his ardent humanitarianism , in the early forties .

		Temperance reform , then woman suffrage , finally the anti-slaverj ' move - ment , enlisted his fervent support .

		In that epoch of stormy debate he did not withhold his voice .

		The spirit which shaped some of his most characteristic work was already evoked .

		His ringing utterance was heard in poems like the '' Stanzas on Freedom , '' and the sonnet to
Wendell Phillips	PERSON	, both of which belong to
1843	DATE	.

		`` The Present Crisis , '' that superb climax of lyric eloquence , came in
1845	DATE	.

		The year
1848	DATE	is designated by the biographer as
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's annus mirabilis .

		It saw the publication of the second series of the '' Poems '' and the comple - tion of '' The Fable for Critics , '' the ' •
Biglow Papers	PERSON	, '' and the `` Vision of Sir Launfal '' ; these besides niunerous articles and poems con - tributed to the magazines .

		For
Lowell	PERSON	the satirist , Mr.
Grreenslet	PERSON	has unqualified praise . ''

		Little as he liked to be reminded of it in his later years ,
Lowell	PERSON	was the author of the ♦
Biglow Papers	ORGANIZATION	, ' and it is as the author of the '
Biglow Papers	ORGANIZATION	' that he is likely to be longest remembered .

		... In variety , unction , quotability , ethical earnestness , humor , wit , fun , even in pure poetry and pathos , they stand quite by themselves in American literature .

		Criticism can - not touch them . ''

		Oftener than we are apt to remember , these years of
Lowell	LOCATION	's early manhood were in ^ ` aded by sorrow .

		In
1847	DATE	the Lowells lost their little daughter Blanche , scarce a twelvemonth old ;
three years later	DATE	.

		Rose , their third child , died in infancy .

		The intimate personal expression of the poet 's grief is given in the affecting lyrics : '' She Came and Went , '' '' The Changeling , '' and `` The First Snowfall . ''

		In
1850	DATE	the poets mother , -- from whom he had inherited the strong mystical tendency so clearly felt in his serious work as a whole , -- died ; her in - tensely imaginative mind had become disordered in
1842	DATE	, and for several years she had been an inmate of an asylum .

		The cloud had rested heavily over the household , but bitterness was still in store .

		In
1852	DATE	, while enjoying their first trip abroad , the Lowells were again bereaved 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, in the death of
Walter	PERSON	, their little son , as they were passing the winter in
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Meanwhile Mrs.
Lowell	PERSON	's health had been declining , and soon after the return home , in
1853	DATE	, the poet buried the wife of his youth .

		His burden of grief is felt in '' Palinode , '' '' After the Burial , '' and '' The Dead House . '' ''

		Something broke my life in two , '' he said later , '' and I can not piece it together again . ''

		Of the history conveyed in the later chapters of this work we have not space to speak .

		The biogi'apher has given a vivacious record of the multiform activity which so distinguishes this useful representative of letters , this cultured servant of democracy in public life .

		Mr.
Greenslet	PERSON	's critical estimate of
Lowell	LOCATION	's work in verse and prose is conservative and altogether judicious .

		Of the thi'ee himdred poems included in the final edition of the works , less than fifty , he believes , '' possess any vivid poetical life . ''

		Among the traits which give distinction to
Lowell	PERSON	's best poetry , he empha - sizes : '' the utter and fervent sincerity of the moods expressed in it '' ; `` the amount of mind that lay back of it '' -- he finds in
Lowell	LOCATION	more of the Shakespearian mind than in any other American poet ; and '' the consistent ideality which was both root and branch of his abound - ing intellectual life . ''

		These qualities , together with a keen , sensuous love of nature ,
Lowell	PERSON	had ; the indispensable gift of poetic style he had , also , -- '' but intermittently ; it is shown multitudinously in lines and passages , rarely through entire poems . ''

		For the ''
Conunemo	PERSON	- ration Ode '' and the '' Agassiz , '' the critic ex - presses natural and imqualified admiration ; it is , however , to the ''
Biglow Papers	ORGANIZATION	, '' vitalized by the fluent and irrepressible wit of the satirist , that he recurs oftenest , and with a final word of highest praise .

		In speaking of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's prose , '' savory '' is the apt word with which Mr.
Greenslet	PERSON	describes his style .

		In the best prose of the essayist , he finds a union of vitality and antiquarianism which imparts one of the chief charms to his diction . ''

		Side by side with sub - tilely allusive phrases that tlirill the ripe reader with gleaming memories of old and far-oif au - thors will be found some breezy vocable of the street that strikes a sudden gust of fresh air across the page . ''

		It is as a critic of literature , Mr.
Greenslet	PERSON	thinks , that
Lowell	PERSON	's fame will probably be most enduring , at least that his work as a critic of literature '' wiU last in greater bulk than anything else of his . ''

		If his criticism is not always temperate , not always judicious , or minutely accurate in scholarship , `` it is , none the less , richer in humor , metaphor , gusto , -- in short , in genius , -- than any other critical writ - ing that
America	LOCATION	has protluced ; and it is not far surpassed in these qualities by anythmg in the language . ''

		With a glowing tribute to
Lowell	LOCATION	's potent influence in the cause of cidture and of conscience while alive , his biogi'apher prophesies the enduring potency of this many-sided talent suffused throughout the works of '' the first true American man of Letters . ''

		In the stormy battle years of 1861-5 , when
Lowell	PERSON	, already secure in the fame of his early verse , was flashing Northern sentiment into the sharp and stinging lines of the second ''
Biglow Papers	PERSON	, ''
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	was fighting as a pri - vate soldier under the flag of the Confederacy .

		Born in
Macon	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, in
1842	DATE	, he had just completed his college course in
Oglethorpe	LOCATION	and had been called to a position as tutor in that institution , when the war broke .

		Lanier flung himself into the struggle with the same ardor that sent
Paul Hamilton Hayne	PERSON	,
George W. Cable	PERSON	,
Maurice Thompson	PERSON	, and the poet
Timrod	PERSON	to the support of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	cause .


Sidney Lanier	PERSON	and his brother ,
Clifford	PERSON	, -- two slender gray-eyed youths , inseparable in their service of danger and hardship -- extracted all the romance which their experience provided .

		In
1863	DATE	, they were on scout duty along the
James	LOCATION	;
Lanier	PERSON	wrote later with enthusiasm of his army life : '' We had a flute and a guitar , good horses , a beauti - ful country , splendid residences inhabited by friends who loved us , and plenty of hair-breadth escapes from the roving bands of Federals .

		Clifl : ' and I never cease to talk of the beautiful women , the serenades , the moonlight dashes on the beach of fair
Burwell	PERSON	's Bay and the spirited brushes of our little force with the enemy . ''

		Poor
Lanier	PERSON	-- it is almost all there -- his whole brief story I the brushes with the enemy , the hair-breadth escapes , the music and the romance , the boyish enthusiasm , the pluck , the heroism -- and complaint , never !

		The pathos , also , in that brief life of achievement , which began when the war closed , -- that note , too , was struck in these prophetic years .

		In '64 the brothers were transferred to
Wilmington	LOCATION	, and placed as signal officers upon the blockade-runners .

		Here
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	was captured and for five months was confined in the Federal prison at
Camp Lookout	LOCATION	; it well-nigh became his tomb .

		With emaciated frame and shattered physique the young soldier went home , like so many other youthfrd veterans , south and north , to fight for life in the coming years .

		With
Lanier	PERSON	the struggle was for both life and livelihood .

		He
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 was twenty-three years old , unsettled as to his future , and under the shadow of those ' • raven days '' of the desolated and demoralized South . ''

		Our hearths are gone out and our hearts are broken '' -- he plaintively sang ; yet he turned the plaint into a song of cheer ; still he found the romance .

		In
1867	DATE	he was married to Miss
Mary Day	PERSON	, of
Macon	LOCATION	, and the poems of his wooing-time and of his wedded life are as tender and sweet as the lyrics
Lowell	PERSON	sang to
Maria ^ \ Tiite	ORGANIZATION	.

		For five years
Lanier	PERSON	tried to follow the law , and then , in
1873	DATE	, he gave hiuLself to art .

		He went to
Baltimore	LOCATION	, alone -- except for his flute .


Lanier	PERSON	's flute is as famous as
Lanier	PERSON	; it is a part of his personality '' .

		Its mellow notes had cheered the soldier and his comrades by camp-fire and in prison : it had been softly played in many a surreptitious serenade ; but it was more \ Nddely known than this , for
Lanier	PERSON	was a musician of remarkable power , and he was called by many the finest flute-player in
America	LOCATION	, if not in the world .

		Lanier 's musical genius is almost the chief element in his story .

		So far as he covdd trace his ancestry it disclosed this talent in its possession : in the Restoration period thei * e were five Laniei * s in
England	LOCATION	who were musicians ; in
Charles I.	PERSON	's time
Nicholas Lanier	PERSON	was painted by
Van Dyke	PERSON	, and ^ \ Tote music for the masques of
Jonson	PERSON	and for the lyrics of Her - rick ; the father of this
Nicholas	PERSON	was a musician in the household of Queen Elizabeth : thus
Sid	PERSON	- ney
Lanier	PERSON	came natiirally by his gift .

		In
Balti	LOCATION	- more ,
Lanier	PERSON	's flute secured him a jx > sition in the
Peabody Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	, and furnished the means of living for sevei ^ al years .


Theodore Thomas	PERSON	is said to have been on the point of making the artist first flute-player in his orchestra , when
Lanier	PERSON	's health finally failed and he was com - jjelled to give up the struggle .

		But
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	foimd also in
Baltimore	LOCATION	his fii `` st opportunit -RCB- '' to gratify what had been the ambition of the years since his college course -- the opportunity to study literature and the scientific principles of verse .

		The unfulfilled dream of his youth had been a systematic course in the German universities ; this was not to be realized , but in the richly-equipped Peabody Libraiy of Baltimoi-e he found his university .

		Never was there a more assiduous student .

		Especially did he devote himseK to the field of Old English i ^ oetiy .

		Soon there were uiAata - tions to lecture , and in the city he came to have an established reputation as a fascinating lec - turer on English literature .

		In
1875	DATE	he first won i-ecognition as a poet by the publication of '' • Com '' ' in ''
Lippincott	PERSON	's Magazine '' ; and four months later his more successful poem '' The Symphony '' appeared in the same magazine .

		His new friendship with
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	pro- duced the in \ ` itation to write the words for the
Centennial Cantata	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first collection of his poems was published in
1877	DATE	.

		Lanier 's story is less familiar to the general reader than is that of
Lowell	LOCATION	, and it is so com - pelling that we have been betrayed into these details .

		The real pathos of it may best be sug - gested by two quotations from his letters to his friend and fellow-poet ,
Hayne	PERSON	.

		Writing in the early seventies , he says : '' I have not put pen to paper in a literary way in a long time .

		How I thirst to do so , -- how I long to sing a thousand various songs that oppress me unsimg -- is unexpressible .

		Yet the mere work that brings me bread gives me no time . ''

		Again , when the tale of his life was almost told , under date of
November 19 , 1880	DATE	, he writes : '' For six months past a ghastly fever has taken pos - session of me each day at about 12 m. , and holding my head imder the siu ^ ace of indescribable distress for the next twentj - hours , subsiding only enough each morning to let me get on my working harness , but never inter - mitting .

		... I have myself been disposed to think it arose purely from the bitterness of having to spend my time in making academic lectures and boys ' books -LSB- the series of '' The Boy 's
King Arthiu	PERSON	- , '' '' The Boy 's Froissart , '' etc. -RSB- -- pot-boilers all -- when a thousand songs are singing in my heart that will certainly kill me if I do not utter them soon . ''

		Yet the poet extractetl the joy of life , as he toiled , singing , with his `` Tampa Robins '' -- ' ■ If that I hate wild winter 's spite -- The gibbet trees , the world in white , The sky but gfray wind o'er a grave -- Why should I ache , the season 's slave ?

		I ' U sing from the top of the orange-tree
Gramercy	LOCATION	, icinter ^ s tyranny . ''

		Thus , too , through the last suffering years of his illness and weakness he went patiently , blithely : singing the song of his '' Stimip-Cup '' -- his lx -RRB- ld challenge to Death : ■ ■
David	PERSON	to thy distillage went ,
Keats	PERSON	, and Gotama excellent ,
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	, and Chaucer bright , And
Shakespeare	PERSON	for a king-delight . ''

		Then .

		Time , let not a drop be spilt : Hand me the cup whene'er thou wilt ; 'T is thy rich stirmp-cup to me ; 1 11 drink it down right smilingly . ''

		In i-apid succession he ^ vrote three wonderful poems , each a masterpiece : '' The Revenge of
Hamish	PERSON	, '' ' * ' How Love looked for Hell , '' and `` The Marshes of
Glynn	PERSON	. ''

		In
1879	DATE	the poet was appointed to a lectureship in the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fruit of this professional con - nection we have in two volumes , neither of 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, which is characterized by scientific precision or minutely accurate scholarship ; nevertheless '' The Science of English Verse '' and '' The English Novel '' are recognized as indispensable to the student of English literature to-day .

		In the
winter of 1880-1	DATE	Lanier gave up the pam - fid struggle ; withdrawing from the
University	ORGANIZATION	, he went for relief to the pine lands in the mountains of
North Carolina	LOCATION	.

		Here ,
Septem	PERSON	- ber 7 ,
1881	DATE	, he passed away .

		This is the mere outline of the heroic life , the story of which has now been told by Mr.
Mims	PERSON	.

		The characteristics of this interesting volume are its picturesqueness , its simplicity , its fulness of detail and its dispassionate discussion of
Lanier	PERSON	's claims to a permanent place among our American poets of fame .

		Not the least valuable of its features is the intelligent and sympathetic presentation of the South 's condition at the close of the war .

		To the general student of American literature , this phase of the work is most illuminating in relation to the recent lit - erary development of the South , as well as in the narrower relation of its influence upon the intellectual growth of
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Mims	PERSON	's work represents the first complete bio - graphy of this southern poet .

		It is something of a distinction to have served as the first inter - preter of a character so fine and rare ; it is a gi'eat distinction to have performed the honor - able service so well .

		Lowell and
Lanier	PERSON	: they met once , in
1875	DATE	.

		Lanier was in
Boston	LOCATION	visiting
Charlotte Cush	PERSON	- man , his very dear friend , then ill at the
Parker House	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two delightful afternoons were spent with
Longfellow	LOCATION	and
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of this visit the latter afterward wrote : '' He was not only a man of genius with a rai-e gift for the happy word , but had in him qualities that won affection and commanded respect .

		I had the pleasiu-e of seeing him but once , when he called on me ' in more gladsome days , ' at Elm wood , but the image of his shin - ing presence is among the friendliest in my memory . ''

		LoweU and
Lanier	PERSON	: they were somewhat alike in their ideality , their sincerity , their intellectu - ality , in the deep spiritual vision which has glimpses of things beyond the knowledge of the world ; they were not unlike in their poetic tone .

		Lanier was hardly more than thirty-nine at his death ; what might he not have done had he been given ten years longer to live and sing !

		StiU he had written the poems which we have named ; he had written `` The Song of the Chattahooche , '' the `` Psalm of the West , '' '' Sunrise '' -- and '' The Marshes of
Glynn	PERSON	. ''


W. E. SiMONDS	PERSON	.

		An
Oxford History	ORGANIZATION	or
England	LOCATION	.

		* In
Great Britain	LOCATION	, as upon the continent and in our own coimtry , the cooperative method of writmg history is in favor .

		The ''
Cambridge Modern History	ORGANIZATION	'' now in the midst of its course is , of English works , the most distinguished one of this character ; but several have already been carried through , and more are promised shortly .

		Among those which are just making their ap - pearance , none will be regarded by students with greater interest than the `` Political History of
England	LOCATION	, '' which is to be published , in twelve volumes , under the editorship of the Reverend
William Hunt	PERSON	and Mr.
Reginald Lane Poole	PERSON	.

		These names assui-e for the series warm appre - ciation in the world of scholarship , for Dr.
Hmit	PERSON	, now President of the
Royal Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, has recently been associated with the Dean of Winchester in editing the best history of the English Church that has yet appeared ; while Mr.
Poole	PERSON	, who , since
Gardiner	PERSON	's death , has been sole editor of the '' English Historical Review , '' has himself done much in other ways for the growth of historical and cartographical science .

		If the names of the editors are likely to in - spire confidence , no less can be said of the au - thors of the twelve volmnes .

		Had another title been sought for the work , this might well have been `` The Oxford English History '' ; for not only the editors , but all except two of the thir - teen authors -LRB- one of the volumes is written by two men -RRB- either are now or have been coim ^ ected with
Oxford University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The two exceptions are Mr.
Thomas Hodgkin	PERSON	, who will write of
England	LOCATION	before the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
George Burton Adams	PERSON	, Professor of History in
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, whose book carries the narra - tive from the Conquest to the end of the reigii of
John	LOCATION	.

		This limitation to a few authors gives each the opportimity for treatment of an extended period , and residts in solid volimies of nearly five hun - dred pages , instead of many individual chapters , as in the ''

1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 123 praiseworthy feature is the thorough biblio - graphical apparatus appended to each volume .

		The etlitors have done their work silently .

		Thus far the volumes appear i ^ - ithout individual prefaces , and one finds no '' etlitors ' introduc - tions '' beyond a two-page statement of the pur - pose of the work as a whole .

		The process of * ' linkin g '' is left to the reader , who , miassisted by editorial finger-posts , may find the good things for himself .

		In this respect the three volumes which we have now to review seem to us to have suffered no loss .

		These volumes are the second , third , and tenth of the series ; and together they amount to more than tliirteen himdred pages of text .

		It is evident that within the limits of a brief review , criticism of detail must give place to general suggestions .

		In Professor
Adams	PERSON	's book , we find the period 1066-1216 handled with the calm judgment which the author 's former writ - ingfs in this and kindred fields have led us to expect ; and we comment on this the more , by reason of the eonti'oversial tone which has per - vaded much that others have written upon the same topic .

		The reigns of the
Norman	PERSON	and earlier Plantagenet kings present to the student many problems which even
England	LOCATION	's wealth of historical sources has not yet made perfectly clear .

		Much of the recent work has been rather destructively critical , and the reflection of this in Professor
Adams	PERSON	's lx -RRB- ok leaves the reader with a certain feeling of negation .

		William , we are told , did not regard aU the land of the English as rightlv confiscate .

		That the manors of the feudal barons were scattered about in different parts of
England	LOCATION	must not be attrib - uted to a conscious intention thereby to weaken their power .

		The traditional view of the mak - ing of the New Forest is open to question .

		The oath at
Salisburj	ORGANIZATION	' , again , was not a very novel performance .

		These negative opinions might leave the student sorrowing for his departed faith , did not Professor
Adams	PERSON	supply occasional passages upon the constitutional changes and social development of the period -- such as the discussion of feudalism -LRB- pp. 14-23 -RRB- or that of ecclesiastical affairs -LRB- pp. 38-50 -RRB- -- so sugges - tive and stiinxdating as to make one regret the great emphasis laid upon political history to the hurt of other fields .

		Taken as a whole , the work of Professor
Adams	PERSON	covers a difficult period of English history with a combination of unity and depth that neither Sir
James Ramsay	PERSON	nor
Miss Norgate	ORGANIZATION	has completely attained .

		With the struggle over the Charter and with the death of
John	ORGANIZATION	, Professor
Adams	PERSON	leaves the story .

		It is taken up by Professor Tout , to whom the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries are familiar groiuid .

		This volume carries the narrative down to
1377	DATE	, and , like the preced - ing one , leaves
England	LOCATION	in an age of transition , -- the age of Froissart , of
Wyclif	LOCATION	, and of Chaucer .

		During this long and eventful time , but four kings ruled in
England	LOCATION	,
Henry III	ORGANIZATION	.

		and the three
Edwards	PERSON	, and son succeeded father .

		Two of them were great , though in very different ways , and with very different results for their land .

		But under all four the growth of
England	LOCATION	's sturdy national life went on .

		In this volimie , as in that which preceded it , we can not but regret the entire subordination of everything to politics , which we do not believe to make all of history .

		Here only a part of the fourth chapter and the entire last chapter are devoted to those deeper changes in town and country , in
Church and University	ORGANIZATION	, in law and art , which after all is said are what to-day inter - est us in mediaeval life .

		But with this limita - tion -- and such it seems to be -- we must not quarrel , for it is an intended characteristic of the whole series .

		From the middle ages to the reign of
George HI	ORGANIZATION	.

		constitutes a sudden and difficult leap , and perhaps this fact is sufficient to account for the feeling of relative disappointment that we get from reading the tenth volume , the work of the editor .

		Dr.
Hunt	PERSON	, which extends over the years 1760-1801 .

		It seems hard for modem English historians who write of the eighteenth century to suppress their own political senti - ments .

		K Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	, for example , has given us a Whiggish history of
England	LOCATION	, here is a good Tory antidote .

		Not that Dr.
Hunt	PERSON	's work is unscientific or intentionally partisan , -- on the contrar -RCB- - there is evidence that the writer has striven to be just throughout .

		His proclivities appear , however , in the descriptive adjectives and epithets applied to men and measures , --
Home Tooke	PERSON	, for example , is always labelled , -- as well as in the larger discussions and inter - pellations of events .

		The younger
Pitt	PERSON	is very properly his hero , and
King Greorge	PERSON	himself appears as a greater man than in most accounts of the reign .

		On the other hand , the Whigs in general , and
Charles James Fox	PERSON	in particular , are handled with an acerbity which contrasts amusingly with the over-sympathetic estimate of Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	.

		For revolutions Dr.
Hunt	PERSON	has no love .

		Speak - ing of the younger
Pitt	PERSON	he says : '' In later days -LSB- he -RSB- altogether abandoned a liberal policy , for he was called on to give
England	LOCATION	that which 124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, is infinitely more important than liberal measures , the preservation of its constitutional and social life from the danger of revolution '' -LRB- p. 283 -RRB- .

		This may be regarded as typical of Dr.
Hunt	PERSON	's attitude .

		What he says of the French Rev - olution would indicate that he took rather a narrow view of the real meaning of that mighty struggle .

		Ireland fares little better .

		But , while it would be of interest to examine Dr.
Hunt	PERSON	's general account of the close of the eighteenth century , we feel that it is more important to discuss briefly his attitude in respect to our own controversy with the mother-country .

		This attitude is strikingly like that of
Chalmers	PERSON	, and is presented in a summary which the author gives on pages 141 -- 142 .

		`` The spirit which imderlay it can be traced with growing distinctness since
1690	DATE	; it was a spirit of inde - pendence , puritan in religion and republican in politics , impatient of control , self-assertive , and disposed to opposition .

		It was irritated by restraints on industry and commerce , and found opportmiities for expression ill a system which gave the colonies representative assemblies while it withheld rights of self-government .

		... It is to be remembered that
England	LOCATION	's colonial policy was then , as it is now , the most liberal in the world .

		American discontent existed before the reign of
George III.	PERSON	; it was kept in check by the fear of French invasion .

		It was when that fear was removed that
England	LOCATION	began to enforce the restraints on com - merce .

		This change in policy fell most heavily on the
New England	LOCATION	provinces , where Whig tendencies were strongest , and specially on
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		A small and violent party in the province famied the flame of dis - content , and the attempts at taxation , which added to the grievances of the colonists , afforded a respectable cry to the fomenters of resistance .

		Their wish was aided by the apprehension aroused in the minds of their fellow countrymen , by the increase in the part played by the prerogative and by the predominance of the
Tories	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	.

		While men in other provinces , as
Patrick Henry	PERSON	in
Virginia	LOCATION	, worked in sympathy with
Samuel Adams	PERSON	and his associates , the revolution was at its outset engineered at
Boston	LOCATION	, and was immediately determined by the quarrel between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		In the events which led to the Revo - lution the British government appears to have shown a shortsighted insistence on legal rights and a contemptu - ous disregard of the sentiments and opinions of the colonists ; the revolutionists generally a turbulent , inso - lent , and unreasonable temper . ''

		With the narrative of the bare events of the Revolution we have little faidt to find , but Dr.
Hunt	PERSON	's interpretation of these , and his grasp of colonial conditions , seem to us not entirely satisfying .

		Let us take for example his descrip - tion of the colonies found on page 54 .

		`` Though Puritanism as a religious force was well nigh extinct in the
Xew England	LOCATION	provinces , it affected the temper of the people : they set a high value on speech making and fine words , and were litigious and obsti - nate ; lawyers were plentif id among them and had much influence . ''

		Dr.
Hunt	PERSON	fails to mention that the legal pro- fession , in
New York	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	, and
Virginia	LOCATION	, was of longer training and of greater reputation : indeed his references to the middle and southern colonies is in general unsat - isfactory .

		Again the author goes on to say : '' Their -LSB- the colonies ' -RSB- constitutions differed in vari - ous points ; in some the governor was appointed by the crown , in others by the proprietary .

		All alike enjoyed a large measure of personal and political freedom ; the had the form and substance of the British Constitution : they had representative assemblies in which they taxed themselves for their domestic purposes , chose most of their own magistrates , and paid them all ; and it was seldom that their legislation was interfered with except with respect to commerce . ''

		Such general statements are hazardous .

		In the proprietary provinces , in
1760	DATE	, the governors , although nominated indeed by the proprietors , were subject to the approval and control of the crown .

		In
Rhode Island	LOCATION	and
Connecticut	LOCATION	, on the contrary , the governors were elected , and not appointed at all .

		As to the choosing of mag - istrates , the statement in the text would have , in the case of some colonies , e. g.
Maryland	LOCATION	, to undergo serious limitation .

		If customs officers are to be included , not all magistrates were paid by the assemblies , and if the last clause be literally true , surely such important exceptions as the vetoes and prohibitory legislation of En - gland as to paper money , land-banks , and tobacco currency shoidd at least be mentioned .

		In this one respect like Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	' , Dr.
Hunt	PERSON	emphasizes the conunercial system as the chief source of colonial irritation .

		His account of tliat system , however , is somewliat loose .

		There was no Navigation Act of
1657	DATE	-LRB- p. 55 -RRB- .

		It should be explained why hefore
1733	DATE	trade with the French West Indies was '' ^ contraband '' -LRB- j -RRB- .

		56 -RRB- .

		We have ventured thus far into detail not because Dr.
Himt	PERSON	's conclusions are necessarily erroneous , but because it seems that they are rather dogmatic .

		Against mmor errors of fact or of exaggeration we are glad to set the general accuracy of the narrative , and the very fair - minded judgment of
Washington	LOCATION	's career , and the calm acceptance of the justice of Andre 's execution .

		Finally , with reference to Dr.
Hunt	PERSON	's general estimate of our rebellion , we feel that the chief deficiency again residts from the concentration of attention upon the legal and political sides of the struggle .

		Revolutionary politics , in very truth , were not always savory : it is only on the deeper grounds of social and economic development that the real imderstand - ing wUl some day be reached .

		THE DIAL 125
Recext American Poetry	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The poetical work of Mr.
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	is always serious and deserving of respectful attention .

		Dur - ing the last ten or twelve years it has been put forth in a series of small volumes that students of Ameri - can literature have learned to greet with welcome and appreciation .

		By reason of being so scattered , his work has failed of its full effect , and has made something less of an impression than it should .

		It is f -RRB- articularly in the sonnet that Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	has worked , and now that he has brought together no less than three hundred and fifty of his sonnets into a single stately volume , it is possible to get a clearer and more comprehensive view of his total achieve - ment tlian has hitherto been vouchsafed .

		This book of sonnets is assm * edly a worthy memorial of the poet 's many yeai-s of endeavor .

		The sonnets are highly finished , and in the orthodox form , except for an intentional departure in one or two special cases , for which artistic justification is not lacking .

		Their range is wide , their diction is noble , and their idealism is of the finer sort .

		Their excellence , moreover , is so even that it is peculiarly difficult to make a representative selection .

		`` With much hesita - tion , we reproduce ' • The Victor . ''

		which is at least as fine as any .

		although no finer tlian a score of others . ''

		I am the Shadow .

		-- I whose brooding wings Are gray with # eons .

		I depopulate The world : and all yon peopled stars await My ravenous scythe .

		Through ehamel dust of kings I come , spuming the scepters .

		Though the stings Of adders still are mine , I bear no hate .

		But am beneficent .

		Minion of Fate , I am the mausoleum of all things .

		Stem and implacable sovereign of the dead .

		But friend to him down-trampled in the strife .

		I , shrouded , cryptic , through the darkness go Silent for ever : yet it hath been said I lift the portals leading unto Life ... And thou , at last , -- it may be thou shalt know . ''

		It might be urged that the arresting thought , the memorable phrase , rarely occurs in Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	's work ; it might also be urged that he does not always escape the temptation of fluency , that his ornament is often purely rhetorical and that he resorts too • CoixECTED So > - KETS OF LtoYD MiFFUs .

		much to conventional imagery .

		We do not press these points , because taken altogether they merely prove that Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	does not quite do what only the supreme masters of the sonnet have done .

		There can be no doubt , in the presence of this collection , that he has given proof of a true poetic gift , and made a considerable contribution to American literature .

		The late
Joseph Trumbull Stickney	PERSON	was born in
1874	DATE	, was graduated from
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1895	DATE	, and died in
1904	DATE	.

		He won high universitj ' honors , at
Cambridge	LOCATION	and afterwards at the
French University	ORGANIZATION	, and during the last year of his life was an instructor at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Most of his manhood and much of his childhood was spent abroad .

		These facts are gleaned from the Biographical Note with which his literary executors have prefaced the volimie of his collected `` Poems . ''

		The contents of this volume include a reprint of the '' Dramatic Verses '' pub - lished in
1902	DATE	, some incomplete dramatic studies , a considerable collection of '' Later Lyrics , '' besides sections of '' Juvenilia '' and '' Fragments . ''

		They represent practically the whole poetical achievement of a man who was both a brilliant scholar and a promising poet a poet whose work fairly justifies his being reckoned among `` the inheritors of unful - filled renown . ''

		Promise rather than fulfillment is the mark of this work as a whole , for it reveals
Stickney	PERSON	as stUl groping for a distinctive manner rather than as having reached a definitive expression of his powers .

		Reviewing his first volume , we were compelled to speak of its `` jarring staccato , '' its '' far-fetched epithets , '' and • • its endeavor to be im - pressive at the cost of clear thinking and verbal restraint . ''

		The '' Later Ljnics '' now first printed show us the process of fermentation still at work , but serve also to deepen our sense of the poet 's pos - sibilities .

		Such a sonnet as this on '' Mt. Ida '' is no mean performance , and may be taken as illustrating the highest level of his attainment . ''

		I long desired to see .

		I now have seen .

		Yonder the heavenly everlasting bride Draws the white shadows to her virgin side ,
Ida	PERSON	, whom long ago God made his Queen .

		The daylight weakens to a fearful sheen ; The mountains slumber seaward sanctified , And cloudy shafts of bluish vapour hide The places where a sky and world have been .

		O
Ida	PERSON	, snowy bride that God espoused Unto that day that never wholly is .

		Whiten thou the horizon of my eyes .

		That when the momentary sea aroused Flows up in earthquake , still thou mayest rise Sacred above the quivering Cyclades . ''

		This is the first of a g ^ oup of three sonnets inscribed to the sacred mountain , and the other two move upon the same serene height of imag ^ ative vision .

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's verse exhibits something of the heroic optimism of his own '' Singer of Joy . '' ''

		He sang the rose , he praised its fragant breath ; -LRB- Alas , he saw the gnawing worm beneath . -RRB-

		He sang of
summer	DATE	and the flowing grass ; -LRB- He knew that all the beauty quick would pass . -RRB-

		He said the world was good and skies were fair ; -LRB- He saw far , gathering clouds , and days of care . -RRB-

		126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Immortally he sang pure friendship 's flame ; -LRB- Yet had he seen it shrivel to a name . -RRB-

		And , ah , he praised true love , with golden speech ; -LRB- What though it was a star he could not reach . -RRB-

		His songs in every soul the hero woke ; -LRB- He in the shadows waited the last stroke . -RRB-

		He was the singer of the joyous art ; -LRB- Down to the grave he bore a broken heart . -RRB- ''

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	draws morals from nature no less than from human life , as the following stanzas attest : '' The clouds upon the mountains rest ; A gloom is on the autumn day ; But down the valley , in the west , The sudden sunlight breaks its way , -- A light lies on the farther hills . ''

		Forget thy sorrow , heart of mine !

		Though shadows fall and fades the leaf .

		Somewhere is joy , though 't is not thine ; The power that sent can heal thy griei ; And light lies on the farther hills . ''

		Thou wouldst not with the world be one If ne'er thou knewest hurt and wrong ; Take comfort , though the darkened sun Never again bring gleam or song , -- The light lies on the farther hills . ''

		The majority of Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	's new poems are occa - sional , and few know as well as he how to find the fitting word or the felicitous phrase with which to celebrate a friend , or a cause , or a memory .

		His tributes to
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	and
John Wesley	PERSON	are models of this kind of composition . ''

		The Vale of
Tempe	LOCATION	'' is , according to a list of titles printed at the back of the book , Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	's sixteenth volume of verse .

		If he should live long enough , there may some time be a sixtieth . ''

		All Art 's over long , '' he remarks in the motto supplied for the present collection , yet we can not help feeling that literature is the richer for these new poems , albeit they strike notes long familiar to his readers .

		Of our present-day ministrants at nature 's shrine , he is perhaps the most unceasing and ardent in his devotions , and inexhaustible is the store of poetic fancy that he consecrates to the object of his wor - ship .

		We quote the lyric called '' Revealment . '' ''

		A sense of sadness in the golden air , A pensiveness , that has no part in care , As if the
Season	ORGANIZATION	, by some woodland pool .

		Braiding the early blossoms in her hair , Seeing her loveliness reflected there , Had sighed to find herself so beautiful . ''

		A breathlessness , a feeling as of fear , Holy and dim as of a mystery near .

		As if the World about us listening went .

		With lifted finger , and hand-hollowed ear .

		Hearkening a music that we can not hear .

		Haunting the quickening earth and firmament . ''

		A prescience of the soul that has no name , Expectancy that is both wild and tame , As if the
Earth	LOCATION	, from out its azure ring Of heavens , looked to see , as white as flame , -- As Perseus once to chained Andromeda came , - -- The swift , divine revealment of the
Spring	DATE	, '' The volume contains many other poems as exquisite as this ; indeed , the most surprising thing about Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	's work is the even excellence which charac - terizes so great a quantity of matter . ''

		The Great Adventure '' is a volume of sonnets by Mr.
George Cabot	PERSON	Lodge .

		His themes are the major triad of Life , Love , and Death .

		The third section is particularly dedicated to the memory of
Trumbull Stickney	PERSON	, and includes the following son - net , which we quote , not as one of the best , but as the one which explains the title of the collection : '' He said : ' We are the Great Adventurers , This is the Great Adventure : thus to be Alive and , on the universal sea Of being , lone yet dauntless mariners .

		In the rapt outlook of astronomers To rise thro ' constellated gyres of thought ; To fall with shattered pinions , overwrought With flight , like unrecorded Lueif ers : -- Thus to receive identity , and thus Return at last to the dark element , -- This is the Great Adventure ! '

		All of us , Who saw his dead , deep-visioned eyes , could see , After the Great Adventure , inmianent , Splendid and strange , the Great Discovery I '' We also quote the sonnet that comes next , as illus - trative of the poet 's occasional habit of experiment - ing in tetrameters . ''

		Above his heart the rose is red .

		The rose above his head is white , The crocus glows with golden light .

		The Spring returns , and he is dead !

		We hark in vain to hear his tread .

		We reach to clasp his hand in vain ; Tho ' life and love return again We can no more be comforted .

		With tearless eyes we keep steadfast His vigil we were sworn to keep : But , when he left us , and at last We saw him pass beyond the Door , And knew he could return no more .

		We wept aloud as children weep . ''

		High praise must be given to the thoughtful and imaginative qualities of Mr.
Lodge	PERSON	's verse ; he is a poet who is visibly gi'owing with each new volume he puts forth , and who may be expected to go far .

		`` The Valley of Dreams , '' by Mr.
H. Hayden Sands	PERSON	, is a volume of lyrics possessing much medi - tative charm and a considerable degi-ee of technical excellence .

		A representative poem is the following : '' Why shed the bitter tears of Death For that which can not be ; Why long to linger in the breaflh Of brief Mortality .

		A brighter Star shall light the
Night	TIME	-- A gladder ending crowns the Fight . ''

		Should we lament the fading rose ?

		The rose shall once more bloom .

		The smiling flower that upgrows Around To-morrow 's tomb .

		Though unperceived unto our eyes Fairer shall bloom to other skies . ''

		And when at last we two shall pass Into the great Unknown , And coming flowers through the grass Their deathless seed have sown .

		We , too , shall see a brighter day .

		Brighter than all long passed away . ''


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 127 We note an occasional tendency to resort to eccen - tricities of diction , of which the following are illus - trations : '' With kisses sweet she tended it , And ` neath its fragrant boon .

		Within her wild hair bended it And sangeth to the moon . '' ''

		What a joyous life is yours !

		What a life of thoughtless hours !

		Winging on your pleasant tours , Through Midsummer 's fragrant bowers . '' ''

		From her tresses all woven and spangled , With those drops the night mignonettes wear , I caught from the odor which tangled , My heart as a rose in her hair , The attollent Love that was there , -- That Pain of all Pains that was there . ''

		The last example is rather cheap
Poe	PERSON	, the second turns liberty to license in the matter of pronunciar tion , and of the first we can do no better than repeat a memorable dictum , and say : '' This will never do . ''

		Nevertheless , Mr.
Sands	PERSON	is no little of a poet , and we have read his verses with pleasure .

		Their form of publication is of a nature to delight the bookish sense . ''

		Old Lamps and New '' is a volume of lyrics and sonnets by Dr.
Edward WUlard Watson	PERSON	.

		They are love songs for the most part , and the mingled joy and poignancy of belated love is their characteristic theme . ''

		The long g ^ y shadows creep and closer fall , The cool night winds across the meadows call ; High in the pallid sky the wan , white moon Swims slowly in the silence over all -- Ah , Love , you weep that night must come so soon . ''

		The sweetness of thy love steals over me ; Life never gave me love till I loved thee , Now , at the eve ; I missed thee all the noon ; So short they seem , the hours that yet may be -- Ah , Love , you weep that night must come so soon . ''

		My arms are close around thee , and they press Unto my heart thy perfect loveliness ; Shall I scorn Fortune 's dear belated boon ?

		Because the hours are few is joy the less ?

		-- Yet still you weep that death must come so soon . ''

		A pretty fancy , but no particular depth of emo - tion , characterizes Mr.
Bayne	PERSON	's volume of verse .

		`` Afloat '' is a pleasing example . ''

		Ah I could we ever drift and dream In these cool coverts of repose , The world , like yonder restless stream Which vainly sparkles as it flows , Would leave beneath thy sweet control The calmed Propontis of my sonl . ''

		Still , if in this enchanted sphere No longer we may drift and dream , 'T is ours at least to wake and steer , 'T is ours to leave the restless stream , And twine from roses of to-day A garland for some happier
May	DATE	. ''

		Sometimes , as in `` There are other eyes in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' we have society verse pure and simple . ''

		There are other eyes in
Spain	LOCATION	, -- Dark and dazzling eyes ,
Crncita	LOCATION	,
Rosebud	ORGANIZATION	lips which wait the rain Like the harvest for
Demeter	ORGANIZATION	.

		Do not distance with disdain : There are other eyes in
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Robert Chenault Givler	PERSON	is the author of a volume of - ` Poems , '' printed upon bufE paper , and bearing no evidence of its place of origin .

		The contents are given over to musings and raptures , silvery moonlight and gentle melancholy , abstract questionings and meditations upon nature , life , love , and eternity .

		We quote these striking lines upon the '' Violoncello '' : ' * What hand first formed thee , Wind-harp of the soul ?

		Not that of man ; this scroll , these curves and strings Are faded memories of immortal things Our spirits saw ere
Time	ORGANIZATION	began to roll His fretful stream ` twixt both eternities . ''

		What sound is that , which floats upon the breeze Like a lost star searching the cave of night For hiding place , to soothe its virgin light Li the soft sobbing of the forest wind ?

		The tremulous sound grows softer than the dew That slips between the leaves , and sweeter stall Than sound of pebbles toyed by
midnight	TIME	rill . ''

		These lines are undoubtedly poetry , and they rep - resent only a fair average of the author 's gift of expression . ''

		A Southern Flight '' is a small volume of ten - der and gfraceful lyrics , the joint production of two singers whose note is always clear and pure .

		Mr.
Frank Dempster Sherman	PERSON	signs '' At Dusk . '' ''

		The air is filled with scent of musk Blown from the garden 's court of bloom , Where rests the rose within her room And dreams her fragrance in the dusk . ''

		Above , attended by the stars , The full moon rises , round and white , -- A boat in the blue
Nile of night Drifting	ORGANIZATION	amid the nenuphars . '' ''

		And now the whippoorwill who knows A lyric ecstasy divine Begins his song .

		Ah !

		sweetheart mine .

		What shall love 's answer be , my Rose ? ''

		Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	is the other poet , and he it is who thus sings `` At Twilight '' : '' A little shallow silver urn , High in the west the new moon hnng ; Amid the palms a fountain flung Its snowy floss , and there , above .

		With its impassioned unconcern , A hidden bird discoursed of love . ''

		I felt your hand upon my arm Flutter as doth a thrush 's wing , Then tighten .

		Sweet , how small a thing Draws kindred spirits heart to heart !

		More was that hour 's elusive charm To US than eloquence or art . ''

		Mr.
Duncan Campbell Scott	PERSON	's '' New World Lyrics and Ballads '' includes several pieces in somewhat ruder measures than are acceptable to a sensitive ear , but contains also a few poems as good as any that the author has previously published .

		We are particularly impressed with the truth and high spir - itual beauty of '' The House of the Broken-Hearted . '' ''

		It is dark to the outwsird seeming , Wherever its walls may rise , Where the meadows are a-dreaming , Under the open skies .

		It is dark in the midst of the city , ^ Vhere the world flows deep and strong , Where the coldest thing is pity , Where the heart wears out ere long .

		Where the plow - share of wrath and of wrong Trenches a ragged fuiTow , Round the house of the broken-hearted .

		The house of sorrow . ''

		But while the world goes unheeding The tenant that holds the lease , Or fancies him grieving and pleading For the thing which it calls peace , There has come what shall never cease Till there shall come no morrow To the house of the broken-hearted The house of sorrow . ''

		There is peace no pleasure can jeopard , It is so sure and deep .

		And there , in the guise of a shepherd ,
Grod	PERSON	doth him keep ; He leads His beloved sheep To fold when the day is departed .

		In the house of sorrow .

		The house of the broken-hearted . ''

		If we might make further quotations , they should be of '' A Nest of Hepaticas . '' ''

		O Passion of the coming of the

		When the light love has captured everytliing .

		As we opened the present review with the collected verse of one of our own most serious singers , so we will close it with '' The Collected Poems of
Wilfred Campbell	PERSON	, '' a poet whose inspiration is both strong and sustained .

		We set no particular store by the fact that an
American Maecenas	ORGANIZATION	has purchased an edition of this volume for distribution among the various libraries of his foundation .

		It is a fact useful for advertising purposes , just as President
Roose	PERSON	- velt 's recent laudation of '' The Children of the Night '' was useful , but in neither case does the dis - tinction have any critical weight , for it might just as easily have fallen to some far less meritorious work .

		But Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's poetry , quite independ - ently of this sort of uncritical patronage , deserves serious consideration , and the volume of it , now brought together , is surprisingly large .

		It is classi - fied in eight divisions , of which the first , called '' Elemental and Human Verse , '' comes perhaps the nearest to exhibiting the predominant notes of the whole .

		In other words , nature and the soul of man are the lofty themes which inspire the poet through - out .

		But the natm ' e of Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	's interpreta - tion is not the conventionalized and sophisticated affair of the bookish poet ; it is the universal mother conceived of in her elemental and passionate char - acters , sung of in strains of intimate sympathy and rapturous communion .

		And his conception of the soul of man is that of '' man the hoper , man the dreamer , the eternal child of delight and despair whose ideals are ever a lifetime ahead of his greatest accomplishments , who is the hero of nature and the darling of the ages .

		Because of this , true poetry will always be to him a language , speaking to him from the highest levels of his being , and a sort of translation from a more divine tongue emanating from the mystery and will of God . ''

		These words are taken from the dignified confession of poetical faith with which the collection is prefaced .

		Trans - lated into verse a few pages further on , the thought thus takes form : '' Earth 's dream of poetry will never die .

		It lingers while we linger , base or true -- A part of all this being .

		Life may change .

		Old customs wither , creeds become as nought , Like autumn husks in rainwinds ; men may kill All memory of the greatness of the past , Kingdoms may melt , republics wane and die .

		New dreams arise and shake this jaded world ; But that rare sjjirit of song will breathe and live While beauty , sorrow , greatness hold for men A kinship with the eternal ; until all That earth holds noble wastes and fades away . ''

		The greater part of the work now collected has made a previous appearance in other forms , and we have more than once paid tribute to its sincerity and beauty .

		Besides this lyrical work , Mr.
Campbell	PERSON	has to his account eight poetical dramas , which he promises to collect for us into a companion volume .

		A coruribuiion ^ he '' Portfolio '' monogi-aphs , one to the study of of the most valuable series on artistic DutcJi paintinu .

		subjects in English , has recently , after several years ' interregnum , given us matter for congratulation in the publication of Sir
Walter Arm	PERSON	- strong 's volume on '' The Peel Collection and the Dutch School of Painting '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The purpose of the author , one of the most discriminating of art critics , is to refute that premature judgment of
Ruskin	PERSON	which is quoted from the opening pages of his '' Modern Painters '' to the effect that '' most pictures of the Dutch School , except always those of Rubens ,
Van Dyke	PERSON	, and
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	, are ostenta - tious exhibitions of the artist 's power of speech , the clear and vigorous elocution of useless and senseless words . ''

		Sir
Walter	PERSON	doubts if this be true , and shows convincingly that the great Dutch painters speak '' the same language as the gi'eat Italians of the sixteenth century or the great Athenians of

		THE DIAL 129 .4 practical believer in the Golden Rule .

		twenty centuries before . ''

		Although the book nomi - nally deals only with the pictures in the Peel Col - lection , it is reaUy a monograph on the whole
Dutch School	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his treatment of the painters of still life , of landscape , and of portraits , the author makes clear who are the greatest masters in each gi'oup and gives his reasons for their rank .

		Ajiiong artists of the present day om * critic will find ready sympathy for all that he says in regard to the slight impor - tance of subject as compared with the supreme imi -RRB- ortance of style , of artistic worth .

		The chief difference between the Dutch and Italian artists , so Sir
Walter	PERSON	argues , lies in their choice of subject .

		The landscapes and the models which these painters of the North portray are inferior in beauty to those which naturally served as material for the artists of the South .

		Yet no ai-t has ever been condemned j for the humbleness of its subject-matter .

		Among the many interesting points in this book are the author 's illustrations of the famUiar idea that a work of art is the interpretation of natm ' e through the tempei-ament of the artist .

		He makes another good point in what he says about the focus of a painting , -- the size and character of the brush-strokes in relation to the size of the painting and to the dis - tance proper to a correct view .

		Since this is not a histoiy of j -RRB- ainting .

		but a critical monograph , the author is perfectly justified in omitting discussion of certain important painters , as
Hals	PERSON	and Rembrandt , who are not represented in the
Peel Collection	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is perhaps the best contribution to the critical study of Dutch painting since the publication of `` Les JSIaitres d' Autrefois '' -LRB- 1875 -RRB- .

		It will enhance the appreciation of these great painters .

		It is something new in the literature of art .

		Its criti - cism is fresh and stimulating .

		It is a book which eveiy lover of the Dutch School should possess , in order to read and re-read .

		In his Introduction to the '' Letters of Labor and Love , '' by the late Mayor Jones of
Toledo	LOCATION	, Mr.
Brand Whitlock	PERSON	has said , better than can the re \ 4ewer , those things the reviewer would wish to say .

		And after a careful reading of these letters , written by '' Golden Rule ''
Jones	PERSON	to his working-men , one feels that they must appeal to every fair-minded reader , as they do to Mr.
Whitlock	PERSON	, as the simple and spontaneous expression of the beliefs of a spiritxud - minded yet singularly practical man , with a gen - erous and abiding faith in his fellow-men .

		The predominant idea of the book is that of libert -RCB- ' .

		There is scarcely a letter in which the writer does not recur to the thought of greater liberty and equality among men .

		The story of Mayor
Jones	PERSON	's life is well known , -- how he rose , as the result of an invention of his own , from the position of a humble worker in the oil-fields to a place of wealth and authority : how he educated himself in no mean manner ; how he put in practice the beliefs that he j formulated ; how his life so won upon the people I that he was elected to office again and again , over j the heatls of party candidates ; and how in his death he was mourned as many greater men are not .

		It was this living out and living up to his beliefs that won such results ; he was no mere theoidst , and hav - ing decided for himself what was the cause of much of the unhappiness in the world , he did his utmost to overcome this unhappiness by what he considered just and fair treatment of the working-man .

		These letters show plainly what were his principles of action : in one particularly -LRB- • • Politics , '' written the next day after election , in
1900	DATE	-RRB- , he states his jwlit - ical belief in no imcertain terms . ''

		I am for a social and political order that will be true in every detail to the idea of
Elquality	LOCATION	, that all men are created equal .

		I am for a social system that will grant to every baby bom on the planet equality of opportunity with every other baby .

		I am against a system that destroys a few by making them inordinately rich , while it destroys many by making them inordinately poor .

		I am for peace , for har - mony , for heaven ; I am against war and hat `` and helL I am against government by force anywhere , and for government by consent everywhere ... My only hope , and all of my hope , is in the patriotism of the people , the love of man for man ; I have no hope in any kind of partyism . ''

		A man who believed these things so strongly , who acted them out in his daily life to the best of his power and opportunity , who refused a nomination to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	because he would not be bound by any party expectations or party ties ; and who did his best to spread his ideas because he was convinced they were right , would always be sure of a following .

		As the most forcible and significant utterances of such a man , these letters should find a ready wel - come not only among his admirers but also among all who are interested in the deeper problems of societj - .

		But that is a reason for its existence .

		Lavish - ness is its aim .

		The book is a box of spikenard , poured in unappeasable love over one who has attended my life . ''

		The result of this great labor of love is probably the most minute and exhaustive edition of an English minor poet that has ever been published .

		Nearly one-half of the first volume is filled by a series of Introductory Essays dealing with matters essential to a general understanding of
Herbert	LOCATION	's poetrj - ; such as the great events of his time , his life and character , the type of his religious verse , his style and technique .

		Most important of all is the essay explaining and justifying the ` man - ner in which Professor
Palmer	PERSON	has arranged and grouped the poems .

		Chronology and subject-matter resolve them into twelve significant groups , to each of which special prefaces are furnished .

		Professor
Pabner	PERSON	's essays are terse , direct , and pithy , felicitous in their combination of tii'eless scholarly research and infectious enthusiasm .

		The notes to the poems 130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, are voluminous , but a simple classification makes selection among them easy .

		They include explana - tions of the text , cross-references to similar passages in
Herbert	PERSON	or his contemporaries , and the most illu - minating comments and illustrations that have been proposed by previous editors .

		The illustrations '' attempt to exhibit whatever portions of
Herbert	LOCATION	's visible world have survived the centm-ies . ''

		They show his homes , the churches with which he was con - nected , his portraits , -- including what was probably the original of them all , not hitherto published , -- and many interesting facsimiles of his manuscripts and printed works .

		The prose writings are included partly for their intrinsic interest , but more for the light they throw ujwn the man and the poems , upon which it is Professor
Palmer	PERSON	's great wish to concentrate attention .

		Type , paper , and binding are of the finest quality , so that no pains have been spared to make the new edition as notable in mechanical features as it is rich in scholarship and in inspiration .

		It will be long before the edition is superseded as a final effort to reconstnict the personality and inter - pret the vital message of

		find , not a book for the mere nature - lover , and certainly not one for or by the theoretical farmer , but one in which the author has endeavored to set down such results of her experiences as will help others who wish to make an attempt as earnest if not as extended as her own .

		She was moved to try to make a dream come true , and by means of advertising she obtained a farm of twelve acres , not far from the city , containing a number of old build - ings and a small orchard .

		Her endeavor was to make this rented place support itself ; and beginning with six setting hens , she gradually added ducks , guinea-hens , and rabbits , until the place became a veritable stock-farm , while at the same time the gar - den supplied the table , and the family savings soon purchased a cow .

		After the first year and a half she found herself able to bank the sum previously spent in living expenses .

		The chief thing is that , instead of experiencing discomfort and privations , the family lived in greater comfort and happiness than before .

		As might be expected , the book in which such experiences and triumphs are unfolded is quite different from the ordinary garden books , although it contains seasonable advice about the vegetable and fruit garden , the mushroom bed , the care and feeding of poultry , ducks , geese , guinea - hens , rabbits , the cow , pigeons , the family horse , bees , turkeys , pheasants , choice cats , and pigs .

		The author 's directions are simple and untechnical , and generally clear , for she has borne in mind her own unfortunate experiences in consulting expert refer - ence-books .

		There are also many suggestions and time-saving and labor-saving devices that only a woman would think of ; so that , while the volume contains information useful for any amateur , it is preeminently of value to the woman who wishes to undertake a small farm or to make an individual income by means of one or more of the pursuits described .

		Its arrangement is good , gi'ouping under each month the work and preparations esjjecially suited to the period , and summing up the author 's ten-years ' experience in the way most likely to be helpful to the reader .

		She writes with that tem - pered enthusiasm that is apt to be convincing ; and although she takes her subject seriously , she allows herself occasional touches of humor .

		There are many illustrations from photograplis , and a detailed table of contents , but no index .

		As before , the studies have been chosen with a view to representing the best of both the historic and the literary criticism of Sainte-Beuve .

		There have been slight omissions of passages lacking in present interest , and where several essays upon one person exist they have been combined , omitting repeti - tions .

		The volumes are illustrated with portraits , and handsomely bound in buckram .

		M.
Edmond Scherer	PERSON	's appreciation of Sainte-Beuve , written in
October , 1869	DATE	, at the time of the latter 's death , forms an illuminating introduction to the first vol - ume .

		At a time when criticism has become a business rather than a vocation , it is worth while to recall
M. Scherer	PERSON	's account of Sainte-Beuve 's aims and methods , -- of the slow but sm-e development of his critical bent , -- and we must inevitably wonder , with him , whether '' the royalty of letters is not fated to pass away like the other royalties , '' or whether out of the '' general mediocrity '' of English criticism there wiU ever arise another Sainte-Beuve .

		Meanwhile for delicacy , good taste , profundity of research , and brilliancy of finish , his work remains unique , and well deserves the tribute of adequate translation and sumptuous publication now being rendered it .

Ffrangcou Davies	PERSON	's trea - ehaptert on tise ou '' The Singing of the Future '' the vocal art .

		-LRB- j ^ i ^ L ^ ue
Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a direct and serious appeal to the English-speaking singer .

		The author argues that voice and the singing instinct -- regarded from the physical point of view -- are comparatively scarce ; but that they are plentiful enough , if men gave greater heed to their psychic powers , to supply us with a larger number of lasting and suggestive types of singers than we now possess .

		The singing instinct is more general , and musical ability more latently plentiful , than many of us imagine , -- as witness the behavior of an audience under the influence of a Reeves or a
Joachim	PERSON	.

		And the germ being there , the step between appreciation and performance is not insurmountable .

		Given a fairly keen sense of pitch and rhythm , -- in other words , modest musical intuition and cap > acity for work , -- and singing becomes a mere matter of practical development , under the guidance of lin - guistic and imaginative thought .

		The strongest recommendation which Mr.
Davies	PERSON	makes as the ideal of the singer is to strive for mastery over all tj ` pes of human expression , with verisimilitude as the guiding principle .

		This implies that voice culture can not be regarded as something apart from general culture : and the singer who woidd satisfy the highest demands of his profession should not confine his study within the bounds of the art to which he is primarily devoted .

		The artist should not beguile his audience with lovely and sensuous tone merely because the power happens to be within his natural gifts , -- he should not ovei ^ awe with physical prowess to the detriment of lin - guistic purity .

		One notices the touch of sincerity in Mr.
Davies	PERSON	's work , and his chapters on '' Tone , '' '' Breathing , '' and '' Style '' may be profitably read by musicians as well as singers .

		Romance and ^ he person of sensibiUty who could hutorv of an remain umnoved by the picturesque Italian valley , chama , the historic association , the artistic treasures , and the religious history of the Casentino .

		would doubtless be hard to find .

		But harder still to discover is the pen that could do justice to that poetic valley .

		Miss
EUa Noyes	ORGANIZATION	, in her book called `` The Casentino and its Story '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is not lacking in the enthusiasm that all but the insensate must feel -- an enthusiasm that has letl her to make most careful exploration , patient investigation , and loving exposition of the scenes and memories of the favored region .

		Unfortunately , this enthusiasm , and the luxury of indulging a very lively historic imagination , have betrayed the author into generalizations and theories that a scientific analysis of history will not always justify ; and her descrip - tions of scenery have an exuberance that detracts 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, somewhat from their descriptive value .

		To cover in a vohime of 323 pages one of the most pictm-esque valleys of
Italy	LOCATION	, which is at the same time a great religious centre both 2 -RRB- ast and present , the scene of a part of the exile of
Italy	LOCATION	's greatest poet as well as the former home of some of the most important families in Tuscan Middle Age history , is no light task .

		Perhaps we should not be surprised that the charcoal-burners , who are among the chief charms of the modern Casentino , are dismissed with only casual mention in two places in the text .

		In view of the difficulty of portraying the Casentino ade - quately in words , one is grateful to find the pen so artistically supplemented by the brush .

		Miss
Dora Noyes	PERSON	's illustrations , twenty-five in color and twenty - four line , really are illustrations , for they give an accurate idea of the country ; but they are also much more than mere illustrations , for they have poetic feeling and imagination , and they add materially to the charm of the volume .

		Shall the earth ^ S ^ ^ at deal has been written in be kept still regard to man 's duty toward the habitable f futm ' e State and the citizens thereof .

		The rights of the child , the rights of the commu - nity , the rights of art , have all been discussed , with reference not only to the needs of the present gen - eration but of those to come .

		The factor ' that is least considered is the earth itself , and our obliga - tions toward a proper husbanding of its resources .

		Nothing in law or economics can have a more impor - tant bearing on the welfare of posterity than mate - rial conditions , the soil , the sea , the mines , from which are drawn in various ways most of the power and subsistence necessary to the life of man .

		Yet the duty that one generation owes to another in the matter of the proper fertilization of agi `` icultm * al lands , the preservation of forests , economical meth - ods of mining , careful regard for the life-habits of fishes and game , is seldom urged .

		This duty is the theme of Professor
Nathaniel Shaler	PERSON	's latest book , which he calls '' Man and the Earth '' -LRB- Fox , Duf - field
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is impossible to support theories as to future conditions of land and sea by statistics , because of the varying processes governing these conditions .

		But Professor
Shaler	PERSON	, with his wide knowledge of natural sciences , is in the best possible position to draw conclusions from existing states .

		As a result , he has written an interesting little book , which will repay reading , and which , it is to be hoped , will result in directing attention to the vital subject of which it treats .

		The history of ^ ^ ^ history of our smallest common - our smallest wealth has been a stormy one , owing commonwealth , largely to the peculiar ideas of its founders and the circumstances of its founding .


Rhode Island	LOCATION	was the refuge of those
New England	LOCATION	men and women who were so extreme in their views and positions that they were driven out of the other colonies .

		It was largely a collection of idealists , cranks , and enthusiasts ; and the policy of the com - monwealth that grew out of the combination was necessarily individualistic .

		From the days of
Roger Williams	PERSON	down to recent times , separatism has been a marked characteristic of the little state .

		The result of this has been a history full of internal strife and of opijosition to national tendencies .

		There was much that was selfish and mean in these struggles , so that the state was a thorn in the side of the states - men who were building up the nation .

		But
Rhode Island	LOCATION	history has also its glories , the gi'eatest being its consistent policy of religious toleration when the world was intolerant .

Flower Observatory	ORGANIZATION	, and the measure of
1066	DATE	double and multiple stars .

		For the first-named series of observations Mr.
Charles L. Doolittle	PERSON	is respon - sible ; for the other , Mr.
Eric Doolittle	PERSON	.

		Of the thi-ee papers included in the
October	DATE	'' Uni - ^ - ersity Studies '' of the
University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	, the one that is of most interest to our readers is that in which Professor
C. W. Wallace	PERSON	prints and discusses certain '' Newly-Discovered Shakespeare Documents . ''

		The documents are three in number , and of a legal character .

		They were foimd by Professor
Wallace	PERSON	in the archives of the
Public Record Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		Tennyson 's '' In Memoriam , '' published in something like '' Golden Treasurj - '' garb by the
Macmillau Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is an edition '' annotated by the author . ''

		This means , in the words of the present
Lord Tennyson	PERSON	, that the '' notes were left by my father partly in his own hand - Avriting , and partly dictated to me . ''

		Since there are some twenty-five pages of them , they are a valuable addition to our apparatus for the study of the poem , and will serve to decide many a disputed point .

		A lengthy introduction by the poet 's son is also included , embodying the opinions of several of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's most famous contemporaries , and gi \ - ing a fairly clear state - ment of his religious attitude .

		It will be evident from our description that this is a very precious little book . ''

		The Musician 's Library , '' published by the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	, grows apace .

		It now numbers a score of volumes , about eqiuiUy divided between compositions for voice and for piano .

		The latest of these vohunes are two containing '' Songs and Airs by
George Frideric Handel	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
Ebenezer Prout	PERSON	.

		The first vohmie contains pieces for high voice , and the second pieces for low voice .

		The introductory matter is the same for both volumes , and consists of a carefully - written critical and biographical study , besides a chrono - logical index .

		There are eighty selections in all , forty for each volume .

		Six are from '' Messiah , '' and five each from '' Samson '' and ''
Judas Maccabaeas	PERSON	. ''

		Vocal - ists will be most grateful for the operatic arias , which are far less accessible than the numbers representing the oratorios .

		A most interesting and important publishing enter - prise is announced by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in conjunction with Messrs. Dent of
London	LOCATION	.

		This is a series of reprints , under the general title of '' Every - man 's Library , '' of the great books in everj - department of literature , carefully edited , handsomely printed and boimd , and sold at the low price of
fifty cents	MONEY	a volume .

		Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	is general editor of the series , and critical introductions to the various volumes will be supplied by such writers as
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	,
Andrew Lang	PERSON	,
Lord Avebury	PERSON	,
A. C. Swinburne	PERSON	,
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	,
Herbert Paul	PERSON	,
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	,
Richard Gamett	PERSON	,
HUaire Belloc	PERSON	, and
George Saints	ORGANIZATION	- bury .

		That the mechanical form of the volumes will be the best that modem methods of printing , paper - making , and binding can produce is assured by Mr.
Dent	PERSON	's connection with the plan .

		The series is to be published in quarterly instalments of about fifty vol - umes each , the first of which will appear next month .

		We trust this undertaking will meet the ^ ^ ■ ide popidar success that it is sure to deserve .

		Mr.
Richard Bagot	PERSON	, an English novelist of conscientious industry and creditable perform - ance , has made the
February	DATE	'' Nineteenth Cen - tury ' the vehicle of certain reflections upon the present condition of literary criticism as it affects the \* Titer of fiction .

		He finds that condition to be extremely unsatisfactory , and makes tenta - tive suggestion of a corrective for its obvious shortcomings .

		Since the conditions he describes obtain quite as noticeably on this side of the water as on the other , his article shoidd prove equally interesting to both American and En - glish readers .

		He calls attention , to b ^ in with , to the con - tradictory character of the reviewing of current fiction .

		It is quite common for a novel to run the whole gamut of criticism from highest praise to severest censure , when in all probability the book is just an ordinary ephemeral production , deserving of neither extreme , but simply calling for a few words of classification and illustrative comment .

		Sometimes , as in a case cited from his own recent experience , the novelist has the malicious satisfaction of finding both kinds of estimates in different issues of the same journal .

		Thus , even if he pins his faith to some particular organ of literary opinion , his confidence is liable to be shaken by the rudest of shocks .

		And in any case , '' the perplexed novelist is liable to read in one leading organ that he has WTitten a work which places him in the front rank of living wTiters of fiction , and in another that he is ignorant of the very rudiments of the art of novel-writing . ''

		It is a hard problem .

		The nov - elist himself may lay to his soul the flattering unction of the laudatory judgment , although he will hardly do so without some misgi \ Tngs , but the reader in search of light will not know what to think .

		Another very evident defect in the reviewing of fiction is that the criticism so often comes from persons having no familiarity with the subject-matter of the work criticised . ''

		A novel dealing , we will say , with foreign life is reviewed perhaps by a critic who has no knowledge of the people and the country in which the scene 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, of the book in question is laid .

		How , it may be asked , is such a critic to be a sound and reliable guide either to author or public ? ''

		How , indeed !

		And to what confusion worse confounded are we led when a novelist describes some phase of life with which he lias himself no intimate ac - quaintance , and his work is then reviewed by a critic whose knowledge of the subject is even more superficial !

		The '' society '' novel offers the most obvious example of this condition of things .

		Some portrayal of smart life is described by the reviewers as a brilliant social satire or as a new `` Vanity Fair , '' and the writers of such books '' are supposed by the outside public to know intimately that society of which they write with such assurance . '' ''

		But how many critics are there , '' asks Mr.
Bagot	PERSON	, '' who can boldly tell the distinguished author that he , or she , has made well-bred people say , do , and think things en - tirely foreign to their nature and caste tradi - tions ? ''

		That such defects as have above been indi - cated , and many others as glaring , characterize most current criticism of fiction , is a fact too apparent to need demonstration .

		And the rea - sons are equally apparent .

		To make a truly intelligent estimate of even a novel requires ability of a sort so rare and valuable as to be at the command of very few newspapers or other periodicals , it also demands an amount of space that can not possibly be devoted to any single book of the class that numbers its thousands yearly .

		The problem set the average reviewer of the average novel is simply this : What is the most profitable employment I may make of the two hours and the two hundred words which are all I can give to this book ?

		A personal im - pression , a bit of description or classification , an indication of some salient feature , and a word or two about the workmanship are all that may be attempted imder the narrow conditions imposed .

		Reviewing done subject to those limitations wiU have weight in proportion to the ability and knowledge of the reviewer -- and the brief para - graph may often be surprisingly weighty -- but of course it will be anything but adequate to the claims of any book that really calls for serious consideration .

		Mr.
Bagot	PERSON	, taking his cue from French prac - tices , from the positive fact of French official criticism and the negative fact that the French press does not , as a rule , attempt to review the whole output of current fiction , ventures a sug - gestion which , while it offers great difficulties on the practical side , is at least interesting and worthy of consideration . ''

		What if the entire press , '' he asks , '' should agree to ignore all works of fiction sent in for review which did not bring with them to the editorial offices a guar - antee that they liad duly passed an initial stage of examination , and had been declared worthy of the notice of the journalistic critic ?

		And what if the circvdating libraries declined to subscribe to any but works of fiction thus ImUmarked ?

		It might , I think , reasonably be supposed that some such purifying process as this would tend considerably to reduce the flood of undesirable matter ; that it woidd diminish the work of the reviewer ; and that the art of the novelist and the taste and literary discernment of the novel - reading public would gradually be raised . ''

		Having made this suggestion , Mr.
Bagot	PERSON	pro- ceeds to enlarge upon the benefits , to both authors and readers , that might follow in the train of its adoption .

		He develops the argu - ment with caution , but with a very evident prepossession in favor of some such method as a means of stemming the flood of worthless fiction and of giving the novelist himself a kind of comisel of which he often stands in dire need .

		We can imagine the outcry of the amateur novelist , and of the professional sensation - monger , at any such suggestion of a '' trust '' in literary criticism .

		And the question of quis custodiet custodes could be very effectively raised by such a proposal .

		Originality , and even genius , might possibly for a time be sup - pressed by the operation of such a plan , but we can not believe that in the long run it would not work more good than harm .

		The difficidty , of course , would lie in the constitution of the tribunal organized for this judicial sifting of the tares from the wheat .

		To accept the re - sponsibilities of a lihadamanthus in this matter wovdd be to accept a thankless task , and one certain to entail much discomfort upon the in - cumbent .

		The rage of the rejected woidd be anything but celestial , and would be declared in a manner both personal and pointed .

		Mr.
Bagot	PERSON	appreciates the difficidty of the problem , and it is with no little diffidence that he pro- poses his press-constituted academy .

		But the experiment is not beyond the range of possibil - ity , and the library profession is already looking for some way of trying it .

		Certainly the long - suffering public , now misled by so many blind guides , deserves to have its interests protected by the critical guild more effectively than they are at present protected , and no suggestion aiming at so praiseworthy an end should fail of being examined with due deliberation .

		THE DIAL 143 COMMUNICA TION .

		LATE DISCUSSIONS OF THE WAR OF
1812	DATE	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In reading the re \ ` iew of Captain
Mahan	PERSON	's `` Sea Power and the War of
1812	DATE	, '' in a recent number of The Dial , I notice what seems to me the omission of an important fact , and one that is none too prominently brought out in the book itself .

		There is , however , some discussion of it in the book , and it seems to me that it should have had a place in the re \ ` iew .

		It is the fact of the chief cause tliat led
Great Britain	LOCATION	to make such favorable tenus with us in ending the war .

		Tliat our land forces , in spite of the almost marvellous incapacity of the commanding generals and the blimder - ing and short-sightedness of the
Washington	LOCATION	government -LRB- and of
Jefferson	LOCATION	previously -RRB- , finally did some fairly good work , is true ; and certainly our n & vj , considering how it was neglected at the start , was splendidly efficient .

		But when all of tliis is considered there is still not enough to account for the residt -- for the readiness with which
Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	made peace .

		It will of course be borne in mind that her gi-eat defeat at
New Orleans	LOCATION	-- the defeat that riuned her most promising plan -- was not known when she so readily entered into the arrangements for peace .

		Then what was the cause ?

		It was not the problem of Xapoleon , -- he was defeated ; and though
England	LOCATION	's expenses for the recent wars were heavy , her opportimity was good for getting a large part of it back from iLS .


Russia	LOCATION	, our friend , was certainly not in shape to go to war with the first sea power in the world to help us .

		There was just as certainly no other power to attempt it , even had there been another as friendly .

		But if
Great Britain	LOCATION	coidd hope to recoup herself from our lands and goods , was she in military shape to go on ?

		She was at the height of her military power .


Wellington	LOCATION	's veterans were out of the
Peninsula	LOCATION	, other forces had been organized , and there was sufficient money in the war-chest for immediate purposes .

		And on the sea
Great Britain	LOCATION	stood as she had never stood before , and probably never will stand again .

		She mmibered her war-ci-aft by the himdreds , and after the French shadow had been lifted she had more than two himdred vessels to send to our coasts .

		We had four large frigates , and not a sliip larger , and had mustered just seventeen fighting vessels at the beginning of the war .

		Before the negotiations at Ghent the larger number of our stronger vessels were taken or blockaded in port .

		Of our four large frigates , the '' Constitution '' alone kept the seas .

		True , as Captain
Mahan	PERSON	points out , and your reviewer does not , before our little navy was so nearly crushed it had struck heavj ^ financial blows at the enemy .

		This , indeed , wath the possible exception of the \ ` ictorj - on
Lake Champlain	LOCATION	, was its most formidable and telling work .

		It was the `` work that
Great Britain	LOCATION	most seriously ■ felt .

		Her \ idnerable point was not her body , but her pocket .


Porter	PERSON	, in the little '' Essex , '' before he was captured , did more to harm the enemy and to help our cause than aU oiir brilliant single-ship actions put to - gether .

		He practically destroyed the Biitish whaling interests in the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		And now we are prepared to answer the question : -- What led
Great Britain	LOCATION	to consent to peace-terms so favorable to us ?

		The answer is : it was the work of our privateers .

		Even Captain
Mahan	PERSON	, who natiirally has a relatively high regard for the regular ser ^ - ice , and is not inclined to place a great value upon an irregular one , in part admits this .

		He says : `` From
September 30 , 1813	DATE	, ... to the corresponding date in
1814	DATE	, there were captured by American cruisers 639 vessels , chiefly merchantmen ; a number that had increased to over a thousand when the war ended the following winter . ''

		He further goes on to estimate that fully 424 of these prizes were taken in foreign seas .

		He says , however , that we had lost more vessels relatively by capture than the enemy ; but he then goes on to say : '' Her cruisers -LSB- i. e. , the
U. S.	PERSON	cruisers -RSB- were causing exaggerated anxiety concerning the intercourse between
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, which , though certainly molested , was not seriously interrupted . ''

		It will be observed that he does not minimize the effect that even an exaggerated fear might have in influencing the course of the enemy so alarmed .

		By the word '' cruisers '' is of course to be understood chiefly privateers .

		The small number of vessels in our regular navy has already been spoken of .

		But it has been said that all sorts of food-stuffs went up greatly in price in this country after the additional British war-ships came over , so that we were in fully as great straits as English subjects in this regard , and that therefore
Great Britain	LOCATION	had still an advantage .

		We only need to look at this statement for a moment to see where the truth lies .

		We had a great and prolific territory from which to obtain all necessary foods ; Eng - land had to import a great deal of what she used , and the wages and other incomes of those who must pur - chase were very low .

		At that time the whole of
England	LOCATION	, if divided equally amongst the people , would have given but a very few acres to each person -- probably not more than five or six ; yet several great noblemen owned as many as ten to twenty thousand acres each , and a con - siderable part of this was not under ciUtivation .

		In this comitry we had hardly settled or cultivated beyond our mere borders , and there was laud by the million acres to be had almost for nothing .

		But let us glance for a moment at some actual figures of prices in
England	LOCATION	about this time .

		I quote from '' The American Merchant Marine , '' though the figures have been published elsewhere .

		The work mentioned says : '' In Jime
1813	DATE	the British people were paying the famine prices of 358 a barrel for flour , .338 for beef , and -336 for pork , while lumber cost S72 per thousand .

		It was this economic distress , more than our brilliant victories in a dozen naval duels , that brought
Great Britain	LOCATION	at last to terms . ''

		Here we have the story .

		Then shall we not still feel pride in our work in the War of
1812	DATE	?

		W ^ e fought for our rights , we fought hard , and we won in the only way that we could have won .

		And be it remembered that these privateers whose work was so effective were not semi-pirates , like some that had been sent to sea by other countries : they sailed imder regiUar letters of marque ; they were ex - pected to observe all the rules of civilized warfare , and did observe them ; and , finally , they often met and over - came vessels supposedly larger and stronger than them - selves , including some regular naval vessels .

		There is somewhat of a tendency -LRB- perhaps the result in part of reaction -RRB- to belittle our work in the War of
1812	DATE	.

		It is aided , doubtless , by some books now in use in our schools and colleges that give wholly the British side of the contest ; the writer is prepared to quote chapter and verse in support of this statement .

		Let us not allow the pendiUum to swing too far the other way ; let us try to keep within the limits of truth .

		144 THE DIAL -LSB-

		The Real , axd the Ideal ,
Whitman	PERSON	.

		* It is fourteen years since
Walt Whitman	PERSON	died , and no full and formal biogi-aphy of him has yet appeared , unless we regard as such Mr.
Henry Bryan Binns	PERSON	's recently-issued work , which mod - estly disclaims all pretensions to being either a definitive biogi-aphy or a critical study .

		The author , an Englishman , rightly looks to
America	LOCATION	to produce the final and complete life of this eminently American poet .

		Mr.
Horace Traubel	PERSON	's memoirs of Whitman , '' With
Walt Whitman	PERSON	in
Camden	LOCATION	, '' extend over a period of less than four months , and obviously make no claim to anything like biographical completeness .

		They give us , in a good-sized octavo volume , rough notes of talks with Whitman , as thrown on paper from day to day , together with many letters of the period , or of an earlier time , addressed to Whitman .

		The whole book , unstudied and unpolished , conveys a realistic impression of the poet and the man , such as only a devoted Bos - well is able to give .

		Mr.
Traubel	PERSON	is well styled by Mr.
Binns	PERSON	'' the old poet 's spiritual son . ''

		Knowing and loving Whitman longer than he could distinctly remember , it was he who held
Whitman	PERSON	's hand in his own when the old man drew his last breath in the little house in
Mickle Street	ORGANIZATION	,
Camden	LOCATION	.

		He was named in the poet 's will as one of his literary executors ; he was active in organizing the
Walt Whitman Fellowship	ORGANIZATION	, of which he is secretary ; and it is probably his pen and voice , more than any other man 's , that have kept
Whitman	PERSON	's memory green durmg the last four - teen years .

		Coming from such a source , and written almost in the poet 's very presence , Mr.
Traubel	PERSON	's book appeals vividly to lovers of Whitman , and even the indifferent or scornful will find matter of quaint and curious interest in its pages .

		A book like Mr.
Traubel	PERSON	's is not of the kind that lends itself readily to criticism .

		It is very part of the poet himself , and to criticise it would be to criticise Whitman , which is not the reviewer 's purpose .

		A few illustrative passages will be given in aU their vmstudied mformality , and then the rea < ler will be left to seek a more intimate acquaintance with the book , or not , as he may feel inclined .

		many of the letters revert , almost of necessity , to the old theme of the Whitmanism of Whit - man , and , in particular , to the '' priapism , '' as
Emerson	PERSON	once rather harshly called it , of certain passages in his poems .

		To the familiar defense , and the only defense , -- the alleged harmlessness of all things to those who are themselves inno - cent , -- most of us must sorrowfully shake our heads and acknowledge our inability to make adequate reply .

		In lialting and contrite accents we can only confess tliat such a state of blame - lessness is more tlian we can attain unto ; or , rather , it is a paradisaic condition from which we have long ago fallen .

		Sin , no more tlian disease , wUl be vanquished by denjdng its exist - ence .

		Not that Whitman makes any such denial in words ; it is his whole attitude that impresses one as a sort of bold-faced refusal to see aught but glad sunshine and smiling fields where others take anxious note of threatening thunder - clouds on the distant horizon and detect treach - erous quagmires beneath the fair appearance of flowery verdure .

		The very first page of Mr.
Trau	PERSON	- bel 's book shows us Whitman 's determmation to find in nature only what he sets out to find .

		`` W. handed me a leaf from
The Christian Union	ORGANIZATION	containing an article by Hunger on
Personal Purity	ORGANIZATION	, in which this is said : ' Do not suffer yourself to be caught by the
Walt Whitman	PERSON	fallacy that all nature and all processes of nature are sacred and may therefore be talked about .


Walt Whitman	PERSON	is not a true poet in this respect , or he would have scanned nature more accu - rately .

		Nature is silent and shy where he is loud and bold . ' '

		Now , ' W. quietly remarked , ' Hunger is all right , but he is also all wrong .

		If Hunger had written Leaves of Grass that 's what nature would have written through Hunger .

		But nature was writing through
Walt Whitman	PERSON	.

		And that is where nature got herself into trouble . '

		And after a quiet little laugh he pushed his foi-efinger among some papers on the table and pulled oiit a black-ribbed envelope which he readied to me ... '' Much of the conversation reported is trivial to all but ardent Whitmanites .

		Others are at liberty to skip , and will do so -- whole pages at a time .

		It is not of great importance to most of us to be told that
Whitman	PERSON	said , '' Repeat that ,
Horace	PERSON	, '' or '' Go over tliat again ,
Horace	PERSON	, '' or '' I do n't quite catch on , '' or '' How 's that ? ''

		Needlessly faithful is the reporter in reproducing Whitman 's little j -RRB- rofanities and vidgarities ; after a few samples the reader might well take the rest for granted .

		Putting aU this down in cold clear type has the effect of showing us Whitman in a false perspective .

		The printed page seems in some way to emphasize imduly what in the rapid give and take of informal talk falls more or less involuntarily and parentheti -
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 145 cally from the lips .

		Yet for those to whom '' the real Walt Whitman '' can not be too real , this excess of unattractive detail may be no excess at all .

		A Whitman pronoimcement on
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	ought to be rather rich reading ; for two poets more unlike each other could hardly be imagined .

		Here is a part of a conversation between master and disciple soon after
Arnold	PERSON	's death : ''
Whitman	PERSON	adds as to Arnold : ' He will not be missed .

		There is no gap , as with the going of men like
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		My Arnold piece did not appear in
Tuesday	DATE	's
Herald	ORGANIZATION	.

		I wonder if the editor was a little in doubt about it ?

		It appeared to-day , however .

		The
Herald	ORGANIZATION	has a higher opinion of Arnold than I have .

		I discussed Arnold in effect -- throughout in such words -- as one of the dudes of liter - ature .

		Does not Leaves of Grass provide a place even for Arnold ?

		Certainly , certainly : Leaves of Grass has room for everybody : if it did not make room for all it would not make room for one . ' ''

		Readers wdll note in the foregoing -- for ex - ample , '' throughout '' for '' though not '' -- Mr.
Traubel	PERSON	's self-acknowledged carelessness as an editor ; but we gladly fall in with his himior and jjass the matter by as of small importance .

		A lack of sympathy equal to that between
Whitman	PERSON	and Arnold might have been looked for between Whitman and
John Addington	PERSON	Sy - monds .

		Yet the latter was an early and ardent admirer of the American poet .

		The subjoined passages are from a letter written by
Symonds	PERSON	in
1872	DATE	in reply to one from Whitman . ''

		Youi ' letter gave me the keenest pleasure I have felt for a long time .

		I had not exactly expected to hear from you .

		Yet I felt that if you liked my poem you would write .

		So I was beginning to dread that I had struck some quite wrong chord -- that perhaps I had seemed to you to have arrogantly confoimded your own fine thought and pure feeling with the baser metal of my own nature .

		AVhat you say has reassured me and has solaced me nearly as much as if I had seen the face and touched the hand of you -- my Master !

		... I have pored for continuous hours over the pages of Calamus -LRB- as I used to pore over the pages of Plato -RRB- , longing to hear you speak , buruing for a revelation of your more developed meaning , panting to ask -- ■ is this what you woxdd indicate ?

		-- are then the free men of your land really so pure and loving and noble and gen - erous and sincere ?

		Most of all did I desire to hear from yoiu '' own lips -- or from your pen -- some story of athletic friendship from which to learn the truth .

		Yet I dared not address you or dreamed that the thought of a student could abide the incAritable shafts of your searching intuition .

		Shall I ever be permitted to question you aud learn from you ? ''

		Finally , a few lines showing the warmth of affection existing between '' Walt '' and ''
Horace	PERSON	'' may serve to close this review of Mr.
Traubel	PERSON	's volmne .

		`` W. was very affectionate in his manner to-night .

		♦ Come here ,
Horace	PERSON	, ' he said .

		I went over .

		He took my hand . '

		I feel somehow as if you had consecrated yourself to me .

		That entails something on my part : I feel somehow as if I was consecrated to you .

		Well -- we will work out the rest of my life-job together : it wo n't be for long : anyway , we 'll work it out together , for short or long , eh ? '

		He took my face between his hands and drew me to him and kissed me .

		Nothing more was then said .

		I went back to my chair and we sat in silence for some time . ''

		Of Mr.
Binns	PERSON	's more formal treatment of the same theme much might be said , and most of it commendatory .

		A little too obvious , perhaps , is the author 's effort to establish friendly rela - tions with his American readers and to give him - seK an air of familiarity with American history and American ways .

		The very dedication of his book , '' To my mother , and to her mother , the Republic , '' is an advance bid for our good - will .

		AH the carefully-studied accompaniment of political and historical matter that runs through the book is somewhat suggestive of cram , and is not at all necessary to the complete - ness of the biography .

		It irks the reader to have the
Wilmot Proviso	ORGANIZATION	thrust on his notice , or the split in the Democratic party narrated as a contributing cause of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's election .

		Whitman 's anti-slavery attitude and his warm patriotism can be understood without these excursions into American history .

		The pride of recently-acquired learning -- or , we might say , the imeasiness of ill-digested erudition -- seems to betray itself in this parade of irrelevant matter .

		Mr.
Binns	PERSON	ascribes much of Whitman 's best development , and his attainment to the '' power of seK-abandonment , '' to the influence of that unknown Southern woman with whom the poet had intimate relations for a few months in his early manhood .

		The whole affair is , and prob - ably always will be , shrouded in mystery ; but the ascription of any such benign and fructify - ing influence to an illicit connection of this sort is what one might have expected rather from a writer on the other side of the Channel than from an Englishman .

		The experience , whatever its exact nature , the author thinks to have been instrxunental in breaking down some barrier . ''

		Strong before in his seK-control , '' writes Mr.
Binns	PERSON	, '' he is stronger still now that he has won the power of self-abandonment .

		Unconsciously he had always been holding himself back ; at last he has let himself go .

		And to let oneself go is to discover oneseK .

		Some men can never face that discovery ; they are not ready for 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, emancipation .

		Whitman was . ''

		All this invites discussion , psychological and ethical .

		In some sort it brings up once more the old conflict be - tween Hellenism and Hebraism , or , as Mr.
Hugh Black	PERSON	styles it , between culture and restraint .

		The danger seems to lie in our failing to distin - guish between the masterful facility that comes of perfect self-control and the comiterfeit ease that is the cheap and tinsel product of unre - straint .

		The author loves Whitman whole-heartedly , and the picture he presents is sympathetically drawn .

		Both in biographical detail and in criti - cal comment the book is an excellent piece of work , perhaps the fullest and best study of the poet 's life and writings that has yet appeared .

		It is written in a pleasing and scholarly style , and every page bears marks of painstaking re - search .

		Two passages only can find space here for quotation .

		The first shall be an amusing and characteristic anecdote , which is probably new to most readers . ''

		It is related that once in a
Brooklyn	LOCATION	church he failed to remove his soft hi'oad - brinnned hat , and entered the building with his head thus covered , looking for all the world like some
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	of the olden time .

		The offending article was roughly knocked off by the verger .

		Walt picked it up , twisted it into a sort of scourge , seized the astonished official by the collar -- he always detested officials -- tromiced him with it , clapped it on his head again , and so , abruptly and coolly , left the church . ''

		This may recall a line from the '' Leaves , '' -- `` I have hated tyrants , argued not concerning God , had patience and indulgence toward the people , taken off my hat to nothing known or unknown . ''

		The second selection is of a critical , interpreta - tive sort , comparing Whitman as a j -RRB- rophet -LRB- by no means as a man of letters -RRB- with
Carlyle	PERSON	. ''

		With
Whitman	PERSON	,
Carlyle	PERSON	recognised the underlying moral purpose of the universe , and the organic miity or solidarity of mankind ; but being himself a Calvinistic Jacobin of irritable nerves , these convictions filled him , not with a joyful wonder and faith , but with contempt and despair .

		He never saw humanity as the body of a Divine and Godlike soul ; and though he was continu - ally calling men to duty and repentance , he did so from inward necessity rather than with any anticipation of success .

		For he felt himself to be a
Voice	ORGANIZATION	crying in the wilderness .

		Whitman worshipped the hero as truly as did
Carlyle	LOCATION	; but then he saw the heroic in the heart of our common humanity , where
Carlyle	PERSON	missed it ; hence his appeal was one of confidence , not despair . ''

		The two books , the American 's and the En - glishman 's , may well be read together , the former filling in with minute and realistic detail the more largely-sketched and more liighly-idealized portrait presented by the latter .


Percy F. Bicknell	PERSON	.

		Main Currents in
Socioi	LOCATION	^ OGicAii Theory .

		* To get the force of Professor Small 's book on '' • ' General Sociology '' it is necessary to con - sider that originally it was an outline or syl - labus of a course of lectures delivered to the graduate students of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such a course of study , with modem
University	ORGANIZATION	methods , usually leaves a large room for sup - l ^ lementary work .

		Hence , wliile we are not willing to admit the frank acknowledgment of the author that '' in form it is rough , fragment - ary , and unsystematic , '' the book is somewhat unproj ^ ortional from the standpoint of a scien - tific treatise .

		However , as the author admits , it is not a treatise , but a critical analysis of the development and present status of sociology .

		It is a conspectus of sociology or a comparative study of sociological thought .

		Its purpose is to show what sociology is and what it is not , and while it does not build a scientific system of sociology it indicates broad lines of construction or synthesis of the same .

		The book is critical rather than constructive .

		While the author does not attempt to construct a system of sociol - ogy , he indirectly points out the way for others and indicates upon what foundation they must build .

		In reference to the various phases of development of sociology by different individ - uals , Professor Small lias shown that the dif - ferences of sociologists are more apparent than real on account of the various points of view and various methods of attack , and that they are all working on the same sociology with con - verging lines of thoiiaiit .

		Thi'ouo - h the great mass of contributions to the science , pseudo and real , he finds a constant line of development from the earliest authors to the present time .

		With tliis object in view he has brought out the knowledge necessary for the foundation of sociology in the various attempts that have been made to construct a science .

		It is a masterly array of material and forces and , in most parts , an arraignment of these before the critic 's bar of justice . ''

		Our thesis , '' says the author , `` is that the central line in the path of methodo - logical progress , from
Spencer	PERSON	to Ratzenhofer , is marked by gradual shiftings of effort from analogical representation of social structures to real analysis of social processes . ''

		In other words , the stress is now being laid on fimction where formerly it was laid upon structure .

Spencer	LOCATION	to Ratzenhofer .

Albion W. Small	ORGANIZATION	.


University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 147 of Sociology , '' the author asserts that it is a process of human association , and then he proceeds to show that sociology attempts to interpret the whole process of human associa - tion .

		He asserts that facts of human associa - tion are not sufficient data for a science , but that '' the whence , the how , the why , and the whither , of processes are essential to sociology . ''

		The relations , meaning , and valuations of facts other than the facts themselves represent the subject matter of sociology as well as of other sciences .

		It is the passing of knowledge over into power that makes a real science .

		It is the advancement of the knowletlge of what occxirred to a knowledjre of the meaning of what occurred .

		In addition to the establishment of the science of processes , the sociologist shoidd formulate a programme for the promotion of more and more rational social processes .

		In the following chapter , under the title of `` Definition of Sociology , '' Professor Small gives the ordinary definitions , each of which bases the science on the association of men .

		He says that sociology is a unified view of human life and a l -RRB- ody of guiding principles for the conduct of life .

		He shows through analysis how this ap - pears , and adds that '' • sociology is an attempt so to visualize and so to interpret the whole of human experience that will reveal the last dis - coverable grounds ujwn which to base con - clusions alx -RRB- ut the rational conduct of life , '' and finally closes the chapter vnth the more ac - curate and inclusive definition : ''
Sociologr	PERSON	is the science of the social process . ''

		Here again he emphasizes the study of the activities of sociology .

		Of all the phases of society function is the real essence of sociology .

		In Chapter III .

		Professor Small presents the * ' ImpiUse of Sociology , '' in which he points out briefly its reasons to be one of the sciences .

		It is an attempt to show that the driving power of society arises in a philanthropic effort to make the world better , and that sociology is the scientific regulating power .

		This is followed in subsequent chapters by an historical survey of sociology ' .

		This survey , as the anther points out , is necessarily meagre .

		However , sufficient is given for the support of his main thesis .

		Cher one-half of the main body of the book is taken up with a remarkable comparative analysis of Spencer .

		Schaeffle , and
Ratzenhofer	ORGANIZATION	.

		It would be impossible for the reviewer to foUow this extende < l and masterh - analysis .

		The object is to show that
Spencer	PERSON	considered society as composed of differently arranged parts in which he emphasized structure ; that
Schaeffle	LOCATION	, while accepting this , goes a step further and represents society composed of parts working together to achieve results , that he emphasized function or action of society ; and Ratzenhofer considers society as a process of adjustment by conflict and subsequently by cooperation between associated individuals .

		Professor Small is very keen in analysis , and while his analytical researches in the past have been of great service to students of the science , the value of the comparative study of these three great founders of sociology can not be overestimated as a service to students .

		It is a demonstration of the main line of evolution of sociology .

		While the incompleteness of
Spencer	PERSON	's method is made apparent , as a foundation of sociology his system is as essential as the foundation of a building to its superstructure .

		Where form and structure are made the essential framework of the system Spencer implies that they are brought about by social activities .

		However ,
Spencer	PERSON	represents the first step in the analysis of human association .

		Schaeffle , by emphasizing function and seeking the ultimate causes of structure , has taken the second step .

		But Professor Small points out the limitations of each by saying that Spencer '' tended to seek the meaning of social structure in structure ; so
Schaeffle	LOCATION	's limits are indicated by his tendency to see the meaning of social function in function rather than in casual and consequent conditions in the persons func - tioning . ''

		That is , structure and fimction are ends in themselves , which is contrary to Pro- fessor
Small	ORGANIZATION	's interpretation of sociology .

		Fol - lowing the analysis of these two authors , he asks these four questions : ' * First , what are the essentials of human association ?

		Second , how do these essentials change their manifestations from time to time ?

		Third , by virtue of what influences do these variations occur ?

		Fourth , what social aims are reasonable in view of these conclusions from experience ? ''

		And he uses the analysis of Ratzenhofer to show how these ques - tions may be answered .

		The analysis of social processes after
Ratzenhofer	PERSON	is the most exact of any system yet presented .

		It includes the es - sential featui-es of Ratzenhofers '' Sociologische Erkenntnis '' and also his ' • Wesen und Zweck der Politik . ''

		Ratzenhofer clearly represents the three steps in the development of sociology , and points out how structure occurs through fimction .

		He shows the causes of social activity , and in this demonstrates clearly the needs of social analysis .

		The remainder of the work , while still review - ing the opinions of other sociologists , is more of 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, a constructive nature than the first part .

		A dis - cussion of the psychical , ethical , and technical makes up the outline of the remainder of the book .

		The most noticeable feature of this part of sociology , which is more nearly Professor Small 's view of the science , represents its real - istic nature .

		Society is a real thing made up of the elements of everyday jjractice , and in its study we should follow human interests and human society wherever they lead .

		First must be considered the interests of the individual and his relation to the complete society .

		This should be followed by the relations of groups to one another and general social structure and f miction .

		As a book on general sociology this is a valu - able contribution to the literature on the subject .

		While the interpretation of himian experience is sufficiently emphasized , sufficient stress is not laid upon the evolution of human society as a means of arriving at a correct estimate of the present structure and activities .

		The processes through which society is made are alternate dif - ferentiation and integration .

		While it is true that Professor Small says we can not explain society as it is by comparing it with a society of savages , the course of evolution through differ - entiation and integration gives a basis of under - standing which can not be obtained in any better way .

		The scientist orients his subject by remov - ing complex or interfering forces .

		His point of departure must be a simple element or condi - tion .

		Social evolution gives the student this point of departure .

		Perhaps some fault might be found with the book on account of the voluminous nature of the discussion and the unevenness of its make-up .

		But the vigor of the author and his familiarity with the content and method of sociological wi-it - ings , his numerous illustrations , as well as his masterly analysis , make up for any lack of con - densation of material .

		It is not a book for be - ginners but for students of maturity of mind and acquired sociological knowledge .

		To such it will prove of great value , and in general is an impetus to the development of the science of sociology .

		It helps the student to realize the great advancement sociology has made in recent years , and what a stupenduous task is before scholars before it is reduced to scientific pro- portions .

		As Professor Small has pointed out what sociology is , and what it is not , and indi - cated what it should be , we trust he will go on in his studies and write a treatise on the subject .

		Shakespearean TabLiE-Talk .

		* Perhaps it is wrong to call this ripe conmaent on Shakespeare by the name of Table-Talk .

		There is certainly nothing desultory , idle , ram - bling about it .

		Bnt other names do not suggest the quality of it .

		If we say '' lectures '' we think of some celebrity addressing a cultivated audi - ence gathered for a little titillation of literary recollection , or perhaps some learned professor giving the results of private studies while stu - dents toiled behind with note-books .

		If we say '' studies '' we think of conunentaries and dis - sertations , sources and texts .

		If we say '' essays '' we may mean anything from the most eccentric fancies about Shakespeare to an exliibition of universal scholarship .

		Here is nothing of all this .

		In this book we have a man who has read
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	long and deeply and who now talks to us of typical plays .

		It is not talk at the dinner-table , precisely , for he has his book in hand , and at times will read half a page or a couple of lines .

		What name can we give it ?

		In its intention it is something like a great actor 's presentation of his conception of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's creations .

		As may have been already suggested , this book is more or less like
Hazlitt	PERSON	's '' Characters of Shakespere 's Plays '' ; more , at least , than most of the recent weU-known books of criticism .

		Mr.
Dowden	PERSON	studied the gTowth of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's conceptions and their realization in dramatic form .

		Mr.
Moidton	PERSON	studied the sj ^ ecial dramatic art of some lyrical plays .

		Mr.

Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and sought to make us see that in all his work .

		Mr.
Mabie	PERSON	gave a general account of the man against a background of Elizabethan life .

		Mr.
Brand	PERSON	es gathered together the scholar - ship of the time and formed his own theories and conclusions .

		Mr.

Stopford Brooke	PERSON	does none of these things , save here and there .

		He runs through each play , giving some general comment , interpreting each character , following out the dramatic development , presenting the prevailing ideas .

		He gives us not a study of the plays or a study of Shakespeare based upon the plays , but a picture of his own mind as he reviews the plays .

		That is what
Hazlitt	PERSON	did , though in making the comparison , it is scant justice to Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	to say that he seems to have thought over his subject with a • On

		THE DIAI .

		149 view to this particular book , much more carefully than
Hazlitt	PERSON	could ever have thought over his lectures .

		The thing about
Hazlitt	PERSON	that most impressed that devoted lover of Shakespeare .


John Keats	PERSON	, was his '' ' depth of taste . ' ''

		Keats probably meant by that expression that exactly the right thing impressed
Hazlitt	PERSON	alx -RRB- ut each character or play of Shakespeare .

		That does not impress me so much in
Hazlitt	PERSON	's book as the fact that what - ever did impress him , impressed him so strongly .

		The book is almost as interesting in the view it gives of
Hazlitt	PERSON	as in its \ ` iew of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Read for instance the beginning of the essay on * ' Hamlet '' : what a remarkable production to be set do ^ vn almost extempore .


Hazlitt	PERSON	's power of thought in his power of expression was so remark - able that one of the chief interests in his criti - cism is that it gives one such an idea of what art may be to an indi ^ - idual .

		That is , in fact ,
Hazlitt	PERSON	's strong point as a critic : not his taste , as
Keats	PERSON	thought , or his power as a '' specidator '' as
Blackwood	PERSON	said , althoug ^ h both of those things are apparent in his book on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is himseK so wonderfully impressed by literature , in this case by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, that one gets up from a reading of his work with almost a new conception of literature as an element in life .

		Such is not ^ Ir .


Stopford Brooke	PERSON	's especial power .

		I am much more impressed by his '' depth of taste '' than by
Hazlitt	PERSON	's .

		Like
Hazlitt	PERSON	he commonly speaks of the events of the plays , of the characters , as though they were events or characters in real life .

		He analyzes motives , explains utterance , calls attention to beauties of speech or thought .

		* But where his mind leaves the plays , it reverts to
Shakespeare	PERSON	and his pur - poses .


Hazlitt	PERSON	's mind reverted to himself as to the reader in general : Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	thinks of the wT-iter .

		I shall admit , in passing , a greater interest in
Hazlitt	PERSON	's method .

		We nat - urally talk of a play or a book as though it were a piece of real life ; there is often much to explain or describe .

		But where the critic goes beyond that , I like better to have him give us an idea of the effect of it all upon himself , than to have him tell us of the art of the dramatist .

		Literature is really of importance to us only as it affects us : otherwise it is history or science .

		These things are each excellent , but they are not rightly followed by literary methods .

		If a man • There is .

		of course , a danger here .

		Consider the pagres written • though not in this book I on Hamlet 's madness .

		There is really no such question : the only possible question is .

		Did Shakespeare conceive of him as mad ?

		which is a very different thing , and to be decided on grounds very different from those often aU ^ ed .

		will show us what a vital factor
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is or has been in his thinking and being , he will be talking of something of which he knows .

		If he tell us of how Shakespeare created these plays and characters that may be so vital a force to us , he may be talking of something he knows , but it is more likely that it is something he only guesses about .

		And whether he know or guess , the matter is of historic or scientific importance , not of poetic .

		But it is to be said that the main point of Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	's book is not here .

		He is content , as a nde , to interpret the play , the character , the passage in hand , and it is only here and there that he goes back to the author .

		As to the kind of comment , we have gener - ally to begin with , a few words about the play . ''

		ZVIidsummer Night 's Dream '' represents the temper of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's soid in earlier years ; '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' is matle up out of such and such materials in earlier literature .

		Then generally comes an interpretation of the action , then comment on the character .

		Or some - times instead of these last being carefully taken up , we have a discussion of two or three topics of chief interest , as with '' Coriolanus '' where the author deals with '' -LRB- 1 -RRB-
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's treat - ment of the political question in
Rome	LOCATION	; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the character and fate of Coriolanus ; -LRB- 3 -RRB-
Corio	PERSON	- lanus and his mother . ''

		WTiat is said on these matters is generally , in its intention , perfectly simple .

		It may be well to quote a passage . ''

		Opposed to him in character , but his friend , is Mercutio ; wit 's scintilating star , thrilling with life to his finger-tips , not caring for women save as the toys of an hour , ready to tackle , on the instant , any woman , young or old ; brave , audacious , going swiftly to his point , keepittg no thought within him but flinging it at once into his speech ; ' he will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month ' ; quick in choler , ready to attempt the moon and puU the sun down , loose of speech , mocking old and young out of the racing of his blood -- the gay ruffles of
Italy	LOCATION	, such as Shakespere often met in
London	LOCATION	, such as many of the Italian novels enclose and paint . ''

		* Some impatient scholars may possibly put this aside , with an inquiry for something new in the book , something beside a re-statement of the material of the play .

		A nvunber of little matters , more or less new , may be noted , as for instance : that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	had a feeling of true sympathy for the common people -LRB- pp. 7 , 223 -RRB- ; that in ''
Romeo	PERSON	and Juliet '' he was thinking of '' ■ the long suffering justice who punishes quarrels which injure the state '' -LRB- p. 35 , cf. * It should be added that this is only the gist of aereral paragraphs on Mercutio .

		150 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, pp. 64-68 -RRB- ; that Mercutio was not too brilliant for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to keep alive -LRB- p. 44 -RRB- ; that
Shylock	PERSON	was a hot-blooded , passionate , resolute , dignified man of sixty -LRB- p. 152 -RRB- ; that
Jacques	PERSON	is not a cynic , or even bitter -LRB- p. 172 -RRB- ; that
Prospero	PERSON	is the last of the great mediaeval en - chanters -LRB- p. 286 -RRB- ; and naturally many more such views .

		But it is not to be said that the value of the book depends upon its new discoveries or its new views , or on the new standpoint or the new spirit in which the critic regards the plays .

		In just this fact itseK lies its great value .

		Here is a critic who turns on no new light , who oifers no new theory , who proclaims no discovery , who presents no new conception .

		What , then , does he add to Shakespearean scholarship or Shakespearean criticism .

		Perhaps Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	woidd be satisfied if he were generallj ^ esteemed to have added nothing at all .

		For it is clear that what he wants is not to make more criticism or more scholarship , but to make his readers see that there is more in Shakespeare than they supposed .

		He puts aside critical apparatus and scholarly theory , and is content simply with the plays .

		Perhaps he wrote this book not in a great library , not even in a well - provided study , but -- it may be -- out-doors with notliing but the plays and pencil and paper .

		He certainly might have done so .

		The professional critic or Shakespearean scholar is a little at sea with such treatment .

		He has not much to say : there is not much to discuss or raise a dust about .

		Of course you can disagree anywhere .

		I open at random and pretty soon read ''
Orlando	LOCATION	and
Rosalind !	PERSON

		could anyone desire to have more charming , more sunshiny companions than these two en - chanting persons ?

		To live with them is to live with moral beauty , but it is not a beauty which the pharisaic moralist will like at all . ''

		I sup - pose I may be something of a pharisaic moralist myself , for I never had any such feeling about
Rosalind	PERSON	and
Orlando	LOCATION	as Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	has ; so I might dissent from that dictimi as from many others in the book .

		But agreement or disagi'eement in particulars is not the point .

		To make us see more in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, that is the writer 's desire .

		A bold midertaking , one will say , after a century of devoted Sliakespearean study , scholarship , crit - icism , appreciation .

		But in all that century there have been few books so single-minded as this .

		Alabama i > W ar-Timk and After .

		* For a long time the South was largely a neglected field to the historical student .

		Re - cent years , however , have seen a marked devel - opment of interest in the study of the history of tliis part of the comitry , as is evidenced by the increased activity of historical societies and the establislmient of state departments for the preservation and publication of historical rec - ords in several southern states .

		In several northern universities distinct courses in south - ern history are now being given , and in other respects it is beginning to receive the attention which lias long been bestowed upon the history of the northern states .

		Recently a number of excellent monographs on particidar periods of southern liistory have appeared ; and it is prob - ably no exaggeration to say that the liistory of no other state has been so well wi-itten up as has the early period of
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		In '' Civil War and Reconstruction in
Ala	LOCATION	- bama , '' a volume of over 800 pages , by Pro- fessor
Walter L. Fleming	PERSON	, we have the most comprehensive and valuable work of the kind that has yet been written .

		It shows evidence of intimate knowledge based on wide research , is fair and judicial yet sympathetic in tone , and is altogether a most interesting jjicture of life in a southern state dui'uig and munediately fol - lowing the Civil War .

		As a proper backgToimd for the study of the Ci ^ il War and
Reconstruc	PERSON	- tion period , the author has described the society and institutions that were destroyed by the war .

		The population of the state , its industries , the develojjment of secession sentiment , the disrup - tion of the religious denominations , the eman - cipation sentiment in northern
Alabama	LOCATION	, are some of the topics discussed .

		Then follows the story of secession , the preparation for the com - mg struggle , military operations on
Alabama	LOCATION	soil , the problems of conscription and exemp - tion , and the peace movement .

		In northern
Alabama	LOCATION	, a region unconnected with the rest of the state by railroads and geogTapliically a part of
Tennessee	LOCATION	, the people were largely opposed to the war ; and this locality became a nest of '' tories , '' deserters , and '' mossbacks '' from all over the South , and they caused the
State	ORGANIZATION	and Confederate authorities no little trouble .

		Be - sides their opposition to the war , they com - mitted outrages on both
Confederate and Union	ORGANIZATION	sympathizers and terrorized the coimtry gener - * Civil War and Reconstruction in

		THE DTATi 151 all -RCB- ' .

		For a time there was talk among them of sece < ling from
Alabama	LOCATION	, and , together ydth .

		the counties of
East Tennessee	LOCATION	, forming a new state vdth the name of Nick-a-Jaok .

		Particularly instructive and fascinating is Professor
Fleming	PERSON	's account of social and eco - nomic conditions during the ^ ^ - ar : new industries created by the necessities of the war , blockade running and trading through the lines , the con - duct of the slaves , educational activity , the struggles of the newspapers to keep going , life on the farm , the hardships and destitution of the families left behind , etc. .

		The condition of the state at the close of the war , with its deserted and neglected farms , paralysis of business , wTecked railroads , poverty-stricken people , law - lessness and disorder , with demoralizetl negroes roaming about the country testing their new freedom and refusing to work , -- these make a pictui'e which no one can now study without profound sympathy .

		The reorganization of the state in accordance with the
Johnson	PERSON	plan of Reconstruction , the overthrow of this plan by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the military regime , and the activity of the Freedmen 's Bureau , are de ^ * ribe < l with detail .

		The author 's judgment with regard to the
Freedmens Bureau	ORGANIZATION	is that it tlid little good and in many cases did much harm .

		The sub - ordinate agents in
Alabama	LOCATION	, he says , were mostly broken - < lown men who had failed at other under - takings , preachers with strong prejudices , and the • • dregs of a musteretl-out army . ''

		The insti - tution in
Alabama	LOCATION	, he declares , was entirely unnecessary .

		Cotton was worth
fifty cents	MONEY	a pound , and the extraordinary demand for labor guaranteed good treatment for the laborers .

		A ^ ^ latever suffering the blacks endured was mainly due to their congregation in the tov ^ ns and to their own shiftlessness .

		Through a gen - erous disti-ibution of government rations they soon came to entertain the l > elief that it was the duty of '' Uncle Sam '' to support them whether they worked or not .

		Finally , imscrupulous and designing officials took advantage of their posi - tion to make a jwlitical machine of the
Bureau	ORGANIZATION	, and instances were not lacking where they de - frauded the credidous blacks by selling them painted sticks which , they were told , entitletl them to forty acres of land of their o \ sti selection .

		An interesting feature of Mr.
Fleming	PERSON	's work is an elaborate account of the various orders and leagues which played an important part in the life of the state during the Reconstruction period .

		The most notable of these were the
Union League	ORGANIZATION	, organized among the negroes by northern white men , and which became a potent political machine , and the
Ku Klux Klan	PERSON	, organ - ized among the southern whites for maintaining order , but which eventually degenerated into an organization of persecution and murder .

		Inter - esting and unique is the author 's description of the effects of the Reconstruction policy upon the educational and religious life of the people .

		The
State University	ORGANIZATION	was '' ratlicalized '' and practically broken up , and in many cases negro churches were disrupted by differences of politi - cal opinion among the members .


Alabama	LOCATION	was more fortunate than some of her southern sisters , -- notably ^ lississippi ,
Louisi	PERSON	- ana , and
South Carolina	LOCATION	, -- in escaping from the worst evils of negro and • • Carpet-bag '' nde ; but even as it was , no true American can read the story \ s ` ithout a sense of shame and humiliation .

		There was not an honest white man living in the state during Reconstruction , saj 'S Professor
Fleming	PERSON	, nor a man , woman , or child , descende < l from such a person , who did not then suffer , or does not still suffer , from the direct results of '' Carpet-bag '' financiering .

		With every young person one must , therefore , continually urge : Are you willing to retain just the personal habits you have now ?

		You can not too quickly change them if you wish to make thorough work .

		Clear and definite thinking , moreover , moves di - rectly and imhesitatingly toward its goal , and for that very i-eason seems to be a distinct help to decisive action .

		For all purposeful action involves the use of definite means to definite ends .

		Definiteness in thinking , thus , seems to be directly connected with decision in action , and vagueness of thinking with indecision and weak - ness '' -LRB- p. 121 -RRB- .

		Yes , indeed , poor old brain of mine !

		You and I have found that out these many years ago , but liave found , also , that it is not always easy to see in a fog .

		All things considered , we must believe that President
King	PERSON	's book will carry a real and valuable message to those for whom it was in - tended ; and if it seems to some barren of new thought , and not especially distinguished in style , these impressions should not be held to condemn it ; for they represent , as it were , only the back view of the edifice . ''

		Life and Religion '' is a volume of extracts from the writings of the late Professor
Max Miiller	PERSON	, selected and arranged by liis wife .

		It is not a controversial work , and slioidd not be treated as such ; rather , it is as though the veteran humanist and philologist invited the reader to sit with him by the fireside , and there confided to him the thoughts and aspirations which had guided his path during a long and successful life .

		Who woidd refuse such an invitation ?

		Who would listen with other than deferential , if not reverential , attention ?

		Pos - sibly , on grounds of philosophy or science , or from the standpoint of our own religion , some of the professor 's ideas may be wrong ; but what of that ?

		His star served well to make his wagon go , and that to good purpose , and is entitled to our regard , if only for its past per - formance .

		This very thought , indeed , is one of those most cherished by
Max Muller	PERSON	himself , in relation to other peoples .

		HimseK a true Christian , he had become too intimate with the thoughts of other peoples , past and present , not to regard their aspirations with sympathy and appreciation . ''

		True Christianity , I mean the religion of
Christ	LOCATION	, seems to me to become more and more exalted the more we know and the more we appreciate the treasures of truth hidden in the despised religions of the world '' -LRB- p. 24 -RRB- .

		The first impression of the book is perhaps a little disappointing ; because , from its necessa - rily disjointed nature one does not instantly perceive the uniting thread .

		If a man is heard making statements about the
Himalaya Moun	PERSON	- tains , or the Arctic regions , we are likely to give him scant attention , until some remark or expression betrays the fact that he has been there himself .

		So it is with
Max Miiller	PERSON	: many of his paragraphs sound much like the empty professions of those who have learned such things by rote ; but one does not read far mthout find - ing that the author speaks whereof he knows . ''

		Everyone carries a grave of lost hope in his soul , but he covers it over with cold marble , or with green boughs .

		On sad days one likes to go alone to this God 's acre of the soul , and weep there , but only in order to return full of comfort and hope to those who are left to us '' -LRB- p. 205 -RRB- .

		Ah yes I good friend .

		No doubt the most significant message of the book is contained in its interpretation of
Chris	LOCATION	- tianity .


Max Miiller	PERSON	believed himself to be a Christian in the fullest sense , and to me it seems that he was wholly justified .

		Yet the orthodox , so-called , will be horrified to read : '' When we think of the exalted character of Christ 's teaching , may we not ask ourselves once more , What would He have said if He had seen the fabulous stories of His birth and childhood , or if He had thought that His Divine character would ever be made to depend on the historical truth of the Evangeha In/antice ? ''

		-LRB- p. 27 -RRB- . ''

		If
Jesixs	PERSON	was not God , was He , they ask , a mere man ?

		A mere man ?

		Is there anything among the works of God , anything next to God , more wonderfid , more awfid , more holy than man ?

		Much rather should we ask , Was then Jesus a mere God ?

		... A God is less than man .

		True Christianity does not degrade the Godhead , it exalts manhood , by bringing it back near to God '' -LRB- p. 34 -RRB- . ''

		Then it is said .

		Is not
Christ God	ORGANIZATION	?

		Yes , He is , but in His own sense , not in the Jewish nor in the Greek sense , nor in the sense which so many Christians attach to that article of their faith .

		.

		Christ 's teaching is that we are God , that there is in us something divine -- that we are nothing if we are not that ... Let us bestow all praise and glory on Christ as the best son of God .

		... Christ never calls Himself the Father , He speaks of His Father with love , but always with humility and reverence '' -LRB- p. 21 -RRB- .

		* The grandiose trilogy of ' * Christ and Antichrist , '' as conceived in the teeming fancy of IVIr ,
Dmitri Merejkowski	PERSON	, is now completed with the publication of ''
Peter	PERSON	and
Alexis	PERSON	. ''

		This work is possibly richer in material than either of its predecessors , but its construction is so hopelessly chaotic as to preclude any serious claim to consideration as a work of art .

		What we have is a formless aggregation of curious facts and pedantries Ulustrative of
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	in the
early eighteenth century	DATE	, of the barbarism of a people reluctantly tm-ned toward civilization by the masterful Tsar , and of sti-ange mediaeval supersti - tions mingled with wild religious vagaries .

		The fig ^ e of
Peter	PERSON	is dominant throughout , but it is a figure of traits so contradictory that it assumes no definite outline in our imagination .

		As far as it may be exhibited by a single quotation , it appears in this passage : '' At six in the morning he began to dress .

		Pulling on his stockings he noticed a hole ; he sat down , got a needle and a ball of wool , and began darning .

		Ruminating about a road to
India	LOCATION	in the footsteps of Alexander of
Macedonia	LOCATION	, he darned his stockings . ''

		Contrasted with the fiery and brutal energy of
Peter	PERSON	, we have the futility and degeneracy of his weakling son , a maudlin character utterly unequal to the responsibilities laid upon him .

		The action culminates with the terrific scene of torture in which the life of
Alexis	PERSON	is sacrificed to his father 's insensate rage .

		We say action , but of a truth there is little action of any connected sort in the work viewed as a whole ; the treatment is episodical and disjointed throughout .

		The author 's immense display of learning and his untamed vigor of de - scription are made devoid of artistic effect by the almost total absence of restraint and correlation .

		The result is absolutely bewildering .

		As in the pre - ceding sections of this trilogy , the antithesis is plain •

Peter	PERSON	is the embodiment of Antichrist in the eyes of the horror-stricken orthodoxy which he 80 recklessly defies .

		So in '' The Death of the Gods ''
Julian	PERSON	was Antichrist to the primitive church , and in * ' The Forerunner ''
Leonardo da Vinci	PERSON	was Anti- christ to the mediseval church .

		But is it the author 's wish to enlist our sympathies on
Peter	PERSON	's side as he enlisted them on the side of the apostate and the artist ?

		If this be the case , he has failed as signally as he succeeded in the earlier volumes .

		Viewing the trilogy as a whole , we must say that ' • The Fore - runner '' is immeasurably finer than either of the other parts .

		Not merely is it wrought of metal more attractive , but in the manner of its workmanship it also excels .

		`` On the
Field of Glory	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Henryk Sien	PERSON	- kiewicz , breaks a silence of several years , during which the distinguished Polish romancer has been resting upon his well-earned laurels .

		It is a book of about the dimensions of `` The Knights of the Cross , '' and deals with the period of
John Sobieski	PERSON	and the anxious years of the impending Turkish invasion .

		We confess to some disappointment upon finding that the great victory of
Sobieski	LOCATION	is only foreshadowed in this narrative , instead of being presentetl to us with the magnificent descriptive power that the author knows how to apply to such situations ; but perhaps he is keeping that theme in reserve for a supreme effort .

		It is surely manifest destiny that he , and no other , should deal with it .

		The title of the present romance is thus a misnomer , for the book ends before any of its characters have reached `` the field of glory , '' although they spend much of their time in talking about it .

		In other words , although the story has this baekground of patriotic expectancy , it is in reality a story of private interest , a love-story of freshness and charm , a story of strange manners and exciting adventures .

		Some of the younger Polish critics , it seems , have been charging the
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	school of fiction with sterility , whereupon the leader of that school has pointed to certain of his colleagues by way of refu - tation , and particularly to Mr.
Gasiorowski	PERSON	, whose quality we may now appraise in ' •
Napoleon	PERSON	's Love Story , '' just translated into English .

		The author is a yoimg man , and this romance is chiefly remark - able for its length , caused by a remorseless sp i n nin g out of dialogue and elaboration of descriptive detail , but it may , nevertheless , be read -LRB- or skimmed over -RRB- with a fair degree of satisfaction .

		Its theme is the episode of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's visit to
Warsaw	LOCATION	in
1807	DATE	, and his resulting romantic attachment to
Madame Walewska	ORGANIZATION	.

		The character of the heroine is depicted for us with much subtlety , while her imperial lover is the same familiar figure with which we have become acquainted in other works of romantic invention .

		Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	is a most indefatigable producer of novels .

		His latest , '' The Cherry Ribband , '' is of a piece with its predecessors ; at least with those of its predecessors which find the author upon his native heath -- or in his native kail-yard or among his native moss-hags .

		-- and deals with the troublous times 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, of the Covenant .

		It has an abundance of sturing adventure , of duelling , fighting , and romance .

		The strong figiu-e of Claverhouse appears upon the scene from time to time , but plays no very conspicuous part in the action .

		Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	is as good as ever in his characterization of eccentric Scotch types .

		The book deserves well of the reader , albeit it is little more than a replica of earlier ones .

		The
Dogger Bank	ORGANIZATION	incident has been ingeniously utilized by Mr.
E. Phillips Oppenheim	PERSON	for his latest Active invention , `` A Maker of History . ''

		It seems that this was , after all , a deliberate attempt to force
England	LOCATION	into war with
Russia	LOCATION	.

		A secret treaty had been concluded between the Tsar and the
Kaiser	PERSON	whereby the invasion of
England	LOCATION	was imminent .

		But it so happened that a young Englishman , an innocent tourist , was a witness of the meeting between the two monarchs , which was brought about by the con - junction of two imperial trains , at a secluded point of the railway .

		Not only was the young English - man there in hiding , but he became jjossessed of a page of the treaty itself , which was blown out of the window of the carriage in which the momentous agreement was drawn up .

		As he could not read German , he knew nothing of its significance , but simply tucked it into his pocket .

		Afterwards he went to
Paris	LOCATION	, talked innocently but indiscreetly about his adventure , and was promptly kidnapped .

		His sister went in search of him , and was also kidnapped .

		No harm was done them , but they remained in the custody of the
French Secret Service	ORGANIZATION	in order that the German Secret Service might not get hold of them .

		Next comes an English baronet , who sees a photograph of the girl , falls in love with it , and assumes the role of amateur detective .

		AU the par - ties concerned have adventures of the most surpris - ing description , until the need for secrecy no longer exists , because the French government has check - mated
Russia	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	in their sinister game .

		Those who know Mr.
Oppenheim	PERSON	's methods as a novelist will hardly need to be informed that this stirring story is told with neatness and despatch .

		`` The
Ford	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Arthur E. J. Legge	PERSON	, is a quiet story of English life , illustrating the relations between two families -- one of aristocratic and an - cient lineage , the other the social outcome of that well-known product ,
Harrold	PERSON	's
Household Soap	ORGANIZATION	.

		The parvenu becomes the neighbor of the lord , and a ford across the stream which flows by their estates provides a convenient subject of dispute .

		It is a
Montague	ORGANIZATION	and Capulet affair , but turns out happily in a way , although the most sympathetic character in the novel is drowned while crossing the ford , and we shall never feel quite sure that the heroine ought not to have married him instead of the scion of the enemy 's stock .

		The book is simple and genuine , and its style has the touch of poetic distinction to be expected of a writer who has also won the laurels of a singer of songs .

		The trick of making an interesting novel out of the incidents that make up the life of a party of tourists is not as simple as it seems .

		Since the effoi ` ts of
William Black	ORGANIZATION	in this dhection , we can think of no others who have been quite as successful as Mr. and Mrs.
Williamson	PERSON	.

		And the fact that their trav - ellers have for a vehicle the modern motor-car instead of the antiquated phaeton gives to their narratives the needed touch of timeliness . ''

		My Friend the Chauffem '' '' tells how an English baronet and an Irish peer -LRB- in prospect -RRB- personally conduct a party of three female Americans through northern
Italy	LOCATION	and into
Dalmatia	LOCATION	, harassed all the time by the atten - tions of an Austrian prince , who is the villain of the piece .

		-LRB- We wonder why it is that Austrian princes make such satisfactory villains . -RRB-

		The climax is reached in
Montenegro	LOCATION	, when the villain lures the heroine into a deserted house , and would force her consent to a marriage .

		The marriage that really comes off is a diff ` erent sort of affair , in which the impoverished scion of the Irish nobility figiu'es as the leading man .

		A second marriage in prospect as the book closes is that of the baronet with the enfant terrible of the tale , who it seems is not a child at all , but a maiden of seventeen , masquerading in short clothes and long braids to oblige her mother , relict of
Simon P. Kidder	PERSON	, of
Denver	LOCATION	,
U. S.	PERSON	A .

		This mother has sentimental leanings toward the prince , despite whose villainy she turns a willing ear to his protes - tations .

		A peculiar feature of the story is that it is told , in tiu ` n , by each of the five persons making up the party in the motor-car .

		The attendant prince alone has no chance to describe matters from his point of view , which is rather a pity .

		The name of ''
W. B. Maxwell	PERSON	'' is non-committal as to sex , but ''
Vivien	PERSON	'' is a woman 's novel .

		It is , moreover , one of the best novels that we have read for a long time , by a writer of either sex .

		Its ele - ments are familiar enough -- the neglected girl , the dreary years at a cheap boarding-school , the heart - breaking task of earning a living in a
London	LOCATION	shop , the consequent privation , misery , and iUness , the inevitable persecution by the wealthy libertine , and the eventual rescue by the j -RRB- rince of her dreams .

		But despite the hackneyed nature of its plot , as thus revealed in skeleton , the work has both originality and distinction .

		The interest is so varied , the nar - rative so broadly humanized , the delineation of char - acter so true and fine , that oiu '' attention is com - pletely absorbed from first to last .

		The spirits of tenderness and pity brood over it , and the recurrent note of forgiveness , however seemingly dark the sin , adds a divine touch to the work .

		And a very serious work it is , although animated in its movement , a work that sounds the depths of the human mystery , and confronts the reader with the darkest riddles of life .

		Having these qualities , it is matter for satis - faction that the story is told upon a generous scale -- there are more than six hundred pages -- and gives us comprehensive studies of character and situ - ation rather than the glimpses afforded by the im - pressionist .

		Such a novel is like an oasis in the desert to the weary reviewer , and rewai ` ds him for much toiling through the arid wastes of popular story-telling .


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 155 A singularly charming and appealing book is ^ ` The Great Refusal , '' by the novelist who calls herself ''
Maxwell Gray	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It assumes , to be sure , something too much of the character of a sociological tract in the closing chapters , and is based upon over - wrought sentiment rather than upon any practical form of idealism , but is nevertheless so fine in motive and so graceful ia diction that criticism is measure - ably disarmed .

		The '' great refusal '' is made by the hero , who renounces wealth and position to become a common workingman , and eventually embarks in a socialistic venture liaving for its object the estab - lishment of a Utopian commonwealth in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		These are not his only sacrifices , for love also is cast aside , and it is not imtil the end of much suf - fering that his early passion is replaced by one fixed upon far surer foimdations .

		The characterization is excellent , alike of the two women , the devoted hero , and his masterful father , whose money seems to the son too tainted for legitimate enjoyment .

		Nor is the hero in any sense depicted for us as a prig or a weakling , but rather as a genial , athletic , and altogether wholesome specimen of the best English manhood .

		The style of the novel , also , is natural as to dialogue , and charmingly allusive as to description . ''

		The Conquest of Canaan '' is a thoroughly read - able book , made so by its genial description of vil - lage types of character , and enough of a story to make the chapters hang together .

		Canaan is in
Indiana	LOCATION	, and it is conquered by the town ne'er - do -
weU	ORGANIZATION	, who seems to have in him aU the makings of a vagabond ; but who instead develops strength and determination .

		This transfoi-mation of an outcast into a leading citizen is sketched with considerable skill , and incidental himior is not lacking .

		A very pretty love story adds warmth and romantic color - ing to this the latest of Mr.
Tarkington	PERSON	's pleasant inventions . ''

		The
House	ORGANIZATION	of a Thousand Candles '' is a house of mystery situated somewhere in the depths of
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		It has secret panels and subterranean pas - sages , and the departed owner is reputed to have concealed vast treasures somewhere within it .

		This makes it an object of burglarious enterprise on the part of the surrounding jwpidation , and the coming of the new owner , to whom the house with all its contents has been left , is by no means a popular happening .

		This owner is a young man of roving disposition , to whom the propeiiy has been left under singular conditions , one of which is that he shall make it his residence , and not leave it for a full year .

		Since his life is attempted on the very first day of his arrival , the prospect is at least exciting .

		But he proves game , and sets about solving the mys - tery for himself .

		Presently , an interesting romance develops , the other pei * son concerned being an in - mate of a neighboring school for girls .

		Startling episodes occiu * in swift succession , the machinations of all the villains are thwarted , the romance comes to a happy conclusion , and in the end we have the gi'eatest surprise of all , which it would be heartless of us to reveal .

		Mr.
Hough	PERSON	's '' Heart 's Desire '' is a book some - thing like Mr.
Wister	PERSON	's `` The Virginian , '' and quite as much or as little of a story .

		Heart 's Desire is a remote mountain settlement of the southwest , hav - ing for its population one doctor , two lawyers , a few cowboys and miners , and no women .

		Its entire cir - culating medium amounts to about three hundred dollars , which frequently changes hands , and now and then , by the fortunes of the game , is temporarily collected in the pockets of some one citizen .

		The story begins with the advent of the first woman , and in subsequent chapters are chronicled the beginnings of litigation , art , music , and other accessories of civ - ilization .

		Presently a corporation comes with a rail - road in its gift , and what continuity ' of interest the story has centres about the project .

		The book has both sentiment and humor , both after the fashion long ago set by
Bret Harte	PERSON	, and makes a brave pre - tence at showing that a free life under these primi - tive conditions is much better worth having than the trammelled existence of more settled communities .

		The argument is stifficiently pei-suasive to compel temporary assent , and that is all the story needs for its sympathetic enjoyment .

		There can be no doubt that it is enjoyable , and that Mr.
Hough	PERSON	has sur - passed his best previous efforts for our entertainment .

		Miss
Beulah Dix	ORGANIZATION	is an accomplished artificer of historical romance , and has worked successfully in the material offered by seventeenth-century
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, by puritans in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and by the conflict of roundhead with cavalier .

		It is to the latter phase of her acti ^ aty that '' The Fair Maid of Graystones '' belongs , and the book turns out to be a very pretty story indeed .

		Besieged Colchester has just fallen into the hands of the parliamentary army , and one of the consequences is that
Jack Hethering	PERSON	- ton becomes a royalist prisoner .

		Then follows a sur - prising series of adventures for this engaging hero , brought about by the fact that he is taken for a cousin of the same name , and thereby becomes responsible for many villainies laid to the charge of that unwor - thy person .

		How he clears himself from this tangle it is the business of the novelist to unfold , and she does it without straining our sensibilities more than is strictly necessary for the purposes of a full-grown romance .

		The historical substratimi of the tale is of the thinnest , and chiefly takes the form of a conven - tional reflection of the manners and speech of the time . ''


Barbara Winslow	PERSON	, Rebel , '' by Miss
Elizabeth Ellis	PERSON	, is another historical romance with an English setting , its scene being laid just after the defeat of
Monmouth	LOCATION	at Sedgemoor .

		Here we have a fascina - ting heroine , aiTested for harboring rebels , and a victim of
Jeffrey	PERSON	and the
Bloody Circuit	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sentenced to a brutal punishment , she is saved by one of the king 's officers , who thereby becomes himself a rebel , and the two take flight together .

		They are clearly in love with one another to any eyes but their own , but the inevitable misundei ` standing supervenes , holding them at arm 's length through the requisite nmnber of chapters .

		Barbara is a young woman of the pert and proud type so dear to the romantic 166 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, heart , and her soldier lover has the complementary \ drtues that the situation requires .

		The story has heen told , essentially , a hundred times before in as many different guises , but it usually makes a pretty one , and in this case no complaint may be made of it for lack of interest or excitement .

		We are not altogether satisfied that Miss
Glasgow	LOCATION	should again have deserted her native heath -LRB- if a
Virginia	LOCATION	plantation may be thus designated -RRB- for the allurements of the metropolis and its so-called '' society . ''

		As we said of '' The
House	ORGANIZATION	of Mirth , '' it is next to impossible to make a story of human interest out of the vapid and insolent life of the idle rich , and even the delicate art of Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	was balked in the effort .

		Now Miss
Glasgow	LOCATION	's art , although pos - sibly stronger , is less delicate , and by so much she has been even less successful than the writer with whose latest work `` The Wheel of Life '' is brought into inevitable comparison .

		We may say in behalf of the newer novel that it offers us at least one fine character in the person of its hero , who is in '' society '' but not of it , and another of strong but elusive charm in the person of the woman poet whose apparition haxmts many of the pages .

		But as compared with '' The Deliverance , '' for example , this work is an inferior production .

		`` Lone mother ^ he peninsula to which the name of of dead
Italy	LOCATION	has been given for long ages empires . ''

		presents some of the most compli - cated problems in historical geography of all the continent of Em-ope .

		Consolidated under the Roman rule in the
early half of the third century	DATE	, B. C. , the peninsula was visited and pillaged by almost all of the barbarians in the early Chi'istian centuries .

		The Ostrogoths occupied it in the
fifth century	DATE	, A. D. , imtil Justinian obtained possession and reestablished the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	there .

		It became an exarchate of the
Byzantine Empire	ORGANIZATION	about the middle of the sixth century , and a few years later the
Lombards	LOCATION	wrested it from the Empire .

		By the
Treaty of Verdun	ORGANIZATION	, in 843 , it was separated from the
Western Empire	ORGANIZATION	, and in the tenth century it was united to
Germany	LOCATION	in the empire then formed .

		The
Papal State	ORGANIZATION	then es - tablished proved a bar to complete Italian nationality until very recent times , and from that time until the nineteenth century jwilyarchy existed in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		From the tenth to the
thirteenth century	DATE	, feudal principal - ities and republics were established ; and most of the republics were transformed into principalities before the end of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		In the
fifteenth century	DATE	,
Milan	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	, the
Papal State	ORGANIZATION	, the oligarchic Re - public of
Venice	LOCATION	, and the Kingdom of
Naples	LOCATION	, formed a pentarchy .

		The Normans conquered the southern part of the peninsula and established the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies .


France	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	at times had possessions in
Italy	LOCATION	, and a large portion was once incorporated into
Austria	LOCATION	.

		For three centuries the potentates of
Europe	LOCATION	were accustomed to ask , '' What action shall we take in
Italy	LOCATION	? ''

		During the greater part of the eighteenth century ,
Italy	LOCATION	was at the dis - posal of
Europe	LOCATION	, f m-nishing a country wherein conven - ient principalities were found for throneless princes .

		In twenty-one years ,
Sicily	LOCATION	changed masters four times ;
Parma	LOCATION	, three times in seventeen years .


Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon I. created a kingdom in
Northern Italy	LOCATION	.

		In
1815	DATE	the peninsula was again divided among pi-inces , and was dominated over by
Austria	LOCATION	.

		Not until
1860	DATE	was the kingdom of
Italy	LOCATION	finally established by
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	,
King of Piedmont	ORGANIZATION	.

		Ten years later , the State of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	disappeared from the map of
Italy	LOCATION	, and `` United
Italy	LOCATION	'' was perfected .

		Dxiring the polyarchy ,
Italy	LOCATION	was the cradle of the Renaissance in art , in letters , in diplomatic institu - tions , in banking , and in commerce .

		It would appear an - extraordinarily ambitious undertaking to write the history of such a country and its people in a sin - gle volume ; yet Mrs.
Augusta Hale Gifford	PERSON	, in her ''
Italy	LOCATION	, her People and their Story '' -LRB- Lothrop Pub - lishing Company -RRB- , has not only furnished a worthy companion volume to her deservedly popvUar `` Ger - many , her People and their Story , '' but has suc - ceeded in giving a readable account of the people who have occupied the peninsula from Roman times down to the present day , thi'oughout all the vicissi - tudes of their political goverment , -- a peoi ^ le who have been distinguished in the fields of art , letters , music , and government .

		Very naturally , the first part of the work -LRB- about 400 pages -RRB- is largely drawn from
Gibbon	PERSON	's '' Decline and Fall , '' and brings the history down to the time of Theodoric .

		A single chapter of the second part serves for the course of history from Theodoric to
Charlemagne	LOCATION	, more than five cen - turies .

		Nine chapters serve for the interesting but complicated history of the country to the Napoleonic era .

		From
1792	DATE	to the present time , the most interesting period , diu-ing which time the '' Italian Question '' was continually before the world , the history is given with considerable attention to de - tails , and altogether the volume is of exceptional value both from its historical accuracy and its pop - ular style .

		-- Mr.
Henry Dwight Sedgwick	PERSON	, in his '' Short History of
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has not undertaken such an ambitious task as Mrs.
Gifford	PERSON	's .

		He takes up the history in the year 476 and closes with the last year of the nineteenth cen - tury .

		He has a good sense of proportion , and good ideas of historical perspective ; he writes in a vivid style , and possesses a keen sense of hmnor which contributes not a little to the entertaining quality of his book .

		Altogether , his volume , by no means as small as its name might indicate , is entitled to a place in the front rank of '' short histories . ''

		A chronological table of the Popes and Emperors , a genealogical table of the Medici , a skeleton table of the Kings of the Two Sicilies , and an admirably selected list of books for general reading , give Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	's volume permanent value as a book of reference .

		THE DIAL 157 The foremoxt In writing of a man whose thorough - fZddcon '' ^ '' going egoism was tempered by none to
Hume	PERSON	.

		too benevolent a spirit , and whose chief claim to influence upon contemporary English thought was his power to arouse opposition , it is per - haps not unnatural that the biographer 's tone should contain a note of defense .

		Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	, who has written a life of
Thomas Hobbes	PERSON	for the ' * En - glish Men of Letters '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , evidently felt that his subject was in need of appreciation , and that the reading public ought to become better a `` iuainted with • • the most conspicuous English thinker in the whole period between
Bacon	LOCATION	and
Hume	PERSON	. ''

		Hobbes belonged distinctly to the period in which he lived , and is indeed a product of it .

		Out of its spirit of scientific investigation grew his ma - terialism ; out of the disturbed political situation in
England	LOCATION	grew his famous theory of sovereignty as embodied in • • The Leviathan '' ; and out of these conditions , added to the struggle between
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, grew his somewhat strange conception of mo - rality .

		His present biographer tells us that he had • ` formed and begun to execute a remarkable plan .

		He intended , like a sound logician , to lay down the first principles of scientific inquiry , to apply them to what we should now call psychology , setting forth the laws of human nature , and finally to foimd upon this basis a science corresponding to modern soci - olog -RCB- ' . ''

		His point of view is essentially scientific ; the method of Euclid impressed and influenced him greatly , as did also the fact that the one universal phenomenon is motion .

		Since he developed all liis conclusions from ' • undeniable first principles '' -LRB- as he called them -RRB- , we are tempted to look forward and arbitrarily class him Avith the later continental rationalists .

		His actual physical speculations , admits his biographer , can liave no interest except as speci - mens of eai ` ly guessing , and his theology is practi - cally of no value .

		But his political theory is by no means so easily disposed of , and stands out , even to-day , coherent and logical .

		Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	has sunuuai'ized it with care and precision , and has dis - cussed it with interest .

		Literary Ger - With the publication of '' Young Ger - ^ tiu ^ `` ear?v many '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the sixth volmue
19th century	DATE	.

		of the • ` Main Currents in
Nineteenth Century Literature	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, the task of presenting that great critical work to English readers is completed .

		The task has been long - delayed , and its full accomplishment is a noteworthy event .

		Although the average age of the six volumes is upwards of thirty years , their vitality - has suffered little impau-ment with the lapse of tune , and we may read them to-day with almost the zest with which we made their acquaintance in the seventies .

		The period of this concluding volume of the work lies between the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	and the gi'eat rev - olutionary yeai `` s of the mid-century .

		Heine is the central figure in this act of the literary di-ama , while among the lesser performers are Borne ,
Hegel	LOCATION	,
Menzel	PERSON	,
Immermann	LOCATION	,
Gutzkow	LOCATION	, and Freiligrath . ''

		It is a mighty panorama , this , which the study of the feelings and thoughts of
Germany	LOCATION	, first oppositionist , then revolutionary ' , between
1815	DATE	and
1848	DATE	, unrolls to our view . ''

		And it grows ever in interest , up to the culminating scene of
1848	DATE	, when '' a long shud - der -LRB- of pain and at the same time of relief -RRB- passed through the whole of
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It was as if a win - dow had been opened , and air had reached the lungs of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		This year of • ' great spiritual signifi - cance '' is in literatui'e • ' the red line of sepai-ation that divides our century and marks the beginning of a new era . ''

		It is difficult to keep within bounds our admiration for the energj ' .

		the insight , and the profound philosophical basis of this master-work of criticism .

		A single preg ^ nt sentence may be quoted from the final chapter : •
' Between the years 1830	DATE	and
1840	DATE	something has been happening qtdetly , deep down in men 's minds -- Goethe 's poetry and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy of life , at first championed exclusively by enthusiastic women , have been steadily gaining influence over the cultivated , making them proof against theological impressions but receptive to all great hiunan ideas .

		The cult of Goethe leads by degrees , even in the case of women , to the cult of political liberty and social reform . ''

		The impact of this work upon the alert minds to which it came in the seventies , both as an inspiration and as a trumpet-call to renewed spiritual endeavor , may best be illusti * ated by what Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	wrote the author just after the appearance of the first volume . ''

		I must tm-n to what has lately been constantly in my thoughts , and has even disturbed my sleep .

		I have read yoiu '' Lectures .

		No more dangerous book could fall into the hands of a pregnant poet .

		It is one of those works which place a yawning gulf between yesterday and to-day .

		After I had been in
Italy	LOCATION	, I could not understand how I had been able to exist before I had been there .

		In twenty years , one will not be able to comprehend how spiritual existence at home was possible before these lectm-es ... Your book is not a history of literature according to the old ideas , nor is it a history of civilization .

		I will not trouble to find a name for what it really is .

		It reminds me of the gold-fields of
California	LOCATION	when they were first discovered , which either made nul - lionares of men or ruined them . ''

		_ anAmei-ican IS the title of the latest issue in the commonueaUh .

		uggful • ' American Commonwealths '' series -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author , Mr.
Albert Phelps	PERSON	, a native of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, has based his entii-e narrative upon a close study of the origi - nal sources of
Louisiana	LOCATION	history , and the result is a very good aecount of the position that
Louisiana	LOCATION	has occupied in the history of American settlement and the expansion of American institutions .

		It is worthy of note that throughout the work two important points are emphasized : the significance of the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	in the history of American development ; and the effect of negro slavery and its aftermath upon political and social problems .

		In developing the im - 158 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, portance of
Louisiana	LOCATION	as the key to the
Mississippi	LOCATION	basin , Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	gives a full and interesting descrii > tion of the French and the Spanish domination over the lower
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	, the continual pressure of the Anglo-Americans against the southwestern frontier , and the final annexation and absorption of the territory into the
Union	LOCATION	.

		The absolute neces - sity , political , commercial , and geographical , of the possession of the Mississipj -RRB- i valley to the states of the North is shown to have been one of the fatal causes of weakness to the
Confederacy	LOCATION	.

		On slavery and the problems growing out of it , especially as com - plicated by
Louisiana	LOCATION	conditions , the author writes with full knowledge and keen insight .

		The institu - tion of negro slavery and its effects are traced from colonial times to the jwesent day .

		Like others who have studied the race-question thoroughly , Mr.
Phelps	PERSON	has come to the conclusion that there '' never was a negro problem , '' but that the mulatto is the really important factor in the so-called race problem , the black negro seldom or never being troublesome unless made so temporarily by white or mulatto leaders .

		As to the future of the negro , the author thinks that it is by no means assured ; the negro finds it increasingly difficult to compete with the better equipped white man in the struggle for existence .

		A fact set forth in this account , not generally known , is that the Spanish rule over
Louisiana	LOCATION	was much better than that of
France	LOCATION	, and better than the early American administration in the territory .

		Seldom remembered , also , is the fact that in the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	material assistance was given by
Louisi	PERSON	- ana to the revolting colonies .

		Other phases of state history to which some attention is devoted are the gradual fusion of nationalities after the annexation , the
Burr	PERSON	intrigue and the War of
1812	DATE	, the troubles leading to secession , the Civil War period , the
Butler	PERSON	regime in
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and the Reconstruction of the state from
1862	DATE	to
1876	DATE	.

		The account of the Reconstruction , though brief , is the first satisfactory treatment of that tumultuous epoch in
Louisiana	LOCATION	history .

		Particularly useful is the examination and evaluation of the testimony taken by the various com - mittees of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	that investigated conditions in that unhapi ^ y state between
1866	DATE	and
1876	DATE	, during the reign of the mulatto and the '' carpet-bagger . ''

		The book closes with a short sm-vey of present con - ditions in the commonwealth .

		Aaoodvopuiar ^ ^ -RCB- ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ '' ' ^ ^ O ' ^ J Mr.
Basil	PERSON	de introduction to
Selincourt	LOCATION	, is a recent addition to that the art of
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	, admirable series , `` The Library of Art '' -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- .

		Its author , in follow - ing the older traditional views , stands at variance with such modern critics as
Perkins	PERSON	and
Berenson	PERSON	.

		This fact is evident in his remarks on the Roman school of painters of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries and its relation to
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	, as well as in his treatment of the chronology of the master 's works .

		His arguments are not always the soundest , nor is his criticism as discriminating as it might be .

		Moreover , his treatment of the whole subject lacks thoroughness .

		The frescoes in the transept of the lower church at
Assisi	LOCATION	, which have been ascribed to Giotto by some of the best authorities , he puts aside as not genuine , with - out adequate discussion .

		He ignores not only the little panels in
Munich	LOCATION	, which have been seriously as - cribed to the gi'eat Florentine , but also the '' Presen - tation '' of Mrs.
Gardner	PERSON	's collection in
Boston	LOCATION	, and the Giotto-like frescoes in
San Antonio	LOCATION	at
Padua	LOCATION	.

		Added to this he casts suspicion upon the genuine - ness of
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	's altar-piece in the Louvi'e , without giving adequate reasons for such doubt .

		It would seem that the author lacks the trained eye and mind of the connoisseur , since he bases his conclusions upon the content of the pictures rather than upon that which forms the true basis of discriminating criticism -- the details of technique and of style .

		Yet after all has been said , this is , within its limitations , a good book .

		Mr.
De Selincourt	PERSON	very jjroperly gives most space to his description of
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	's panels in the sacristy of St.
Peters	PERSON	, and of his great frescoes at
Assisi	LOCATION	, at Flor - ence , and at
Padua	LOCATION	.

		His comments upon
Ruskin	PERSON	's criticism of the Paduan frescoes are excellent .

		He loves his subject , and his enthusiasm , which is prop - erly tempered , is just what is needed to inspire the i-eader with a desire to know more of the great Flor - entine and his art .

		The j -RRB- rominence which the author gives to the subject-matter of the pictures , together with the literary flavor of much of his writing , makes his book an excellent popular introduction to the art of
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	.

		So used , the text , accompanied as it is with many excellent illustrations , should prove of much value to beginners in the study of art , and may serve them better than would many a more scientific but less enthusiastic work .

Miss G. E. Mitton	PERSON	's volume on ''
Jane Kntihsh	PERSON	life and i i rn - u / n wavK in
Jane Austeu	PERSON	and her Times -LRB- Putnam -RRB-
Austen	PERSON	's time .

		jg another attempt to piece out the very uneventful story of INIiss
Austen	PERSON	's life with an account of her eighteenth-century environment .

		The few facts of her life have all been told many times before , and her friends and the places she visited have all been fully described .

		So Miss
Mitton	PERSON	goes still further afield , making
Jane Austen	PERSON	simply a good excuse for a rambling , discursive , but not uninteresting account of the manners and customs of her day .

		This survey , she argues , will be of especial value inasnmch as Miss
Austen	PERSON	her - self , in her novels and her letters alike , makes so few references to the great events or the ephemeral interests that environed her .

		So Miss
Mitton	PERSON	tells us how
Jane	PERSON	travelled , and how she might have travelled if she had ventiu-ed on to the Continent , what she studied at school , how clergymen like her father were regarded , what people ate in those days and what they wore , how they managed the serv - ant question , and how they escaped paying postage .

		Her contemporary authors get a chapter ; so does the British navy , apropos of her two brothers ' con - nection with it .

		We are told how
Jane	PERSON	and her heroines liked Bath , what adventures they had at
Southampton	LOCATION	, and what
Jane	PERSON	saw and might have
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 169 seen in her visits to
London	LOCATION	. ''

		Society and Love - making '' is the title of a chapter describing the balls and routs of the time , telling of the exag - gerated head-dresses of the ladies , the gloves they saved so carefully for the minuet , and the money they lost at cards .

		It ends with a circumstantial account of all
Jane	PERSON	's love affairs , viewed in the light of the theories of love which her novels seem to enunciate .

		There are copious extracts from the novels and from
Jane	PERSON	's letters , as well as from the standard biographies .

		But if the present work does not attain to , or claim , much orig ^ inality , it is a clever and readable compilation , with something about it of the sprightly freshness of Miss
Austen	PERSON	's own work .

		Twenty illustrations reproduce portraits of the Aus - ten family and some of their friends , and scenes of contemporary life as some of the eighteenth century artists have depicted it .

		More of Mr. BirrelVg ettays .

		Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	's latest volume , '' In the Name of the Bodleian '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , is characteristically full of • quaint fancies , brilliant sallies of wit and hvunor , keenly-calculated judgments of men and things , and an erudition that pointedly avoids beaten highways to < 5ull its treasures from odd nooks and dusty corners .

		Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	is a book-worm , but he rides his hobby s < S gaUy , with such a vivid appreciation of all the more human relations of life , that others besides book-worms find hiin suggestive and sympathetic .

		The title-essay , a delightful account of the foimda - tion and history of the great
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	library , has for its occasion the financial straits of that institution .

		The paper on '' First Editions '' is a sensible and amusing comment on the controversy between the collector and the man who scoffs at him ; and '' Bos - well as Biographer '' is an analysis of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's and
Carlyle	PERSON	's respective estimates of '' Bozzy , '' unin - spired by the publication of any more modem opin - ion .

		But generally the point of departure is a new book or a new edition .

		In '' Hannah More Once More '' Mr.
BirreU	PERSON	seizes the opportimity afforded him by the publication of
Marion Harland	PERSON	's biogra - phy to make an engaging apology for that other essay in which he rudely related how he buried Miss More 's works , in nineteen calf-bound volumes , in his garden .

		A laudatory life of
Tom Paine	PERSON	, by Mr.
Moncure D. Conway	PERSON	, leads to a vigorous analysis of
Paine	PERSON	's peculiar genius , and the republication of
Matthew Ai-nold	PERSON	's '' Friendship 's Garland '' to a trenchant description of '' Our Great Middle Class . ''

		The subjects are of a more special interest , the treat - ment correspondingly slighter and more casual , than in the '' Obiter Dicta '' ; but the new volmne has its full share of the fine flavor imparted by Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	to everything he touches .

		Improving the ^ ^ - ^ udgett
Meakin	PERSON	is the author of workingman 's a book on '' Model Factories and Vil - '' urroundinrjs .

		j ^ ges '' -LRB-
A. Wessels Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which con - tains an immense amount of information , both inter - esting and instructive , m regard to the progress made during the past century in matters referring to the welfare of the laborer and artisan .

		Even to those best acquainted with the efforts that are being made for better conditions of labor and of housing , much of Mr.
Meakin	PERSON	's material will be entirely new , re - markable , and encouraging .

		Especially interesting is the well-supported statement that the merchants and manufacturers who have led the movement for industrial betterment have done so as business men and not as philanthropists , and the corollary that improved living and working opportunities have been the cause and not the result of increased business success .

		Mr.
Meakin	PERSON	's book is divided into two parts , the first section dealing largely with the elementary efforts made by manufacturers whose buildings were situated in the centres of cities toward ameliorating the conditions of light , air , sanitation , dining facili - ties , and recreation ; and with the efforts , more inher - ently successful , of those who had recognized the underlying principle that cheap land , away from the heart of the city , in a district that might be suitably surrounded by the homes of the workingmen , was the essential for real improvement .

		The mmiber and importance of the factories in
America	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and on the Continent that have taken advantage of im - proved traffic facilities to avail themselves of country sites will be only less surprising than the photographs shown to illustrate the combined beauty and economy which is the result .

		The second half of Mi ' .

		Meakin 's book deals with '' Industrial Housing , '' and is prac - tically a supplement to the first part , since it illus - trates the success which manufacturers have had , in their various and varied schemes , toward surround - ing their workshops with ideal villages .

		The whole book is strongly indicative of the trend toward cooperation that modern industry is taking .

		A dictionary ^ ^ ^ ® honest , as Hamlet remarks , is of famous to be one man out of ten thousand .

		American .

		^ o be famous in the
United States	LOCATION	was of the same degree .

		of rarity a few years ago , when the first issue of `` Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	'' appeared .

		One out of five thousand is the present ratio , which should stiU be reasonably satisfactory to the one .

		In other words , the eight thousand bi - ographies of the first edition have become sixteen thousand in the fourth , now at hand from the house of
Messrs. A. N. Marquis & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This volume , like its predecessors , has been compiled and edited by Mr.
John W. Leonard	PERSON	.

		A new feature is provided by the inclusion of brief references to those men - tioned in the earlier issues , who have since died .

		There are more than two thousand closely-printed pages in the present volume .

		We have exhausted our vocabulary in testifying to the usefulness of this work in connection with the earlier editions , and will only repeat the simple statement that it is invaluable .

		We particularly commend to the attention of judi - cious readers the preface , which is a highly enter - taining essay .

		We may read therein , for example , of the clannish individual who submitted the name '' of thirty-three of his relations as suitable for inclu - 'm THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, sion , of the female `` grafter '' who offered -LRB- for a consideration -RRB- to secure recognition for unsuspected genius , and of the unpublished poet whose '' blank -LRB- not to say blank ety-blank -RRB- verse '' about Lincoln was offered in evidence that the writer belonged among the immortals .

		For these , and other delightful matters , we thank Mr.
Leonard	PERSON	, aside from his ser - vices in providing the harassed editor with an indis - pensable book of reference .

		A collection of brief biographical Some American - i-ii .

		women of a sketches , characterized by a real in - bv-goneday .

		terest of subj ect-matter and a pleas - antly unconventional manner of treatment , is Mr.
Seth Curtis Beach	PERSON	's '' Daughters of the Puritans '' -LRB-
American Unitarian Association	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .


Catherine Maria Sedgwick	PERSON	,
Mary Lowell Ware	PERSON	,
Lydia Maria Child	PERSON	,
Dorothea Lynde Dix	PERSON	,
Margaret Fuller	PERSON	,
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	, and
Louisa M. Alcott	PERSON	are the par - ticular women about whom Mr.
Beach	PERSON	has chosen to write .

		Of nearly every one of them an authoritative biography or memoir of some sort has been written , and one purpose of these essays is to call attention to the more elaborate studies and to stimulate interest in them .

		One of the interesting disclosures of these sketches , which are studies of personality rather than more formal and studied biography , is the picture of the early nineteenth century which they inciden - tally convey .

		Life was very simple in those far-off days , and literature , too , was simple and unsophis - ticated ; but neither life nor literature ever lacked serious inspiration .

		Nearly every author was also a reformer , with a pet cause to write for and to work for in other ways .

		Probably few of Mr.
Beach	PERSON	's readers will care to read a book about each of the seven women with whom he deals ; but there is not one in the list about whom good Americans should be willing to remain in complete ignorance .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
Ernest Newman	PERSON	's volume of '' Musical Studies '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is made up largely of critical essays previously printed in the leading American musical and literary journals .

		The six chapters in the hook are de - voted to ''
Berlioz	PERSON	, Romantic and Classic , '' '' Faust in Music , '' '' Programme Music , '' ''
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	and the Origin of Music , '' ''
Maeterlinck	PERSON	and Music , '' and '' ■
Richard Strauss	PERSON	and the Music of the Future . ''

		Mr.
Newman	PERSON	^ s groupings of principles and motives are on a broad and comprehensive scale , and are free from the ambiguity that mars so many works on musical criticism .

		Professor
Harald Hoffding	PERSON	's '' The Problems of
Phil	PERSON	- osophy '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is not an abridgment of the au - thor 's philosophical theories , hut rather a defence of the four problems that he holds to be the basis of philo - sophical thought , namely : The problem of the nature of consciousness -LRB- the psychological problem -RRB- , the problem of the validity of knowledge -LRB- the logical problem -RRB- , the problem of the nature of being -LRB- the cosmological prob - lem -RRB- , and the problem of value -LRB- the moral and religious problem -RRB- .

		While Professor Hoffding is one of the most thoughtful and learned scholars in his particular branch of knowledge , he is not , even in his '' History of Modern Philosophy , '' distinctly lucid and simple .

		And in this new volume , an abstract discussion of abstract princi - ples , his style carries him beyond the possibility of ac - companiment by the layman .

		But since the book is , in the nature of the case , intended for philosophers and teachers of philosophy , its usefulness will not be much impaired by its abstruseness .

		A little manual dealing with the life and art of Ra - phael has been prepared for the use of art students by Mrs.
Julia Cartwright Ady	PERSON	, and is issued as the four - teenth volume of the '' Popular Library of Art '' -LRB- But - ton -RRB- .

		Mrs.
Ady	PERSON	is accustomed to the preparation of far more elaborate studies than this , but she uses the smaller space at her command with muoh discrimination , writ - ing what is , withm its limited compass , a singidarly complete account of the character and development of
Raphael	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		She is of course thoroughly familiar with modern critical opinion , and as iar as it goes her work is exact and scholarly .

		Fifty reproductions of the artist 's work illustrate the volume .

		Mr.
John Sampson	PERSON	has edited for the
Oxford Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity Press -LRB-
Henry Frowde	PERSON	-RRB- `` The Poetical Works of
William Blake	PERSON	. ''

		This is '' a new and verbatim text from the manuscript , engraved , and letter press originals , '' and includes , by way of apparatus , both variorum read - ings and bibliographical material .

		The text of
Blake	PERSON	has been so overlain with the emendations of -LRB- not always judicious -RRB- editors that its restoration was highly desir - able , and this Mr.
Sampson	PERSON	has scrupulously done for us .

		Pimctuatiou is all that this editor has ventured to add to
Blake	PERSON	's originals , and this could hardly have been omitted .

		We can not be too gratefid for this beautiful and scholarly edition of the great mystic .

		Poetry , romance , art , architecture , history of wars ^ between individuals , factions , and races , -- all these play their part in Mrs.
Janet Ross	PERSON	's '' Florentine Palaces and their Stories '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Mrs.
Ross	PERSON	has every qualifi - cation for writing a book of this kind .

		Herself a resident of
Florence	LOCATION	for thirty-five years , and an associate of its best citizens , familar with all their traditions and customs , , and moreover a diligent student of their archives , she has compiled a book which takes precedence of any other in the same field .

		The number of palaces described is seventy-six .

		A very complete index renders the mass of tradition available for ready reference , and the illustra - tions from drawings by
Miss Adelaide Marchi	ORGANIZATION	help to make up an exceedingly attractive volume .

		Seven new volumes have recently been added to the well-known ''
Newnes	PERSON	' Art Library '' -LRB- Wame -RRB- .

		These are boimd uniformly with the rest of the series , in boards with cloth back , gilt lettered .

		Each volume contains a frontispiece in photogravure , about sixty full-page half - tone plates , and a brief textual comment .

		A number of the half-tones in the volume on
Rossetti	PERSON	are made more effective by being moimted on rough grey mats .

		Mr.
Ernest Radford	PERSON	furnishes the text for this volume , and Mr.
Malcolm Bell	PERSON	writes of
Titian	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
P. G. Konody	PERSON	of
Filippino Lippi	PERSON	, Mrs.
Arthur Bell	PERSON	of Tinto - retto , Mr.
Ars	PERSON	^ ne
Alexandre of Puvis de Chavannes	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Henry Miles	PERSON	of '' The Later Work of Titian , '' and Mr.
J. Ernest Phythian	PERSON	of '' The Pre-Raphaelite Bro - therhood . ''

		These introductory sketches are largely bio - graphical , except the last-named , which is an exposition of the motives and relative positions of
Madox Brown	PERSON	, Holman-Himt ,
Millais	PERSON	, and
Rossetti	PERSON	.

		Beginners in art study will especially appreciate this very attractive series .


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 161 Notes . ''

		Sermon Briefs , '' by
Henry Ward Beecher	PERSON	, is pub - lished at the
Pilgrim Press	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		It consists of transcriptions from
Beecher	PERSON	's manuscript notes made for sermons preached during the years 1864-5 .

		Attention having been newly recalled to '' Die Waf - fen Nieder , '' the historical romance of the
Baroness von Suttner	PERSON	, by the recent award of the Nobel peace prize ,
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	now republish their trans - lation of the work , as made by Mrs.
Alice Asbury Abbott	PERSON	many years ago .

		This version is entitled '' Ground Arms , '' which is both idiomatic and exact .

		`` Model English Prose , '' compiled by Pi-ofessor
George R. Carpenter	PERSON	, and published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a volume of selections for the use of secondai-y schools .

		The selections are not only representative of their authors and periods , but are also extremely inter - esting on their o \ ^ 'n accomit , and it is seldom that we are offered a school-book which so completely deserves to be described as good reading .

		The EngUsh '' Who 's Who '' for
1906	DATE	, published by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	, calls for about the same sort of comment as previous issues .

		ITiere are many new biographies , and the selection of American names is as capricious as ever .

		Removal of many tables to the companion '' Who 's Who Year Book '' has kept the work within practicable dimensions , although the biographies now fill nearly two thousand pages .

		Encouraged by the success which attended the publi - cation in the original of
Xavier de Maistre	ORGANIZATION	's `` Voyage autour de ma Chambre '' in the series of
Riverside Press Editions	ORGANIZATION	,
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will shortly bring out Bemardin de Saint-Pierre 's '' Paul et Virginie '' in the French text of the original first edition .

		The new edition will be set in type of the Didot style , imported from
Paris	LOCATION	, and is to be embellished with reproductions of the engAvings in the first French edition .

		These illustrations are not facsimiles , but have been reengraved on wood by
M. Lamont Brown	PERSON	.

		The edition is limited to 280 numbered copies .

		An important publishing transfer recently effected was that whereby Messrs.
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	took over the periodical and book business of the
United Educational Company	ORGANIZATION	, formerly
E. L. Kellogg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	and
E. O. Vaile	ORGANIZATION	.

		The periodicals include the well-known '' Teach - er 's Magazine , '' a practical assistant and representative of teachers in the primarj - , intermediate , and grammar grades throughout the country , published monthly with illustrations ; `` The School Journal , '' a weekly journal presenting new movements in education with special reference to intermediate and secondary schools ; '' Our Times , '' a weekly journal of current events , for general readers , and also adapted for practical school use ; and '' Educational Foundation , '' a monthly magazine of peda - gogy .

		These periodicals , it will be seen , cover the en - tire work from the primary to the end of the secondary schools .

		The large and important list of pedagogical books , teachers ' helps , supplementary books , and school entertainments includes '' The Teacher 's Library , '' a se - ries of practical professional books for teachers , contain - ing over twenty volumes ; `` The Teacher 's Month by Month Books , '' for primary grades ; and the `` Annual School Directories , '' fifteen in number , founded by
E. O. VaUe	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is understood that the plans of
Messrs. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	include many important impravements and developments of both the periodicals and the book list along approved edxicational lines .

		LIST OF NEW BOOKS 211 CELTIC LITE RATURE .

		For twenty-five centuries the stage of our so-called civilized - world was occupied by two great groups of actors : Greek and Syrian they were , protagonists and antagonists , with chorus and semi-chorus from surrounding tribes .

		They grew up side by side , they made their entrances separately , but soon they clashed and contended and wrought out the drama and spectacle of life .

		Occasionally they were swept aside by invading hordes -- by
Northern	ORGANIZATION	barbarism orMoslem culture , -- but they soon regained their place in the centre of the stage , and to this day they are the dominant powers in our thought Meanwhile what went on behind the scenes ?

		It was not until toward the close of the eighteenth century that the existence of vast poems and mighty systems of thought in
India	LOCATION	were revealed to the European world .

		Even to-day these great reservoirs of reason and imagination are hardly accessible to the student ; and they have not begun to flow over and fertilize the fields of modem thought - The intuitive profundity of many conceptions in Hindoo philosophy surpasses the reasoned deductions of Greek or German metaphysic And the closing scenes of the Mahabharata , at least , have a spiritual and ethical significance not equalled by any European poem .

		About the same time the Teutonic race `` found itself '' in the great myths of the Niebelungenlied and the Icelandic Sagas .

		And simultaneously the Celtic genius rose on the horizon , and spoke in a voice that thriUed
Europe	LOCATION	.


MacPherson	PERSON	's Ossian , vague and confused as it is -- full of interpolations which show the influence of Shakespeare and the classics , -- has yet in it the fundamental characteris - tics of primitive and original literature .

		It must be remembered , however , that one branch of the Celtic myth tree had blossomed and bour - geoned long before , -- had in fact become almost the main stem of English literature .

		The Arthurian legend was twice a changeling , for , born in compara - tive simplicity or poverty in
Wales	LOCATION	, it was transported to
France	LOCATION	and decked with borrowed trappings of chivalry and Christianity .

		Then it was brought back by
Malory	ORGANIZATION	, redacted by him , shorn of something of its over-blown glory , and made into the typical En - glish epic story .

		Milton indulged the dream of using the legend as the subject of his life-work , and it is perhaps a pity he did not finally choose it rather than the more high flying and difficult theme he under - took .

		At his hands we might have had something of the mystery and magic , the wild paganism , the primitive interpretation of nature and humanity , that is in the original Welsh legends .

		As it is we had to wait for
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	to make more prim and proper and conventional the already prim and proper and conventional version of
Malory	LOCATION	.

		For all the redactors of the Arthurian story have dealt as hardly with the Welsh originals as
MacPherson	ORGANIZATION	did 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, with his Irish ones .

		They transformed nature myths into chivahic romances and religious poems .

		While on one hand they deepened and hxmianized the legends , on another they wiped out all that was most characteristic of the Celtic nature .

		The originals , however , remained , and it is hardly too much to say that their resuscitation and recogni - tion have been the great literary find of the past fifty years .

		The Welsh cycle of legends and poetical relics came earliest into notice , and it is on these that the criticism of Renan and
Arnold	LOCATION	is mainly founded .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's essay on Celtic Literature is almost the best critical treatise in the language , and it is certainly the most curious tour de force of criticism which exists anywhere .

		Apparently he knew only a few words of
Welsh	ORGANIZATION	, had examined only a few relics of Welsh literature , and was in absolute igno - rance of the great mass of Irish poetry .

		Yet by a divination of genius which seems almost uncanny , he defined and described the Celtic genius as no one else has ever succeeded in doing .

		Perhaps with the instinct of an artist for effect , he forced the note of difference , of uniqueness , in Celtic literature further than there is warrant for doing .

		It is difficult to believe that the main characteristics that he found in this literature have not existed in other litera - tures and in all ages . ''

		Melancholy , '' '' Titanism '' surely there is something of these qualities in the
Bible	LOCATION	and the Greek Tragedians , in
Dante	LOCATION	, Job , and
Jeremiah	PERSON	.

		Prometheus , Orestes and -LRB- Edipus , the people of the Inferno , -- these figures certainly express the emotions of pessimism and revolt in a larger sense than
Llywarch Hgn	ORGANIZATION	or
Taliesin	LOCATION	.

		And from the Iberian rather than from the Celtic race rose the arch-rebel ,
Don Juan	PERSON	.

		In style , too , it is pretty hard to differentiate the Celtic natural magic , which Arnold discovered , from the charm of expres - sion in
Sappho	LOCATION	and Catullus .

		And the romantic inter - pretation of nature in the Celtic poetry !

		Really there are fine things of this kind in the
Bacchae of Euri	LOCATION	- pides and in the wilder and weu-der scenes of Virgil .

		Human gifts seem to be a pretty constant quantity , and one hesitates to believe that an entirely new set of talents came in with the Celts .

		However , as this may be , the qualities which Arnold found in the Celtic genius are qualities of style -- of personality .

		If one who has hardly more claim to scholarship in these matters may presume to judge , these qualities pertain rather to Welsh than to Irish literatm * e .

		The Irish legends are the much larger body of important work ; they are destined , I think , to have a greater future than the Welsh , but they are epic and impersonal .

		They are in many respects badly written .

		They have neither the sense of style which the best Welsh fragments possess , nor the form and proportion which the best Welsh stories display .

		Very probably this lack of fineness of phrase and form was not so evident in the original Irish poems .

		Dr.
Douglas Hyde	PERSON	has told us of the poet culture which went on in
Ireland	LOCATION	during that country 's great period .

		There was a Druidic and Bardic organiza - tion , which must have included a large percentage of the population of the state , supported at the cost of the state .

		There were colleges where the bards were trained and disciplined in the conception and execu - tion of poetry .

		There was an amazing list of model compositions which the students had to memorize , and there was a marvellously intricate system of versification which they had to master .

		If these accounts are facts , no race ever invented such a hot - house method for the production of literature .

		And from the hints and glimpses we have , it is probable that the `` Irish bards did develop an almost unequalled technique in writing .

		Only their technique seems to have been mainly concerned with the music of syllar hies , whereas the Welsh poets cared more for the pictures in words .

		The difference obtains yet , if we may consider the English poets as the descendants of the Welsh bards .

		But the original productions of the Irish poets are gone .

		What we have is their work reduced to writing by monkish scribes after centuries of merely oral existence .

		The music would be the first thing to go out of the poems under these conditions .

		Of some of the epic legends there are a number of recensions extant .

		And these read as if the scribes had still other versions to choose from , and were so anxious not to lose anything good that they , as it were , superimposed one upon another .

		In the descriptions we have adjectives seven deep heralding the arrival of the nouns , and the same idea is repeated over and over again in slightly dif - ferent form .

		This excess of particularity and vivid - ness has almost the same effect as
MacPherson	ORGANIZATION	's vague monotony , and leaves the figures and stories confused .

		If the Irish legends are inferior to the Welsh in mystic depth , in glimpse and gleam of revelation , they are also inferior to the Icelandic Sagas in world - wide significance , in the power of imagination which grasps the beginning and end of creation and seeks to explain everything between .

		The Irish gods and their doings are about what a child might imagine .

		There was no theology in the primitive Irishman 's head .

		He was all for this world , and if he thought of the hereafter he conceived it merely as a place where there were improved opportunities for eating , drinking , fighting , and the making of love .

		He was absolutely healthy and cheerful .

		He had a romantic regard for woman .

		All pleasurable things appealed

		187 to him -- splendid attire , wine , song .

		Poetry has probably never been so much honored as by him .

		`` With a high sense of personal honor , he submitted to one singular superstition -- a sort of taboo -- called geasa .

		He thought that no honest man could object to having his head cut off in single combat if the play was fair .

		TVTiat , then , is the great value of the Irish epics ?

		It consists , I think , in the clear and undistorted splendor with which absolutely natural humanitj ' is bodied forth .

		Does not the description I have given recall the Homeric world and the Ho - meric view of life ?

		Homer is indeed the name that leaps to our lips as we move about among the large humanities of the Irish epics .

		This is not because their heroes are half gods and perform deeds which put even the Greek Herakles or Achilles to the blush .

		These wonders detract rather than add to the vitality of the figures .

		But this vitality is so rich , so abounding , that in spite of extravagance or mediocrity of style , in spite of bad narrative form , a whole world of beings , splendid , magnificent , and real , rises to us from in the Irish legends .

		Essentially , taking the whole round of his career ,
Cuchulain	PERSON	is a finer figure than Achilles .

		The whole train of his mates and rivals ,
Fergus	PERSON	,
Ferdiad	LOCATION	,
Conor	PERSON	,
Meve	PERSON	, are tremendous triimiphs of projection .

		The love stories of
Naoise	ORGANIZATION	and D ^ rrdre , of Diarmait and
Grainne	PERSON	, rank with the most perfect in the world .

		For if the men of the Irish legends recall the men of Homer , the women have much of the qualitj - of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's heroines .

		The gayety , the charm , the constancy , the pathos of
Rosalind	PERSON	and
Imogen	PERSON	are at least im - plicit in them .

		And the world in which these figures are set , a world of joyous intercourse in splendid palaces , of out-door life in field and forest , a world of banquet and sport and war , might be set against the world of either the Greek or English poet .

		What are we to do with this treasure trove of Celtic literature ?

		Shall we take
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's invitation and '' cross out the immensely overpaid ac - count of Troy , Ulysses wanderings , '' and turn to this new material for themes and inspiration ?

		Or must we accept the fragmentary and amorphous Welsh and Irish poems as final and sacred works of art ?

		Renan said sadly , '' We Celts will never build our Parthenon -- marble is not for tis , '' but he claimed for his race the thrilling , penetrating cry which shakes and inspires the world .

		I speak under the protection of Renan 's name when I say that Celtic literature has produced no great work .

		Its most powerful and effective production , the Arthurian legend , owes only its germ and origin to Celtic genius ; it was biult up by many hands in many lands .


Ireland	LOCATION	is the home of the Fairy folk , the
Aes Sidhe	ORGANIZATION	, yet no Celtic work can compare with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's fairy comedy .

		Wild
Wales	LOCATION	, both the real land and its mirrored image in song , overflows with glamour , but what Welsh poem equals
Cole	PERSON	- ridge 's '' Christabel '' in undefinable depths of magic meaning ?

		Unconquered courage , stormy despair are in the Scotch Ossian , yet these qualities are carried to far greater heights in
Milton	LOCATION	and
Byron	PERSON	.

		The Celtic charm of expression is keen and vivid , but
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	outmatch it beyond com - pare .

		If we accept
Arnold	PERSON	's view that many of the finest qualities of English poetry entered it from Celtic sources we must decide that the Celtic genius is a fecundating pollen , powerful when blown abroad but almost inert when it remains at home .

		In fact the Celtic mind would seem to be either too fine and frail , or too extravagant and florid , to create perfect works of art .

		It either has not the strength to build them at all or it overloads them until they break down .

		The relics of Celtic poetry rise before us somewhat like the circle at
Stone	ORGANIZATION	- henge .

		This is not a qxiarry , for the sign of a mighty conception , the marks of human labor are there ; it is not a ruin , for it is buHt of materials too indes - tructible for decay .

		Or perhaps a better image of Celtic antiquity would be
Milton	PERSON	's description of the animal creation , when all the beasts were strug - gling from the ground -- '' the lion pawing to get free its hinder parts . ''

		Half vital , half encumbered and embarrassed by the matter of which they are made , the Celtic legends start out into the world of art Neither the Heroic Cycle of Ulster , nor the legends of
Finn	PERSON	, nor `` The Four Branches of the Mabinogi , '' can , in their old shape , hope to become world poems .

		The Celtic gen ` us which wrought them had nearly all the poetic gifts , except the gift to look before and after , to group each part in refer - ence to the whole .

		Therefore this magnificent poetic material lies open to the piracy of the poets of the world .

		It lacks the defense which the greatest poetry possesses of being done better than any new hand can possibly achieve .

		Contemporary critics wiU probably say that the modern poet had best busy himself with the modern world .

		Contemporary critics probably told
Homer	ORGANIZATION	and
Virgjil	PERSON	and
Milton	PERSON	this same thing .

		If contemporary critics had had their way the world would never have seen any noble or serious poetry .

		For in the main such poetry requires g ^ eat themes and figures , and dim backgrounds to project them against .

		Such subjects are difficult to find , almost impossible to invent ; but the Celtic genius has given us by the basketful themes unsurpassed in literature , as yet only slightly wrought by art .

		The genial friends , the wise and witty sayings , the rare good times , the thrilling experiences , of those early years will never see their match ; and j # Si laudatrix temporis acti , her memory kindled into a rosy glow with the enchantment of those distant and fast-fading scenes , writes with some excess of fond enthusiasm for their vanished glories , she certainly merits , not the censure , but rather the thanks of her sympathizing con - temporaries .

		The famous men and women of the past can never be made too real and living to us , and it is for the vivid presentation of their personalities and peculiarities that we have much reason to thank
Miss Friswell	PERSON	, especially as she offers , for the most part , what is best and most attractive in their characters .

		The bright daugh - ter of a gifted father , she enjoyed unusual op - portxmities for meeting and mingling with the illustrious of her own time and country , as well as with some foreign notables , and she appears to have made good use of these opportunities .

		The writer 's name will recall that of her father ,
James Hain Friswell	PERSON	, the once popidar but now little read author of the very successful essays on '' The Gentle Life , '' and of numerous miscel - laneous works besides .

		Her own ''
Gingerbread Maiden	ORGANIZATION	and other Stories , '' published in her teens , and her memoir of her father -- to name no other of her writings -- show her to be sealed of the tribe of authors .

		The references she has introduced to her own personal appearance , and to her extraordinary resemblance to Marie An - toinette , incline one to surmise that , besides in - heriting her father 's literary tastes , she was also , in her physical endowment , matre pulchrajilia pulchrior . ''

		I have tried , '' she pleads apologet - ically in her closing paragraph , '' to keep from intruding too much upon my readers , but I fear I have not altogether succeeded ; therefore I would remind them , and my critics , that aU rem - iniscences are bound to be leaves from the lives • In the Sixties and Seventies .

		This seemed to the schoolgirls not a man 's business , and the elder girls did not scruple to laugh and jeer , which hurt his daughters ' feelings , mak - ing the elder indignant , and the younger cry : and I , who hated such behaviour , and would not have literary people laughed at on any acconnt , stoutly maintained that to do the housekeeping and to buy clothes was peculiar to poets , and therefore quite right .

		As I was looked upon as an authority on literary manners , if not matters , the chaff ceased . ''

		Our author 's detailed reports of long conver - sations equal some of
Madame Adam	ORGANIZATION	's amazing achievements in this department of autobiog - raphy .

		After some pages of dialogue about an expected call from Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	, the narra - tive proceeds as follows : `` A little man walked straight into the room ; his head , which was crowned by a quantity of auburn hair , was held high , his eyes stared straight in front of him , and he was evidently quite unconscious that he was not alone in the room .

		My mother walked forward and held out her hand .

		He started , and dropped his hat ; my gover - ness went forward and picked it up ; he almost snatched it from her ... Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	sat down on the edge of a chair .

		He bent slightly forward , his arms resting on his knees , his hat balanced between his fingers , and he kept swinging it backwards and forwards , just as I had seen Mr.
Toole	PERSON	do in a farce ; he dropped it and picked it up several times .

		I think he was about twenty - nine or thirty years old at this time -- not more than five feet six in height , and he had that peculiar pallor which goes with auburn hair ; and this paleness was heightened by study , enthusiasm , and the fierce , rebel - lious spirit which seemed to animate that fragile body , and which glows and burns in his writings .

		My mother and Miss W did all they could to put him at ease , and I sat and repented that I had ever wished to see him , for I pitied him intensely , he seemed so very ner - vous .

		.

		• .

		My father now appeared , and by his conver - sational powers and tact soon set Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	quite at his ease .

		He ceased to fidget , and talked of
Coleridge	PERSON	and other poets in a most interesting manner -- to hear him and my father was an intellectual treat . ''

		Interesting memories are given of
Toole	ORGANIZATION	and Irving and other actors .

		The author has much of Charles
Lamb	PERSON	's fondness for the old plays and the old heroes of the footlights .

		With Irving the Friswells were on terms of intimacy , even to
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE jyiAJL 189 the point of maJdng criticisms and advising changes in some of his plays .

		Two passages relating to this lamented genius may well find space for insertion here . ''

		My mother , and indeed all of us , often used to point out little details that had been overlooked .

		I remember one in The Bells , which my mother told Mr.
Irving	PERSON	on the first night , when he returned to our house to supper .

		People who have seen the play may remember that the first scene is a small iim , in the depths of the country , and that there is supposed to have been a deep fall of snow -- in fact , it is still snowing .

		` ITie innkeeper , ' Mat - thias ' -LRB- Irving -RRB- , walked in , on that first night , in ordinary black boots , with no snow upon them .

		My mother spoke of it , and afterwards '
Matthias	PERSON	' wore high black boots , and stood on the mat while the snow was brushed off them .

		Remarks were made in the papers as to Mr.
Irving	PERSON	's attention to the minutest details , and this was cited as an instance . ''

		`` We had been waiting for ``
Bob Gasset	PERSON	, ' and now he came , but looked so different I could scarcely believe he was the same man .

		Mr.
Irving	PERSON	was then under thirty , had a pale , serious , intellectual face , and long , rather wavy , black hair , and was as different from his make - up as
Bob Gasset	PERSON	as can well be imagined .

		We all got into a cab and drove home , Irving coming in to supper .

		My father talked about the play , and said how much he liked it ; but the actor talked very little ; he gave me the idea of being melancholy , I thought he was tired .

		I did not know then that sUence and seeming lassitude were habitual to him ; but so it was , for , though I saw him often for four or five years , I do not think I ever saw him cheerful , let alone hilarious .

		His face , voice , figure , proclaimed the tragedian -- and yet how well he can play comedy every one knows who has seen him as ' Jingle . '

		That night he quite annoyed me , for when we came into the dining-room he suddenly put up his eye-glasses , and , after a caref xd scrutiny of my face , said , more to himself than to my father and mother : ` Very pretty -- extraordinary likeness to
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	. '

		I became crimson ; but
Irving	PERSON	was not in the least per - turbed .

		I might have been a picture , from the cool way in which he looked at me , and I have never been able to determine whether he knew he spoke aloud . ''

		A rather melancholy picture of Du Maurier , sitting sadly in the twilight of increasing blind - ness , is presented in the following , which evi - dently refers to a period later than the seventies . ''

		I went and found the artist sitting alone and seem - ingly rather dull .

		He told me he was almost blind ; and he spoke of my father 's early death , of his hard work , his philanthropy and his Christianity .

		He talked of his own work , and seemed afraid he should not be able to keep on drawing much longer for Punch . '

		You think I can see you , ' he said ; ` but though I know you are quite near me , you are in a grey mist , and I can not dis - tinguish your features . '

		... He talked of the old days in Great Russell Street , and said ' that then was his hap - piest time , and those were the palmy days of Punch ' ... He had not at this time written Trilby .

		I never saw him after that book came out . ''

		A glimpse of
Dickens	LOCATION	, whose '' Old Curiosity Shop ' the author says she almost knew by heart , will here be welcome .

		`` My father was very fond of taking me out and about with him , so that at a very early age I became acquainted with authors , publishers , and printers .

		On one occasion we were walking down Welling ^ n Street ,
Strand	LOCATION	, and just passing the office of
Household Words	ORGANIZATION	, when a han - som cab stopped , and out stepped a gaily dressed gen - tleman ; his bright green waistcoat , vivid scarlet tie , and pale lavender trousers would have been noticed by any one , but the size of the nosegay in his buttonhole riveted my attention , for it was a regular flower garden .

		My father stopped and introduced me , and I , who had only seen engravings of the Maclise portrait , and a very handsome head in my mother 's photograph album , wa & astonished to find myself shaking hands with the great novelist ,
Charles Dickens	PERSON	.

		His manner was so exceed - ^ S ^ y pleasant and kind to a young nobody like me that I was very much taken with him ; and I was moreover very anxious to like the man who had created
Dick Swiveller	PERSON	and the Marchioness , and
Little Nell	PERSON	and her grandfather . ''

		No preface is required to the following real - istic description of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		The scene is laid in the
Charing Cross Station	LOCATION	. ''

		A train drew up , and out of it stepped a gentleman .

		My father said something which I did not catch , and going up to him stopped and shook hands .

		The gentle - man would have been tall , but his shoulders seemed somewhat bent ; his hair was long , so was his beard ; he wore an ugly
Inverness	LOCATION	cape and a large slouch hat ; he looked like a bandit in a melodrama , and I thought him some poor actor who had come out in some of the stage properties .

		As he talked to my father I was conscious of his looking very often at me ; at last he said : ' So this is yotir daughter -- you must be proud of such a daugh - ter . '

		My father smiled , and replied : ' I could wish her to be stronger . ' '

		Is she delicate ? '

		exclaimed
Tennyson	PERSON	.

		• Why , when I saw you coming she reminded me of the Goddess of the Mom -- she quite brightens up this dull and dreary place , ' and he looked with disgust round the station , which I had always liked . '

		She looks the incar - nation of youth and health , ' he added . ''

		The writer indulges in a curious lamentation over what would seem to be the exceptionally fortunate circumstances of her upbringing .

		She says , '' I think now it was rather hard on us youngsters to always have so many clever and brilliant people roimd us ; we always seemed to be kept at attention . ''

		Readers of her book will not echo her regret .

		As a record of '' Impres - sions of Literary People and Others , '' it is vivid , rapid , thoroughly entertaining and seldom , frivolous , and , despite occasional carelessness -- such carelessness as one expects in a lady who is dashing off her reminiscences about as they occur to her , -- generally well written .

		But as the writer takes occasion to regret the modem decline in literary style and grammatical correct - ness among our host of '' amateur '' authors , she may pardon a reviewer for calling attention to a few slips in her own pages .

		The split infinitive in the last quotation we pass over as likely to offend none but that terror of us all , the purist .

		But '' I put up with it like a good sister should 190 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, contains a vulgarism truly surprising in this par - ticular sister .

		Of
Disraeli	PERSON	and his wife we read that '' they mutually loved each other '' ; and in another place , '' Then we settled down to talk of the people we had mutually known . ''

		On another page the writer speaks of playing '' a Lieder of
Mendelssohn 's	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The
London	LOCATION	Plague she makes break out in
1664	DATE	, a year too soon .

		Last , and least , '' yodle '' she spells '' joddle , '' and for '' waltz '' she writes '' valse . ''

		All these are small matters , introduced here largely in the hope of pleasing the author by proving to her how thoroughly her excellent chapters have been conned even by the reviewer , who , as we all know , is perfectly qualified to judge of any book by its weight , odor , and superficial aspect .

		The Meaxing and
Influence of American Diplomacy	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Many readers of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' during the past year or two have followed with rather unusual interest a series of articles con - tributed by Professor
John Bassett Moore	PERSON	, of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, on the significant aspects of American diplomatic history and practice .

		They , in common with a larger public , will be glad to know that these studies , after the ap - proved fashion in such cases , have been brought together in book form , and that by a consider - able amount of revision and amplification they have been made even more suggestive and illum - inating than as first published .

		The primary object of the work , in the words of the author , is '' to give , not a chronological narrative of international transactions , but rather an ex - position of the principles by which they were guided , in order that the distinctive purposes of American diplomacy may be understood and its meaning and influence appreciated . ''

		A thoroughgoing and comprehensive history of American diplomacy would be a most welcome acquisition , especially if it came from the hand of such a master in the field as is Professor
Moore	PERSON	; but apparently for such a piece of work we have yet a good while to wait .

		In lieu of it the next best thing , and perhaps for the reading public a really more useful thing , is such a vol - ume as that now under review .

		Li this we have at least a very readable presentation of the prin - ciples and spirit underlying the dealings with *
American Diplomacy	ORGANIZATION	, its Spirit and Achievements .

Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		foreign powers , even though with only enough historical detail to afford a fair background for interpretation .

		The point of view from which Professor
Moore	PERSON	has approached his subject is set forth explicitly in his prefatory note when he affirms that '' nothing could be more erroneous than the supposition that the
United States	LOCATION	has , as the result of certain changes in its habits , suddenly become , within the past few years , a ' world - power . ' ''

		The
United States	LOCATION	is declared to have been '' always in the fullest and highest sense a world-power . ''

		There is nothing essentially novel , of course , in the assertion , and yet in these times it calls for all the emphasis that Professor
Moore	PERSON	has placed upon it .

		Six or seven years ago , amidst the excitement incident to war , conquest , and expansion , it became the custom to picture the
United States	LOCATION	as breaking forth with startling suddenness from her tradi - tional isolation and making a highly dramatic , not to say sensational , debut as a world power .

		Afterwards , however , when we became able once more to reflect sanely upon our international position , we discovered that never since we have constituted an independent nation have we been anything else than a world-power , and that our present status -LRB- whether for better or for worse -RRB- differs from that of ten or of fifty years ago merely in degree rather than in kind .

		In an essay published as long ago as
1899	DATE	Professor
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	drove home the fact that historically the
United States	LOCATION	has never been an isolated power , and now Professor
Moore	PERSON	builds his whole argument on the thesis ; in truth if one cares to trace the earlier development of the idea he will fuid it stated perfectly by Trescot in his treatise on the diplomacy of the American Rev - olution , written more than half a century ago .

		In his opening chapter Professor
Moore	PERSON	gives us a succinct account of the beginnings of our diplomatic history .

		After laying down the prop - osition that the advent of the
United States	LOCATION	into the family of nations was the most important event of the past two hundred years , he describes graphically the difficulties and embarrassments which the young power was called upon to face before it had won its way to an honorable inter - national standing .

		The sketch contains nothing that is new , but as a convenient summary it is distinctly worth while .

		The method of the suc - ceeding nine chapters is topical rather than chro - nological .

		The first subject taken up is '' The System of Neutrality . ''

		The years of the Con - federation have been designated as the critical
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 191 period of our early national history , but the ex - pression might be applied with almost equal propriety to the years between
1791	DATE	and
1796	DATE	during which American independence was totter - ing vmder the impact of European turmoil .

		As Professor
Moore	PERSON	points out , the perils which the nation encountered at this time were greater than the old Confederation could have withstood , and were a very severe test of the efficacy of the new Constitution .

		The temptations to wander from the straight and narrow path of neutrality were all but overpowering .

		Almost alone among the statesmen of the time
Washington	LOCATION	kept a level head , and it was his decisive action more than anything else that warded off the danger .

		Pro- fessor
Moore	PERSON	's accoimt of the Genet mission , while very brief , is illuminating .

		Of
Genet	PERSON	him - self it is remarked that he '' has been the subject of much unmerited obloquy ; in circumstances exceptionally trying his conduct was ill-advised , but not malevolent . ''

		After an interesting chapter on the contribu - tions of the
United States	LOCATION	toward establishing the freedom of the seas , -- especially with respect to the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	pirates , the impressment of seamen , the right of search , the African slave - trade , and the free navigation of sounds , straits , and other water channels , -- we find a useful sketch of the fisheries questions which represents a chapter added since the serial publication of the studies .

		And of course there is a chapter on the much-discussed , if not over - worked , Mon - roe Doctrine .

		For the most part this chapter is of necessity a rehearsal of facts already well known , but it contains also some general obser - vations and conclusions which , coming from such a man as Professor
Moore	PERSON	, are worthy of the most thoughtfid attention on the part of our people .

		Says the writer : `` A tendency is often exhibited to attach decisive importance to particular phrases in President
Monroe	PERSON	's message of
1823	DATE	, or to the special circumstances in which it originated , as if they furnished a definitive test of what shotUd be done and what should be omitted un - der all contingencies .

		The verbal literalist would , on the one hand , make the
United States	LOCATION	an involuntary party to all controversies between European and
Ameri	PERSON	- can governments , in order that the latter may not be • oppressed ' ; while the historical literalist would , on the other hand , treat
Monroe	PERSON	's declaration as obsolete , since the conditions to which they specially referred no longer exist .

		But when we consider the mutations in the world 's affairs , these modes of reasoning must be con - fessed to be highly unsatisfactory .

		The *
Monroe	PERSON	Doc - trine ' has in reality become a convenient title by which is denoted a principle that doubtless would have been wrought out if the message of
1823	DATE	had never been writ - ten -- the principle of the limitation of European power and influence in the Western hemisphere ... The
Monroe	PERSON	Doctrine ... is now generally recognized as a principle of American policy .

		To its explicit acceptance by
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	there may be added the declaration which was spread by unanimous consent upon the minutes of
The Hague Conference	ORGANIZATION	, and which was permitted to be annexed to the signature of the American delegates to the convention for the peaceful adjustment of international disputes , that nothing therein contained should be so construed as to require the
United States	LOCATION	* to depart from its traditional policy of not entering upon , interfering with , or entangling itself in , the political questions or internal administration of any foreign state , ' or to relinquish ' its traditional attitude toward purely American questions . ' ''

		The three topics of expatriation , international arbitration , and territorial expansion are taken up in order and traced rapidly through the whole course of our national history .

		And finally there is the closing chapter on '' Influence and Conditions , '' in many ways the most valuable in the book .

		Here Professor
Moore	PERSON	attempts an estimate -LRB- which he would be the first to recog - nize as only partial -RRB- of American diplomacy in respect to its influence upon civilization at large and particularly upon the methods and condi - tions of intercourse among states .

		He finds that this influence has been at least three-fold .

		In the first place , the diplomacy of the
United States	LOCATION	has fostered political , commercial , and maritime liberty ; in the second place , it has emphasized the principle of legality in the con - duct of international affairs ; and lastly , it has promidgated ideals of honesty , good-faith , sim - plicity , and directness which foreign offices and diplomats have always been much too prone to ignore .

		To the general assertion with which the volume closes , to the effect that American diplomacy has been identified with the cause of freedom and justice , many individual exceptions might easily be taken ; yet that it is true in all essential respects no one at all acquainted with the subject woxdd undertake to deny .

		Professor
Moore	PERSON	's task in this book has been to search out the things which the
United States	LOCATION	has stood for in the realm of international poli - tics and to make an exposition of them in the light of briefly enumerated facts .

		This under - t ^ dng he has accomplished with signal success .

		One may question his assignments of space or of historical importance to one topic or another , or his judgments of men and events , though to the reviewer these seem on the whole to be admir - able ; but there are practically no misstatements of fact , and of affirmations of opinions which do not grow out of the most careful thought there are none at aU .

		192 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, JAPANESE Architecture and Allied Arts .

		* The reader who takes up Mr.
Ralph Adams	PERSON	Cram 's '' Impressions of Japanese Architecture and the Allied Arts '' is likely to lay it down again with a sigh of regret that there is not more of it , albeit thick j ^ aper , wide margins , and the sixty f lUl-page illustrations swell its propor - tions to a good-sized voliune .

		Four of the ten chapters were written for architectural period - icals ; one is a paper that was read before the
Boston Society of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Crafts .

		Necessarily , they deal chiefly with generalities , and there is some repetition , or rather reiteration , of the same ideas .

		This reiteration does not , however , de - tract from the charm of the book , and the ideas thus reinforced are sound and are cogently expressed .

		It is evident that Mr.
Cram	PERSON	has studied his subject with painstaking care , keeping the larger relations ever in mind ; and the essays that make up this volume are thoughtful and discriminating .

		He tells us that we must consider the art of Old
Japan	LOCATION	, and particidarly the religious architecture , as the Aasible expres - sion of the ancient civilization of
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, which from the seventh to the twelfth centuries was the highest civilization then exist - ing in the world .

		But , as he says , -- '' From the standpoint of the casual traveller , even of the architect , Japanese architecture is at first abso - lutely baffling ; it is like Japanese music , so utterly for - eign , so radically different in its genesis , so aloof in its moods and motives from the standards of the
West	LOCATION	, that for a long time it is a wonder merely , a curiosity , a toy perhaps , or a sport of nature , not a serious product of the human mind , a priceless contribution to the history of the world .

		Partly by inheritance , partly by educa - tion , we have been qualified for thinking in one way , and in one way only .

		From
Athens	LOCATION	through
Rome	LOCATION	,
Byzantium	LOCATION	, the
Auvergne	LOCATION	,
Normandy	LOCATION	, the He de
France	LOCATION	, to
Yorkshire	LOCATION	and
Somerset	LOCATION	, there is running an easily traceable thread of unbroken continuity of architectural tradition ; but from
Athens	LOCATION	tlirough
Ionia	LOCATION	,
Persia	LOCATION	,
Hin	PERSON	- dustan ,
China	LOCATION	, and
Korea	LOCATION	, to
Japan	LOCATION	, while the line is equally continuous , it is through lands aloof and barred , and by ways that are blind and bewildering .

		We can think forward in the terms of the
West	LOCATION	, we can hardly think backward in the terms of the mysterious East .

		Yet when the revolution is accomplished and the rebel - lious mind is bent to the unfamiliar course , this strange architecture comes to show itself in its true light .

		It is more nearly Greek than any other , for it is the perfect - ing of a single , simple , and primitive mass by almost infinite refinements of line and proportion . ''

		This is a significant utterance , not only from the novelty of the view put forth , -- no other author having ventured an appreciation of Jap - * Impressions op Japanese Architecture and the Alued Arts .

		By
Ralph Adams	PERSON	Cram .

		anese architecture at its true worth , -- but be - cause it is the view that must prevail when that architecture is more widely studied .

		StUl , as the
Philistine	LOCATION	in matters of art is not easily turned from his traditional notions , Mr.
Cram	PERSON	's conten - tion would be more convincing were more of the details filled in .

		These , let it be hoped , will some day be forthcoming .

		Meanwhile , there is reason to be grateful for a competent and illum - inating summary of the historical development of the art , and some account of the more impor - tant buildings that have been preserved from ancient times .

		All of the book is not given over to architec - ture .

		The chapter on `` The Genius of
Japan	LOCATION	- ese Art '' is a clear and forcible presentation of fundamental truths ; the '' Note on Japanese Sculpture '' affords an excellent introduction to a much neglected subject ; and very charming is the chapter on '' Temple Grardens . ''

		In speak - ing of `` The Minor Arts '' there are lapses here and there into such extravagant phrase as '' that from the very first whatever had been made by any workman had been beautiful . ''

		Would it were so !

		Strict regard for truth , however , com - pels the admission that not all Japanese work - men are artists .

		With little that Mr.
Cram	PERSON	says is there occasion to quarrel .

		His spelling of `` kakimono '' -LRB- whatever that may mean -RRB- instead of '' kakemono '' will not pass muster .

		The color print by
Yeizan	PERSON	, not `` of Yeizan '' as he puts it , is well characterized as `` not a masterpiece . ''

		But when he asserts that '' it says as much , per - haps all we can ever understand , of the pictorial art of
Japan	LOCATION	, '' the statement may be challenged squarely .

		The qualities he proceeds to comment upon are for the most part wanting in the print he takes as a text , and of which a half-tone re - production is given .

		The other illustrations are from photographs , selected with excellent judg - ment , but they might have been better reproduced and printed .

		The Greatest of French Dramatists .

		* So little has been written in English about Moliere that admirers of le grand comique , as Frenchmen call their genius of comedy , will hail Mr.
Henry M. TroUope	PERSON	's biography as a commendable attempt to add a necessary work to a meagre literature .

		To quote Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's article in the
Encyclopaedia Britannica	LOCATION	on this great Frenchman , '' The English biog - * The Life op Moliere .

		By

1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		193 raphies of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	are few and as a rule abso - lutely untrustworthy . ''

		Considering that in the literature of the modem drama Moliere stands , after
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in the foremost place , and that in the literature of
France	LOCATION	his is the greatest name , this dearth of English works about him becomes indeed remarkable .

		No point need be raised as to the timeliness of Mr.
TroUope	PERSON	's book .

		The questions for con - sideration are its accuracy , construction , and charm .

		In the case of the first of these qual - ities only praise may be given .

		The author has examined all French authorities , both orig - inal and commentative , so thoroughly that the most captious critic woidd find it difficidt to gainsay his knowledge of the topic upon which he writes .

		The earlier jjeriod of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's life is veiled , to a great extent , in mystery ; yet it is a matter of small moment whether he left
Paris	LOCATION	with a band of strolling players in the autumn of
1645	DATE	or the
spring of 1646	DATE	; or just when he joined forces with a provincial actor named
Dufresne	PERSON	.

		The points of human interest are that
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, the son of a weU-to-do upholsterer to the king , preferred the stage to a shop-ridden life , and that after failure in
Paris	LOCATION	as an actor and im - prisonment for debt he had the courage , upon his release from gaol , to flee to the provinces and f oUow the calling of a strolling player for thirteen years rather than return to his father 's shop .

		Nor does it matter whether '' L'Etourdi '' was first produced at
Lyons	PERSON	in
1653	DATE	or
1655	DATE	.

		The fact which interests posterity is that an itinerant actor , who had previously written only rough canevas -- or frameworks of plays -- sud - denly turned his pen to verse and wrote a five - act comedy that electrified a
Lyons	PERSON	audience and acclaimed the birth of a new kin g. O The one contested point in
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's life of prime importance to biographers is the parent - age of his wife ,
Armande Bejart	PERSON	.

		Though pre - sented , in her marriage certificate and various other docimients of the period , as the legitimate daughter of
Joseph Bejart	PERSON	and
Marie Herve	PERSON	, still the calumnies heaped upon Moliere by jeal - ous rivals have made the majority of his biog - raphers persist in believing his wife to be the illegitimate daughter of
Madeleine Bejart	PERSON	, an actress whom he loved in his youth .

		Volumes have been written upon this subject , and the end is not yet .

		To Mr.
TroUope	PERSON	's credit , be it said , he takes a judicial view of the case , adjudg - ing
Armande Bejart	PERSON	, in accordance with xmre - futed documentary evidence , to be legitimate .

		Possibly their national jurisprudence has led so many Frenchmen to believe the charges brought against her legitimacy ; according to French law she is guilty because not proved innocent , whereas an Anglo-Saxon judge would dismiss the charge against her because of insufficient testimony .

		Throughout his book Mr.
Trollope	PERSON	shows painstaking and accurate scholarship .

		M.
Paul Lacroix	PERSON	's '' Bibliographic Molieresque '' con - tains perhaps a himdred and fifty titles of books and articles relating to
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's life or the his - tory of his troupe ; yet La Grange ,
Vinot	LOCATION	,
Gri	PERSON	- marest ,
Bruzen de la Martiniere	ORGANIZATION	, Tallemant des Reaux , De
Vize	PERSON	,
Loret	LOCATION	,
Boulanger	PERSON	de Chalussay ,
Brossette	PERSON	, and the anonymous author of a pam - phlet entitled '' La Fameuse Comedienne '' are the authors from whom all modem biographers have drawn their material .

		When a few his - torical sidelights , such as Chappuzeau and the
Brothers Parfaict	ORGANIZATION	, are added , together with the documentary discoveries of
Beffara	LOCATION	,
Jal	ORGANIZATION	, and
Soulie	PERSON	, a fairly complete repository of knowl - edge upon the subject has been catalogued .

		The work of these and many lesser authorities Mr.
Trollope	PERSON	has thoroughly digested .

		Although there have been many modem bio - graphers of Moliere since
Taschereau	PERSON	, the first of them , Mr.
TroUope	PERSON	is justified in selecting MM .

		Despois and Mesnard as his literary guides .

		Having their superb definitive edition of Moli - ere 's works at hand , and the numbers of the Molieriste magazine , so ably edited by the dis - tinguished archivist of the Theatre Fran ^ ais ,
M. Georges Monval	PERSON	, he need look no further for accuracy of information .

		It is not hyper-praise to say that he alone , of aU English-speaking writers upon
Moliere	PERSON	, has thoroughly mastered his subject ; yet one is compelled to qualify this approval by adding that he has presented his knowledge in a manner far from commendable as regards construction and charm .

		In considering the matter of construction , it should be borne in mind that Mr.
TroUope	PERSON	's book is intended for English readers ; therefore , an intimate knowledge of French should not be required , else it may be asked why the book exists at aU ?

		A reader able to comprehend the many French extracts , in both verse and prose , which adorn its pages must be sufficiently versed in the language of Moliere to consult French biographies , far more charmingly and quite as accurately written as Mr.
TroUope	PERSON	's bulky work .

		It is admittedly difficult to translate French verse into English , yet even an abortive attempt would have given the general reader a clearer idea of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's diction than Mr.
TroUope	PERSON	has done by 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, confronting him with Alexandrine strophes in a foreign language , the meaning of which it is necessary to understand in order to grasp the author 's comments .

		In the arrangement of his material Mr.
Trol	PERSON	- lope shows a decided lack of orderliness .

		Being thoroughly imbued with his subject-matter , he continually presupposes a like knowledge on the reader 's part .

		Particularly is this true of Chapter VIII. , devoted to
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's ideas of comedy and a comparison between
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	.

		Heretofore , the reader has been made acquainted with but four of the poet 's plays ; yet Mr.
Trol	PERSON	- lope proceeds to discuss technically the poet 's methods of work throughout the entire range of his thirty-four comedies .

		This chapter , with the single exception of the introductory view of French comedy before
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	, by far the most thoughtful in the book , should have been placed in conclusion .

		Its resume of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's work is not mtelligible to one unfamiliar with his plays ; its discussion of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	is out of place at the moment , if not altogether so , on the principle that comparisons are likely to prove odious .

		Certainly there are many critics willing to cede Shakespeare the foremost place in the drama who will stoutly contest Mr.
Trollope	PERSON	's assertion that he is the Frenchman 's superior in comedy .

		In viewing the construction of Mr.
Trollope	PERSON	's book one is reminded of a dingy attic heaped with a pile of dusty books upon an admira - ble subject .

		A scholar with the time and in - clination to ferret out knowledge wiU find it there , but the general reader will prefer a corner in a cosy library beside a shelf of weU-selected volumes .

		In other words , a book less volumi - nous , but more entertaining , than Mr.
Trollope	PERSON	's would find a much wider field .

		In charm , as
weU	ORGANIZATION	as in construction , this biography leaves much to be desired .

		Moliere 's early struggles , his wanderings as a stroUing player , his triumph at court and strange inti - macy with
Louis XIV.	PERSON	, the assaults of his ene - mies , the heartlessness of his wife , his friendship with such men as BoUeau and
La Fontaine	PERSON	, his tragic death and burial , make his life-story one of strong human interest , demanding skiU as a word painter in the telling .

		This is a quality in which Mr.
TroUope	PERSON	is singularly deficient .

		His style is so cumbersome , his language so ver - bose , that he wearies when he should charm .

		Take , for instance , this extract in which he en - deavors to describe the character of the people
Madame de RambouiUet	ORGANIZATION	invited to the assem - blies in her famous Blue Room : '' Ladies must be known to the hostess , or known well by her intimate friends , and they must be of good birth , before the invitation would be given .

		If a gentleman had pleasant maimers and could talk well , and espe - cially if he was in any way distinguished , he might gain admittance inside her doors . ''

		Aside from its archaism , this description , like many others in Mr.
TroUope	PERSON	's book , is tauto - logical .

		All he has told us in these fifty-three words might have been expressed far more clearly in sixteen by saying : `` The hostess in - vited only well-born women ; men were admitted within her doors by cleverness or charm . ''

		In speaking of comedy the author argues that '' a sort of magnetic influence is at work , carry - ing with it delight or boredom , and the infection is caught . ''

		The same is true of other forms of literature ; for the magnetic influence in both in - stances is artistic ability .

		Mr.
Trollope	PERSON	's erudi - tion is praiseworthy to a degree ; yet his manner of imparting it is ponderous .

Late Wak	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The tendencies of advancing civilization are all against the settlement of international ques - tions by force of arms .

		The energies of humanity are now for peace rather than for war .

		Never - theless , a conflict at arms will always have fasci - nation for the intellect of man , because the play of forces is so great , the theatre so vast , the human interest so compelling , and the influences so far-reaching , that , despite those aspects from which humanity would avert its gaze , the trained mind will love to dweU upon the elements in the problem and long to foretell the outcome .

		Every man is more or less of a prophet , and those out - side the game are even more eager to foretell the outcome than the players themselves .

		When diplomacy dropped its pen , in
Febru	LOCATION	- ary ,
1904	DATE	, and war imsheathed the sword , it was positively comical to listen to the vaticinations of so-called experts at
Washington	LOCATION	,
Berlin	LOCATION	, and
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Mighty generals and admirals , versed in the dogmatics of
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	ballistics and har - dened in the orthodoxy of their schools , forthwith proceeded to tell exactly what would happen .

		The old story of believing in things because they were big , was repeated .

		It was the usual routine of ready-made philosophy without a knowledge of new facts , and of prediction without any basis of history .

		Yet , all the way through , it was a game of the unknown .

		THE DIAL , 195 made much .

		It was supposed that our knowl - edge of Czartlom was tolerably complete ; but with the whole body of
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	conceit and ignorance of
Oriental Asia	LOCATION	set rock-fast in the ideas of '' white-manism , '' it was an article of faith that
Japan	LOCATION	must be defeated in spite of some initial successes .

		Nevertheless , those of the noble five thousand who between
1868	DATE	and
1900	DATE	, in the early days of
Japan	LOCATION	's awakening , had served as schoolmasters , technicists , or instruc - tors in any line of
Japan	LOCATION	's multifarious activities , had no fears .

		They did not '' prophesy '' very much ; they did not '' predict '' ; they simply told what they saw .

		They knew what
Meckel	PERSON	and
Douglas	PERSON	had taught
Oyama	LOCATION	and
Togo	LOCATION	.

		They knew , too , that it was not '' yesterday '' when the Japanese began to leam .

		They recalled that the Dutch at
Deshima	LOCATION	, from
1630	DATE	to
1868	DATE	, had fer - tilized the Japanese intellect during all the time of her so-called seclusion , and that long before
Perry	PERSON	had come to
Japan	LOCATION	there were awakened spirits and alert reformers .

		These from
1868	DATE	have controlled the palace and the mind of the god that dwells therein .

		The seeing ones knew also that however diligent or brilliant were the teachers , the pupils were even more so .

		They felt , moreover , that the Japanese realized that this was a fight for food , for growth , for life .

		They were persuaded also that the spirit of the Samurai and '' the virtues of the Emperor '' had , after thirty-five years of public-school training , been transfused into the common people .

		So , with the military system that was German in its thoroughness and
Yamato	LOCATION	in its spirit , the Ja - panese , after fifty years of historic propaedeutic and ten years of special preparation , rushed with eagerness to the fray .

		No
David	PERSON	ever went more assuredly to victory than the Japanese .

		Nevertheless , however much or in whomsoever or whatsoever they trusted , they kept their Shi - mose powder dry .

		Now we have a critical estimate of the detailed operations of the war , written by the capable military correspondent of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times . ''

		Let no one buy this book thinking that he is going to get a consecutive narrative , or a picto - rial presentation of the various conflicts .

		No ; this book is magnificent , but it is hot a story .

		Let us look at it outwardly , and then appraise its inward contents .

		Take it for what some may think it to be , and it wiU yield disappointment and even wrath .

		Head it for what it purports to express and actually is , and it will be foimd to have hardly a peer in its class of literature , and probably will have no equal or successor for many years .

		Through some 700 pages , with a few illustra ^ tations of the leading promoters of or actors in the great drama , and what is virtually a complete portfolio of maps and plans up to the
Mukden	LOCATION	operations , with a diary of the war , an order of battle of the Russian forces , with only a paragraph on the Japanese system , a conspec - tus of the fleets in
February	DATE	and in
May of 1905	DATE	, and a capital index , we have chiefly crticism , criticism , criticism .

		Day by day as the correspondent saw the situation , as repre - sented by one railroad , two fleets , two armies , so many sabres , bayonets , and guns , with a knowl - edge of the power of both the Russian and the Japanese stomach to consume rations and of the ability of hosts of war-locusts to devastate the land , we have pictures in words and diagrams of what is more like a game of chess than a series of events and episodes .

		Here is an array of mathematical units rather than of human beings .

		There is no blood on these pages ; one hears no cry of the wounded , and looks into no ghastly battle-trenches .

		We find rather a cold-blooded and for the most part accurate account of collisions of opposing forces .

		He who wishes to leam the science of modem war must read this book .

		One word tells the story , -- training .

		One word dominates the situ - ation , -- science .

		One word links initiative with consummation in the chain of success , -- art .

		The Japanese have never let up for an instant during the past decade .

		They wrested the secrets of power from the West , a whole generation ago , and then with a faculty for adaptation amounting to genius they made the art , which comes from a mastered science and as expressed in training , tell at every point .

		Continuous victories , a hun - dred thousand prisoners against two thousand , the conquest of disease and wounds in the hos - pital even more than supremacy over the enemy in battle , and , grandest of all , seK-conquest at the treaty council , all show the superiority of the Japanese .

		It is needless to go into the details of this book .

		The author dwells on the outlook for either side when the war broke out , and outlines all the movements until his fiftieth chapter winds up the long dithyramb -LRB- we call it so , for aU glory is ascribed to the
Mikado	LOCATION	-RRB- of continuous success with the appropriate ''
Nunc Dimittis	PERSON	. ''

		Just how the Russian camel could not get through the eye of the Siberian needle is the negative proposition herein fxdly explained .

		But lest the reader might think the '' Times '' critic has no descriptive power , let us quote from the author 's view of the blue - water battle of mid -
August	DATE	: 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, '' When at last the giants -LSB- the battleships -RSB- came out and gave battle , the other classes of warships resumed at once the very secondary place which they legitimately hold in fleet action .

		The Russian cruisers fled and scat - tered .

		... It was superior gunnery and rapid accurate fire that decided the day .

		Those three twelve-inch shells that struck the Tsarevitch , within a few minutes of each other , wrecked the Russian line of battle .

		The flag-ship was no longer under control , and , worse of all , the death of Admiral
Vithoft	PERSON	deprived the line of guidance .

		The supremacy of the gun , and of the heaviest gun most of all , becomes overwhelmingly manifest . ''

		No notice of this book would be just that leaves out high praise of the forty maps and battle plans by Mr.
Percy Fisher	PERSON	.

		While critical knowledge of the country traversed and fought over will illuminate the masses of red and blue which seem to move over the brown spaces rep - resenting hills and the white representing plains , with the black threads standing for rivers , yet these diagrams are superb from the point of view of one who knows the difficulty of making a good battle-plan .

		The maps are all that could be desired .

		For its special purpose , this book is of unique value .

		* Under the title `` The Greek View of Life '' Mr.
G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	has put forth a sym - pathetic interpretation for which he deserves the thanks of all readers who believe in the desira - bility of an historical basis for the pursuit of the things that are more excellent . ''

		The following pages are intended to serve as a general introduc - tion to Greek literature and thought , for those primarily who do not know Greek '' is the open - ing of a modest preface to a well-balanced and well - written book from the hands of a competent author .

		It is true that Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	is an avowed philhellene , who believes that Greek cul - ture '' is still , as it has been in the past , the most valuable element of a liberal education , '' and has been both acclaimed and derided as an apos - tle of the neo-Paganism about which we have heard so much of late .

		It is to him that Mr.
Gilbert Chesterton	PERSON	devotes his essay on '' Pagan - ism '' -- perhaps the most meteoric flight of brilliant pertness in the `` Heretics '' volume , -- speaking of him as '' the most pregnant and provocative of recent writers on this and similar subjects , '' and arraigning him as the mislead - ing advocate of a return to a misunderstood • The Gbeek View of Life .

		Paganism .

		In the present work , however , Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	must appear to a fair critic not as a partisan but as a sane and able interpreter with a pardonable dash of enthusiasm .

		The book has five chapters , -- -LRB- I. -RRB- The Greek View of Keligion , -LRB- H. -RRB- The Greek View of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, -LRB- III . -RRB-

		The Greek View of the Individual , -LRB- IV . -RRB-

		The Greek View of Art , -LRB- V. -RRB-
Conclu	LOCATION	- sion .

		Each chapter has its divisions carefully planned and succinctly treated , and concludes with a usefid summary .

		In this way the author touches most topics of importance .

		But one omission is immediately noticed and regretted : there is no adequate or consecutive presentation of the Greek love of knowledge .

		This formed the subject of the third , I think , of Dr.
Butcher	PERSON	's recent
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	lectures ; and readers of The Dial wiU recaU also Mr.
Percy F. BickneU	PERSON	's article on `` The Greek Love of Detail '' -LRB-
Oct.	DATE	.

		16 ,
1905	DATE	-RRB- .

		`` The Greeks are ever children , '' said
Herodotus	PERSON	, -- anticipating Dr.
Stanley Hall	PERSON	's declaration that the Greeks represent the `` eternally adolescent , '' but wording it rather better , -- and they went about with the open eyes of bright children questioning everything and everybody merely for the sake of knowing ; and many of their questions are still on our lips .

		However , Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	doubtless felt the limi - tations of space , and on the whole has used his two hundred and thirty-three pages admirably .

		The world to which the author invites our attention is the `` old , untroubled , pagan world of beauty , '' and herein he manifests the same spirit with which he pleaded so winningly for the substance against the shadow in his remarkable '' Letters of a Chinese Official , '' who , by the way , has many strange points of resemblance to an Athenian gentleman .

		In this world , if we may trust our interpreter , harmony was the truth of all existence ; the claims of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, of art , of religion , and of the individual with his human cravings , claims which clash and clang in such disheartening discord to-day , were more nearly harmonized in ancient
Greece	LOCATION	than in the history of any other land .

		That the harmony was in - complete even in that golden age our author is too intelligent to deny and too honest to dis - semble .

		One finds now and then a Greek coin on which a glorious obverse is joined to an un - sightly reverse , and Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	in displaying the latter exhibits an honesty that wins at once our respect and our confidence .

		In the sec - tions , for instance , dealing with the Greek view of woman he does not blink the fact that the attitude of the Periclean or the Demosthenic age is strikingly suggestive of
Japan	LOCATION	in its less at -
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 197 tractive phases .

		Again , in the paragraphs on the Greek view of the
State	ORGANIZATION	his devotion to his land of charm does not prevent him from giv - ing an adequate treatment of the faction and anarchy so rampant in Greek politics .

		Orange and
Green	ORGANIZATION	in
Ireland	LOCATION	's most pugnacious days were doves of peace compared to Democrat and Aristocrat in many cities of
Greece	LOCATION	.

		What
Athens	LOCATION	represents to him is sho ^ vn by this sen - tence : '' All the beauty , all the grace , all the joy of
Greece	LOCATION	; all that chains the desire of man - kind , with a yearning that is never stilled , to that one golden moment in the past , whose fair and balanced interplay of perfect flesh and sold no later gains of thought can compensate , centres about that bright and stately city of romance , the home of Pericles and all the arts , whence from generation to generation has streamed upon ages less illustrious an influence at once the sanest and the most inspired of all that have shaped the secular history of the world . ''

		And yet in the same section he teUs us that '' this democracy dissolved into an an - archy of individuals , drawn deeper and deeper , in pursuit of mean and egotistic ends , into po - litical fraud and commercial chicanery . ''

		Hon - esty of presentation could go no further .

		The sentence quoted above in laudation of
Athens	LOCATION	will serve as an illustration of the '' par - donable dash of enthusiasm '' in our author .

		Only once or twice does this enthusiasm draw near the borderland of extravagance ; but even the warmest admirer of Greek plastic art will read the following passage slowly before yielding his approval : '' Their mere household crockery , their common pots and pans , are cast in shapes so exquisitely graceful , and painted in designs so atlmirably drawn and composed , that any one of them has a higher artistic value than the whole contents of the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	; and the little clay figures they used as we do china ornaments put to shame the most ambitious efforts of mod - em sculpture .

		Who , for example , would not rather look at a Tanagra statuette than at the equestrian statue of the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	? ''

		But after all , has not
William Morris	PERSON	stood champion for the lesser crafts , for the beauty of the web , the cup , or the knife , telling us how all the arts hang together , and summoning us to f oUow the goddess to the kitchen as well as to the art gallery ?

		That the Greeks '' were artists through and through , quite apart from any the - ories they may have held , '' we are not allowed to forget at any point in the chapter on Art , in which the sections dealing with the Greek iden - tification of the aesthetic and ethical points of view and with music and the dance will be f oimd particularly fruitful for the reader not thoroughly at home in Greek life and thought .

		It is really difficult to take leave of our Cam - bridge essayist , and one would like to speak of many things , -- of his style , for instance , now and then deepening to the genuine Tyrian hue , but never patchy ; of his quiet literary appreci - ation ; of his little touch of rather lovable pes - simism as he dwells on his theme with the thought that `` no perfection of life delivers from death '' ; of his realization that the Greek view of death and a future life breathes but little consolation . ''

		The fear of age and death is the shadow of the love of life ; and on no peo - ple has it fallen with more horror than on the Greeks .

		The tenderest of their songs of love close with a sob , and it is an autumn wind that rustles in their bowers of
spring	DATE	. ''

		These and many other topics insist on presenting them - selves ; but they must be left for the many readers that this excellent book deserves to find . ''

		The Greek View of Life '' ought to stimidate a real interest in a period that invariably fasci - nates our eyes if we we will turn them but once to '' the fairest and happiest halting-place in the secular march of men . ''

		The material book presents a pleasing appear - ance , and is of convenient size .

		The printed page is legible , and there is comparative freedom from typographical slips , although on page 122 the substitution of as for at is very irritating , particularly in a third edition .

		In these days of '' eye-mindedness `` and the constant purveying thereto , Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	and his publishers are to be commended for resisting the temptation to improve his little work with illustrations .

		It must seem strange to the general Auitraiiaand reader to find volumes on
Australia the Philippines	LOCATION	, ^ jj ^ t ^ g
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	included in the `` Asiatic Neighbors '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , even though the native stock of
the Philippines	LOCATION	is Ma - layan , the typical brown man of the Asiatic seas and their confines .


Australia	LOCATION	has been an English colony since
1788	DATE	, and
the Philippines	LOCATION	were Spanish colo - nial possessions for more than three centimes before becoming subject to American influence .

		Both have been more closely related to
Europe	LOCATION	than to
Asia	LOCATION	, though nearer to Asiatic than to European coasts .

		However , one ought not to be captious about the series in which such admirable books as the present ones are included .

		In `` Australian Life in Town and Coimtry , '' Mr.
E. C. Buley	PERSON	, an Australian by 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, birth as well as by other ties , exhibits
Australia	LOCATION	as a continent , not only in the extent of its territory -LRB- three million square miles > , but in comprising a number of states , with a goodly amount of mutual jealousy , though united under a Federal Constitution ; having several important cities , though its entire population is little more than half that of the city of
London	LOCATION	; maintaining relations with
England	LOCATION	somewhat re - moved from the conventional love for `` the dear old Mother Country '' ; and having some aspirations after national life , fostered by the `` Australian Natives ' Association . ''

		He does not recognize Botany Bay or the penal settlement as having influenced the life and development of the continent .

		A convict settlement was no part of the plan of the early advocates of colo - nization in
Australia	LOCATION	, though the 26th of
January	DATE	, the date when Captain
Phillip	PERSON	landed , in
1788	DATE	, at
Port Jackson	LOCATION	with the first load of convicts , is now annually observed by Australians as '' Anniversary Day . ''

		The real development of
Australia	LOCATION	began with Captain
John MacArthur	PERSON	, who , with sure in - stinct in agricultural and pastoral matters , seems to have grasped the possibilities of the Australian con - tinent immediately upon his arrival .

		The pastoral industry which he introduced led to exploration and the development of various branches of agriculture .

		Gold was discovered in
1851	DATE	; but the greatest factor in the development of the resources of the country was the experiment in the ocean carriage of perish - able produce , by which in one year
Australia	LOCATION	sold one hundred millions worth of produce in excess of her purchases .

		The book deals most entertainingly with Australian life , and is well illustrated .

		-- Mr.
James A. Le Roy	PERSON	's '' Philippine Life in Town and Country '' differs in style from the other volumes of the series , and has many advantages over the vast number of books upon the
Philippines	LOCATION	which have appeared in the English language since
1898	DATE	.

		It was found impossible for the author to divide the life of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, as he has seen it , into urban and rural .

		Mr.
Le Roy	PERSON	is qualified to write of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, both by a previous experience with the Spanish Americans , and by virtue of his connection with the
United States Philippine Commission	ORGANIZATION	dwc - ing the establishment of civil government in the islands .

		Yet he writes with no intention of main - taining any particular theory , or of supporting any policy with regard to the '' Philippine question '' which enters so largely into the politics of our country to - day .

		In his pictures of the life of the '' Filipinos '' -LRB- whom he defines as the Christianized inhabitants of the islands as distinct from the Moros or
Moham	PERSON	- medan Malays of the southern regions -RRB- , he quotes largely from the novels of
Jos ^ Rizal	PERSON	, a native lit ^ terateur and political martyr .

		Some entirely new photographs of scenes in the islands illustrate the volume .

		Mecordsofa ^ he goodly size of Mr.
Edmund	PERSON	naturalist in Selous 's volume called '' The Bird the
Shetland	LOCATION	, .

		Watcher in the
Shetlands	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is a temptation to the uninitiated to ask what there is in that barren region to write so much about .

		But whoever gives himself the pleasure of letting Mr.
Selous	PERSON	tell him will straightway be ashamed of his skepticism .

		In the first place the author is convinc - ingly in love with his subject -- even with those `` desolate and wind-swept isles '' where
November	DATE	comes in
August	DATE	, and the sea never sleeps . ''

		Would God my home were here , '' he exclaims , `` that I might make a life-long and continuous study of the wild sea-bird life about me ! ''

		-- and he adds , '' Oh , is there anything in life more piquant -LRB- if you care about it -RRB- than to lie on the summit of a beetling cliff , and watch the breeding sea-fowl on the ledges below ! ''

		Contagious as this enthusiasm is , however , it is the excellence of his watching that gives the greatest value to his book .

		Mr.
Selous	PERSON	believes with
Darwin	PERSON	that '' every creature is ready to alter his habits , as the opportunity arises , and the greater number of them are , in some way or another , always in process of doing so . ''

		Consequently his observations , always patient , loving , and interesting , often have a further point in recording variations from accepted for - mulae .

		Many of these discoveries seem insignificant ; others , it is more than likely , may lead the way to important results .

		In any event , the definiteness of the records is delightful .

		The coloring of the Arctic skua , fifteen variations of which are carefully dis - tinguished ; the cuddling of the guillemot chick under its mother 's wing ; the flight of the fulmar petrel which `` suggests a soul , '' while other birds are only bodies ; the sporting of a young seal with a spar of wood -LRB- for the sub-title of the book promises `` some notes on seals '' -RRB- ; and the manners of `` Falstaff , '' the big seal who '' expatiates '' luxuriously upon his rock '' with such great yawns , such stretchings , heavings , and throwings back of the head , with supple curv - ings of the neck ! ''

		-- all these and more are vivid enough to the reader to become an appreciable part of life .

		The fine scorn of civilization on which they are embossed adds further zest to them .

		`` To me , '' Mr.
Selous	PERSON	says , '' a live snake is much more interesting than a live man or woman . ''

		He clings to this preference good-naturedly , amusingly , until he speaks of the cruelty of men to animals ; then his scorn bites and stings . ''

		They conquer , these
Philistines	LOCATION	, and the finer-touched spirit lies bleeding and suffering beneath them .

		-- I say that the ' pale Galilean ' has not conquered here , but that Thor has , though often in his rival 's name . ''

		The only real fault of the book -- unless account is taken of some obvious inaccuracies of style -- lies in the illustra - tions , which are taken from drawings altogether too much '' made up , '' instead of from photographs , as any American is bound to think they should have been .

		The task of collating and editing the abundant materials existing for an adequate history of
Trinity Parish	ORGANIZATION	in the city of
New York	LOCATION	, undertaken by the Rev. Mor - gan Dix , S.T.D. , D.C.L. , ninth rector of said parish , bore its first fruit in
1898	DATE	, in a large and handsome volume setting forth the history of the parish from
1686	DATE	to the close of the rectorship of Dr.
Inglis	PERSON	in A famous Bishop and his work .

		THE DIAI .

		199
1783	DATE	.

		That volume was somewhat fully reviewed in these columns at the time of its publication , as the history of
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	during the period cov - ered was to a large extent the history of
New York City	LOCATION	and province , and of far wider than merely parochial interest .

		After an interval of three years , a second volume appeared , bringing the history down to the close of Dr.
Moore	PERSON	's rectorship in
1816	DATE	.

		This volume also received due notice in these columns .

		It was then supposed that a third volume would suf - fice to cover the rectorial terms of Dr.
Hobart	LOCATION	and Dr.
Berrian	PERSON	, the seventh and eighth rectors , and to conclude the labors of Dr Dix as editor .

		The third volume which now appears -LRB- Putnam -RRB- but partially fulfils the expectation of the completion of the history , principally because of the discovery of a large mass of letters containing so much of interest and of im - portance in the history of
Trinity Parish	ORGANIZATION	as to de - mand considerable attention .

		This volume is there - fore devoted to the rectorship of Dr.
Hobart	LOCATION	to the year
1830	DATE	; and a fourth volume will be required to treat of the rectorate of Dr.
Berrian	PERSON	.


John Henry Hobart	ORGANIZATION	was a man of great prominence in his day .

		He was a native of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, in which city he began his ministry .

		He was but a short time settled over churches in
New Brunswick	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, and
Hempstead	LOCATION	,
Long Island	LOCATION	, before he was elected an assistant rector in
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, in
1800	DATE	.

		He became Secretary of the Diocese of
New York	LOCATION	, and was some time Secretary of the
House of Deputies of the General Convention	ORGANIZATION	.

		When con - secrated Assistant Bishop of
New York	LOCATION	in
1811	DATE	.

		there were but six bishops of the
Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	.

		In
1816	DATE	, by the death of
Bishop Moore	PERSON	, he became Bishop of the Diocese , and the same year was elected rector of
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		His relations to
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	by no means restricted the sphere of his influence .

		He was temporarily in charge of the Dioceses of
Connecticut	LOCATION	and
New Jersey	LOCATION	, and had the general oversight of the church in the
West	LOCATION	-
ern Reserve	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was influential in the establish - ment of the
General Theological Seminary of Geneva	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- now
Hobart	LOCATION	-RRB- College , and of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	press in this country .

		He carried the gospel to the
Oneida Indians	LOCATION	, and awakened the Church to the needs of missionary efforts in what was then con - sidered the far West .

		He was a man of strong convictions , and the phrases `` the Gospel in the Church '' and * ' Evangelical Truth and Apostolic Order '' are associated with his name .

		He was some - what of a controversialist , and one of his opponents in a once famous controversy was so impressed with his ability that he declared , '' Were I compelled to entrust the safety of my country to any one man , that man should be
John Henry Hobart	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The editor of the history of
Trinity Parish	ORGANIZATION	has wisely embraced the opportunity afforded by the connection of such a man with that important parish , to publish a careful selection from the more than three thou - sand letters known as the ''
Hobart	LOCATION	Correspondence . ''

		So far from this giving to the present volume the character of a personal memoir of the famous Bishop , it is a valuable contribution to the history of the Diocese of
New York	LOCATION	, of the
Protestant Episcopal Church	ORGANIZATION	, and of the times in which
Hobart	LOCATION	lived ; and it gives to the third volume of this series an inter - est like that of the first and second volumes , far wider than the limits of a parish , albeit the largest and most influential parish in the land .


Umbria	LOCATION	and iu ^ he past year has produced a remark - foremost figure , able number of books about the Saint FrancU .

		g ^ all but fascinating region of
Italy	LOCATION	known as
Umbria	LOCATION	, and about
Umbria	LOCATION	's foremost fig ^ e ,
St. Francis	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two late additions to the list are Miss
Emma G. Salter	PERSON	's '' Franciscan Legends in Italian Art '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , and Mr.
Edward Hutton	PERSON	's `` The Cities of
Umbria	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The distin - guishing feature of the former work is its very com - plete classified lists of everything in art connected with the life of
St. Francis	ORGANIZATION	, even those pictures and statues which , though not great as works of art , are yet extremely interesting to Franciscan students .

		Pictures of the saint began to be made as early as the
thirteenth century	DATE	, and are usually to be found in rather out-of-the-way places , such as
Greccio	LOCATION	,
Subiaco	LOCATION	,
Pescia	LOCATION	, etc. .

		Not the least valuable por - tions of Miss
Salter	PERSON	's book are the few pages of '' Practical Hints '' for the traveller , showing him how to reach these places .

		An opportunity is often missed by the traveller , even when close at hand , because of the lack of just such practical knowledge as this .

		Tradition says that the
Greccio	LOCATION	picture was painted from life for a friend ; but whether it was or not , the type of face of St.
Francis	PERSON	, his dress and symbols , make him one of the most easily recog - nizable figures in Italian art .

		As frontispiece to this volume , the author has selected
Raphael	PERSON	's repre - sentation from the left-hand corner of his famous
Madonna di Foligno	ORGANIZATION	in the
Vatican Gallery	ORGANIZATION	at
Rome	LOCATION	.

		-- Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	divides his book into three parts : '' Impressions of the Cities of
Umbria	LOCATION	, '' '' The Umbrian School of Painting , '' and ``
Umbria	LOCATION	Mystica . ''

		How thoroughly the author is under the speU that affects all who dwell long enough in
Umbria	LOCATION	, may be judged from such a passage as this , from the chapter on Spoleto : '' I came to her in an evil mood , hating my f eUow-men and especially the tourist ; I left her after a long time , refreshed and rested , at peace with all men , having understood her beauty and her joy .

		... Climb up to the great Roman aqueduct that spans the profound ravine which isolates
Spoleto	LOCATION	on her round hill , and at evening look across the val - leys to the hUls and the mountains ; that luminous softness , a delicacy so magical that you had thought only the genius of Raphael or Perugino could im - agine and express it , is just reality . ''

		In the division devoted to Umbrian painting , the author has well characterized its profound and delightful sentiment as distinguished from the intellectual travail of the Florentines or the magnificent acceptance of life of the Venetians .

		In ``
Umbria Mystica	LOCATION	, '' St.
Francis	PERSON	is of coiu ^ e the chief figure , though
Joachim di Flore	PERSON	,
St. Clare	LOCATION	,
Brother Bernard	ORGANIZATION	, and
Brother Elias	ORGANIZATION	are 200 THE DIAL -LSB-

America	LOCATION	.

		treated also .

		Sabatier 's monumental work on
St. Francis	ORGANIZATION	is criticized as showing limitations due to the fact that this biographer is a Frenchman and not a Catholic .

		Of the thirty-two illustrations in this volume , twenty are in color , and are of great beauty .

		Taking both matter and manner into consideration , Mr.
Button	PERSON	's book is perhaps the most exhaustive and attractive of the long list of Umbrian books of the past year .

		Refreshingly interesting is Professor
Charles Zueblin	PERSON	's little volume en - titled `` A Decade of Civic Develop - ment '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , consisting of nine essays reprinted from '' The Chautauquan , '' and in a way a supplement to the author 's '' American Municipal Progress '' published some years ago .

		In content the book is a record of civic development and progress in the
United States	LOCATION	during the past ten years , with suggestions for many new lines of improvement .

		The spirit of optimism pervades the entire work , and certainly the facts which Professor Zueblin marshals abundantly prove his thesis that American cities are rapidly becoming more attrac - tive and fit for the homes of the millions .

		The agencies which are contributing to the civic trans - formation are social settlements , university extension schemes , free lecture courses , municipal art societies , recreation schools , movements for the establishment of parks , playgrounds , and free libraries , and vari - ous municipal and private organizations .

		We are now entering upon a period of '' civic awakening , '' he says ; a new `` civic spirit '' is spreading as never before , and a new conception of public responsibility is taking possession of the minds of the people who dwell in cities .

		The duty of training the citizen for life in a democracy is also coming to be more generally appreciated , and as a result many semi - educational movements are now contributing to the development of higher civic ideals .

		With increasing prosperity have come leisure and culture , and these in turn have conduced to social and municipal re - form .

		Less attention is being given to political methods and machinery , and more to municipal improvements .

		The housing of the people , the adornment and beautification of the streets with monuments and fountains , the creation of archi - tectural unity , and the laying out of new parks are some of the problems to which the `` new spirit '' has given rise .

		Professor Zueblin 's account of the `` remaking '' of
Chicago	LOCATION	,
Harrisburg	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
Washington	LOCATION	is a record of municipal progress which no one can read without a sense of civic pride and a feeling of hope for the future .

		Deplorable as is the condition of many cities , says the author , the record of progress in the decade is a proud one , and compels the belief that the cities will be redeemed .

		`` It is said that a man must needs build three houses before he will have one to suit him , '' remarks Mr.
Charles Edward Hooper	PERSON	in the preface to his volume about `` The Cotmtry House '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	, Page & 27ie countrv house and how to build it .

		Co. -RRB- .

		The book is an attempt to save the would-be builder from such expensive and annoying prelim - inaries by giving him a clear idea both of the diffi - culties he should avoid and the beauties he may attain to .

		Mr.
Hooper	PERSON	begins by giving special advice about the choice of a site .

		General consider - ations governing the selection of the plan are next discussed , and there is a detailed account of the proper way of putting up a house under varying conditions , and of finishing it outside and in .

		Next Mr.
Hooper	PERSON	turns his attention to details , such as doors , windows , and fire-places .

		He has something to say about each room in the house , making endless suggestions for variety of treatment .

		Next he attacks the problems of heating , lighting , ventilation , and plumbing .

		A chapter on '' Water-Supply and Drainage '' discusses these important matters from a practical point of view , and also considers various artistic disguises for wells and wind-mills .

		Out - buildings , gate-ways , and the garden with its acces - sories are all duly considered .

		There are specimen contracts for the enlightenment of the inexperienced builder , and any details not previously disposed of are brought together in a final chapter entitled '' Hints . ''

		Prices and architects ' names are attached to most of the illustrations , thus adding to their practical value .

		JEsthetically , the illustrations are of course a decided feature .

		There are a great many of them , and the photographer , Mr.
E. E. Loderholtz	PERSON	, has shown skill in treating his subjects in such a way that the points of the text are always made clear without sacrificing the beauty of the pictures .

		To people who are not looking forward to building a country home , Mr.
Hooper	PERSON	's book will be interesting as showing what has been done in that direction in
America	LOCATION	; in the end it will probably inspire them with a great desire to carry out some of Mr.
Hooper	PERSON	's suggestions .

		Intending builders can not fail to profit by reading the book , -- except in one respect : it offers so many enticing hints for elaborating and beautifying the house and grounds in unusual ways that , though the house when built may exactly suit its owner , it will probably cost him a good deal more than it would before he realized the full possibilities of ''
The Country House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Observations of The bright talk of a witty and observ - an English .

		tj i - ji p husband 's ^ ^ ^ woman , gitted With a sense oi American wife , humor , is always worth listening to ; and even when it is addressed to the general public through the medium of print , it need lose little or none of its fine quality .

		Mrs.
John Lane	PERSON	's `` The Champagne Standard '' -LRB-
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- treats lightly and briskly of her domestic and society expe - riences upon removing , as she and her husband recently did , from
New York	LOCATION	to
London	LOCATION	.

		The ser - vant problem , domestic architectxu'e , the fight with
London	LOCATION	smoke and smut , the hide-bound conserva - tism of our English cousins , and various other topics suggested by her new surroundings , are handled in an entertaining and often amusing manner .

		The reader may perhaps wonder , on reading Mrs.
Lane	PERSON	's
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 201 Iliad of domestic woes , why this energetic
New England	LOCATION	woman -LRB- she appears to be Boston-bred -RRB- sub - mitted to such martyrdom at the hands of her bond - women .

		With a family of two only , why not assert one 's American independence , dismiss the retinue of supercilious and at the same time sycophantic serving - folk , and enjoy the dignity and freedom of one 's God - given self-sufficiency -- even at the risk of British stares and frowns ?

		The chain that fetters the slave at one end is bound to the master at the other .

		Oidy those worries fret us for which we have an affinity .

		Nothing but our own can come to us . -RSB-

		SIrs .

		Lane is worthy of better things than kitchen squabbles , as her pen has already proved .

		Of things one might criticize , if critically inclined , are Mrs.
Lane	PERSON	's asser - tion that '' the days have passed in
America	LOCATION	for the making of sudden and great fortunes , '' her calling the whale a fish , and speaking of '' a protoplasm '' as if it were a form of animal or vegetable life , her occasional use -LRB- despite her
Boston	LOCATION	training -RRB- of wiU for shall and of would for should , and her indulgence in such looseness of sentence-structure as this , -- '' It is , therefore , rather startling , as a blushing stranger , to see the loving couples that emerge out of the leafy paths of Kensington Glarden ... '' On the other hand , we must commend her freedom from
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- mania , and her censure of such follies of English conservatism as the insistence that no woman , how - ever old , shall be considered fully dressed unless she be entirely undressed as to neck and shoulders .

		With the passing of good Queen
Victoria	PERSON	, let this particular item of court usage , so dear to her other - wise compassionate heart , pass also , and let the shivering shoulders be clothed .

		When the great Italian scholar , Pro- IS ^ ZH ^ tgo . ''

		lessor
Ettore Pais	PERSON	, published his Roman History , about seven years ago , the world of classical scholarship experienced a profound and somewhat unpleasant sensation .

		The
Storia di Roma	ORGANIZATION	is primarily a criticism of the earlier sources ; and after the author has thoroughly sifted them , practically nothing remains .

		Every - thing handed down from the regal period , with most of what is credited to the first century of the repub - lic , is swept into the rubbish-heap of historic myth and legend .

		It is readily seen that a work of such a destructive character would encounter hostile criti - cism on every side .

		But the unsympathetic attitude of conservative scholars seems merely to have spurred the author on to a more detailed investigation of his subject ; and he now gives us what seems to be a reply to his critics , in a volume of about three hun - dred pages bearing the title , '' Ancient Legends of Roman History '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The vol - ume is mainly a collection of essays , '' special and minute demonstrations of subjects already succinctly treated '' in the author 's earlier work .

		As a rule , each chapter is devoted to the examination of some well-known tale , such as the story of Tarpeia or the legend of the
Horatii	LOCATION	.

		From a close and untiring study of the most diverse sources , -- myths , ancient colts , archaeological remains , etymological data , classical authors , and Roman topography , -- Profes - sor Pais has brought together a mass of materials of a most bewildering character , which he builds into an argument that seems almost irrefutable .

		It will be found , however , that in many instances he claims more weight for his evidence than his critics are likely to allow .

		Throughout the work , he nudn - tains his earlier negative position ; but he also tries to give his studies a positive value by attempting to explain how the myths originated , tracing a number of them back to Italian worship .

		`` Lucretia and
Virginia	LOCATION	, in origin two goddesses , became mere mortals ;
Vulcan	ORGANIZATION	was changed into the lame and one-eyed Horatius Codes ; ... the god Minucius was transformed into a tribxme of the people . ''

		Such conclusions are not likely to be accepted without dis - pute , although most who read them will agree that every chapter is the work of a master .

		The English version is by the author 's countryman ,
Mario E. Cosenza	PERSON	.

		While in the main satisfactory , it fre - quently lacks in point of clearness , the involved parenthetical structure of the sentences making it difficult at times to follow the author 's arg ^ ument .

		A book of • ^ ' ' ^ ^ ^ ' 1 ^ '
Symons	PERSON	's prose work is inuiginarv always strikingly individual .

		Indeed portrait * .

		g ^ little kinship has it with current modes that it is perhaps best described in critical slang as `` precious . ''

		His latest volume is called '' Spiritual Adventures '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , and is dedicated , not unfittingly , to Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	.

		In order to enjoy it , one must have a strong taste for analysis , for intricate psychological problems , for self-revelation so searching as to be decidedly foreign to the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	temper .

		The first sketch in the book , `` A Prelude to Life , '' is written in autobiographic form , and detaUs the experiences -- whether real or imagi - nary only Mr.
Symons	PERSON	can tell -- of the author 's childhood .

		Its uniqueness consists in its bald frank - ness , its utter freedom from reserve , its absolute lack of glamour .

		There is no rose-color in the recollec - tion .

		He remembers that he was indifferent to his father . ''

		He never interested me , '' he says coldly .

		His mother seems to have been his one friend , for he either despised or disliked his teachers and school - mates , and hated the `` commonplace , middle-class people '' among whom his family lived .

		He loved music passionately , and books ; but he discovered Humanity only aifter reading `` Lavengro , '' which sent him gypsying .

		Eventually he went to
London	LOCATION	and found there the strong sense of life that he had sought in vain before .

		He admits to being a vain , selfish , and idle child , and then he snaps the '' Pre - lude '' off short without giving the least hint of how the queer boy grew up to manhood .

		The next sketch lays bare the inner consciousness of a Jewish garment-worker who becomes a great actress .

		Others trace the spiritual experiences of a mad musician , of a realistic painter who found it necessary to live the sordid life of his models , of a minister beset by doubts of the gospel he taught , and of half a dozen 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, others .

		Most of the '' experiences '' are trag ^ ic ; all are thoroughly subjective and tantalizingly incom - plete .

		Indeed one wonders whether it is by intention or chance that Mr.
Symons	PERSON	always keeps back the salient point of the story .

		His skill in analysis must be admitted , and his command of telling epithet and of a certain poetic , though wholly undramatic , charm .

		But his very cleverness and facility make it more to be regretted that he has wasted his time in portrai - ture , brilliant but without significance , of subjects that are hardly worthy of such distinction .

		The latest , and let us hope the last .

		An uncrowned exploitation of the royal marriage of Enalish queen .

		^ ^ ^ r. i i ^ • i i .

		i Mrs. r itzherbert is a volume by the late
W. H. Wilkins	PERSON	entitled '' Mrs.
Fitzherbert	PERSON	and George IV . ''

		-LRB-
Longmans	LOCATION	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The au - thor has been an accomplished defender of unhappy queens , Mrs.
Fitzherbert	PERSON	being the fourth whose career he has chronicled .

		His undertaking has had the full cooperation of Mrs.
Fitzherbert	PERSON	's family , who have freely loaned portraits , letters , and other documents to the end that the biography might be complete .

		The publishers have done their part by producing a liandsomely bound , well printed , and lavishly illustrated volume .

		In addition to his able manipulation of materials and lively style of narra - tion , Mr.
Wilkins	PERSON	was fortunate enough to secure a privilege stubbornly withheld from previous chron - iclers ; he was given the
King	PERSON	's gracious permission to see and to quote from the famous Fitzherbert papers .

		These , it will be recalled , Mrs.
Fitzherbert	PERSON	placed at
Coutts 's Bank	ORGANIZATION	in
1833	DATE	, with the specific purpose of vindicating her character , exactly when or how she did not determine .

		From them the fact of her marriage with
George	PERSON	, Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	, is proved beyond a doubt , and the famous controversy is happily settled , -- not , however , at all to
Prince George	ORGANIZATION	's credit .

		The marriage is naturally the pivotal point of the book .

		Very little space is de - voted to the previous life of Mrs.
Fitzherbert	PERSON	, and afterwards the varying status of the marriage and of the Prince 's devotion to her was of course the chief consideration , both to the lady herself and to the gossiping public .

		Mr.
Wilkins	PERSON	has nothing but praise for Mrs.
Fitzherbert	PERSON	, who is represented as acting throughout her intercourse with the Prince in a maimer uniformly to her credit .

		George 's life and character are touched upon only in the aspects in • which they affected Mrs.
Fitzherbert	PERSON	. ''

		The Elements of Sociology '' -LRB- Mac - t!loHologv .

		millan -RRB- , by Professor
Frank W. Blackmar	PERSON	, is not a book calculated to convince doubters that there is a well-defined science of society .

		The author maintains that sociology has a field and purpose distinct from those of the special social sciences , but of this his book is not convincing evidence ; the chapters on the production and con - sumption of wealth and on exchange seem to belong for the most part in a treatise on economics , while that on the theory and functions of the state might have been taken out of a work on political science .

		The parts of the book which deal with socialization , social control , and social ideals are not subject to the same criticism , yet they are not altogether satis - fying ; probably the space devoted to these subjects is insufficient for the successful exposition of a philosophy of society .

		The chapters on social pathology bring the science down to earth , and con - stitute probably the most valuable part of the book ; there is a reference to ' '' the criminal germ '' which looks at first sight like an extreme application of the biological analogy ; but this is probably only one of numerous expressions which would have been im - proved upon in a careful revision .

		There are two suggestive chapters on the field and method of social investigation ; and , finally , an historical sketch of social philosophy and sociology which wUl be found a convenient introduction to the literature of the subject .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		We have previously noted the appearance of the first three volumes in the '' Journals of the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	Con - gress , '' as edited by Mr.
Worthington Chauncey Ford	PERSON	for the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fourth volume of this important work has now appeared after a long delay , easily to be accounted for by the size of the volume , which contains over four hundred pages .

		It takes us into the epochal year of
1776	DATE	, and covers only five months of the year at that , so many and serious were the activities of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	during the period between the Canadian expedition and the first steps toward the Declaration .

		The many who had not the privilege of viewing the annual
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	exhibition of last
summer	DATE	may console themselves very comfortably with the volume of '' Royal Academy Pictures ,
1905	DATE	, '' recently pubUshed by
Messrs. Cassell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, which sets before us for the eighteenth consecutive time an adequate record of the national achievement in British art for the year .

		The quality of the reproductions , both half-tone and photo - gravure , is no less excellent in this than in previous vol - umes of the work .

		More than two himdred paintings and sculptures are reproduced , and there is a brief in - troductory note by Mr.
M. H. Spielmann	PERSON	.

		A new volume in the '' Drawings of the Great Mas - ters '' series reproduces about fifty of the drawings of
Adolph von Menzel	ORGANIZATION	.

		The illustrations are introduced by a brief appreciation from the pen of Professor
H. W. Singer	PERSON	, who gives a vivid and sympathetic picture of
Menzel	PERSON	's bitter struggle for recognition , and an account of his most important lithographs , wood-cuts , and paint - ings , and of the great mass of his drawings , some five thousand of which were recently exhibited at
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		Only one of the fifty representative sketches in the pres - ent volume has ever been reproduced before .

		There is a wide variety in subject , style , and finish , but all are interesting .

		-- In similar form , though in this case appear - ing in '' The Master Etchers '' series , is a volume de - voted to the etchings of Charles
Mdryon	PERSON	.

		There are forty-eight excellent reproductions of the master 's work , an account of his unhappy career from the pen of Mr.
Hugh Stokes	PERSON	, and a useful annotated list of his output .

		The form of these volumes , which are imported by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons , is in every way worthy .

		BRIEFER MENTION 239 NOTES 239 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS 240 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 241 THE CARDINAL VIRTUES OF FICTION .

		The modem novel is so versatile a thing , and offers so varied an appeal to the interests of its readers , that the determination of criteria for its proper appraisement is made a pecvdiarly difficult task for the critic .

		The difficulty is possibly greater than in the case of any other of the recognized literary forms , since a novel may achieve distinction , or at least obtain the vogue which is a temporary equivalent for dis - tinction , in any one of a score of ways .

		If it exhibit some particular sort of excellence in a marked degree , it will find its special circle of admirers , who will praise it for that quality alone , caring little for its shortcomings in other directions .

		An d the total public , even of novel - readers who require of themselves some measure of critical accounting for their own tastes , is so vast that it is sure to include enough people to constitute an audience of respectable propor - tions for almost any author who displays any kind of real ability , no matter how cramped may be its expression .

		Nevertheless , out of all the chaos of aim and achievement which is illustrated by modem fiction , it ought to be -- it must be -- possible to evolve a critical order of some description , to determine certain ideal standards of workman - ship , and to classify under a few general cap - tions the enduring elements of the artistic con - ception embodied in the novel considered as a form of literary production .

		When one has read some thousands of novels with a view to something more than the entertainment they offer , with what we would call a scientific pur - pose were it not for the imf ortunate associations of the word '' science '' when mentioned in con - nection with literary criticism ; when one has done this , the essential features of the novel - form gradually emerge from a welter of fugitive impressions , and shape themselves in the read - er 's consciousness , creating for him a norm to which he will thereafter refer his new impres - sions , and upon which he will base his judg - ments .

		These features or elements we have ventured to call the cardinal virtues of fiction , and will now endeavor to consider them one by one .

		The first of the virtues may be called inven - tion , although this single word is inadequate for the expression of ovir meaning .

		Some such phrase as `` selection of material '' would be better , for of invention in the literal sense there is not likely to be much question .

		The plots .

		have all been used many times over , and even the incidents do not often have the merit of real novelty .

		Relative novelty is about all that the writer of fiction may hope to achieve , even in the details of his work , while for his main material he is thrown back upon the old mo - tives and complications .

		For effects which will 222 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, produce even the illusion of novelty , hia chief reliance must be in the stage-settmg rather than in the story , and here , so great is the possible variety of scenes offered by life present and life past , so changeable are the fashions of literature , and so short are the memories of readers , he may succeed in lending a seeming freshness to some tale which in its essence is as old as
Rome	LOCATION	or Babylon .

		Closely allied to the virtue of what we have called invention is that of construction , and in the cultivation of this virtue the artist finds his first real opportunity .

		The architectonic char - acter of a successfid work of fiction is one of its most important features , and not a little of the satisfaction we find in reading a novel comes from the sense that we are following a logical plan , with a nice adjustment of parts , with a careful adaptation of means to ends , and with a steady development of plot-interest up to the moment when the climax is reached .

		The art of proceed - ing from climax to conclusion calls for no less thought than the art of working up to the climax , and there is greater danger of scamping this part of the work than any other .

		To accomplish all that has here been suggested is to be tndy crea - tive , not perhaps in the highest sense , but cer - tainly creative in the sense of contributing an element of one 's own to the material supplied by the world outside .

		^ Many novels are successful , and deservedly so , by virtue of excellence in these two respects of invention and construction .

		Theirs is not the most enduring kind of success , but it is one by no means to be despised .

		It is , moreover , the only kind of success that makes anything ap - proaching an immediate and imiversal appeal to readers , for the success that eventually sets a work of fiction among the classics of literature is apt to be no more than a succes d'estime with the generation that witnesses its production .

		It is not by the applause of contemporary throngs , but by the judgment of the few , accimudated through following generations , that the world comes to know for the masterpiece that it is such a work as ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' or '' I
Promessi Sposi	PERSON	, '' or ``
Wilhehn Meister	PERSON	, '' or ``
Tom Jones	PERSON	, '' or '' The Scarlet Letter . ''

		Meanwhile , each generation has its own popular fictions , outshining for the time more important works , .

		but neglected by the next generation because lacking in the virtues of the higher sort .

		These higher virtues , which are the sure anti- septics of literature , are the virtues of charac - terization , style , and truth .

		With the virtue of characterization we reach our own climax , in this brief critical survey of the essentials of artistic fiction .

		It is the one absolutely indispensable virtue of the novel that is to be considered seri - ously , for the pages that do not frame for us figures of men and women who really live , who are even more certainly denizens of the peopled world as our consciousness knows it tlian are most of the flesh and blood beings whom we jostle -LRB- but do not know -RRB- in the daily walk of life , then those pages may be excellent literature , but they are assuredly not the pages of an excellent novel .

		We have said tliat construction is a crea - tive act , and so it is , but the creative act par excellence of the novelist is the shaping of hu - man beings in the moulds of the imagination , and their portrayal in such subtle wise , and with such force of penetrative sympathy , that they take their rightful place among our intimates , becoming perhaps more truly our intimates than those whom we know best in the actual world .

		Who lias not felt , for example , that he has a closer acquaintance with some of the people of
Scott	PERSON	's or
Thackeray	PERSON	's or
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	's creation than with the best of his own personal friends ?

		The novelist who creates character , then , may be sure that his work will live , however it may fail in practising the other virtues of the fictive art .

		It is all the better , of course , if inven - tive and constructive skill be superadded to the power of characterization , and still better if , in further addition , there be exhibited the power of style and the power of truth .

		By style we mean everytliing that relates to beauty in its formal aspect , as distinguished from those other aspects of beauty which are the good and the true .

		Style in the novel may be displayed in many ways .

		Its most obvious function is found in the descriptive passages , but there is -LRB- or may be -RRB- exhibited a power of style in the narrative , in the analysis of motive , and even in the direct discourse of the characters .

		And it must be remembered that although style is one , styles are many , and verbal beauty is equally available for the diverse moods of humor and pathos , of sparkling animation and serious contemplation .

		If we find in characterization the supreme creative activity of the novelist , and in style the supreme expression of his feeling for formal beauty , we must turn to truth for the supreme expression of his artistic conscience .

		And we mean by truth not only the truth of observation and report , of psychological relation and logical process , but also , and even more insistently , the truth that is ethical in its outlook , the truth that respects sanctions , and discerns morality to be in very fact the inmost nature of things .

		To
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 223 embody truth , thus apprehended , whether by reason or by intuition , in the very foundations of his structure , must be the aim of every serious novelist , has been the determination of all the novelists whose works we now hold in honor .

		Thus fiction and truth , whose names are as the poles , are seen as one and the same thing from this philosophical ^ ` ie \ \ ^ int , which * ' was some time a paradox , but now the time gives it proof . ''

		The foregoing somewhat abstract discussion may seem to have little relation to fiction as illustrated by the stories one reads from day to day for diversion , or by the publishers ' output from year to year .

		But its relation to fiction in a serious sense , to fiction considered as con - stituting one of the three principal forms of imaginative literature , is of the most \ ` ital char - acter , for it is in accordance with some such analysis as we have here sought to make that the definite litei-ary status of every novel must be fixed .

		The fact is irrelevant that ninety - nine novels out of every hundred would get no status at all when rated by the tests here pro- posed .

		It is with the himdredth novel alone that the student of literature has to deal , and it is highly important that he deal vnth it upon a clearly-outlined critical plan .

		We are aware that we have suggested an outline and nothing more , but it is frequently athdsable , in criticism as in other intellectual occupations , to recur to first principles , to make sure that our point of departure has been well-chosen , and that we have started in the right direction for the imseen distant goal .

		Hawaiian Yesterdays '' is the story of a stren - uous life amid the rudest surroundings .

		The semi-savagery of the natives , the lack of the commonest domestic conveniences , the heart - breaking remoteness from civilization and friends , the practical certainty of never more re - visiting the scenes of childhood and youth , made a Hawaiian missionary 's calling a serious one indeed .

April 1	DATE	, quickening , and also for the supplying of bodily needs out of such cargoes as had arrived from
Boston	LOCATION	in the preceding twelve months . ''

		On a certain occasion , the Reverend Mr.
Richards	PERSON	arrived from his station at
Lahaina	LOCATION	, only in time to ascertain that the last vestige of clothing had been dis - tributed , leaving him literally ' out in the cold . '

		This was a dreadful disappointment , for his only paii '' of black trousers was in the last stage of disintegration ; and in what other color could he appear before the Lord as an honored and God-fearing ecclesiastic ?

		His excellent wife came cheerfully to the rescue , bringing forth from some hidden store an old black satin shirt -- treasiu-ed memento of youthful gaiety and worldly pleasure .

		This long-discarded article was now offered again upon the altar of sacrifice , and under the housewife 's deft manip - ulation reappeared once more upon the stage of active life , transformed into a suit of staid and sombre hue -- a thoroughly regulated specimen of a genuinely evan - gelical pattern .

		But alas for poor human nature !

		The incident was eagerly caught up by the profane beach - combers of
Honolulu	LOCATION	, and all along the seacoast of
New England	LOCATION	was recited the story of the luxury in which Hawaiian missionaries were living . '

		Why , their clothes are made of nothing less expensive than the costliest silks and satins ! ' ''

		This same Mr.
Richards	PERSON	was the hero of a bap - tismal episode too amusing to omit .

		A native couple , the proud parents of an infant boy , on presenting the child for baptism and being asked what name they had chosen for their son and heir , promptly replied , '' Beelzebub . ''

		Only after grave remonstrance woidd they relinquish their choice .

		The name they finally insisted upon as a substitute was '' Mr.
Richards	PERSON	, '' for that was certainly the name of a good man if the other was not ; and so the babe was chris - tened '' Mr.
Richards	PERSON	. ''

Titus Munson Coan	PERSON	, our author 's playmate and lifelong friend .

		With this com - rade , or with the boys of the school and their teacher , the writer made exploring tours about the island and to the volcanoes of
Kilauea	LOCATION	and
Mauna Loa	ORGANIZATION	in the interior .

		Noteworthy , among other things , is the absence of those countless forms of reptile and insect life that might have made such excursions in a tropical climate un - pleasant if not dangerous .

		These happy con - ditions have now , it appears , been somewhat changed for the worse by the importation of the mosquito , along with other accompaniments of civilization .

		A description of
Kilauea	LOCATION	in action , as viewed from the crater 's edge , will perhaps be welcome to those unfamiliar with such spec - tacles . ''

		Over the recently hardened lava we traveled nearly half a mile , coming suddenly upon the level margin of the lake of fire .

		This was a circular pool , fully a thou - sand feet in diameter , surrounded by a wall of rock , so that as we stood upon the brink the melted lava was fifteen or twenty feet below us .

		Its whole mass was in motion , furiously bubbling and boiling , and dashing up waves of red-hot foam and spray .

		Sometimes there would be a partial calm , as of the sea after a storm ; a considerable portion of the surface would freeze over with smooth hard lava , such as we had under foot ; but in a few minutes there would be a violent outbreak , and the broad field would split open across its whole extent , allowing the melted rock to rise through the crevices like water coming up over the ice on a river during a freshet in the
Spring	DATE	of the year .

		Huge cakes of solid lava would tilt up on end , slowly turning over , and finally disappearing in a tremendous whirlpool of fiery surf thrown up from below .

		This exhibition was being continually renewed all over the lake , while we stood chained to the spot , and lost in admiration of the awful spectacle , till an unusually vigorous outburst , surging forth from under the banks , warned us that we were upon an overhanging table-rock which might be hurled at any moment into the sea of fire .

		The author , after being well started in book - learning by his mother , attended the Reverend
Daniel Dole	PERSON	's school for mission children at
Punahou	LOCATION	, near
Honolulu	LOCATION	.

		The teacher 's name will call to mind ex-Governor
Sanford B. Dole	PERSON	, his son , who -LRB- another parallelism -RRB- came also to

		The writer 's expe - riences were enlarged also by considerable work as a land-surveyor at the age of sixteen , when he received a government appointment through a friend 's intercession .

		Soon afterward he took passage in a whaler for
New Bedford	ORGANIZATION	and a
Massachusetts	LOCATION	college , sailing round
Cape Horn	LOCATION	, of course , and spending one hundred and forty days at sea .

		Two sperm whales were taken just after the
Cape	LOCATION	was doubled , and sundry other incidents diversified the voyage .

		If the earlier chapters recall the famous adven - tures of the
Robinson	PERSON	family , the later pages occasionally remind one of the equally interest - ing experiences narrated by the author of '' Two Years before the
Mast	LOCATION	. ''

		Some few matters for criticism , unimportant in themselves , but perhaps noteworthy to a carefid reviewer , may be briefly set down in closing .

		Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	jcsd his Work , * Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	is , and must remain , easily the first portrait painter of the eighteenth century , and his porti-aits are universally ac - knowledged to be among the best ever painted .

		He can therefore , mthout danger , be brought into close contrast A \ ath the illustrious porti-ait painters that preceded him , while none who have come after have approached the ^ ^ • ide scope and broad powers that were undeniably his .

		That his portraits are often flattered likenesses , as was charged in
Reynolds	ORGANIZATION	's o ^ ti day , is undoubtedly true ; but he never sacrificed character to flat - tery , not even in his portraits of women , where it was most often exercised .

		In many of his male portraits , he is a pronoimced , almost a brutal , realist , not even sa \ dng himself , -- as ANitness , in one of his seK-portraits he wears spectacles , in another he holds his ear-trumpet , and in a third has his hand to his ear in the attitude of listen - ing , each of these details marking his infirmities , either of sight or of hearing ; recall also that great portrait of Doctor

		close to his eyes , which '' Ursa Major '' remon - strated against as preserving a record of his near-sightedness , saying to Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	: '' Rey - nolds may paint himseK as deaf as he chooses , but I will not be Blinking
Sam	PERSON	in the eyes of posterity . ''

		Such an objection coming from
Johnson	PERSON	seems odd , in view of the answer he once gave to
Boswell	PERSON	's question as to what was the first merit of a portrait , -- '' Truth , Sir , is of the greatest value in these things . ''

		Flattery or no flattery , there can be no ques - tion in the mind of anyone familiar with Rey - nolds 's work that his portraits of the men and women of his time enable one to live those times over again with them .

		His power of characteri - zation was so strong , and he had such an agile hand to fix it as quickly as it was discerned , that each portrait he has given us , in all the enor - mous number he painted , is the portrait of the individual limned .

		Other painters executed por - traits of
Johnson	LOCATION	,
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Burke	PERSON	,
Sterne	PERSON	, and of many other notable characters ; but in Rey - nolds 's portraits of these personages we know that we see the men before us as they appeared to their friends and contempoi-aries , and we read their characters in their faces as we have read them in their lives and writings .

		There never was a painter who had the power of giving such distinction to his portraits as RejTiolds had ; and it is quite remarkable that this should be so , considering that he was not an impeccable draughtsman .

		But he did possess to a marked degree that intangible quality called taste , which made him avoid whatever was com - monplace or conventional in pose and arrange - ment , and always gave grace and dignity to his work .

		RejTiolds had other defects as a painter besides his frequent bad drawing , which we can - not help thinking , in view of the superb drawing in some of his pictures -LRB- especially the
Lord Heathfield	ORGANIZATION	and the Doctor
Johnson	PERSON	in the Na - tional Gallery -RRB- , was due to haste and carelessness ; while some of it may be owing to the fact that he never drew with charcoal but painted in with the fidl brush from the start .

		His portraits sometimes lack solidity and seriousness , and his mania for experimenting Avith colors has led to the fading and cracking of his work to a lamentable degree , so that his fame , especially as a colorist , rests largely upon the testimony of those who saw his works fresh from the easel or comparatively soon after , before time and the restorer together had helped to ruin them .

		He and the art-loving public also owe a large debt of gratitude to the masterful mezzotint scrapers of his time , who have handed down his works in 226 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, the beautiful black and white translations we all know so well , and thus preserved what otherwise would have been in great part lost .

		Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	has been '' written up '' almost to death .

		Biographies , studies , and mono - graphs upon him are legion , -- from those written by his contemporaries who knew him , such as
Northcote	ORGANIZATION	,
Farington	LOCATION	,
Mason	PERSON	, and
Malone	PERSON	, fol - lowed by
Cunningham	PERSON	,
Cotton	ORGANIZATION	,
Leslie	PERSON	, and
Taylor	PERSON	, down to the present time , when the latest are the volumes by Sir
Walter Armstrong	PERSON	and by Mr.
W. B. Boulton	PERSON	.

		His Discourses , too , have been many times printed and reprinted , translated and edited ; notwithstanding which we now have a new edition with notes by Mr.
Roger Fry	PERSON	.

		Sir
Joshua	PERSON	can therefore hardly be called , personally or professionally , an unknown quan - tity , and his character has always been held up as altogether admirable and signally free from taint , except in the writings of the two Scotch - men who have wi * itten about him ,
Allan Cun	PERSON	- ningham and Sir
Walter Armstrong	PERSON	, each of whom seems to nurture some uncanny Scotch malevolence against him .

		I have tried to dis - cover if there could be any national reason for this strange antipathy , but can find none ; and were it not for the coincidence that it is only
Scotchmen	PERSON	who have decried him , it would not be worth mentioning .

		The volume by Sir
Walter Armstrong	PERSON	is a republication , without revision -LRB- which is a pity , considering that the Graves and
Cronin	PERSON	`` His - tory of the Works of Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	'' has since appeared and would have cleared up some doubtful attributions of ownership , etc. -RRB- , of a luxurious folio issued in
1900	DATE	, which contained an important catalogue of Sir
Joshua	PERSON	's work , quite the most valuable part of the voliune , but which imfortunately is omitted from the reprint .

		This is particidarly bad , as on page 164 of the reprint , in a note to the paintings of `` Mrs.
Sid	PERSON	- dons as the Tragic Muse , '' the reader is referred to the catalogue : '' For some further details bear - ing on their history , see the Catalogue at the end of this volimie . ''

		But non est. .

		A folio is such an inconvenient volume to read , that I had not tackled the original edition , and so was ready to welcome eagerly its republication in handy size .

		What was my dismay on finding that Sir
Walter	PERSON	's point of view as to RejTiolds 's life and character was , to say the least , unusual and equally untenable .

		His whole aim seems to be to belittle and disparage Sir
Joshua	PERSON	as a man , and as a result to lessen the potentiality of his art .

		As Mr.
Fry	PERSON	weU says in his introduction to the Discourses : '' Of
Reynolds	PERSON	the man there is no need to speak here at length ; the outlines of his character are so simple , so familiar , they have been retraced so often by his contempo - raries and successors , and that with such a re - markable uniformity of commendation -- if we except a few spiteful phrases in
Cunningham	LOCATION	's Life and the singidar view of his actions taken by Sir
Walter Armstrong	PERSON	-- that to repeat them here again would be superfluous .

		One need only refer to the rounded completeness and harmony , the deliberation and method he showed in all his undertakings , and the freedom from all that is petty or narrow , which distinguished him in life as much as in art and made each so nicely complementary to the other . ''

		What is the mes - sage conveyed by a picture , depends wholly upon the point of view of the beholder ; and whether that message is the one intended by the painter , or the very reverse , depends likewise upon how near alike are the view-points of the painter and of the observer .

		Now Sir
Joshua	PERSON	's point of view and Sir
Walter	PERSON	's are as far apart as the antipodes .

		Were this not so it would be im - possible for Sir
Walter	PERSON	to see Sir
Joshua	PERSON	as he has drawn him ; and such being the case , while Sir
Walter	PERSON	's views of Sir
Joshua	PERSON	, both as a man and as an artist , may be perfectly satisfactory to him , they will satisfy no unbiased student of the life and works of the First President of the
Royal Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sir AValter seems to think it a crime for a man to be well balanced , temperate , and calm .

		.

		To an analytical criticism of the two Scotch detractors of
Reynolds	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Boulton	PERSON	devotes ten pages of his volume .

		Of the first , he says -LRB- p. 314 -RRB- : '' To this account of the painter , he -LSB-
Allan Cminingham	PERSON	-RSB- brought no single fact that was not already preserved in the lives by
Northcote	PERSON	and
Malone	PERSON	, but he deliberately took the plain tales of those writers and treated them with an ingenuity of perversion which is alto - gether extraordinary . ''

		Of the second , he writes -LRB- p. 317 -RRB- : '' The latest and most notable of the critics of RejTiolds 's character is Sir
Walter Armstrong	PERSON	, who in that fine volume published in
1900	DATE	arrives at much the same estimate of the man as
Allan Cunningham	PERSON	.

		It is needless , however , to say that his views are expressed without any of
Cunningham	PERSON	's rancour , and that they are the result of an obvious endeavor to be just .

		The present writer is none the less con - vinced that Sir
Walter	PERSON	is completely mistaken in the opinion he has formed of
Reynolds	ORGANIZATION	's per - sonality . ''

		And as a final and impartial judg - ment upon
Reynolds	PERSON	's character , by one who , all wiU admit , '' knew the times better than
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 227 most and was gifted beyond the ordinary with an insight into the hearts of men and women , '' Mr.
Boulton	PERSON	ends his volume with
Thackeray	PERSON	's words : `` I declare , I think of all the polite men of that age
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	was the finest gentleman . '' '

		It is a wonder that Sir
Walter	PERSON	did not , fol - lowing the fashion of the present day when a man Ls to be flayed by his biographer , call his book '' • The True Sir
Joshua Rej-nolds	PERSON	. ''

		Then we should have known what to expect .

		We might , indee < l , have been prepared for some - thing of the kind by the '' Author 's Note . '' ''

		If my estimate of his character is found to differ in essential points from that usually accepted , I can only say that it has been formed after a very carefid weighing of the evidence . ''

		This '' careful weighing of the evidence '' would im - ply the exercise of the judicial spirit , which is precisely what is most wanting in Sir
Walter	PERSON	's pages , and stamps his estimate of RejTiolds 's character as both narrow and perverted .

		One trouble with Sir
Walter	PERSON	is his utter inability to assimilate the atmosphei-e of the eighteenth cen - tury .

		He is a t \ s entieth centurion to the back - bone , with no sentiment and no imagination .

		The styles of these volumes are as different as theii - treatment .

		The first is marred by the bad taste of attempting to be fimny when treat - ing of serious matters , and the constant in - jection of foreign woixis and phrases in a '' polly show your larnin ' '' manner , when - the well of English imdefiled '' ' would have served a better purpose ; together A \ ` ith the use of obsolete words and careless repetitions , as where , on page 122 ,
Sheridan	PERSON	's play '' A Trip to Scarborough '' is mentioned as a '' toned-tlowTi version of Yan - brugh 's Relapse , '' and four pages later we read '' The Trip to
Scarborough	LOCATION	,
Sheridan	PERSON	's version of
Vanbrugh	PERSON	's Relapse . ''

		The second is altogether a delightful book , well flavored with the atmosphere of the times , and generally well \ \ Titten , but with some pas - sages quite involved and obscure , so as to require a careful re-reading to ascei-tain the sense .

		Mr.
Boidton	PERSON	has cidled judiciousl -RCB- - from what has been written about
Reynolds	PERSON	by those who knew and understood him , as well as by those who did not , and the result is eminentl -RCB- ^ satisfactory ; while his final chapters , on '' The Artist '' and on '' The Man , '' are thoroughly convincing .

		He has a refined critical sense , and does Sir
Joshua	PERSON	, both as a man and as an artist , ample justice , without in any way becoming a servile eulogist .

		While the work of
Leslie	PERSON	and
Taylor	PERSON	must re - main the best source for an original study of
Reynolds	ORGANIZATION	, this volume is easily the best general survey that we know .

		The third work is WTitten in that clear and terse English for which
Reynolds	ORGANIZATION	's Discourses have ever been distinguished , and which has put into the heads of some people the thought that
Johnson	PERSON	or
Burke	PERSON	had a hand in their composition , -- on hearing which the gruff old lexicographer exclaimed , ''
Reynolds	PERSON	would as soon require me to paint for him as to ^ \ Tite . ''

		Mr.
Fry	PERSON	's reason for this new edition of the Dis - courses we cordially endorse .

		He writes : '' The present edition has been undertaken from a be - lief that their value stiU persists , that the Dis - courses are not merely a curious and entertaia - ing example of eighteenth century literature , but that they contain principles and exhibit a mental attitude which are of the highest value to the artist . ''

		Mr.
Fry	PERSON	has written a general introduction to the body of Discourses , and a separate special introduction to each discourse ; and he advises that these introductions , as they are really commentaries , should be read after and not before the discourse itself .

		He has also supplied lucid critical notes to the reproductions of those paintings which
Reynolds	PERSON	especially considered noteworthy , and his work is well done and exceedingly valuable .

		While
Reynolds	PERSON	's political opinions are not of much consequence at
this day	TIME	, yet one phase of them is of some interest on this side of the ocean .

		He was a stanch Whig and a friend of the colonies .

		Copley has received the credit of having given Sir
Joshua	PERSON	this bias ; but if he did , it was doubtless much strengthened by his famil - iar intercourse with
Edmund Burke	PERSON	.

		However this may be , it is amusing to note that when To \ STisend , the father of the Stamp Act biU , sat to RejTiolds , they wrangled over the colonies , and the artist bet the politician -LRB- who was boasting that the arch-rebel
Washington	LOCATION	would soon be brought to
England	LOCATION	a prisoner , and that he would bring him to Sir
Joshua	PERSON	to paint his por - trait -RRB- that
Washington	LOCATION	would never enter his studio .

		The bet , which was five pounds against a thousand , made quite a sensation in
London	LOCATION	, and RejTiolds was forced to repeat it a score of times , on the same terms , to his own advantage .

		Reynolds was as careless in signing his pic - tures as have been other painters of past times .

		He is known to have signed but two canvases , the `` IVIrs .

		Siddons '' and `` Lady
Cockburn	PERSON	with her Children . ''

		Sir
Walter Armstrong	PERSON	claims that this assertion '' is not strictly true '' ; but he fails to instance other signed pictures to sus - tain the correctness of his assertion , which he 228 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, certainly should have done did he know them .

		Our own
Stuart	PERSON	is known to have signed but two canvases also ; and it is pertinent to inquire here , where is
Stuart	PERSON	's portrait of Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	, painted for Boydell ?

		Although these three volumes bear the im - prints of American houses , they are of English manufacture , and unfortunately have the fault , so common in transatlantic publications , of inad - equate indexing , while possessing the usual En - glish excellence of typography and illustrations .

		What is Immortality ?

		* The Ingersoll Lecture for
1906	DATE	was delivered by Dr.
Wilhelm Ostwald	PERSON	, Professor of
Physical Chemistry	ORGANIZATION	at
Leipzig	LOCATION	, and temporary Professor at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The perennial subject of this now celebrated lectureship is '' The Immortality of Man '' ; and if Professor
Ostwald	PERSON	's treatment of it does remind us of the famous chapter on snakes in
Iceland	LOCATION	, it at any rate represents the matured opinions of a scientific man of preeminent ability , and as such deserves and will receive widespread attention .

		At the very outset , the lecturer calls attention to the fact that our knowledge '' is an incomplete piece of patchwork '' ; but , he adds , each one is boimd to make the best possible use of it , such as it is , never forgetting that it may at any time be superseded by new discoveries or ideas .

		In this truly scientific spirit , very remote from the dogmatism of the churches , Professor
Ostwald	PERSON	proceeds to consider what immortality may be supposed to be , and what reasons we have for believing in it .

		The argument runs something like this : Mem - ory , in a broad sense , is characteristic of all organic life , but man differs from all the other creatures in the ntiuch greater development of this power , whereby his culture and adaptability become possible .

		Memory links the past with the present , and makes possible psychical con - tinuity .

		Heredity may be regarded as an analo - gous phenomenon , and hence , so long as the race remains alive , it may be regarded as one , like the individual .

		This physical '' immortality '' appears to have no necessary ending , but it is easy to conceive of the destruction of all indi - viduals living upon the earth ; and given time enough , such destruction appears certain .

		This , however , is not reaUy the sort of immortality • Individuality and Immortality .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Wilhelm Ostwald	PERSON	.

		we are seeking , and we turn to consider other types of persistence .

		It is generally said that matter and energy can not be created or destroyed ; but this means , merely , that the sum-totals are supposed to remain the same , the individuality of particidar portions of these things being con - tinually subject to change and disappearance .

		We do not actually know that mass and energy are unchangeable in amount ; and given eternity , the probability may be equally strong for or against any statement based upon human expe - rience .

		The prevalent conception of the eternity of the elementary bodies has been rudely shaken of late ; and , in fact , it appears that there is a whole series of such bodies , persisting for vary - ing periods , from a few seconds to many millions of years ; or , for practical purposes , forever .

		But whatever may be true concerning these things , they do not throw any light on human immortality , because there is no permanence of individuality .

		There is an irresistible tendency towards diffusion and homogeneity , and this is equally true of man .

		There is also perpetual change , so that what we call the persistence of individuality in ordinary life means only the con - tinuity of a series of changes .

		Survival after death does not necessarily imply immortality ; it may be regarded in two ways , either as con - tinuity of changes or as the passage into a trans - cendent state in which there is no further change , and time and space cease to have any meaning .

		In the latter case , we have what is practically equivalent to annihilation ; in the former , we have the prolongation of that which , in the case of persons who have reached old age , appears to have already rim its course , so that death is sim - ply the doing away with something which has ceased to have any reason for living .

		Socially , we may speak of the '' immortals , '' whose works live after them , but even they must fade from memory as distinct individuals , sooner or later .

		Finally , if we give up the idea of personal im - mortality , we may perhaps be led thereby to a higher etliical plane ; for we shall see that our real continuity is in the human race , and shall thus be led to identify ourselves more and more with it ; and so the lecturer concludes : '' Beside the fact of inherited taint there exists the fact of inherited perfection , and every advance which we , by the sweat of our brows , may succeed in making towards our own perfection is so much gain for our children and our children 's children forever .

		I must confess that I can think of no grander perspective of immortality than this . ''

		The discussion is an interesting one , both from its statement of scientific views and from the glimpse it affords of the mind of the author .


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 229 It is , nevertheless , strangely incomplete , almost ignoring the deeper questions at issue .

		What does Professor
Ostwald	PERSON	mean by '' forever '' in the last quotation ?

		If it is not a piece of mere rhetoric , it is incorrect in the light of one of the most assured prophecies of science that the human race must sooner or later come to an end .

		This earth can not perpetually revolve in the same orbit , warmed by the same sun ; for even solar systems have but their little day .

		Where , then , is the promise of immortality ; and , in the light of eternitj ^ what greater value have the days of humanity collectively , than those of single individuals ?

		What , after aU , are the attributes of per - sonality ?

		Personality is able to experience ; it is that which experiences .

		Says Professor Ostwald : '' If we recall the happiest moments of our lives , they will be found in every case to be connected with a curious loss of personal - ity .

		In the happiness of love this fact will be at once discovered .

		And if you are enjoying intensely a work of art , a symphony of Bee - thoven 's , for example , you find yourseK relieved of the burden of personality and carried away by the stream of music as a drop is carried by a wave . ''

		What a curious misconception I In the moments of the most intense feeling , per - sonality is said to be lost !

		On the contrary , it reaches its highest power , and is found indeed .

		The confusion comes from a materialistic con - ception of individuality wliich underlies the whole argument .

		Objectively , to the ordinary individual .

		Professor
Ostwald	PERSON	is a professor at
Leipzig	LOCATION	, and a great chemist .

		When he hears beautiful music , or sees a charming landscape , he totally forgets , for the moment , that he is either of the things just mentioned ; he forgets his name , his age , his nationality .

		Has he then lost himself in the process ?

		By no means ; he has , on the contrary , found what is most funda - mental in his being ; and has , in the act , proved himseK independent of the accessories which in ordinary life seem of first importance .

		Tested in the same way , the assertion that mental life is conditioned by bodily existence assumes a quite different meaning .

		If person - ality is that which experiences , and if it can reside in time and space , must it not experience those things which time and space afford ?

		What I may see and feel at any given time de - pends upon what is there , and it makes no differ - ence to the argument whether the '' things '' are * ' things in themselves '' or projections of my own imagination .

		To show that there is no im - mortality , it is necessary to show that experience ends , while the material for experience continues .

		This , of course , is beyond demonstration .

		The linking of the present with the past is logically explicable only on the view that the present contains that which embodies the past .

		Strictly speaking , when we '' remember '' what happened
last week	DATE	, we become aware of what has been recorded in the brain , just as we might learn by reading the contents of a book .

		When the past shall have ceased to be exhibited in the present , it will have departed indeed ; but it is science herself who denies this very possibility , asserting that effect implies cause , ad infinitum .

		Personality , existing always in the present , moves rather than is prolonged in time , and hence can not be conceived to be submerged in it .

		But in the succession of experiences which make up conscious life , this or that may occupy the field , and we know not what we are destined to '' remember , '' what to '' forget . ''

		It is a great mystery , but one which every hour of ordinary existence affords , on a small scale .

Pennsylvania	LOCATION	has more warrant , because that event was closely connected with national politics .

		Much more valuable than the many reprinted pamphlets and speeches of
Thomas Williams	PERSON	, and even of greater moment than the local his - tory with which he was associated , are his letters , which by this method have been relegated to the background , and for the most part are repre - sented by extracts only .

		A full collection of the letters of this '' founder of the Whig and Repub - lican parties , '' as the author modestly dubs him , or even the subjection of other matter to the let - ters , would have resulted in a most interesting commentary on public men and matters between
1830	DATE	and
1870	DATE	.

		A rare glimpse of President
Jackson	PERSON	is given in a letter from
Williams	ORGANIZATION	in
Washington	LOCATION	, whither he had gone with a
Pitts	PERSON	- burg delegation to protest -LRB- think of the courage it required ! -RRB-

		against the removal of the deposits from the
United States	LOCATION	bank .

		The men were scarcely seated in the
White House	ORGANIZATION	when the
General	ORGANIZATION	opened his batteries and poured forth a voUey of abuse . ''

		Little as I had been in the habit of contemplating him to be , '' says the let - ter , '' I confess I was amazed , shocked at an ex - hibition of coarseness & vulgarity which I had not been prepared to expect .

		There was an utter want of that dignity which overawes imperti - nence & enforces respect .

		He even so far forgot his high station as to contradict flatly our repre - sentative , Mr.
Denny	PERSON	, & to assert that he knew more about the condition of the
State Banks	ORGANIZATION	than all of us together . ''

		Like
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	,
Thomas Williams	PERSON	retired from politics after the Mexican war , but re-entered because of the repeal of the Mis - souri Compromise .

		He took an active part in the Republican Convention of
1856	DATE	, and drew the call for the Convention of
1860	DATE	to meet in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		At the time of writing this call he was a visitor to
Washington	LOCATION	, where sectional pas - sion was at its height in the contest over the election of a Speaker of the
House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		It was , '' said he , `` in the very midst of the tempest and fury of denunciation on the floor of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and while the
Comicil Chamber of the Nation	ORGANIZATION	was ringing with the treason , which the gal - leries were applauding to the echo , that the in - vocation to the friends of
Union	ORGANIZATION	, which is to be found in the call that gathered the people at
Chicago	LOCATION	, was penned by my own hand . ''

		During construction times in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, Will - iams allied himself with the Radicals , although not so extreme in policy as
Stevens	PERSON	and his crowd .

		Writing to his wife in
1866	DATE	, he said that a strong disposition existed to impeach President
Johnson	PERSON	. ''

		No one has any respect for and nobody goes to see him .

		If we coidd feel sure of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, there would be no hesi - tation about the matter . ''

		Again , in describing a refusal to dine with the president ,
Williams	ORGANIZATION	says he does not care to sit down at table with any man for whom he has no personal respect , -- '' one who has betrayed his friends and taken to his bosom the worst and vilest of his coun - try 's enemies . ''


Williams	PERSON	was one of the man - agers of the impeachment trial of
Johnson	PERSON	, and bitterly regretted the failure to convict .

		The two volmnes seem passably free from errata .

		A strange mistake appears -LRB- page 726 -RRB- in the statement that
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	was not impeached ; that to secure impeachment re - quired a two-thirds vote of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author evidently confuses impeachment with conviction .

		Johnson was impeached by vote of the
House	ORGANIZATION	,
February 24 , 1868	DATE	.

		The illustra - tions are of unusual value , embracing reproduc - tions of contemporary cartoons , cuts , and fac - similes of manuscripts and invitations .

		Few of these have been heretofore reproduced .

		The City as Democracy 's Hope .

		* It is difficult to review dispassionately a book one could wish he had written himseK , but in a coiuitry where everyone professes to believe in democracy it is both a privilege and a duty to announce a genuine herald .

		Those of us whose faith has remained undiminished must rejoice in such an effective and concrete exposition as Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's volimie on '' The City '' in an era of skepticism and flippancy .

		As the author says , '' Distrust of democracy has inspired much of the literature on the city .

		Distrust of democ - *
The City	LOCATION	, the Hope of Democracy .

		By
Frederic C. Howe	PERSON	, Ph.D. .


New York	LOCATION	: Charles
Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 231 racy has dictated most of our city laws ... Our charters have been drawn on the supposition that all officials were to be distrusted , rather than that all officials were to be held to account . ''

		The confusion about municipal corruption is of a kind with the doubts about democracy .

		We have been neither frank nor scientific enough to go to the root of the problem -- economic self - interest . ''

		We do not question this motive in the saloonkeeper who organizes his precinct for a liberal
Sunday	DATE	.

		His pol - ities are not ethical , they are due to self-interest .

		The same instinct is reflected , consciously or unconsciously , in the leaders of finance , the franchise seekers , the banker and the broker , the lawyer and the press ; all are fearful of democracy , when democracy dares to be - beve in itself .

		We all know that economic self-interest determines the politics of the saloon .

		We are begin - ning to realize that the same self-interest is the politics of big business .

		This realization explains the awakening of democracy , which is taking place in city and state all over the land . ''

		Privilege and democracy can not thrive together .

		The spoils system is undemocratic : it is petty pri \ - ilege .

		Franchise-grabbing is not only un - democratic , it is anti-democratic .

		Inflated values based on a social gift '' is the price that all our cities are paying to those who have requited this gift by overturning our institutions .

		It is the price which many insist we shoidd continue to pay because of the alleged greater efficiency of private enterprise , and the fear that dem - ocracy is not equal to the additional burdens involved in the assiunption of new obligations . ''

		The subordination of private interest to pub - lic weKare is to be achieved , according : to Mr.
Howe	PERSON	, by the extension of municipal fimctions and the appropriation of the imeametl incre - ment .

		In the first instance the transformation is inmiinent . ''

		But that the private activities of today will become the public ones of tomorrow is inevitable .

		The creche , kindergarten , the settlement , playgrounds , public baths , lodging houses , hospitals , were inspired by private phil - anthropy .

		They are slowly passing under public con - trol ... Today the city protects his -LSB- the citizen 's -RSB- life and property from injury .

		It safeguards his health in countless ways .

		It oversees his house construction and protects him from fire .

		It cleans and lights his streets , collects his garbage , supplies him with em - ployees through free employment bureaus .

		It educates his children , supplies them with books and in many in - stances with food .

		It offers him a library and through the opening of branches almost brings it to his door .

		It offers nature in the parks ; supplies him with oppor - tunities for recreation and pleasure through concerts , lectures , and the like .

		It maintains a public market ; administers justice ; supplies nurses , physicians and hos - pital service , as well as a cemetery for burial .

		It takes the refuse from his door and brings back water , gas and frequently -LSB- ?

		J heating power at the same time .

		It in - spects his food , protects his life and that of his children through public oversight of the conditions of factory labor .

		It safeguards him from contagious diseases , facilitates commimication upon the streets , and in some instances offers opportunities for higher technical and professional education ... `` All these intrusions into the field of private business have involved no loss of freedom to the individuaL Every increase of public activity has , in fact , added to personal freedom .

		WTiatever the motive , the real lib - erty of the individual has been immeasurably enlarged through the assumption of these activities by the city ... '' And all this has been achieved at an insignificant cost .

		The expenditure of the average city of over a quarter of a million inhabitants ranges from sixteen dol - lars to
thirty-four dollars	MONEY	per capita , or from
sixty dollars	MONEY	to one hundred and
thirty-six dollars	MONEY	per family , a simi which would scarcely pay for the education of a single child at a private institution . ''

		Yet these privileges are trifling compared with what might be enjoyed if the public possessed what the city has given away . ''

		The value of the physical property of the seven traction companies in
Chicago	LOCATION	has been appraised at # 44,922,011 ; while the market value of the securities issued by the corporations amoimts '' to § 120,235,539 ; the public debt of the city in
1900	DATE	was ^ 2,989,819 , or § 42,323,709 less than the value of the franchises of the traction interests alone . ''

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	's application of the single tax seems particularly plausible as a means of pro- viding revenue for the imremunerative functions which the public service corporations gladly ac - cord the city as legitimate municipal activities . ''

		Its immediate effect would be a stimulus to building .

		It would at once increase the house supply , it would encourage improvements which would then go untaxed .

		Moreover it would force land now lying idle into pro- ductive use .

		It would encourage the honorable and punish the slum landlord .

		It would place a premium upon the model tenement and a penalty on the shack .

		... Such a change could be inaugurated in any city by a law or ordinance exempting all improvements and personal property from taxation .

		... It seems destined by nature as a means of compensation for the costs of municipal Ufe ... During the years from
1885	DATE	to
1900	DATE	inclusive , in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, the total taxes levied for city , county , and state purposes upon real estate , improvements and personal property was J$ 84,252,058 , at the average rate of 85,265,753 per year .

		This is very much less than the annual speculative increase in the land alone .

		... In
New York	LOCATION	the increase in land values from
1904	DATE	to
1905	DATE	was 8140,000,000 , or 820 , - 000,000 more than the value of all the offices , hotels , apartment houses , and other structures , erected during the year .

		AVhile labor and capital added 8120,000,000 to the city 's wealth , the growth of population created 8140,000,000 . ''

		It is ungracious to find fault with such an invaluable contribution to municipal literature , but if democracy is to be attained it will be by eternal vigilance and exactness in the face of the 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, alert and often unscrupulous critic .

		Mr.
Howe	PERSON	is guileless when lie accepts President
Eliot	PERSON	's approval of the
St. Louis	LOCATION	school system , which though not corrupt is autocratic , and hence tends to perpetuate municipal corruption by adminis - trative inexperience .

		His democracy concedes too much when he says : '' If our cities must be governed by a boss , it is most desirable that he be an elective one . ''

		His enthusiasm for home rule causes him to ignore superior functional organization when he demands factory inspection as a municipal function , whereas if it is not well done by the state the logical change would be to federal , not local , administration .

		He appro - priates himseK an unearned increment when he gives to one of his chapters the title '' The City for the People , '' without crediting Professor
Frank Parsons	PERSON	with the authorship of that splen - did phrase , -- a species of literary piracy that is growing too common among our municipal writers .

		These are slips made conspicuous by the un - usual excellence of this most valuable of recent contributions to municipal subjects .

		Seldom does a writer so successfully justify an ambitious title ; rarely is a sentiment , which to many must be a contradiction , so ably defended ; and only at crucial epochs is it the privilege of a reformer to seize the psychological moment as Mr.
Howe	PERSON	seems to have done in his critical and prophetic claim that the city , hitherto abused by all of its enemies and many of its friends , is the hope of democracy .

		tions ; the text is a sort of pack-horse that limps under the binden of the be-pictiu-ed leaves .

		Such a lavish use of illustrations inclines one to depend upon them for a record of the things seen , rather than upon the reading matter .

		Out of this fact arises an interesting question : Has the descriptive power of writers declined with the rise of the art of photog - raphy ?

		May not the writer of books of travel feel that the camera makes sufficient evidence of what he has seen , and that laborious descriptive effort sup - plementing the camera Avill be lost on the reader ?

		At any rate , it is somewhat rare to find sustained passages of good description in recent travel books , -- passages in which the author forsakes the me - chanical kodak , in order to heighten and color his pages by the glow of his emotions and the imagi - native intensity that prompted him to take the picture of some beautiful scene .

		The question is at least an open one .

		In the way of evidence for our thesis that as the art of photography advances the ^ descriptive power of the writer declines , we would cite the first book on our present list . ''

		Flashlights in the Jungle , '' by the German naturalist
C. G. Schillings	PERSON	, is a good illus - tration of the mechanical talent that makes many modern descriptive books valuable .

		The autlior , who undertook several trips to German
East Africa	LOCATION	in search of sport and specimens for zoological collec - tions , added a unique feature to his hunting equip - ment .

		He devised special photographic apparatus for long range and flashlight work at night , that he might get Naturkunden -- nature documents -- of the intimate wild animal Hfe in equatorial
Africa	LOCATION	.

		That his apparatus was well devised is attested by more than three hundred reproductions of his pho - tographs .

		To see a picture of a lioness about to spring on an ox , or one of a bull elephant making his last charge before death , or one of three old lionesses at a brook , is to realize that the photographer is a daring hunter and a venturesome naturalist .

		Dr.
Schillings	PERSON	is , however , more than a mere photogra - pher of savage animal life , and his book can not be wholly regarded as a mere picture-book ; he is a scientist , and his accounts of his hunting trips are marked by acute observations on the habits of the ani - mals he hunted with gun and camera .

		It is probably no exaggeration to say that this is the most remark - able book of wUd animal photogi * aphy that has ever been printed , but there our praise is inclined to stop .

		We can commend the laborious efforts of Mr.
Schil	PERSON	- lings in gathering his elaborate scientific data , but we can hardly praise his narrative or descriptive skill .

		We forbear to say more about this interesting book , that we may give a long quotation to show the spirit of the author and the quality of his work . ''

		I had taken several pictures successfully with my telephoto-lens , when suddenly for some reason the animals -LSB- rhinoceroses -RSB- stood up quickly , both together as is their - wont .

		Almost simultaneously , the farther of the two , an old cow , began moving the front part of her body to and fro , and then , followed by the bull with head high in the air , came straight for me at full gallop .

		I had instinctively felt what would happen , and in a moment my rifle was in my hands
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 and my camera passed to my bearers .

		I fired six shots and saeceeded in bringing down both animals twice as they mshed towards me -- great furrows in the sand of the velt showed where they fell .

		My final shot I fired in the absolute cer - tainty that my last hour had come .

		It hit the cow on the nape of the neck and at the same moment I sprang to the right , to the other side of the brier-bush .

		My two men had taken to flight by this time , but one of the Masai ran across my path at this critical moment and sprang right into the bush .

		He had evidently waited in the expectation of seeing the rhinoceros fall dead at the last moment , as he had so often seen before .

		With astounding agility the rhinoceroses followed me , and half way round the bush I found myself be - tween the two animals .

		It seems incredible now that I tell the tale in cold blood , but in that same instant my shots took effect mortally , and both rhinoceroses collapsed .

		I made away from the bush about twenty paces when a frantic cry coming simultaneously from my men ... made me turn round .

		A very singular sight greeted my eyes .

		There was the
Masai	LOCATION	, trembling all over , his face distorted with terror , backing for all he was worth inside the bush , while the cow rhinoceros , streaming with blood , stood literally leaning up against it , and the bull , almost touching , lay dying on the ground , its mighty head beating repeatedly in its death agony against the hard red soil of the velt ... As quickly as possible I reloaded , and with three final shots made an end of both animals .

		... It was indeed a very narrow escape .

		It left an impression on my mind which Avill not be easily erased .

		Even now in fancy I sometimes live those moments over again . ''

		The volume contains a sympathetic introduction by Sir
H. H. Johnston	PERSON	, who is another mighty hunter of African beasts .

		It seems rather odd and incon - gruous that both the author and the introductory writer should lament the wanton extermination of African big game by sportsmen , when one sees the pictures in the volume and notes the large nvunber of animals killed by the hunters of this expedition .

		Science probably demands as many dead animals as the sportsman , but it can cloak its butchery under a more legitimate garb . ''

		A Yankee in Pigmy Land , '' by
William Edgar Getl	PERSON	, is also a book on
Africa	LOCATION	, telling the story of a journey across that country from
Mombasa	LOCATION	on the eastern coast to Banana on the western coast .

		That part of the volimie dealing with the eastern section contains but little new matter .

		The author describes the
Uganda	LOCATION	region , dwelling largely on the mission - ary problems , the atrocities of
Congo	LOCATION	land , the sleep - ing sickness -LRB- a sort of living death -RRB- , and gives some hunting tales .

		But the real value of his journey lies in bis account of the home and habits of the little brown Tom Thumbs of the great Pigmy Forest .

		ISlr .

		GeU evidently found the real Pigmies , and not the Dwarfs who are often confused with their more inter - esting countrymen . ''

		Their average height , '' says Mr.
Geil	PERSON	, '' is forty-eight inches .

		The Pigmies have well-developed eyebrows , while other black people have almost no eyebrows .

		I said ' black ' people , but I have seen very few black people in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		The Pigmies are not black ; they are brown with black hair , and all that I have seen have been well devel - oped on the chest . ''

		These little freaks of humanity have some extraordinary qualities , not least among them being the engaging sense of fun . ''

		Not in all
Africa	LOCATION	have I heard so much fun .

		This is the
Xand of Laughter	ORGANIZATION	.

		This Is the Forest of Fun .

		The natives I have met since crossing the line into
Congo	LOCATION	have been sober - faced ; there has been little cheerfulness and no merriment , but these freedom-loving Pigmies , the freest people on earth , are to this vast woodland and its human population what the blithe Shans are to the grave Chinese who live in the far West of the
Celestial Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		The mysterious fun was not momen - tary , but continuous .

		The Pigmies like to have a good time , and thev have it .

		They are the merriest people in the
Shade	LOCATION	- land . ''

		We fear , however , that Mr.
Geil	PERSON	's own sense of hmnor is blunt -- we dislike to say that he is con - ceited , -- for among his hundred and more excellent photographic reproductions is one of himself , labelled '' the greatest living traveller . ''

		Other pictures show him as the central figure with his name in large letters on his portmanteau .

		One photograph depicts him plapng the legendary
William Tell	ORGANIZATION	in the act of shooting a banana off a native 's head !

		Mr.
L. March Phillips	PERSON	, in his book entitled '' In the Desert , '' is concerned with two somewhat unre - lated topics : the French scheme of colonization for
Algiers	LOCATION	, and the influence of the
Sahara	LOCATION	desert on Arab life , architecture , religion , poetry , and philos - ophy .

		The present strained relation between
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	concerning affairs in
North Africa	LOCATION	makes the first topic of timely interest .

		The author justifies the French in their scheme of colonizing the desert , and asserts that '' every move in
France	LOCATION	's policy during the last fifteen or twenty years has been opportune . ''

		Her colonists , `` possessing the soil they cultivate , overspread the land ; industries , public works , improvements , are pushed forward with vigor and intelligence . ''

		In his thesis that the Arab character is the outcome of the influence of the desert , ISIr .

		Phillips g ^ ves us a sketch of the effect of the desert life on himself , and applies his expe - rience to that of the Arab . ''

		What I came to feel more and more strongly as time went on was the extraordinarily stimulating and exciting effect of the desert and the desert climate on the one hand , and its entire lack of anything substantial and definite to think about and feed the mind with , on the other ... So , I used to think , the strength and weakness of the Arab were alike dis - played in the desert .

		All the influences that stimulated his nerves and starved his intellect were round one there .

		In his successes -- his frantic conquests and frantic art and science -- is the stored up force of the desert 's nervous energy .

		In the decline and disintegration of all his power and all his labor is the desert 's fatal incoherence . ''

		If we grant -LRB- and we feel that we must do so when reading the author 's vivid descriptions -RRB- that the desert is chai * acterized by spaciousness , deadness , vast monot - ony , sterility , and primitiveness , then we can readily understand how the empty life of the desert working for countless generations has had its consequences in Arab character .

		Such a plausible thesis makes the Arab a being who despises odds , who has a fortitude that smUes at wounds and death , who is `` proud , fiercely militant , vengeful , courteous too , and digni - fied and generous , but lacking such virtues as pa - tience , long suffering , gentleness , modesty , humility , seK-sacrifice . ''

		Hence , the Arab 's poetry is like his life -- always in the ballad-poetry stage , the poetry of action , not of thought ; his religion is the religion of the sword ; and his architecture is indefinite and 234 THE DIAL -LSB- AprH 1 , unsubstantial , serving largely as a vehicle for rich colors .

		Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	has thus carried Taine 's theory to its limits ; and whatever may be its shortcomings in this particular instance , the author has made an entertaining contribution to our knowledge of Arab life and art .

		Enthusiasm , spontaneity , kindly humor , and a sprightly style characterize the volume entitled '' In Further Ardenne '' with the auxiliary title '' A Study of the Grand Duchy of
Luxemburg	LOCATION	, '' by the
Rever	PERSON	- end
T. H. Passmore	PERSON	.

		This tiny principality , pinched in between
France	LOCATION	,
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Prussia	LOCATION	, and
Lorraine	PERSON	, has had a history out of all proportion to its size , for it has seen and endured the whole pageant of European events .

		Druid flamen , Celtic war-man , Roman lording , feudal baron , and modern diplomat have all laid their hands upon it ; and yet , so says Mr.
Passmore	PERSON	, the Grand Duchy of
Luxemburg	LOCATION	has '' never for a moment lost its distinctive individu - ality . ''

		There still survive , untrammeled even by the ubiquitous tourist , her romance , folk-song , folk - dance , and folk-lore , and it is with these that Mr.
Passmore	PERSON	is primarily concerned .

		With him we wander in search of the quaint and picturesque -- two words the author eschews -- in this old land , '' wide and quiet and peaceable . ''

		He asks us for the merry heart that will go a mile or twain , for '' a love of unspoilt uncrowded sweet earth-corners , an open mind about other people 's religious notions , and even a capacity to think a little occasionally , in a dreamy way . ''

		One of the unique sights described in the book is the
Springprozession	LOCATION	, a religious dance , of
Echternach	LOCATION	.

		This dancing to God 's glory , the origin of which is lost in disputes , is in part described by Mr.
Passmore	PERSON	as follows : `` This Dance of Degrees , the whole with the sick , the old with the young , counteracting their own progress and yet progressing , sweating yet ascending , faint yet pursuing ... The burning sun beats on them , the heaven over them is brass , now and again one swoons and must fall out ; but the dogged escalade goes on .

		Meanwhile the leaders have danced into the church , laid down their offerings , and are wheeling around the altar-shrine , swaying still where the Saint lies sleeping .

		When all have passed this way , a solemn Salut crowns the day ; which done , the Host-blessed pUgrims issue from the church , dancing as ever , to set seal to their vow with triple circling round the great sad Christ who hangs upon the churchyard cross . ''

		We had occasion in a former review to speak favorably of Mr.
Jerome Hart	PERSON	's '' Two Argonauts in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' and we are now pleased to say that we are still more highly pleased by the excellent quali - ties of the same author 's latest book , entitled '' A Levantine Log Book . ''

		Mr.
Hart	PERSON	made a stay of two seasons in the regions of the
Eastern Mediterranean	LOCATION	, stopping at
Naples	LOCATION	,
Malta	LOCATION	,
Constantinople	LOCATION	,
Smyrna	LOCATION	,
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, and
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		One does not expect much that is new concerning these places , so when a trav - eller bids for one 's commendations on his notebook of travels , his view-point must be refreshing and individual .

		These qualities Mr.
Hart	PERSON	supplies in abimdance .

		He can and does write intelligently , but he excels most in the genial himior that brings a smile with almost every page .

		We wish our space permitted us to quote the entire chapter on '' The Breeks of the Turks , '' or the diverting chapter enti - tled '' Spots Where , '' or the description of
Smyrna	LOCATION	; but we must choose a shorter excerpt which describes the entourage of the Sultan when he is returning from his devotions at the mosque . ''

		Now comes a curious sight .

		As his horses ascend the hill at a quick trot his generals , his pashas , his colonels , and his ministers keep pace with his horses .

		The courtiers are clad in scarlet and bullion , in blue and silver , in green and gold ; they are gray , grizzled , and old , but they run like so many school-boys behind and on either side of the imperial carriage .

		Fortunately the run is not a long one , for many of the pashas are fat and scant of breath .

		But no matter how old or how fat , all who are not absolutely disabled run by their master 's carriage .

		Obesity is not an exemption ; old age is not a release .

		There is no apology but partial paralysis ; no excuse but locomotor ataxia .

		This is perhaps the Oriental courtier 's way of indicating enthusiastic loyalty .

		Courtiers have always had to do humiliating things , with joyful faces , in monarchies .

		Perhaps they do still -- perhaps even in republics .

		But what a fantastic spectacle -- a lot of uniformed and elderly digni - taries running up hill on a hot day -- a troop of perspiring and pot-bellied pashas sprinting after their padishah ! ''

		In form and illustrations the book is as pleasing to the eye as the text is to the mind .

		Whoever has read of the great region lying north of
India	LOCATION	knows that every book dealing with it will contain two features : descriptions of the vast , unin - habited wastes , of the paralyzing cold of the gla - cier regions , and the burning heat of the deserts ; and , secondly , of the eternal political question as to who shall rule the region ,
England	LOCATION	or
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Oscar Terry Crosby	PERSON	's volume , ``
Tibet	LOCATION	and Turkestan , '' is no exception .

		Mr.
Crosby	PERSON	's description of the countries named is familiar , and his discussion of the political aspect is independent .

		Accompanied by Captain Anginieur of the
French Army	ORGANIZATION	, the author made his trip in the latter part of
1903	DATE	, traversing the region from the
Caspian Sea through Turkestan	LOCATION	to the Tibetan Plateau .

		Such a route invites many hardships , and Mr.
Crosby	PERSON	tells us the difficulties encountered on this journey were '' in every respect more severe than those experienced in a considerable journey in
Africa	LOCATION	-- from
Somaliland	LOCATION	to
Khartoum	LOCATION	. ''

		In one part of their journey they travelled for forty days through uninhabited wastes , eleven days of that time being spent on the cheer - less verge of starvation .

		The greater part of the book deals with the political aspects , especially of
Tibet	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Crosby	PERSON	sees little to fear in the Yellow Peril , evidently believing it to be prompted by diplo - matic motives .

		The religion , the history , and the peculiar institution of polyandric marriage of
Tibet	LOCATION	are treated fully and
weU	ORGANIZATION	.

		Of
England	LOCATION	's aggres - siveness in
Tibet	LOCATION	, and
Younghusband	PERSON	's raid , Mr.
Crosby	PERSON	says : '' The raid into
Tibet	LOCATION	I believe to have been wild , not capable of bearing good fruit .

		Its occupation is not necessary to the preservation of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	's peace ; nor would it conduce to the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	's prosperity .

		Any harm that could possibly come out of
Tibet	LOCATION	could be met , at the moment of its appearance , at less moral and material cost than by years of repression and injustice based on mere suspicion . ''

		THE DIAL 235 The volume contains an almost entire alphabet of appendices , one of which gives some interesting ex - amples of Tibetan songs . ''

		The Great Plateau '' is the appropriate title of
Captain C. G. Rawling	ORGANIZATION	's volume which recounts his two journeys of exploration into central
Tibet	LOCATION	made in
1903	DATE	and
1904-5	DATE	. ''

		The first expedition , '' says the author , `` penetrated into the uninhabited and barren regions of the
Northern Desert	LOCATION	at a time when
Tibet	LOCATION	was rigidly closed to foreigners .

		The second led through the rich , thickly-populated valleys of the
Brahmaputra	LOCATION	, and was made with the cognisance and permission of the
Lhasa Government	ORGANIZATION	, though only rendered possible by the notable success of Sir Fran - cis
Younghusband	PERSON	's mission . ''

		The result of the first expedition was Captain
Rawling	PERSON	's correct mapping of 35,000 square miles of hitherto unknown and unexplored country .

		The purpose of the second expe - dition was to determine the possibilities of
Gartok	LOCATION	, the capital of western
Tibet	LOCATION	, as a trade mart , and to survey the route so '' that proposals for opening other marts should be based on accurate information . ''

		This undertaking , made under all the usual attendant difiiculties of travel in that region , resulted in find - ing that
Gartok	PERSON	was a village of '' three good-sized houses and twelve miserable hovels '' !

		Such , how - ever , is the scramble for precedence and prestige among the industrial and political giants .

		To those who are interested in the development and the geo - graphy of
Tibet	LOCATION	the volume will contain some new features , but the general reader will find small profit in the book .

		We are at a loss to account for the difference in the literary quality of the two accounts of Captain Rawling 's journeys .

		The story of the first expedition is a weary tale of countless marches and camps , but the account of the
Gartok	PERSON	expedition has at least the g ^ ace of vivacity and freshness .

		Mr.
A. B. De GuervUle	PERSON	, the author of ''
New Egypt	LOCATION	, '' seems to be one who is able to break through the hedges that surround the divinely-appointed affairs of many foreign places .

		In his own words he obtained his information about the new
Egypt	LOCATION	from '' highly placed personages in the Egyptian world , English , French , natives , and others ; these men , keen and talented , who in palaces , ministries , lega - tions , schools , hospitals , bands , or large industrial concerns , are working without ceasing for the regen - eration of
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		I have knocked at all doors , rich and poor , high and low , and everywhere a warm welcome has awaited me . ''

		We are pleased with the frank personality of the author , and we are impressed and entertained by his book .

		Not for a long time have we read a book of travel that is so very inter - esting and refreshingly instructive .

		There is nothing new in Mr.
De Guerville	PERSON	's itinerary ; he took the usual trip from
Alexandria	LOCATION	to
Cairo	LOCATION	, thence to
Luxor	LOCATION	,
Karnac	PERSON	,
Assouan	LOCATION	,
Khartoum	LOCATION	, and Fashoda -- now called
Kodok	PERSON	.

		His account of these places is inter - spersed with facts relative to the French in
Egypt	LOCATION	, the pleasures of
Cairo	LOCATION	,
Ismail	PERSON	and his reign , the com - mercial and industrial life of the land , and the social .

		religious , and political conditions in this rapidly changing country .

		The Renaissance has apparently come to
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		For
France	LOCATION	's share in Eg ^ ypt 's devel - opment he has a smile and a tear ; for
England	LOCATION	's protectorate over
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Lord Cromer	ORGANIZATION	's wise administration he has only words of praise .

		`` JNew
Egypt	LOCATION	'' means the industrial prosperity that has fol - lowed the flag of
England	LOCATION	.

		Even the
Sudan	LOCATION	, which General
Gordon	PERSON	described in
1884	DATE	as `` an abso - lutely useless possession , has always been so , and always will be so , '' bids fair to become a garden spot , if the plans of irrigation do not fail .

		We commend the book for its valuable information , for its pungent style , and for its sprightly gossip about things Egyp - tian .

		We shall await with pleasure the author 's promised volimae to be entitled ''
Egypt	LOCATION	Intime . ''

		The raison d'etre -- and it is a sufficient reason -- of Mr.
A. H. Hallam Murray	PERSON	's volume called '' The High-Road of Empire '' is the plethora of beautiful water-color and pen-and-ink sketches which the author-artist made along the highways of the fasci - nating lands of
India	LOCATION	and
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such a journey , when made in the leisurely manner that the brush and pencil demand , through a land that appeals to artist and writer alike by `` its glorious architecture , its unique landscapes , its rich historic associations , and above all its strangely interesting people , '' offers much that is unusual , when the writer can make his somewhat commonplace experience alive by a re - served enthusiasm .

		This Mr.
Murray	PERSON	has done .

		He went from
Bombay	LOCATION	to
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	by the devious way of
Poona	LOCATION	,
Bijapur	PERSON	, AUabahad ,
Calcutta	LOCATION	.


Benares	LOCATION	, Luck - now ,
Cawnpore	LOCATION	, to
Agra	LOCATION	,
Delhi	LOCATION	,
Lahore	LOCATION	, and
Jodh	PERSON	- pur , and whatever struck his fancy he described in colors , in line-drawings , or with his pen .

		As many travellers and writers on
India	LOCATION	have done , Mr.
Mur	PERSON	- ray dwells at some length on
Benares	LOCATION	, the wonderful city of squalor and beauty , where the heart of old
India	LOCATION	beats most perceptibly in the swarming mass of humanity which gathers there at all seasons , to dip into and drink of the filthy pools or ghats of the
Ganges	LOCATION	, the mother of life . ''

		The river bank is a marvellous sight .

		The Ghats , in flight after flight of irregular steps , descend a hundred feet to the water 's edge .

		Here and there the steps widen out into terraces , and on them are temples and shrines of all sorts and sizes .

		The clifiP is crowned by high houses and palaces , which culminate in domes and minarets .

		Here and there a palace or temple breaks away from the main line , and projecting forward , descends with solid breastworks of masonry to the water 's edge , where every variety of native craft lies moored . ''

		Such a scene catches the artist 's eye and demands a clever brush ; but the following human touch is beyond the artist 's skiU , and requires only a little less skill in the handling of words : '' I was charmed by one scene in particular which we watched .

		Two graceful women in bright-coloured silk saris came down the steps , each carrying on her arm a folded sari of a different hue .

		Leaving this on the brink , they stepped down as they were into the sacred water and drank and dipped .

		Coming back to the steps in wet garments , they wound them off , and simultaneously , by the same mysterious movement , clothed themselves in the fresh silk drapery with which they had come provided .

		The process of transf orma - 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, tion was as elusive and complete as that by which a snow - capped mountain is changed at the afterglow .

		Then taking the strip of wet drapery , and deftly gathering it in narrow folds crosswise in either hand , they went back to their daily occupations . ''

		Many such little descriptive sketches enhance the interest and value of Mr.
MuiTay	PERSON	's sumptuous vol - ume , which contains over forty excellent illustrations reproduced by the three-color process , and about one hundred pen-and-ink sketches .

		The publishers are to be praised for their part in the production of a book that is unusually pleasing in every detail .


H. E. COBLENTZ	PERSON	.

		Briefs on New Books .

		A charming ^ ^ ' ^ ^ ^ ^ extremely vivacious and in - French hostess teresting throng of men and women and her circle .

		^ \ ^ ^ passes before us in the pages of Miss
Janet Aldis	PERSON	's `` Madame Geoffrin and her Salon '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The author is an amiable and com - municative cicerone , and as we run on lightly from chapter to chapter of her gossipy account we feel somewhat as one might , who , ignorant of the lan - guage of the animated talkers , should by some magic be privileged to be present , invisible , at those eighteenth centm-y dinners .

		Our guide points out the hostess or names the various guests , with an anecdote or a story that engages our interest and makes us feel in a manner acquainted with each .

		This silent and somewhat superfluous old man is the hostess 's husband , whom death will soon dis - creetly remove .

		Here is d'Alembert , legitimate child of his century , if not of other parents ; there is FonteneUe , who has lived out nearly a fuU cen - tury and is yet not the least gay and witty of the company .

		This is
Denis Diderot	PERSON	, unkempt and uncourtly , but original and full of matter ; that is
Grimm	LOCATION	, snapping up every bit of literary gossip , and not always stopping at that kind , for his next letter to `` a sovereign of
Germany	LOCATION	. ''

		And as we observe the company our guide explains from time to time the jest that has just raised the laugh , the paradox that has provoked such eager challenge and discus - sion , or the clever tale that has been crowned with such general applause .

		We feel that these are interesting people , and that we should like to know them better , and that if we knew their language and could follow their talk we should get a really inform - ing glimpse into that bubbling cauldron in which the witches ' broth of the revolution was brewing .

		And this remains our feeling when we leave them .

		We have not been taught their language ; we have not penetrated into the intimacy of their deeper purposes and more serious convictions ; and the pic - ture , for all its appearance of life , makes somewhat the impression of a composite photogi-aph .

		A great many salons , a great many groups of persons , shift - ing from year to year , have contributed to it .

		We are made but vaguely aware of the passing of time by the touches it leaves on one or another of the faces .

		We get no adequate suggestion of the rapid movement of ideas and events between the years
1750	DATE	and
1777	DATE	which bound the period of
Madame Geoff	ORGANIZATION	rin 's reign .

		But perhaps these shortcomings are the necessary defects of the book 's good quali - ties , and we readily allow that the latter are quite sufficient to commend it .

		It was worth whUe to give this glimpse of a very remarkable woman and the very remarkable circle that she gathered about her , and to persuade us that the guests at
Madame Geoffrin	ORGANIZATION	's table were charming and interesting people , removed as far as possible from dulness , dryness , and pedantry , and well worth our better acquaintance .

		The course of
Lowell Institute lee	ORGANIZATION	- ^ infaZs .

		t ^ res to which Professor
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	has given '' The Torch '' for a collective title -LRB- McClure -RRB- is based upon a highly abstract and metaphysical conception .

		The opening sentences state the author 's fundamental thesis .

		`` It belongs to a highly developed race to become , in a true sense , aristocratic -- a treasury of its best in practical and spiritual types , and then to disappear in the surrounding tides of men .

		So
Athens	LOCATION	dissolved like a pearl in the cup of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, and
Rome	LOCATION	in the cup of
Europe	LOCATION	, and
Judea	LOCATION	in the cup of the
Universal Communion	ORGANIZATION	.

		Though death is the law of all life , man touches this earthen fact with the wand of his spirit , and transforms it into the law of sacrifice .

		Man has won no victory over his environment so sublime as this , finding in his mortal sentence the true choice of the soul and in the road out of Paradise the open highway of eternal life . ''

		A work thus solemnly preluded is sxire to prove in - tensely serious of character , and the high note of idealism thus sounded at the outset is maintained to the last .

		The first lecture expounds in the most general terms this doctrine of the race-mind , with literature for its organ , which persists while race after race passes away .

		The second lectui-e deals more specifically with literature as '' the language of all the world '' rather than as the language of this or that people . ''

		History is mortal : it dies .

		Yet it does not altogether die .

		Elements , features , fragments of it survive , and enter into the eternal memory of the race , and are there transformed , and -- as we say -- spiritualized .

		Literature is the abiding-place of this transforming power , and most profits by it . ''

		The two lectures following are upon '' The Titan-Myth , '' and complete the unfolding of the author 's funda - mental thought .

		Then follow four lectures dealing specifically with
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Milton	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and
Shelley	PERSON	, each of whom is considered as a special ex - ponent of the racial inheritance of spiritual energy .

		Perhaps the essence of Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's teaching is to be found in these earnest words : '' Honesty is nowhere more essential than in literary study ; hypocrisy , there , may have terrible penalties , not merely in foolishness , but in misfortune ; and to lie to oneself about oneself is the most fatal lie .

		The stages of life must be taken in their order ; but finally you will discover the blessed fact that the world of literature is one of diminishing books -- since the greater are found to contain the less , for which reason time itself sifts the relics of the past and leaves at last only a Homer for centuries of early
Greece	LOCATION	, a
Dante	ORGANIZATION	for his

		THE DIAL 237 entire age , a
Milton	LOCATION	for a whole system of thought .

		To understand and appreciate such g ^ reat writers is the goal ; but the way is by making honest use of the authors that ap - peal to us in the most living ways . ''

		Wanderings There are those who assert that oar on the WeUh Word '' saimtcrer '' is derived from borderland .

		u g ^ jjg terre , '' -- without home or coun - try ; while others hold that it comes from `` Sainte Terrer , '' the pious pUgrim or a '' ' holy lander . ''

		To all who have cultivated the art of sauntering and have practised it in some district of
Great Britain	LOCATION	where the natural scenery is attractive and where the mind is kept occupied without being excited , and have found sauntering the finest of all tonics , mental , physical , or spiritual , the preference is for the latter derivation , whatever the etymologists may decide .

		And from the nmnber of recent books descriptive of leisurely journeys through various districts in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, rich in historic interest and antiquarian lore as well as in natural scenerj ' , the membership in the guild of saimterers is by no means decreasing .

		Mr.
A. G. Bradley	PERSON	is an accomplished saunterer .

		He knows the
Lake District and North	ORGANIZATION	and
South Wales	LOCATION	by personal leisurely inspection , and has writ - ten several books about those regions .

		The latest record of his wanderings is a volume entitled • ' In the
March	DATE	and Borderland of Wales '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	is at some pains to defend the apparent tautology of his title , '' march '' meaning border or frontier ; and he describes jour - neys in
Herefordshire	LOCATION	and Monmouthshire in En - gland , and Montgoraerj ` shire and Glamorganshire in
Wales	LOCATION	, and into districts on both sides of the pres - ent boundary of
Wales	LOCATION	which were once the scenes of exploits of
Owen Glyndwr	PERSON	, a Welsh patriot of the fifteenth centurj - whose life Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	has dealt with in a previous volume .

		The author 's descriptions and the sketches of his artist companion , Mr.
W. M. Meredith	PERSON	, must excite in all readers of the volume an interest in this portion of the Welsh borderland that will be g ^ tified with nothing less than a visit to
Hereford	ORGANIZATION	and its vicinity .

		The author of ^ ^
Thomas Browne	PERSON	was one of the `` Reiigio men who lived apart in the troublous ifedict . ''

		times of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, who allowed himself to be as little disturbed by the civil dissensions of Roimdheads and Cavaliers as he was untouched by the excesses of the Restoration .

		He dwelt quietly at
Norwich	LOCATION	, practising his profession and investigating vulgar errors , interesting himself in sepulchral urns , and enquiring into his religious views as a physician .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	in his recent volume in the • • English Men of Lettere '' series -LRB- MacmUlan -RRB- once more brings out what has already been remarked by others , that
Browne	PERSON	has not contributed anything of importance to medical science or to philosophical or religious thought .

		It is to his genius as a stylist that Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	attributes his rank among the great writers of English .

		And even here he is not beyond adverse criticism , for so thoroughly was he drenched in
Latin	LOCATION	that he carried over almost bodily words that have only their Latin parentage to speak for them .

		Many of them f aUed of adoption and are to-day but '' wild enormities '' of misdirected scholarship .

		Where Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	fails in his estimate is in not suffi - ciently recognizing the essentially poetic quality of
Browne	PERSON	's work , apart from mere form or style .

		He does not bring out what Professor
Dowden	PERSON	calls the two elements of
Browne	PERSON	's divinity , -- wonder and love ; that like a poet his appeal was to the emotions and the imagination .

		This was the body , as it were , which was clothed in the magnificent trappings of his style ; for the prose of '' Reiigio Medici '' and of the '' Urn-Burial '' is almost as splendid as Mil - ton 's .

		It was his familiarity with Latin that gave him such a conmiand of sonorous prose , just as it did the other great prose writers of his age .

		Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	does not attempt any analysis of this style , a task he might well have undertaken , even if suggestive of the text-book .

		The absence of a bibliography is the grievous fault this book shares with the other vol - umes of the same series .

Alexander Innes Shand	PERSON	in his joumaiut .

		u D ^ y g of the Past '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		Bom and bred in
Scotland	LOCATION	, he devoted a dozen years to sport , continental travel , and other distractions , and then , after a year of law practice in
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, crossed the border and eventually found employment as a
London	LOCATION	journalist , being connected with the ''
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' the '' Times , '' and other less noted journals , and associating with the literary cele - brities of his time .

		Travel , hunting , fishing , and gas - tronomy appear to have shared his affections with literature .

		Of his sixteen chapters , all but one , which treats of operations on the stock exchange , contain references to the pleasures of the table ; and the third chapter , `` The Evolution of the Hotel and Restaurant , ** is verj ' largely devoted thereto .

		The author writes in a rapid , readable style , and draws on an ample store of personal experience in many lands , although his ad - ventures never approach the thrilling , or even the extraordinary .

		Apart from his two chapters of '' Lit - erary Recollections , '' and the one on `` Friends of the Athenaeum , '' the book contains little that calls loudly for publication .

		The critical reader will perhaps note a curious expression on the very first page , where the writer , referring to late improvements in
Aberdeen	LOCATION	- shire , says he remembers '' much of the devolution of the transformation . ''

		Why '' devolution '' ?

		Half-way through the volume , passing from the Scotch clergy to the English army , he writes : '' From ministers to messes is a sharp transition , but I must own that , as the Americans say , there was a time when I had more truck with the one than with the other . ''

		Are we really guilty of this unrefined locution ?

		It is new to the present reviewer .

		But it is not much worse than the expression '' cock-arhoop , '' which the author allows himself , with no apologetic quotation marks , and with no disclaimer of its native origin .

		.

		... , '' • '' / > , .

		on public collective title oi a series ot live dis - probiems .

		courses by Dr.
Washington Gladden	PERSON	, recently published by
Messrs. Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first essay , which gives the title to the book , deals with the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount , -- those gi'eat principles of personal character that from the days of Plato have been acknowledged as fitting the individual for the highest social relations .

		The author then passes to the consideration of human brotherhood involved in the words '' Our Father who art in heaven , '' contrasting this with the concept of industrial society .

		It may perhaps be questioned whether the economic concept is fairly stated ; its highest attainment has not yet been reached and the more economic society becomes , the more the crying wrongs of society are eliminated .

		The following chapter on '' Labor Wars '' is good Christianity and good economics ; while `` The Programme of Social - ism , '' the third discourse , is a clear exposition of socialistic principles , both established and debated .

		The purpose to exalt the idea of compromise be - tween the opposing tendencies is both worthy and characteristic of the eminent clerical author .

		Per - haps the best thing is the passage -- too long for quotation -- showing that socialism and atheism are in no way connected .

		The chapter on `` True Social - ism '' gives the noble ideal of regarding work , what - ever its nature or rank , as a social function .

		The final pages , on '' Municipal Reform , '' contain a rapid sketch of what has recently been done and what remains to do , sounding for all citizens the earnest warning to put intelligence , honesty , and unselfish - ness into the
City Hall	LOCATION	if their fruits in city govern - ment are to be expected .

		Like all Dr.
Gladden	PERSON	's utterances , these discourses are characterized by what has been well termed '' sanctified common sense '' and are thoroughly stimidating and suggestive .

		Seashore life on the eastern coast .

		The first number of the
New York	LOCATION	Aquarium Series -LRB-
Barnes	PERSON	-RRB- is a vol - ume on `` Sea-shore Life '' by Dr.
Alfred G. Mayer	PERSON	, Director of the
Marine Biological Laboratory	ORGANIZATION	of the Carnegie Institution at
Tortugas	LOCATION	,
Florida	LOCATION	, and is devoted to the invertebrates of the
New York	LOCATION	coast and the adjacent coast region .

		The work is intended for readers who have had no technical biological training , and its aim is to `` in - crease intelligent interest in the habits and life - histories of marine animals and to disseminate a knowledge of their appearance and relationship . ''

		The author makes a serious attempt to coin new vernacular names for animals to which only a Latin binomial has been hitherto attached , after the cus - tom of English naturalists .

		The work has an edu - cational value in connection with the aquarium in
New York	LOCATION	and the museum collections there and in other cities , and has added interest from the natural history contained in its pages and the many original illustrations .

		Many references to pertinent litera - ture are scattered throughout the text , and biblio - graphical references pertaining to the more impor - tant species are given at the end of the volume .

		Specialists may quarrel with some cases in the author 's nomenclature or seek more light on some of his statements , but all will agree that the book is a welcome addition to the literature of the sea ^ shore .

		A glimpse of ^ ^ ^ , popular evening lectures of the the ancient Christmas holidays before the Royal animal world .

		Institution of
London	LOCATION	have been a fruitful source of excellent books dealing with some phases of scientific learning brought up to date , and freed of technical terminology and abstruse reason - ing .

		One of the most readable and timely of these contributions to popular science is Professor
E. Ray Lankester	PERSON	's '' Extinct Animals '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , which the author regards as nothing more ambitious than an attempt to excite in young people an interest in a most fascinating study , that of the animals of past ages .

		The book is cast in conversational form , enliv - ened by anecdote and illumined by over two hun - dred excellent illustrations , some of them original , and many of them now seen for the first time outside of technical publications .

		The proportion of time - honored cuts is very small , and the figures are well chosen .

		The relations of these animals of the past to the living world are frequently emphasized , and the ways in which fossils are formed are clearly shown .

		We find here the story of the evolution of the elephant , brought to light in recent years by palaeontological explorations in
Egypt	LOCATION	, which in sci - entific interest bids fair to outrank the well-known evolution of the horse made famous by
Huxley	LOCATION	.

		The work is authoritative , quite up to date , and on the whole one of the best popular accounts of the life of the ancient world in print .

		Nature essays and pictures . ''

		The Prairie and the Sea '' is some - what of a misnomer for the collection of miscellaneous outdoor sketches by Mr.
William A. Quayle	PERSON	, which are published , in a volume embellished with a wealth of photographic reproductions , by
Messrs. Jennings & Graham	ORGANIZATION	.

		The half-dozen photographers who have collaborated with Mr.
Quayle	PERSON	have done thoroughly artistic work in picturing both the smaller and the larger aspects of the world about which he writes .

		Mr.
Quayle	PERSON	's point of view is the rather hackneyed one of the nature - lover who , having been born a country-boy , knows a good deal about the out-door world , and , having grown up a sentimentalist , is full of quaint conceits and fancies about it .

		He does not go far enough in the sober study of natural history to enrich his work , after the fashion of Mr.
Bradford Torrey	PERSON	, with unique discoveries in the realms of plant and animal life .

		His enthusiasm for the beauties of nature seems therefore at times a little empty , and his literary style lacks the grace and piquancy needed to carry off a difficult situation perfectly .

		However , this is only saying that his work belongs to the gi'eat average output of nature essays -- not striking , but thor -

Edward Robins	PERSON	's life of Wil - portrayed .

		^ iaja T ,
Sherman	PERSON	in the series of `` American Crisis Biographies '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Much of this interest and charm comes from the character of the subject , the irascible , outspoken , independent soldier , and his imique and exciting career ; but much comes also from the skilful work of the author .

		He has made an excellent portrait of the great soldier , giving the shadows as well as the lights .

		He makes the reader see the vindictiveness of
Greneral Shemuui	PERSON	, his prejudices , and the lack of tact that made him numberless enemies for a time ; but he makes us see , too , the essential greatness of the man as weU as the soldier , a character that finally conquered hostility at the South as well as at the North , and the singular attractiveness of his essentially fine spirit and bril - liant mind .

		The book is an excellent outline history of those campaigns of the Civil War in the West and South in which General
Sherman	PERSON	took part , espe - cially of the world-famed march through
Greorgia	LOCATION	.

nineteenth century	DATE	, and many , from
Tennyson	LOCATION	down , have since written in its praise .

		Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	gives us rather less than half of the entire work , accounting for this mutilation by saying that the omitted stanzas '' deal with uninteresting theological or allegorical material . ''

April 1	DATE	, A little book on

John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sixteen illustrations have been supplied by Mr.

		In this connection we may note that Mr.
Mortimer Menpes	PERSON	and his daughter are preparing a '' portrait bio - graphy '' of Irving , with illustrations in color , which the
MacmUlan Co.	ORGANIZATION	are to publish some time during the year . ''

		The only complete copyright text in one volume '' of the poetical works of Byron comes to us from Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		It contains the gist of the edi - torial matter in Mr.
Ernest Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	's defini - tive seven-volume edition of the poems , completed a year or two ago , and will thus prove a boon to those who could not avail themselves of the earlier work .

		An introductory memoir of some fifty pages is supplied to the present volume by Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	, and there is a frontispiece portrait in photogravure .

		The type is neces - sarily small , though not mireadable .

		At the request of Professor
Bernhard Seuffert	PERSON	, of
Graz	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	, representing the Royal Prussian Academy of
Berlin	LOCATION	, all institutions or individuals having
Wieland	PERSON	manuscripts or letters are earnestly urged to give notice of the fact and thus materially further the very elaborate edition of
Wieland	ORGANIZATION	's complete works , translations , and letters now being prepared by
the Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		A similar appeal is also made in regard to material for the great edition of Goethe proceeding from the Goethe-Schiller - Archiv in
Weimar	LOCATION	.

		Any information as to these matters may be sent to Mr.
Leonard L. Mackall	PERSON	, at
Johns Hop	ORGANIZATION	- kins
University	ORGANIZATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		The Syndics of the
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	have arranged to publish a comprehensive History of English Literature on a scale and plan more or less resembling that of the ''
Cambridge Modern History	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The work will be published in about twelve royal octavo volumes of some 400 pages each , and will cover the whole course of English literature from
Beowulf	LOCATION	to the end of the Victorian Age .

		The action of foreign influences and the part taken by secondary writers in successive literary movements will receive a larger share of attention than is possible in shorter histories , in which lesser writers are apt to be overshadowed by a few great names .

		Each vol - ume will contain a sufficient bibliography .

		The '' Cam - bridge History of English Literature '' will be edited by Dr.
A. W. Ward	PERSON	, Master of Peterhouse , and Mr.
A. R. Waller	PERSON	.

		Besides the editions of '' Paul et Virginie '' and Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's '' Songs and Sonnets , '' already mentioned in these pages , the publishers of the `` Riverside Press Editions '' have under way several enterprises of unusual interest .

		Among these undertakings are a translation of
Bernard	PERSON	's life of the great French designer and engraver , Geofroy Tory , richly illustrated with draw - ings , designs , etc. ; an edition of an exceptionally fine English prose version of the French epic , '' The Song of Roland , '' to be printed on a tall folio page , in a French Gothic type , embellished with reproductions in color of the
Charlemagne	LOCATION	window in the cathedral at
Chartres	LOCATION	; and an edition of
Dante 's Divina Commedia	ORGANIZATION	, in one vol - ume , folio , containing , on opposite pages , both the com - plete Italian text and Professor Charles
Eliot Norton	PERSON	's notable prose translation , illustrated from
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	's rare and beautiful designs for the poem .

		More extended announcements concerning these works will be made later in the year .

G. Lowes Dickinson	PERSON	THE MEANING OF GOOD In this fascinating book , which takes the form of the Platonic dialo ^ e yet which preserves all the delightful infor - mality of a familiar conversation among men of our own day , Mr.
Dickinson	PERSON	finds fullest scope for his powers both as a perfect prosateur and as a subtle dialectician .

		As to his style the
Athenaeum	ORGANIZATION	said in a recent review that he is '' one of the few living Englishmen who can really write prose ... prose , limpid , natural , musical . ''

Owen Wister	PERSON	's new novel just ready Lady
Baltimore	LOCATION	♦ ' ♦ Lady
Baltimore	LOCATION	* is the most engaging story yet written of Southern life .

		It is the quiet annals of an old
Southern	ORGANIZATION	town told in the half whimsical , wholly sympathetic style of '
Cranford	LOCATION	, ' to which it is closely akin in - charm .

		It reminds one , too , of
Margaret Deland	PERSON	's admii-able ' Old
Chester Tales	PERSON	, ' for it is written with the same loving appreciation of a simple neighborhood .

		With what a sense of htimor , with what a delicacy of touch , with what a finished skill
Owen Wister	PERSON	has made an exquisite pictm-e you must read to see .

		It is like a dainty water color portrait , delicious in itself even if it were not true ; but to its truth there will rise up a crowd of witnesses . ''

		I am ready to venture that any Southern man or woman who reads it will stop often , with finger between the leaves , to say , ` Ai n't it so ?

		This is exactly the way it is back home .

		This is us . '

		NOTES 268 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 269 `` I have no ear , '' wrote
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, a confes - sion that might , more pertinently , come from certain poets of to-day .

		The lyric note needed for spiritual consolation after our weary hoars of toil seldom reaches us in modern verse .

		K we wish to dwell in the presence of melody pure and fine , we turn to the older poets ; for our present writers seem careless of that which is their great prerogative , the power to enthrall readers by the magic of audible beauty .

		The disregard for melody in poetT -RRB- ' is apparent to those who make it a practice to read poetry aloud , but is often unnoted by readers who .

		for their pleasure , depend upon the eye .

		In this age , when poetry has had a glorious past , when the English tongue has already been shaped to match - less music , we can not afford to look with tolerance upon poetT -RCB- ' that falls far short of technical perfec - tion .

		The question of musical excellence is to-day more than ever important when prose is usurping public favor .

		Poetry must know her kingdom ; and , since poetrj ' is the transfer of beautiful truth by con - crete symbols , communication between unapparent spirits by means of sensuous images , considerations of these sensuous elements of poetry should go hand in hand with criticism of spiritual values .

		No one of the senses is to be constdt `` d more closely than that of hearing .

		If wfe were '' to read all orfr poetry aloud , verse would again take its rightful place in human civilization , and be once more what it was in the years before the printing of books took away the voice of poetry .

		We scorn to be satisfied with mere eye-reading of a piece of music , insisting that it shall be rendered audibly ; in only a lesser degree should we be satisfied merely to look at the music of poetry .

		If one reads aloud the recent verse of authors of considerable renown , one finds that in almost every poem there is some flaw , some bit of careless worit - manship , to mar its beauty .

		* ' Too fair for mde reality , Too real for a shade , '' with its intolerable succession of awkwardly placed r 's ; '' And ao at last the poet sang , In biting hunger and hard pain , ' ^ where n 's are introduced in reckless profusion ; ''
Momently Stlence	PERSON	and dissonance , like eating moths , Scatter corruption on the choiring orbs , '' where both harmony and nature are defied ; and * ' The woodland weaves its gold-green net ; The warm wind lazes by ; Can we forego ?

		Can we forget ?

		Come , comrade , let us try ! ''

		250 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, with its insistent alliteration , -- all these betray the hand of the artisan .

		Turning from these trans - gressions , one may see how
Collins	PERSON	solved the prob - lem of repetition , -- '' Whose numbers , stealing through thy darkening vale ,
May	DATE	, not unseemly , with its stillness suit , As , musing slow , I hail Thy genial loved return ! ''

		If indifference in the matter of adjusting sounds is the most obvious offense against melody in our current poetry , with it are distinct and frequently censured sins in the matters of rhyme and rhythm .

		Monotony in rhyme is more deserving of pardon than is false rhyme where the sounds are only approximate in musical echo . ''

		Lover '' and '' clover '' illustrate the common fault , the choice of eye-rhymes , insup - poi ` table when pronounced aloud , because they im - mediately force the reader to unhappy consciousness of mere words when he should follow the idea .

		Oftentimes a bewildered reader does not know how to pronounce the rhyming words of a poem in which such combinations appear , as in a sonnet whose first four verses end in '' stood , '' '' said , '' '' myriad , '' and '' solitude . ''

		However much the reader may wish to do justice , orally , to the poem , he can not tell , until reaching '' mood '' in the fifth verse , just what gen - erous intonations , must be given in order to obliterate the differences between '' stood '' and '' solitude , '' '' said '' and '' myriad . ''

		The disregard for integrity of rhyme is often matched by disregard for integjrity of rhythm .

		A single example will suffice to show what frequently occurs in poems written in blank verse : '' Unto this twain , man-child and woman-ehild , I give the passion of this element ; • • • • This power , this purity , this annihilation . ''

		There is so little power of invention among poets of the present time , so little originality in versificar tion , that we scarcely ever find impressive beauty wrought out by artful verse forms .

		Few poets attempt anything more than the iambic movement .

		No spirit of daring experiment animates contributors to maga - zines .

		A correct form has been established , it has found favor , and no man is so hardy as to venture an innovation .

		If we think of the exuberant measures of the Elizabethan period , we may well condemn ourselves that we can not say , with George Wither , '' I have a Muse , and she shall music make me ; Whose airy notes , in spite of closest cages , Shall give content to me , and after ages . ''

		It is true that iambic verse is best suited to the genius of the English language ; but poets have , in the past , found the secret of varied melodies . ''

		Come away , come away , death , And in sad cypress let me be laid ; Fly away , fly away , breath , I am slain by a fair cruel maid .

		My shroud of white , stuck all with yew , O prepare it !

		My part of death , no one so true Did share it , '' or
Raleigh	LOCATION	's '' But true love is a durable fire , In the mind ever burning , Never sick , never old , never dead , From itself never turning , '' show the use of the trochee and of the anapest .

		It is of course the inward impulse , not any math - ematical gift , that produces undeniable melody ; yet , after all , '' the immortal longings '' of the poet may be satisfied if he will take counsel with the Olym - pians , and also with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is much to be learned by versifiers from a close scrutiny of ele - mental music .

		May not the undulations of waving grass , or the drifting of fallen leaves , or the more majestic beating of the tide , be a guide to subtle rhythmical charm , as the sounds of Nature were to writers such as
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, whose work , in portions of '' The Faerie Queene '' and in the '' Prothalamion , '' is characterized by the melody of one who knew the ripple of running water ; or
Burns	PERSON	, who in '' Green grow the rashes , ; Green grow the rashes , O ; '' or in ''
Duncan	PERSON	Gray cam ' here to woo .

		Ha , ha , the wooing o ' t !

		On blythe
Yule night	TIME	when we were fou .

		Ha , ha , the wooing o ' t ! ''

		gives us much of the rich fulness of bird notes ?

		In the obvious attractions of color and form , our poets are becoming more and more worthy of admi - ration .

		The subdued effect of '' Until some hazy
autumn	DATE	day With yellow evening in the skies And rime upon the tawny hills , The far blue signal smoke shall rise , '' the swift distinctness of '' My soul , like wheeling swallows in the raio , Flies low -- flies low -- '' the more ambitious '' A sheaf of broom-flowers , yellow at the heart , Drugged with the sun and listless with the dew , The silence of the ordered petal edge With flame shot through , '' and the intensity of '' Noons of poppy , noons of poppy , Scarlet acres by the sea , Burning to the blue above them ; Love , the world is full for me , '' show unquestionable delight in visible beauty .

		Never before in the history of English poetry have color - words found so large a place as at the present time .

		An alert consciousness of the sun and sky , and of the waning of color , is noticeable in almost every issue of a magazine .

		The modern mood is one of increas - ing keenness of eye , but even yet sensuous perception has not become imaginative in the highest fashion .

		We have an abundance of descriptive poetry , deli - cately responsive to the stimulus of varying condi - tions of nature , and we have an abundance of the poetry of unrelieved reflection ; but the interpretation of the ideal in terms of the concrete is very infrequent .

		Such lines as these are constantly appearing , -- '' Stirring my eager soul to some transcendent strife . ''


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI .

		251 Here is truth , but not poetic truth , since no specific imagery forces the idea upon the reader 's vital intelli - gence ; he does not see or hear the strife ; it is a cold and shapeless warfare , hinted at , rather than pro- jected by picturesque symbols , as in
Miss Guiney	LOCATION	's • • While Kings of et `` mal evil Yet darken the hilU aboat , Thy part is with broken sabre To rise on the last redoubt ; '' To fear not sensible failure .

		Nor covet the game at all .

		But fighting , fighting , fighting .

		Die , driven against the wall ! ''

		The imaginative pageantrj ' which embodies high thoughts separates poetry from the bodiless phantom of philosophy .

		Poetry fires the imagination of the reader by pointing him to famiUar sights and experi - ences as guides to hidden realities .

		So
Vaughan	PERSON	uses the concrete in his well-remembered stanza , -- '' I see them walking in an air of glory Whose light doth trample on my days ; My days , which are at best bnt dull and hoary , Mere glimmerings and decays , '' or the lines in '' The Retreat , '' '' felt through all this fleshly dress Bright shoots of everlastingness , '' and the much-praised lines of
Marvell	PERSON	, '' Annihilating all that 's made To a green thought in a green shade , '' and Shakespeare 's '' Shall I compare thee to a
summer	DATE	's day ?

		Thou art more lovely and more temperate : Rough winds do shake the darling buds of
May	DATE	, And
summer	DATE	's lease hath all too short a date . ''

		While shrinking from objective reality of expres - sion is characteristic of many thoughtful poets , the very opposite fault is sometimes to be observed , -- that is , undue lavishness of picture .

		A certain ver - bal generosity marks much of the work presented in the current magazines .

		Few writers have the jwwer of combining thought with outer vision , and so flash - ing a clear instantaneous light upon a theme .

		The crystallized suggestiveness of '' All valiant dust that builds on dust . ''

		or of . '

		■ Give not a windy night a rainy morrow , To linger out a purposed overthrow , '' is rare .

		We have to-day what may be called the peripatetic school of ix -RRB- etry .

		which insists upon walk - ing all about an object or a dramatic situation , taking notes on every aspect .

		The result of this method of investigation is an accumulation of phrases such as * ' Yet life 's explainer , solvent harmony .

		Frail strength , pure passion , meek austerity , And the white splendor of these darkened years . ''

		Work like this comes dangerously near being mere lexicography ; one waits in vain for the incisive word , the supreme expression of the essential idea .

		There is evidence , oftentimes , of a striving for definite imagery ; but the effort is defeated by over - comprehensiveness .

		In the following sonnet the author has sought vigorously for the circumstantial , and has overwhelmed his readers by crowding pic - tures so rapidly , by the aid of eleven '' ands '' and seventeen limiting prepositions , that the effect is blurred , inasmuch as the sonnet , noble in conception , lacks the calm slow movement of finished art .

		QtTESTIONS . ''

		Curious of life and love and death they stand Outward along the shadowy verge of thought ; Rebels and deicides , they rise unsought And spare no creed and yield to no command .

		Even though at last we seem to understand , Yet , when our eyes grow sphered to the new light , We find them , outposts in the forward night , Tlieir eyes still restless with the same demand .

		On all the heights and at the farthest goal Set by the seers and Christs of yesterday .

		They watch and wait and ask the onward way ; They storm the citadels of faith and youth .

		And , gazing always for the stars of truth , Crowd in the glimmering windows of the soul . ''

		Between these two poles of abstract and of too inclusive concrete , there are many lesser manifesta - tions of defective imaginative power .

		Not in accordance with human experience is this English observation of the ways of nature : '' Waves of the gentle waters of the healing night , Flow over me with silent peace and golden dark .

		Wash me of sound , wash me of color , down the day ; Light the tall golden candles and put out the day . ''

		Again . ''

		The wings whereby he strove and climbed , '' is a line troublesome to a reader who must pause to reassure himself of the function of wings .

		It may be possible to approve the following lines , but one hesitates over the imagery : '' Our road dropped straight as eye can run . ''

		What of the suggestion , partly due to f aultj ' punctua - tion , of these concluding lines of a poem : '' Groves inaccessible whence voices come , That call to the ear whither we may not go '' ?

		And what of the anti-climax of image in '' The past , the future , all of weal and woe In my old life was gone , forever g ^ ne .

		And still to this I clung as one who clings To hope 's last hencoop in the wreck of things '' ?

		The majority of these ill-conditioned lines owe their disfigurement to the ambition of poets for some - thing new and striking in the way of expression .

		Simplicity , which is the gauge of clearness , is consid - ered too old-fashioned by poets who have forgotten , or never known , that great poetrj - is transfiguration of the commonplace .

		The inordinate search for the unique adjective , the surprising phrase , the spec - taciilar image , makes poetasters of us .

		More deplorable than indifference to music or lack of sufficiently concrete expression is disloyaltj - to the crowding emotions of the world .

		If we consider the question of the emotional element in the poetrj ' of to-day .

		we must admit that intellectual perception rather than emotional perception preponderates .

		There is a vast amount of successful verse , cvdti - 262 THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 16 , vated , complacent , without a hint of passionate soul behind .

		Neither the misery nor the joy of life finds thrilling voice .

		Poets give us only the fringes of their deep feeling , and deny us knowledge of their good and evil , guarding their existence jealously .

		If emotion were a matter of premeditation , or if poign - ant understanding of the great passions of the race were a matter of felicitous choice , the poet might be forgiven his selfish shyness ; but as life goes , no one can lay claim to profound emotional individuality .

		A poet should recognize the fact of his alliance with all humanity , and so become the interpreter of the mysteries of human experience .

		There are two very noticeable tendencies in the emotional element of current verse .

		The old longing to attain some sort of personal recognition appears in the literature of to-day as strongly as ever .

		Out of the turmoil and friction of human life , some men and women are struggling for an imperishable remem - brance .

		They yearn , as men have always yearned , to be something more than fleeting shadows ; they wish to arrest their experience and place it before the world , protesting instinctively against the inevitable indifference of the world toward the mere individual .

		The self-absorption of this class of authors appears in this representative poem : '' There are so many kinds of me , Indeed , I can not say Just which of many I shall be On any given day . ''

		Whence are they -- princess , witch , or nun ?

		I know not ; this I know : The gravest , gentlest , simplest one Was buried long ago . ''

		There , by his hand all covered o'er , It slumbers , as is fit ; And nothing tells the name it bore , Or marks the place of it . ''

		But all the other kinds of me They know , and turn aside , And check their laughter soberly Above the one that died . ''

		Their work reveals the utter impotence of the writers to realize that great art sweeps away all limitations of time and space and petty personal intents , absorb - ing all things into the combined significance of a thousand lives .

		The annihilation of self , the erasure of the creature with a surname , must come before fate wills immortality .

		While , in the poems below , egotism sinks away in a larger grasp of the eternal , another regrettable impulse is to be noted .

		The elevation of tone is marked , but so also is the decline of militant spirit - uality . ''

		Let me remember that I failed , So I may not forget How dear that goal the distance veiled Toward which my feet were set . ''

		Let me forget , if so Thy will .

		How fair the joy desired , Dear God , so I remember still That one day I aspired . ''

		And '' Carry me home to the pine-wood , Give me to rest by the sea ; Leave me alone with the lulling tone Of the South-wind 's phantasy . ''

		For I am weary of discord , Sick of the clash of the strife .

		Sick of the bane of this prelude of pain .

		And I yearn for the symphony -- Life . ''

		In a hundred poems to-day we are constantly told of a tragic past , of distant splendor , of the tears and struggles which are viewed now in melancholy retro - spect .

		These chastened poets show a studied indif - ference to the illusions of present action , of heroic struggle and triumph in the immediate hour .

		The ring of battle to-day is only an echo from the dis - tance ; the living voice has no imperious annunciar tion to make of its great joys and sorrows .

		We need such men and women as can match the grim , exultant courage of
Henley	ORGANIZATION	's poem , -- '' Out of the night that covers me , Black as the pit from pole to pole , I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul . ''

		In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced nor cried aloud , Under the bludgeonings of chance My head is bloody , but unbowed . ''

		Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the Horror of the shade ; And yet the menace of the years Finds and shall find me unafraid . ''

		It matters not how strait the gate .

		How charged with punishments the scroll : I am the master of my fate , I am the captain of my soul . ''

		Or of Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's more hauntingly beautiful song , -- '' Of wounds and sore defeat I made my battle stay ; Wingfed sandals for my feet I wove of my delay ; Of weariness and fear I made my shouting spear ; Of loss , and doubt , and dread , And swift oncoming doom , I made a helmet for my head And a floating plume .

		From the shutting mist of death , From the failure of the breath , I made a battle-horn to blow Across the vales of overthrow .

		hearken , love , the battle horn !

		The triumph clear , the silver scorn I O hearken where the echoes bring , Down the grey disastrous morn .

		Laughter and rallying ! ''

		America has deep need of poetry .

		Commercial prosperity has not assuaged the griefs that
spring	DATE	from estrangement , or bodily pain , or death .

		We yearn to know the truths of this too visible universe , the meaning of spiritual defeat , and of all the strange paradoxes that mock our progi'ess ; and we need the knowledge as it is spoken by living voices .

		The con - clusions of a former age have power , but the tri - umphant utterances of the present will bring a more positive solace to those who struggle with conditions

		253 of to-day .

		It is the plighted vow of our poets to trans - mute the inner glory of thought into outer glory of beauty ; it is their privilege to illuminate with a flash those things which elude our understanding ; it is their mission to grapple with the keenest realities of life and with exalted accent forever proclaim the supremacy of spirit over '' these rags of clay .

		PEACE TERMS OF THE WAE OF
1812	DATE	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dl \ l. -RRB- There has been sent me The Diai .

		for
March 1 , 1906	DATE	, containing a letter from Mr.
F. H. Costello	PERSON	, in which occur the following sentences : '' What led
Great Britain	ORGANIZATION	-LSB- in
1814	DATE	-RSB- to consent to peace-terms so favorable to us ?

		The answer is : it was the work of our privateers .

		Even Captain
Mahan	PERSON	... in part admits this . ''

		Everybody is at liberty to express their opinions , and I can have no quarrel with Mr.
Costello	PERSON	for his ; but , as he cites me in support of a view which I do not hold , and have not expressed , and as I can not flatter myself that many readers of The Dial will also read my '' War of
1812	DATE	, '' which affords data for a correct conclusion , it seems expedient to set the matter right .

		It must be remembered that , although
Great Britain	LOCATION	during the preceding ten years had g ^ ven us abundant cause for war , she did not wish war .

		It was we who declared war , for two reasons : the injuries to our trade by the Orders in
Council	ORGANIZATION	, and the British practice of Impressment .

		In the negotiations for peace .

		Great Bri - tain peremptorily refused even to discuss the questions of compensation for the one , or abandonment of the other .

		We relinquished both demands .

		Here there is nothing favorable .

		We had fought , and lost .

		Although
Great Britain	LOCATION	had not wished war , yet , hav - ing incurred it , she thought she might derive profit .

		To this she was the more encouraged , because the cessation of war in
Europe	LOCATION	, by
Napoleon	PERSON	's abdication in
April , 1814	DATE	, promised at first to release her arms against the
United States	LOCATION	.

		She therefore presented two demands .

		One was the definitive abandonment of a large part of our northwestern territory to the Indians , under her and our joint guarantee ; the other , the cession to her of part of the territory of
Maine	LOCATION	, and of the military use of the
Great Lakes	ORGANIZATION	.

		From these she receded ; why ?

		Because , as the Duke of
Wellington	LOCATION	wrote to the ministry , her forces at the moment controlled neither the one nor the other .

		The
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	had been freed by
Perry	PERSON	's vic - tory on
Lake Erie	LOCATION	, and the lower Great Lakes * region saved by
Macdonough	ORGANIZATION
's %	PERCENT	- ictory on I ^ ake
Champlain	LOCATION	.

		Not ha \ ` ing possession , she coiUd not claim .

		Why , then , not continue the war ?

		Mr.
Costello	PERSON	says .

		Priva - teering .

		The inner counsels of the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	are unusually well known in this matter , because the Minister for Foreign Affairs , who corresponds to our
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, was during this period absent on the Continent , conducting negotiations .

		Consequently , con - sultations between him and his colleagues , ordinarily held in conversation , or aroimd the council board , were carried on by letters .

		Many of these have been pub - lished in the
Castlereagh Correspondence	LOCATION	.

		Many have not ; but these also I have had opportunity to read .

		Nowhere in them do the depredations of our privateers find mention , -- I do not mean as a motive to peace , but mention of any kind .

		Losses by privateers were then an old story to
Great Britain	LOCATION	.

		During twenty-one years of war with
France	LOCATION	, she had lost annually in this way an average of nearly 500 merchant vessels , as I have shown in a former work ; while in nearly three years we took from her about
1600	DATE	, a proportion not greatly exceed - ing the other .

		The factor determining her was the fear of a renewal of the European war , owing to disputes between the states that had just overthrown
Napoleon	LOCATION	; to which contributed the marked disposition of the Czar , then the most powerful
Continental	ORGANIZATION	ruler , to be influ - enced in his course by prepossession toward
America	LOCATION	, which made him so far antagonistic to
Great Britain	LOCATION	in the existing
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		These conditions dis - posed
Great Britain	LOCATION	to get the American quarrel off her hands ; but the sole circumstance favorable to us in the terms of peace was that she relinquished claims which could be made good only by further fighting , and this the European conditions made inexpedient .

		The importance of this matter , which alone requires my reply , is that such a claim as Mr.
Costello	PERSON	makes is but too consonant to our American tendency , to trust to improvised means of war , and is therefore dangerously misleading .

		Save for the victories of

		THE ALTHOR OF '' HAWAIIAN YESTERDAYS . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		In bis review of '' Hawaiian Yesterdays , '' by Dr.
Henry Munson Lyman	PERSON	, published in your issue of
April 1	DATE	, Mr.
Bicknell	PERSON	notes one or two errors .

		I am impelled to ask you to supplement his review by this word of e3q -RRB- lanation .

		The book in question was arranged after the death of Dr.
Lyman	PERSON	, late in
1904	DATE	, from a memoir he had written as a recreation in the few leisure hours of a most busy life without other thought than that of giving pleasure to his own family -- and to a few intimate friends .

		The preparation of the manuscript for the press was imdertaken by one of his daughters as an act of filial piety ; and the book necessarily lacked the revision of its author , whose written and spoken En - glish was a life-long deUght to his friends .

		Mr.
BiekneU	PERSON	's hope that the cheerfid yesterdays might be followed by confident to-morrows has passed into an article of faith by all who knew this beloved physician , -- for wherever high thoughts and gentle deeds and peace and love remain , there he will have found a ^ ome .

		The
Masterliness of Mastery	ORGANIZATION	.

		* On taking up Mr.
Alonzo Rothschild	PERSON	's hand - some volume on `` Lincoln , Master of Men , '' one can hardly help wondering why it should have been thought worth while to devote so large and impressive a book to so obvious and well recognized an aspect of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's character and achievements .

		The book seems to be put forth with an air of novelty , both as to title and '' treatment , -- as though bringing out something very important that had been previously over - looked ; whereas there is no good biography of Lincoln that is not itself , apart from the general history of the times that it may contain , the story of his mastery of men .

		From liis youth to the tragic end of his life , he is pictured by every fit biographer as rising from obscurity to wide influence and undying fame through his mastery over the harsh conditions and the strong men that surrounded him .

		They all tell of his early triumphs of physical strength through which he mastered the
Clary	ORGANIZATION	's Grove gang and similar lawless spirits , and made them his loyal friends and supporters ; of the proof of his leadership shown in his election as a captain in the Black Hawk war ; of his legislative career and his rise to the leadership of his party in
Illinois	LOCATION	; of his rivalry with
Douglas	PERSON	, who , though victorious in the early senatorial contest , was vanquished by Lincoln in the struggle for the far greater prize of the Presidency ; of his relations as President with the strong men of his cabinet who tried to manage him but found in him a master who man - aged them , and who was the real , not nominal , head of his administration ; and of his trials with incompetent and unsuccessful generals , whom , patient and long-suffering as he was , he did not hesitate to get rid of when their unfitness was apparent or they would not or could , not give single-hearted obedience to their commander-in - chief .

		These are the things to which Mr.
Roth	PERSON	- schild devotes his book .

		He has given us nothing new in matter , and his grouping throws no new light on
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's career or character ; while the book , with its reiteration of the word , makes no deeper impression of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's mastery over men than does the plain biography that does not use the word at all .

		The thing itself pervades the whole career of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and frequent mention of it tends rather to irritate the reader than to increase his appreciation of the quality .

		• Lincoln , Master OF Men .

		A Study in Character .

		By
Alonzo Rothschild	ORGANIZATION	.

		With portraits .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The theme is treated in eight chapters with more or less fanciful titles . ''

		A
Samson	PERSON	of the Backwoods '' gives an account of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's early struggles and triumphs ; '' Love , War , and Pol - itics '' carries him to his leadership of the Whig party in
Illinois	LOCATION	; '' Giants , Big and Little '' nar - rates his rivalry with
Douglas	PERSON	from their young manhood to the day of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's great triumph when
Douglas	PERSON	held his hat through the inaugura - tion ceremonies ; '' The Power behind the Throne '' is of course
Seward	PERSON	, and '' An Indispensable Man '' is Chase ; while '' The Curbing of
Stan	PERSON	- ton '' conveys an altogether wrong impression of
Lincohi	ORGANIZATION	's relations with his great war minister ; `` How the Pathfinder Lost the TraO '' tells the story of
Fremont	LOCATION	and his lamentable failure as general and politician ; '' The Young Napoleon '' is General
McClellan	PERSON	, and the story of his fail - ures and of his intimate and often touching per - sonal relations with his superiors is told at length , though of course one-sidedly , as appears in the title , which in itself conveys a sneer .

		In fact , the book is one-sided throughout , -- a piece of special pleading , brilliantly done , but without great historical value .

		The author has selected the salient points in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's career and strung his entire treatment of them on this thread of '' mastery . ''

		He has a real gift for popular his - torical writing , and has made every chapter inter - esting , especially to one who already knows enough of the details of
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's life to be able to fit what is here told into its relations with affairs in general .

		But it must be said that these character studies of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's rivals can not be taken as true to life ; the treatment is partial and pre-determined , those characteristics and qualities being brought out that are demanded by the author 's thesis .

		The result is in each case , -- notably those of
Seward	PERSON	and
Stanton	PERSON	, -- that an altogether false idea is given of these men and their relations with their chief .

		The impression is left , perhaps without the author 's intention , not that they were strong men work - ing heartily together for one great cause , though with frequent differences of opinion , but that the relation was essentially one of rivalry , ending in `` mastery '' on one side and defeat on the other .

		Lincoln is made to stand out preeminent , as of course he should ; but one can not get from these studies , elaborate as some of them are , any ade - quate idea of the greatness of his great cabinet ministers .

		One who knows well the history of the time can supply this for liimseK , and to liim the chapters are interesting and not without value ; but it needs this broader knowledge to keep the reader from distorted ideas of the great

		AVhat has been MTitten thus far , though in - tended as a fair statement of the plan of the book and the ine ^ ` itable disadvantages of this plan , would , if no more were said , fail of doing it justice .

		The author tells his ston ^ with zest and force ; the book has life , and the material can not but be interesting , for it deals with the most attractive personality that
America	LOCATION	has pro- duced and the most exciting and critical period of American history .

		It abounds with well-chosen anecdotes , and with the interesting personal items that give life to biography .

		Occasionally the rhetoric is strained through effort to be vivacious in style , but this is not a serious blemish on the work .

		Its mechanical form is notably excellent , especially the portraits ; and there is an abimd - ant apparatus of bibliography , notes , references , and index .

		The bibliography and citations of authorities are indeed fuller and better than any other that we know .

Japan	LOCATION	's Axciext Religiox .

		* There is the same danger and the same diffi - culty in interpreting ancient life in the Sunrise Archipelago , and thus influencing our estimate of the modem Japanese , that pertains to all ap - praisement of a nation coming into notice from unlettered savagery through a later alien cul - ture .

		One who studies the Norsemen , or any Christianized people who received their writing with their new religion , must beware of accept - ing exotic and after-thoughts for primitive con - ceptions .

		The official Japanese of to-day would have us believe that the original Alikado-clans in
Nippon	ORGANIZATION	had much the same ideas about im - perialism that are held to-day .

		The uncritical or average foreign \ \ Titer knocks all chronology into a cocked hat , and puts nursery and fairy - tale theories in the place of science and progres - sive development .

		Mr.
TT	PERSON	.

		G. Aston , in his volume entitled '' Shinto , the Way of the Gods , '' proceeds on a totally different principle .

		He was one of those yovmg Englishmen who , fresh from the imiver - sity .

		set up a literary laboratory in Tokio in
1870	DATE	, almost as soon as that city received its name .

		After long residence in the empire , and profound researches in tradition and text , man - ners and customs , literature and art , Chinese , Japanese , and foreign , he has given in this book • Shixto .

		the Way of the Gods .

		York : Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
W. G. Aston	PERSON	.

		Xew his ripened conclusions .

		No one is equipped for correct perspective in the study of Japanese who is not measurably familiar with those Chi - nese texts from which the early Japanese writers -LRB- who must needs , out of pride , imitate the great Chinese ci \ Tlization beyond seas -RRB- extracted the rhetorical bombast and gold embroidery with which to adorn their scanty insular traditions .

		The
Kojiki	PERSON	, chiefly a collection of myths , was set down from memory , in Chinese phonetics , in the year 712 A. D .

		It contains , for the most part , the pure '' Japanese '' view , with legend and data for partial reconstruction of early Yamato institutional life .

		The Nihongi , written by islanders who had some Chinese scholarship , re-sets the same primitive legends and fairy-tales -LRB- which are accepted by the average Japanese as sober history -RRB- in the elaborate apparatus of Chinese cosmogony , philosophy , and rhetoric .

		The change is as of a picture-frame of impainted pine to Florentine gilt .

		Lest we be accused of exaggerating what the modem Japanese would have us believe concerning the antiquity of his '' nation '' -- which had no real existence until the fusion of many tribes of divers ethnic origins after the eighth century .

		-- we note that the honored Coimt
Okuma	ORGANIZATION	, once premier and head of the
Waseda University	ORGANIZATION	, habitually , and even as late as in '' The Independent '' of
January 25 , 1906	DATE	, speaks of '' our twenty-five hundred years of vrritten history . ''

		The italics are ours .

		What the islanders of the archipelago , called in comparatively modem times • ' the Japanese , '' were before the intellect of the dominant tribe was f ertilize < l by the contact of the Aryan intel - lect -LRB- in the form of Buddhism , an Aryan re - ligion -RRB- , and also with Chinese ethics , philosophy , and general science , is seen in this masterly book , which is written with ftdness , scholarly coolness , and judicial accuracy .

		Had Mr.
Aston	PERSON	chosen to swell his fewer than 400 pages into an ency - clopaedia , he were well able to do it .

		But he has been content to tell only what is known of this primitive cult .

		Shinto had no ancestor-worship , because the islanders had no family life or ances - tral system , such as were already elaborated in
China	LOCATION	.

		Those who have studied the later his - tory of the God-way well know how the dogmas of the paramount Yamato race were harnessed as steeds to draw the chariot of imperialism .

		Shinto notions cooperated with the weapons of iron against the men in the stone age , whose primitive mental conceptions were even ruder than those of their conquerors , whose ancestors came from beyond sea -- possibly from the Sun - gari valley in
Asia	LOCATION	.

		266 THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 16 , Mr.
Aston	PERSON	appraises critically the sources for the study of Shinto , showing that the materials in European languages before the later foreign scholars , who studied on the soil of
Japan	LOCATION	, are very nearly worthless , because they deal with the Buddhaized , or '' Riobu , '' Shinto .

		He treats further of personification , the deification of men , the functions of the gods , myth and mythical narrative , nature and man deities , the priest - hood and worship , morals , law , and ceremonial , closing with a view of those inevitable products of decay that belong to all dying or dead re - ligions .

		He is strong in showing how '' the misunderstanding of metaphorical language is a fertile source of apotheosis , '' and proves that the deification of the
Mikado	LOCATION	is a case in point .

		He is a veritable genius in illustrating the works of desolation that the stupid man in religion has everywhere wrought .

		Notwithstanding the over - praise of the Japanese , the stupid man is fright - fidly in evidence in this island country , which is so much '' the land of the gods '' that it has over eighty million deities , with a census of de - mons and spirits whose figures would stagger calculation .

		From the spell of these '' gods , '' the average Japanese is as yet far from being deliv - ered .

		Even Mr.
Stead	PERSON	, who would have us be - lieve that the Japanese are paragons of efficiency beyond the dreams of the Anglo-Saxon , mixes up '' gods '' and men for our admiration , in a way which demonstrates that these '' gods '' and the everyday Japanese are one and the same .

		In his arrangement of the book , with its abun - dant translation of ancient text and ritual , all well indexed , we have just what the volimie professes to be -- a handbook for the study of Shinto .

		Our own judgment , after reading and re-reading this work , is that there is nothing to compare with it for the critical study of the primitive conceptions of the Nippon islanders and for the institutional history of the
Yamato	LOCATION	, or Mikado-clans ; while at the same time the southern or Polynesian outlook is almost entirely ignored or neglected by Mr.
Aston	PERSON	.

		The study of the traditions and languages of that great drift of humanity inhabiting peninsular
Asia	LOCATION	, and Insulinde , or island
Asia	LOCATION	, will yet throw , we are persuaded , much new light on primitive
Nippon	ORGANIZATION	.

		We are glad to notice that the French author
Revon	PERSON	, in his latest work on
Japan	LOCATION	, `` Le Shinntoisme '' -LRB- the title is tautological , for the to in Shinto has the same force as ism in '' Buddhism '' -RRB- , has begun an examination of the oceanic side of
Japan	LOCATION	's most ancient written ^ ory .

Elliot Griffis	PERSON	.

		The Founder of Modern Landscape Art .

		* Landscape painting has reached its highest development witliin but little over a century , and may therefore be considered as a product of our own times .

		The ancient peoples of
Egypt	LOCATION	, of
Greece	LOCATION	, and
Rome	LOCATION	knew very little of landscape art ; nor did the painters of mediaeval times know much more .

		The great men of the Renaissence used landscape in their backgrounds , and used it weU ; but it was always subordinate to the cen - tral theme .

		They painted very few independent landscapes .

		The landscapes of the Dutch in later days are conventional in treatment , though often very beautiful in color .

		It is most interesting to reflect that a simple English painter .

		Constable , all unknowingly came to be the founder , or at least the earliest inspi - ration , of the greatest school of landscape art the world has ever known .

		His latest biogra - pher , Mr.
Sturge Henderson	PERSON	, has shown in a very clear and interesting way the sources of Constable 's art .

		The simplicity of the tale adds not a little to its charm .

		In his life , as in his art .

		Constable was as simple as
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		In the themes he chose for his paintings he followed in the footsteps of the poet who wrote of dancing daffodils and of the primrose by the river .

		There was in most of Constable 's greater works the spirit of homely life upon a farm in
Suffolk	LOCATION	.

		There was no exceptional feature in the landscape to make it grand or striking ; it was the landscape of home , with great trees and wide skies full of cloud masses , and beneath them spreading meadows and gently sloping hillsides .

		Almost always there was a farmer coming home with his horses and his hay - wain , or a milkmaid with her cows .

		Often mndmills or watermiUs formed the central subject ; for the artist loved old mills and mill dams , with their slimy posts and brick-work falling to decay , and he himself says that the banks of the Stour , abounding in such scenes , taught him to paint before he even touched a pencil .

		The painting of landscape was a later development of Constable 's work ; for he began as a portrait painter , and was fairly suc - cessful in that most difficvdt field of art .

		Perhaps it was from this work that he gained his knowl - edge of drawing ; but the love of landscape was always predominant in him , and as soon as he could he gave up everything else and devoted himself entirely to the painting of landscapes .

		It is a very interesting fact that the homely ♦ Constable .

		THE DIAL 267 Constable , and not the brilliant
Turner	PERSON	, his con - temporary , influenced the French masters .

		It was his • • Hay Wain . '' '

		which was shown at the Salon in
Paris	LOCATION	in
1824	DATE	.

		that made a sensation and ' • created a division in the school of land - scape painters in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	is not pleased with the drawing of Constable nor does he greatly like his color ; whereas he lauds
Turner	PERSON	to the skies .

		Nevertheless , ^ Millet , perhaps the greatest of the Barbizon school , follows Constable closely in many ways ; for he too was a lover of the home , and he cared for his peasants of Nor - mandy or of Barbizon just as Constable loved his Suffolk farmers .

		The value of the sky in landscape was deeply appreciated by Constable , and he was always studj ^ ing clouds in their ever - varying aspects .

		In ^ Millet 's ' * Angelus * ' the sky has nearly as much to do with the marvellous power of the picture as the peasants themselves praying with bowed heads .

		The Frenchmen who found inspiration in Con - stable 's works had a far better technique than he , for there was no
Ecole des Beaux Arts	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	.

		It was not in technique , but in thought and purpose , that the simple English master so deeply impressed the painters of the school of
1830	DATE	, who produced the greatest landscapes the world had yet known ; and in these simple qual - ities are to be f oimd the fascination and charm of Constable 's life and of his pictures .

		He was not successfid in marine painting , although he attempted such subjects at times .

		He was ill at ease with the vastness and grandeur of the ocean , because he did not know the sea as he knew the skies and clouds , and the far-reaching meadows and dowTis of his home-land .

		He painted well only what was familiar to him in his home-life , and here he found subjects great enough to tax the utmost resources of his art .

		But little more than half of -RSB- Mr.
Henderson	PERSON	's book is devoted to the life of Constable and the painting of his pictures .

		In the latter part the author gives some very interesting accounts of the
Lucas Mezzotints	PERSON	, those famous reproduc - tions of some of the greatest of Constable 's works .

		He also speaks at length of the artist 's lectures on art , which are interesting but not far-reaching in their influence .

		Few artists are great lecturers , and Constable was no exception to the general rule .

		He should never have attempted to criti - cize Italian art , which he knew only through reproductions .

		He was somewhat witty at times , and rather caustic in his criticisms , -- indeed , he was accused of being ill-natured , but on the whole this accusation is not borne out by the facts .

		In the tenth chapter of the book , Constable 's influence upon landscape painting is most justly and truly set forth , especially in the part which deals with his influence upon the French school .

		The author says that Constable 's appeal to the French artists was that of naturalism , which was unique in two respects .

		Constable fearlessly adopted '' unpicturesque '' localities as subjects for his pictures .

		He also adopted `` fresh , bright color , which , though the French had admired it in the work of the English water colorists , they had not attempted to emulate in what they con - sidered more serious painting . ''

		More than this , as the author tells us , '' Men of more imaginative temperament might find in the plains and hills of their native land sentiments other than those that he had found ; but it was he who had indi - cated the source from which their inspiration was to be drawn , and pointed them the way to a new kingdom . ''

		The fact is worth noting
Jliat Ruskin	PERSON	made the same criticism on Constable that the French critics made of ^ liUet -- that his tastes were '' low . ' ''

		It is strange that the great poet-critic of
England	LOCATION	should have thus spoken of Con - stable 's art .

		It is equally strange that the learned critics of
France	LOCATION	shoidd in the same words have condemned
Millet	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		In the light of a new day for landscape art , the `` low ' '' has been illuminated by the light of genius and has become '' high '' indeed .

		This residt is simply a tardy appreciation of truth , which in art , as everywhere else , must prevail over artifice .

		The beautifid simplicity of Constable 's life and art are admirably expressed in this book , and those who read it carefully will learn much more than they have known before about the simple and homely but great English master , and how his simplicity and truthfulness prevailed in in - spiring the greatest landscape art the world has ever known .

		258 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16 , fiscal year ending June 30 , 1905	DATE	, considerably over a million men , women , and children of for - eign birth landed at our ports with the intention of becoming residents , for a longer or a shorter time , among us .

		This is the first time that the million mark has been passed and the dubious record has created no little alarm in the minds of many people .

		The mere fact of numbers , however , is not the serious thing .

		A survey of the statistics of the subject , running back sev - enty or eighty years , wiU show that the volume of immigration exhibits a decided tendency to periodic swells and depressions , from which it is but fair to surmise that we are now just passing over the crest of an immigration wave and may expect a corresponding falling off within a few years .

		But even if the present remarkable rate of increase should be maintained indefinitely the important thing would still not be the nimi - ber , but rather the - quality , of the new-comers .

		During the past two or three decades there has been a striking change in this latter respect .

		The peoples who come to us now are not so much those from northern and western as those from southern and eastern
Europe	LOCATION	, -- Russian Jews , Slavs , and Italians insteatl of Germans ,
Scandi	LOCATION	- navians , and British .

		The full effects of this shift can not at present be foreseen .

		Certain it is that morally , mentally , and materially the elements which now dominate are on the whole of an inferior type , and there can be no denying that their coming brings upon the country sev - eral pretty clearly defined , though by no means necessarily fatal , dangers .

		On the other hand , we receive no considerable class of aliens that can be demonstrated to be lacking in capacity for development , and the fundamental test ought always to be not so much what the immigrant is when he lands at our ports as what he shows an aptitude for becoming .

		The problem of the immigrant is one that has been always with us .

		If anyone imagines that the alarm now being expressed in many quarters is anything new he need only run back along the whole course of our national history to observe that over and over again the problem of the incoming alien has been deemed just as serious as it is felt to be to-day .

		At the same time this fact should not become an excuse for indifference .

		Numbers of immigrants fluctuate and quality changes , so that the old problem is continually developing new asi -RRB- ects , and the whole acquires a cimnilative character which gives it an ever larger interest and practical significance for the student and citizen .

		It is therefore encouraging to note that never before has the subject received such an amotmt of discriminating attention and thoroughgoing discussion as during the past twelve months .

		Not , for example , since the days of Chinese exclusion legislation has a president spoken upon it so fully or so exj -RRB- licitly as has President
Roosevelt	PERSON	in liis last two annual mes - sages to CongTCss ; never before has such a body as the
National Civic Federation	ORGANIZATION	devoted a three days ' meeting exclusively to the discussion of it ; and never has the past year 's output of litera - ture upon it been approached in either quantity or quality .

		Not only has immigration been treated from widely varying points of view in many of our best periodicals , but the year has seen the publication of the first noteworthy book on the subject since the appearance of Professor
Mayo-Smith	PERSON	's '' EmigTation and Immigration '' in
1890	DATE	, -- and indeed not one book but several .

		First of all may be mentioned the general treatise by Mr.
Prescott F. Hall	PERSON	entitled '' Im - migration and its Effects upon the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		This volume is the first in a promising series on '' American Public Problems '' which
Messrs. Holt & Company	ORGANIZATION	annomice under the editorship -RRB- of Dr.
Ralph Curtis Ringwalt	PERSON	.

		As Secretary of the
Immigration Restriction League	ORGANIZATION	in recent years Mr.
Hall	PERSON	has had both occasion and opportimity to study the immigration move - ment in all its essential phases and processes .

		The volume which he has written embodies the results of his observations , and is intended to be , not an attempt at an exhaustive discussion , but simply a handbook presenting in convenient form the salient facts concerning the extent , character , and effects of our iimnigration to-day .

		Pretty nearly every conceivable aspect of the subject is touched upon , with the inevitable result that the rule of the strictest brevity becomes inexorable .

		At the same time the book reads well , and one is struck by the author 's skill in condensation where the temptation to more or less diffuse writing must have been very great .

		In many ways the most valuable portion of Mr.
Hall	PERSON	's volume is that which deals with the important topic of immigration legislation .

		After a careful presentation of the history of such leg - , islation an inquiry is made into the effects of our present restrictive laws and the need of new enactments to meet new conditions which have arisen in late years .

		It is clearly shown , as any - body may easily find out for himself by a little investigation , tliat the laws which we now have are constantly being violated with impunity by interested parties in both
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and this through no fault of the officials who are charged with the work of inspection at our ports ,
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 259 but wholly because of the ingenious and semi - secret devices employed by transportation agents , controllers of labor , and local European authori - ties to bring vmdesirable aliens into the
United States	LOCATION	by fraud and deception .

		Mr.
Hall	PERSON	, while not an advocate of radical restrictive measures , believes firmly nevertheless that it is obligatory upon
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to strengthen our exclusion laws at an early date , at least by so much as wiU make it possible to keep out persons belonging to the ten or more classes ali-eady legally debarred .

		In his '' Problem of the Lnmigrant '' Mr.
James Davenport Whelpley	PERSON	has given us a volvune which is so obviously usefid that the wonder is we have been compelled to wait so long for something of its kind .

		Realizing that immigration has generally been contemplated far too exclusively from its American side , Mr.
Whelpley	PERSON	some time ago undertook the more dif - ficidt task of investigating the causes and nature of the phenomenon in the European countries which are the chief origins of our alien influx .

		During the course of the year spent at this task , in thirteen different countries , it became neces - sary to ascertain what are the precise laws of the various nations regidating the admission and set - tlement of inmiigrants .

		We may well believe the author when he teUs us that it was foimd very difficult to get together the data required , jiartic - ularly as the statutes , decrees , and ordinances dealing with the subject are almost invariably scattered and fragmentary .

		The task seems , however , to have l ^ een accomplished admirably , and it is the results of this investigation , in the main , that ^ Ir .

		Whelpley has given us in his book .

		Fourteen nations -LRB- including the
United States	LOCATION	-RRB- are dealt with one by one , and the plan in each case is to give a brief sketch of the con - ditions pre ^ Tiiling respecting immigration and to follow this with a translation of the laws now in force on the subject .

		The volume thus becomes a most convenient handbook for reference , sup - plying the student with a mass of materials not elsewhere available in one language or in any sort of connected form .

		Two of Mr.
Whelpley	PERSON	's chapters are in the nature of general discussion .

		One of these , re - published from '' The North American Review , '' affords a very useful summary of the immigra - tion and emigration laws of
Europe	LOCATION	, with some exposition of the spirit in which they are adminis - tered .

		The other , which originally appeared as an article in '' The Fortnightly Review , '' exploits the authors conception of immigration as an inter - national affair calling for concerted international action .

		The interesting thesis is laid down that '' to police the world for the purpose of putting a wholesome restraint upon emigration is within the power -- even now within the line of duty -- of the greater nations . '

		The author urges that a binding international agreement should be entered into as the most certain means of encour - aging a high standard of admission for immi - grants , preventing the spread of disease from one country to another , checking undue acti > ` ity on the part of transportation agent * , compelling each nation to assimie responsibility for the care of its own defectives and delinquents , and in - ducing the amelioration of political or economic wrongs which operate in certain countries to stim - ulate an vmdue amount of emigration .

		The idea is an attractive one , and as time goes on it bids fair to assume a more practical character than it may appear at present to possess .

		It is at least significant that , among other things in connection with immigration reform .

		President
Roosevelt	PERSON	in his last annual message declared himself in favor of an international conference to deal with the immigration question , which he agrees ' * has now more than a national significance . ''

		Happily for the student of social problems we are at last beginning to have exhaustive first - hand treatises on specific inunigration topics .

		The best of these which has yetsappeared is ' • The Russian Jew in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' planned and edited by Dr.
Charles S. Bemheimer	PERSON	.

		The vol - ume opens A ^ dth three illuminating essays , -- one on ' ■ ' ■ Elements of the Jewish Popidation of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by
Henrietta Szold	PERSON	, another on '' The Jew in
Russia	LOCATION	'' by
Peter Wiemik	PERSON	, and a third on '' The Russian Jew in the
United States	LOCATION	'' by Abi `` ahani
Cahan	PERSON	.

		All are written out of a wealth of precise information and , though deeply sympathetic , exhibit a perfectly sane and fair - minded spirit .

		By far the most valuable portion of Dr.
Bemheimer	PERSON	's book , however , is a series of studies on the condition of the Jewish immigrant popidation in the three great urban centres of
New York	LOCATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		These have been prepared by men and women whose practical knowledge and experience give them a rare degree of authority .

		The topics treated in connection with the Jewish population of each of the three cities are varietl and comprehensive , embracing economic and industrial conditions , religious activity , philanthropy , educational in - fluences , amusements and social life , politics , health and sanitation , law and litigation , and geographical distribution .

		There is likewise an interesting account of the rural settlements which have been established by Jews in many parts of the country ; also a fairly full bibliography .

		Now 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, that the
United States	LOCATION	has come to possess the third largest Jewish population among the na - tions of the world , the publication of such a body of investigations ought to be hailed as a real service by everyone concerned with our coointry 's tasks and fortunes .

		In his little volim -LSB- ie entitled '' The Jews in
America	LOCATION	`` Dr.
Madison C. Peters	PERSON	has given us a readable but superficial sketch of the part which the Jews have had in the development of the
United States	LOCATION	from colonial times until the pres - ent .

		In war , politics , diplomacy , finance , let - ters , art , and science the
American Jew	ORGANIZATION	has taken an indisputably high place , and it is much to be regretted that the recent celebration of the two hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Jewish settlement on this side the
Atlantic	LOCATION	has not called forth a book more worthy of the subject , -- one in which we might indeed find sympa - thetic appreciation but less pf a disposition to glorify indiscriminately .

		Aside from the very brief chapters on the characteristics of the Jews as a people and the prevalence of anti-semitism in
America	LOCATION	, what we have in Dr.
Peters	PERSON	's book is little more than an enumeration of two or three hundred men of Hebrew race who have contributed in some marked way to our national life , together with paragraphs of a general nature emphasizing their services .

		The results are so interesting that one can not but wish that the work had been more thoroughly done .

		* Dr.

St. Lawrence	LOCATION	.

		A -LRB- Careful reading of the book serves to confirm the first impression .

		Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	has given us what may almost be regarded as the last word on the great navigator of
St. Malo	ORGANIZATION	.

		His work is author - itative .

		ical students have their full share of himian na - ture ; they never have seen , and never will see , all alike .

		But both they and the less critical , though not always less discerning , `` general reader '' must be grateful for such a real addition to the sum of human knowledge as a volume of this kind represents .

		Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	introduces his work with a schol - arly memoir , in wliich are gathered together the scanty details of
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	's life .

		As with so many of the world 's great explorers , very little is known of Jacques Cartier beyond what may be gathered from the narratives of his several voy - ages .

		Even the year of his birth has been in dispute , though it is now generally accepted as
1491	DATE	.

		About the only light that the records of his native town throw upon his early life is that afforded by the Registres de I ` etat civil , in which his name appears in connection with no less than fifty-three baptisms , in twenty-seven of which he acted as godfather .

		This , as Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	says , affords striking evidence of the high esteem in which
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	was held by the people of his native town .

		In the
St. Malo of the sixteenth century	DATE	a baptism was an event of some impor - tance , and the man who was twenty-seven tunes honored with the responsible position of godfather must indeed have been a universal favorite .

		At the age of twenty-eight
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	married
Catherine	PERSON	, daughter of Jacques des Granches , high constable of
St. Malo	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was already a man of mark in liis town , having won the title of master pilot .

		Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	conjectures that he had even now taken part in some of the fishing voyages to the far-away shores of the
New World	LOCATION	, gaining thereby that skill in navigation which he after - ward so signally exhibited .

		Of the fifteen years of
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	's life between his marriage and the voyage of
1534	DATE	, even less is known , if possible , than of the j ^ ears of his youth and early manhood .

		From the frequent mention of
Brazil	LOCATION	in his Voyages , it is believed that he must have visited
South America	LOCATION	during this period , probably with one or more of the Portuguese expeditions ; a supposition which is supported by the fact that in
1528	DATE	his wife stood sponsor for a ''
Catherine de Brezil	PERSON	, '' a yoimg native believed to have been brought by
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	from that coimtry on one of his voj ^ ages .

		It is also noted that
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	frequently acted as Por - tuguese interpreter at
St. Malo	ORGANIZATION	.

		For many years the only known accoimt of
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	's first voyage was that contained in Ra - musio 's great work of
1556	DATE	, translated a few years later into English by
Florio	PERSON	.

		It was not until
1867	DATE	that the original relation turned up .


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 261 in the
Bibliotheque Imperiale	LOCATION	at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		This .

		was printed the same year under the title '' Re - lation
Originale du Voyage de Jacques Cartier	ORGANIZATION	an
Canada	LOCATION	en
1534	DATE	. ''

		Of the '' ■ Relation Origi - nale '' Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	gives an excellent translation ; and , not content with this , adds what to the stu - dent will be of still greater interest and service -- a photographic copy of the original manu - script .

		This manuscript bears convincing inter - nal evidence of being a contemporary docimient .

		It has even been thought to be the original nar - rative , in
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	's own handwriting .

		To this view Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	takes exception , though he does not say on what grounds .

		The first published account of the second voy - age was the • ' Bref Recit '' of
1545	DATE	, afterward included by
Ramusio	PERSON	in his ''
Navigationi	PERSON	et Viaggi . ''

		Of this voyage there exist at least three contemporary manuscript accounts , all in the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Upon a care - ful comparison of the three manuscripts with the • ' Bref Recit ' '' Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	foimd that the three manuscripts were substantially the same , but they differed from the ' • Bref Recit '' in a nimi - ber of important particidars .

		It seemed desir - able therefore to put aside the printed narrative , and translate what appeared to be the best of the three manuscripts .

		This Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	has done .

		The onl -RCB- - account of the third voyage -LRB- 1540 -RRB- is that contained in
Hakluyt	LOCATION	-- who also gives an account of each of the previous voyages .

		This fragment , for it is nothing more .

		Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	has also printed .

		We find , therefore , in his book a translation of the original manuscript of the first voyage , a translation of the best of the three relations of the second , and the only known account of the third .

		The text of these three narratives he has enriched with copious notes , the result of a close study of all the evidence available .

		As to
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	's alleged fourth voyage , Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	has this to say : '' That he made a fourth voyage to
Canada	LOCATION	to bring back
Roberval	PERSON	, although no account of such a voyage has been preserved , has been thought probable by a report of an
Admiralty Commission	ORGANIZATION	appointed on the
3rd of April , 1544	DATE	, to audit his accounts ... Roberval and
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	were summoned to appear before them , and their decision in favour of
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	was rendered on the 21st of Jime following .

		The allowance had been asked by him on account of ships employed in the third voyage , and an additional allowance on account of another vessel employed in a subsequent voyage .

		A copy of the application made to the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	has not been pre - served , but the report makes it clear what this subse - quent voyage was for , '' i. e. , on account of a ship used * `` for eight months to fetch the said
Roberval	PERSON	. ''

		Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	is inclined , on the whole , to dis - credit this fourth voyage , or perhaps rather to regard the claim as '' not proven . ''

		In this con - nection it may be mentioned that the Canadian Archivist has lately unearthed at
Paris	LOCATION	a nimi - ber of hitherto unknown documents bearing on Cartier and his voyages .

		Copies have not yet been received from
Paris	LOCATION	, and it is not possible to say what additional light they may throw on the subject ; but if they include anything authentic ^ s-ith regard to the alleged fourth voyage , or filling in the wide gaps in the third voyage , their publication will be eagerly awaited by everyone interested in historical research .

		In the French archives , and elsewhere , there exist a number of contemporary documents , bearing more or less directly upon the Cartier voyages .

		The most important of these Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	has translated and added to the nar - ratives .

		The importance of preserving such dociunents is emphasized by the fact that many invaluable manuscripts , known at one time to have been in the French archives , have disap - peared .

		It may seem unfair to single out the French archives in this way ; but unf ortimately , although losses have occurred in the archives of every country , they are as nothing compared to those which the Archives of
France	LOCATION	have sus - tained .

		At the time of the Revolution , cart - loatls of these precious records were literally dumped out on the street , to be used for lighting fires .

		Even so recently as
1815	DATE	it is related that an official of the government , desiring room for his secretary , sent a vast collection of ancient manuscripts to '' Les epicieres de
Versailles	LOCATION	, '' and another sold entire files by weight for his private gain .

		It is probable that many vital doc - uments eagerly sought by historians for years may have been destroyed in this way .

		To sum up the contents of Dr.
Baxter	PERSON	's very interesting and important work , it includes a scholarly memoir by the editor ; complete and accurate translations of the Voyages of
1534	DATE	, 1535-6 , and
1540	DATE	; a facsimile of the manu - script narrative of the first voyage ;
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	' s Vocabulary of the Language of the Natives of
Canada	LOCATION	;
Roberval	ORGANIZATION	's Voyage of
1542	DATE	; the course of
Jean Alphonse	PERSON	,
Roberval	ORGANIZATION	's pilot ; a collection of
Collateral Documents	ORGANIZATION	, translated from the French and Spanish ; and a
Grenealogj	LOCATION	- of Cartier '' s family .

		To these are added a Bibliography , an Itinerary of the Voyages , and an an ^ ytical Index .

		The work is elaborately Ulustrated by charts , facsimiles of manuscripts , and reproductions of old plates , -- all on
Japan	LOCATION	paper , splendidly executed .

		The doubtful portrait of Jacques 262 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	,
Cartier	ORGANIZATION	, the original of which hangs in the
Hotel de Ville	ORGANIZATION	at
St. Malo	ORGANIZATION	, is used as a frontis - piece .

		Of the make-up of the book it would be im - possible to speak too highly .

		It is one to de - light the heart of the lover of good books and good book-making .

		It gives an appropriate setting to one of the really important historical books of the year .


Lawrence J. Burpee	PERSON	.

		Recext Fiction .

		* The capacity for indignation is a fine quality , in literature no less than in life , but the subject upon which it is employed must be one that raises no doubt concerning the moral issues involved .

		Mr.
Upton Sinclair	PERSON	, in his war story of ''
Manassas	LOCATION	, '' found in the abolitionist movement one of the finest of possible themes , and gave us a singularly forceful embodi - ment of the passion for righteousness .

		When , how - ever , he takes for his theme the labor conditions of a great modern industry , and imports into his treat - ment the same heated methods that were so proper in the treatment of the curse of slavery , we feel that the issue is clouded , and that to produce the impres - sion desired , he must resort to exaggeration and falsi - fication , appeal to narrow prejudice , and have recourse to all manner of sensational expedients .

		This does not seem to us an unfair statement of what his method has been in `` The Jungle , '' which deals with the packing industries of the
Chicago	LOCATION	stock yards , and eventually turns out to be an undisguised contribu - tion to the propaganda of socialism .

		In substance , the book tells the story of a Lithuanian immigrant , from the time of his arrival in
America	LOCATION	to that of his enrollment in the ranks of socialist agitators .

		.

		Diu-ing this time he is employed in various capacities in
Packingtown	LOCATION	, suffers about every sort of misery that a lively imagination could devise , is brought several times into the clutches of the law , becomes a hobo , a hold-up man , and a politician , after which rake 's progress he settles down as one of the avowed enemies of society as it now exists .

		This scheme permits the author to indulge in a frantic onslaught upon pretty nearly every phase of the present social • The Jungle .

		` order , and he utilizes his opportunities to the utmost .

		We doubt if much good is to be done by this sort of ex parte treatment , however real some of the griev - ances may be , and assuredly no balanced and intel - ligent observer will agree in anything like its entirety to this wholesale indictment of industrial and social conditions .

		It is too obviously colored for effect , too wilfully blind to the many forces for good which are steaddy at work counteracting the evils whose exist - ence we readily admit .

		Mr.
Sinclair	PERSON	's horrors are not typical , and his indecencies of speech are not tolerable in any book that has claims to considera - tion as literature .

		He has evidently '' got up '' his case with much pains and ingenuity , but he spoils it by his excess of bias and vehemence .

		Nor are we willing to admit that a work is a novel in any proper sense which does little more than exhibit a technical familiarity with certain trades , and is forever declaim - ing against wrongs , real or imagined .

		In all the essential qualities of good fiction this book is con - spicuously lacking .

		Its figures are puppets , its construction is chaotic , its style is turgid , and its truth is more than half falsehood .

		Now that the author has relieved his mind , we trust that he will turn again to his war story , and complete the work that was so admirably begun a year or two ago .

		`` The Quickening , '' by Mr.
Francis Lynde	PERSON	, offers once more the familiar story of the unregenerate country boy and the dainty maiden who becomes for hiin the one woman in the world , and whom he mar - ries after the inevitable years of misunderstanding .

		There is also , of course , the usual rival , the youth bred in the refinements of civilization , polished with - out and corrupt within .

		The scene is
Tennessee	LOCATION	, and the time our own , which is a departure from the usual practice of setting the action far enough back to send the hero to the Civil War .

		It is in the mod - ern industrial war of promoters and capitalists that he wins his spurs instead , but the outcome is to the same general effect .

		The story is pleasant and genuine .

		`` The Sage Brush Parson , '' by ``
A. B. Ward	PERSON	, '' is the story of an English dissenting preacher , who feels that he can best accomplish his mission for the saving of souls by deserting his unsympathetic wife , going to
America	LOCATION	, and establishing himself in a
Nevada	LOCATION	frontier community .

		Here he finds material a-plenty for his missionary efforts , and , being a good deal of a man at bottom , he wins the respect of his rough neighbors , and comes to have a strong influ - ence over their lives .

		They test him in various ways , and he always proves game .

		The town includes in its population a small group of people of wealth and refinement , one of them being a woman , and her friendship for the preacher becomes the oasis in the desert of his emotional life .

		We think that she is a widow , although we are never quite able to find out ; she thinks that he is unmari-ied , and discovers her mistake under very tragic circumstances near the close of the book .

		For the deserted wife appears upon the scene , nags her husband until he wishes that she were dead , and then , in a quarrel , kdls her - self with their child out of pure spite , knowing that
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 263 his remorse will charge him with blood-guiltiness .

		It does indeed , for , when accused of murder , he pleads guilty , to the amazement of his friends , and is about to be hanged when the truth is brought to view .

		There is much strength in this vivid narrative , com - bined with humor , realistic description , and incisive ■ characterization .

		The desert island story seems to be acquiring vogue • once more .

		Its latest variant is '' The Sea Maid , '' by Mr.
Ronald Macdonald	PERSON	.

		which tells how the Dean of Beckminster and his aUing wife sailed for the anti- podes in
1883	DATE	, and for nearly a quarter of a century remained unheard from , and naturally mourned as dead .

		As a matter of fact , they had been ship - wrecked upon an uncharted island , and so contrived to adapt themselves to circumstances that when they are discovered they are found to be leading a reason - ably comfortable existence .

		TVe hast `` n to mention that there is a daughter , born upon the island , and now grown to beautiful womanhood without ever having seen other human beings than her parents .

		This
Miranda	PERSON	is the • • sea maid '' of the title , and when her Ferdinand turns up , the natural conse - quences follow .

		His appearance is contrived by a mutiny on board a steamer in the Australian trade , with the marooning of ofl & cers and passengers upon the same unknown island , which happens to be con - veniently at hand .

		Here is a piquant situation , and it is developed with ingenious success , albeit with a certain extravagance of humor .

		For sheer enter - tainment this story is one of the best of the year , and it is by no means devoid of the qualities that appeal to the literary sense .

		The troubles experienced by the hero of '' Double Trouble , '' a story by Mr.
Herbert Quick	PERSON	, are of the sort known to the gentleman whose personality alter - nated between that of Dr.
Jekyll	PERSON	and Mr.
Hyde	PERSON	.

		In other words , the story is of a dual personality , told without anything of
Stevenson	PERSON	's psychological in - sight , but nevertheless with a very pretty gift of invention .


Florian Amidon	PERSON	, a banker of
Hazelhurst	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, starts on a journey .

		He has not got very far when he suddenly and mysteriously becomes somebody else .

		In his new character , it seems , he is
Eugene Brassfield	PERSON	.

		and \ Arith that name he wanders to BeUevale ,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, settles down , lives for several years , and becomes a leading citizen .

		One night , while on his way to
Xew York	LOCATION	, he falls out of his berth in the sleeper , and the shock awakens bim as
Amidon	PERSON	, his existence as
Brassfield	PERSON	becoming a complete blank .

		But his clothes , the papers foimd in his pockets , and the reception he meets when he reaches
New York	LOCATION	, all afford convincing evidence that he is
Brassfield	PERSON	.

		One letter , in particular , shows him that he is engaged to marry a girl of BeUevale , who has the most unbounded affection for him .

		In his perplexity , he consults a pair of hypnotists -- a German professor with a lovely daughter -- who find that the
Brassfield	PERSON	personality emerges when he is put to sleep under their influence .

		By taking notes of what he says during a succession of these trances , thev construct for him an outline of his
Brassfield	PERSON	life and character , and impart the facts to him after he is awakened .

		Armed with this material , he re - pairs to BeUevale , accompanied by his friends the hypnotists , and with the help of the notes suppUed him , tries to fit himself into the existence concerning which his memorj ' has nothing to teU him .

		The resulting compUcations are extremely amusing , and keep the reader 's interest alert to the end .

		The story , moreover , has a crisp and animated style that adds greatly to the charm .

		As for the quotations from imaginary poems that preface the chapters , they are , if anything , more diaboUcaUy ingenious than the prose narrative .

		We can assure the reader of this tale much satisfaction .

		One does not like to say imkind things about Mr.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	's romantic fictions , even if he does write far too many of them to write any of them carefuUy , and even if their appeal is quite obviously made to a rather low level of appreciation .

		They are nice stories , after aU , not devoid of interest , and fairly reeking with wholesome sentiment .

		The writer has , moreover , a pretty knack of working up his historical argument , and he has reaUy read widely and wisely in American annals .

		`` The Pa - triots '' is a story of the Civil War , having Lee for its historical hero , and a young Confederate officer for its romantic hero .

		The scenes chiefly described are
Pickett	ORGANIZATION	's charge at Gettj ` sburg .

		the struggle in the WUderness , and the final operations about
Richmond	LOCATION	- There are two heroines , both charming , and the right one wins the contested object of their common wor - ship .

		Dr.
Brady	PERSON	thinks that a writer at this day need make no apology for extolling the character of that great leader and true-hearted gentleman who so valiantly maintained the last hope of the Confederacy as long as any hope was possible , and we quite agree with him .

		Barring the one fatal mistake of judg - ment -LRB- or of sjTupathy -RRB- which aUgned him with the foes of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, the career of Lee earned for him the respect , the admiration , and almost the love , of North no less than of
South	LOCATION	, and there is no one of us who may not be proud of claiming him as a feUow-countryman .

		The story of the priest , to whom the meaning of life is revealed after his vows are taken , and who deserts his calling in response to the imperative mandate of natural instinct , is the stor \ ' of `` The Lake , '' Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's recently-published noveL The story is anything but a new one , and readily lends itself to sensational and unwholesome treat - ment .

		In the present case , the handling is not sen - sational , but is not altogether free from the charge of unwholesomeness .

		Father
Gogarty	PERSON	is in charge of a poor parish in
Connaught	LOCATION	, and among his parish - ioners is a young woman who sins , and is in conse - quence driven from her home , largely by the sternness of the priest 's denunciation of her conduct .

		Repent - ing him of his severity ' upon reflection , he enters into correspondence with the girl , and during the course of this correspondence , he comes to realize that the very vehemence of his accusation had been the outcome of unconscious jealousy , that he had 264 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, denounced her more because of the stirrings of love in his own breast than because of horror at what she had done .

		The gi'eater part of the story is told in the letters which these two exchange , letters which permit the author to discuss not only matters of religion and ethics , but also of art and music .

		The two never meet again , but the self-searchings evoked by their correspondence determine the priest to abandon his profession and go forth into the world , a man among men .

		He makes his escape by swim - ming across the lake one
summer	DATE
night	TIME	, leaving it to be supposed that he has been drowned , but in reality making his way to a seaport , and embarking for AJnerica .

		Here the story ends .

		It wiU be seen that its interest is almost purely psychological , and that the theatre of its action is Father
Gogarty	PERSON	's mind rather than the community in which his lot is cast .

		And although the language is at times appall - ingly frank , it must be admitted that the spirit of the treatment is in general one of artistic restraint .

		The style has the simplicity and transparency that betoken the accomplished craftsman in words , and the author 's feeling for nature is expressed as admirably as his feeling for art and life .

		We doubt if Mr.
Moore	PERSON	has ever done a better piece of writing .

		We have read '' The Healers '' with mingled de - light and exasperation .

		The Dutchman who writes in English under the style of ''
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	'' has a wealth of wholesome and tender sentiment , a fund of genial observation , and a flow of unfailing himtior .

		These qualities make every one of his books noteworthy , and the latest is no exception to the rule .

		With all these gifts to lavish upon a novel it seems to us sheer wantonness that he should also make use of the sensational devices connoted by such terms as telepathy and clairvoyance , and should even resort to such cheap wonders as planchette-writing and table - tipping .

		These things are wrought into the very fabric of his new novel and weaken its logical foun - dations .

		For a serious purpose underlies the play - fulness of this book , a purpose which finds expression in the following proposition : '' As a rule , the medical is the least conservative of the professions , for in their utter incertitude and tomfoolery of ineffective nos - trums the doctors naturally snatch at any new chance of an accidental success . ''

		But the tomfooleries of medicine are highly respectable in comparison with those of popular superstition , which are here put for - ward as a substitute .

		We are thus bound to repu - diate the book in its would-be serious aspect , and fall back upon the entertaining invention , the acute characterization , and the combined humor and pathos that it offers .

		The characters are Dutch and En - glish , the scenes
Leyden	PERSON	and
Paris	LOCATION	; there is a curious resemblance to '' God 's Fool '' in the study of the defective chUd , gradually awakened to a kind of life , as a moral , if not as a thinking , creature .

		We must condemn Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's '' The Angel of Pain '' on grounds similar to those that make '' The Healers '' so ineffective .

		Here is a story of English life ' well-proportioned and skUfidly told , working with strength and insight toward a striking consum - mation , having for its motive the development of the finer qualities of manhood through the ministry of suffering , and keeping , for the most part , a firm grasp upon the realities of life .

		But into this other - wise sane , although possibly overwrought , narrative there is injected an element of the most fantastic superstition .

		One of the characters , who has deserted society for the contemplative life , enters into so close a communion with nature that he comes to hear in very truth the shrill notes of Pan 's flute , and at last sees the god face to face , only to be crushed to death in his shaggy embrace .

		This incident is not repre - sented as resulting from a crazed fancy ; it is given us as equally credible with incidents of the ordinary sort , and is supported by the evidence of eye - witnesses .

		Now Mr.
Benson	PERSON	does not believe this , or anything like this , to be possible ; he has simply spoiled a story of genuine human interest by a reck - less indulgence in sensational imaginings .

		He has done the same sort of thing once before , and if he do not pull himself together in time , he wiU come near to ruining his hitherto creditable reputation as a minor novelist .

		Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	's latest invention is something of a novelty .

		Instead of finding its theme in Scotch Covenanters or Spanish Carlists , it plunges us into the slums of modern
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, and makes us ac - quainted with the gentry whose profession is crime , and whose chief object in life is to escape the gal - lows .

		We have described a school for the training of thieves that makes the establishment of the late Mr.
Fagin	PERSON	seem primitive indeed .

		We have also a modern Oliver Twist -- one '' Kid McGhie '' -- who is an interesting little chap , and who insinuates him - self quite closely into our affections .

		Side by side with this study of the criminal environment , we have depicted the correctives of settlement and reforma - tory , whereby the story becomes justified in its title , `` Fishers of Men . ''

		But all these matters do not account for more than half of the varied interests of the story , which also provides us with types and situations belonging to a very different social sphere .

		Abundance of exciting incident -LRB- sometimes close to melodrama -RRB- , a well-sustained plot , shrewd charac - terization , and genial humor all combine to make this book one of the most entertaining that Mr.
Crockett	PERSON	has ever written .

		An Enatish A new '' History of the Civil War in AmeHcaJ '' '' ^ ^ e

		W. Birkbeck Wood and
Major J. E. Edmonds	PERSON	, two English army officers , is published in
America	LOCATION	by the Messrs.

		The problems of the American CivU War have had , during recent years , special interest for British soldiers ; and this volume is , like

		THE DIAL 265 battles and campaigns of that conflict .

		The Intro - duction , by Mr.
Spencer Wilkinson	PERSON	, makes some state - ments that lead one to expect more than the authors perhaps intended .

		They take little notice of politics and diplomacy , of social and economic conditions , but confine their attention strictly to military history .

		A separate chapter deals with the naval operations of the war .

		The numerous maps and battle-plans are instructive , but not always accurate .

		To Amer - icans , the value of the book is to be foxmd mainly in the judgments arrived at by competent critics who are thoroughly impartial on all questions .

		Their disinterested views on matters of controversy are worthy of the most serious consideration .

		The deep - lying causes of the war are more clearly seen by them than by those nearer the scene of trouble .

		``
Mason	PERSON	's and
Dixon	PERSON	's line , '' they say , `` was some - thing more than an artificial boundary between slavery and emancipation .

		It had come to be a geographical boundarj ' - line between two separate peoples .

		The character , institutions , and interests of the North and South were as different as those of any two neighboring nations . ''

		Leaders and policies of each side come in for moderate criticism .

		Lincoln is criticised for interfering with his generals for polit - ical purposes ;
Davis	PERSON	, for allowing his own views on military matters to embarrass the operations of his generals .

		Throughout the book , emphasis is laid upon the mistake of
Davis	PERSON	in insisting on a strictly defensive fight while waiting for foreign recognition .

		A defensive policy prolonged the agony ; it could not win the war .

		On the other hand , the
Washington	LOCATION	government feared too much for the safetj ' of the capitol , and this gave the Confederates the oppor - tunity to defend
Richmond	LOCATION	by demonstrations in the far-away valley of the
Shenandoah	LOCATION	.

		The Con - federates are commended for the way in which their leaders cooperated with one another , in sharp con - trast with the jealousy among the Federal com - manders ; but they are condemned for their too defensive policy , for their neglect of their western frontier , and for placing too many men , who were afterwards captured , in the fortresses guarding the rivers .

		The estimates of the leading generals are fair enough , Lee and
Jackson	PERSON	are the great mUitarj - fig - ures of the war ; next come
McClellan	PERSON	,
Grant	PERSON	, and Sherman : the two Johnsons and
Stuart	PERSON	are not so important , the authors think , as the Southerners consider them ;
Halleck	PERSON	was a fraud : Longstreet is pronounced slow ; and the opinion is ventured that had
Jackson	PERSON	been with Lee at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, they would have won .

		The decisive factor of the war was the
Union Navy	ORGANIZATION	, which blockaded the coast and broke the Confederate lines along the rivers .

		The authors are mistaken in saying that the Abolitionists gave Lincoln an enthusiastic support and '' supplied the Northern armies with their best soldiers . ''

		The work contains no new material , it makes little use of the official records , and it shows nothing striking as to arrangement or presentation ; but it is a useful condensation of the best military histories and is illuminated by much judicious comment .

		Thus one would expect `` The Letters of Richard Ford '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , as edited and annotated by Mr.

Ford	ORGANIZATION	wrote frequent letters to his friend , Henry Un - win

Madrid	LOCATION	, and he continued the correspondence after his return to
England	LOCATION	.

		These letters , carefully treas - ured by
Addington	PERSON	, have recently come into the pos - session of the writer 's widow , and are now published at her desire .

		The Torrijos insurrection and other political and military ' disquietudes helped to make
Ford	ORGANIZATION	's stay in
Spain	LOCATION	an eventful one .

		A
summer	DATE	and autumn were spent by him and his family as tenants of a small part of the
Alhambra	LOCATION	, whence letters of a picturesque quality were despatched to his friend in
Madrid	LOCATION	.

		Returning to his more permanent quarters - at
Seville	LOCATION	,
Ford	ORGANIZATION	thus describes the difficulties and dangers of the journey : '' We have at length arrived here safely , God be praised I through the deepest ploughed fields , worst
Veritas	ORGANIZATION	, and stoutest gangs of robbers in aU
Spain	LOCATION	.

		We have been six mortal days on the journey , doing some 36 leagues at an expense of 6000 or 7000 reals , having fed 29 persons every night , ravenous wolves who never ate before and probably never will again unless some Milor or # m ~ hajador should make that journey ... '' The let ^ ters show their writer to have been something of a con - noisseur in feminine beauty .

		It may be added in pass - ing that he thrice , in a comparatively short life , bent his neck to the matrimonial yoke .

		The letters from
England	LOCATION	, after his return home , describe with viva - city and wit his literary pursuits , which were chiefly in the way of writing reviews and special articles for the '' Quarterly , '' the * ' Ekiinburgh , '' and other prom - inent journals .

		Five years were devoted , intermit - tently , to his Spanish guidebook .

		The illustrations accompanying these letters are from sketches , draw - ings , and paintings , but not from
Ford	ORGANIZATION	's hand though he was no contemptible draughtsman .

		They are in - teresting , and not merely decorative .

		Two

		of the secret longer a matter of surprise .

		Of his of the Totem .

		many fields of enterprise , the one most frequently cultivated leads him into the inter - esting domain of the early psychology of man .

		.

		In his latest venture , the quest is for '' The Secret of the Totem '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , a perplexing quarry 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, with mysterious haunts .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's methods are the sturdy ones held in high esteem by the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	mind , quite aptly described as an exalted common-sense .

		Penetration is no adequate substi - tute for thoroughness ; but it is the better half of what should be a joint equipment for the chase .

		Whatever the totem comes to mean in more elabo - rately organized communities , its simpler status is a tribal relationship , with its fundamental service in the regulation of the eligibility of marriages between near of kin .

		It is a totem-kin at all events , -- how - ever variable a relation that term may cover .

		The next query relates to the primitive condition of man before this type of marriage-restriction was insti - tuted : whether of large promiscuous herds , or of small unit groups rided by one or a few male patri - archs .

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	, with
Darwin	PERSON	and many others , adheres to the last named supposition .

		Somehow from this relation there developed a system in which the men of one group could take as wives only those of another ; and the designation of each was that of the animal to whose totem each belonged .

		The name is ever a potent influence in savage psychology , and animals are held in high esteem ; but the institution prompted the name , not the converse .

		Why animal names were chosen is no more of a mystery than that we stiU speak of the inhabitants of three adjoining states as
Badgers	ORGANIZATION	,
Gophers	ORGANIZATION	, and
Wolverines	LOCATION	.

		In oppo - sition to the view that the totem marriage-restriction was either a moral one or an innate response to the dangers of in-breeding , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	posits it as an outgrowth of the necessity of the young males to look elsewhere for partners , and of coming to look in convenient or preferred tribes .

		The rest of the asso - ciations with the custom , as well as the complex group of tales and rites and beliefs that attach to the rela - tion , grow naturally out of the psychological habits of primitive man .

		There is more to the theory than this ; and its application to the facts , and its accounting for the exceptions and crossing with other customs , make the whole an intricate tale upon which the author of `` The Disentanglers '' has spent his cus - tomary ingenuity .

		The unhappy life and tragic death of ' ^ rM : .

		T8tu : rt. ^ ^ ^ y ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ `` * Scots are a perennial source of literary and romantic as well as of historic interest .

		The past year adds to the already long list two new biographies .

		One of these , written by Mr.
A. H. Millar	PERSON	and imported by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	, is best characterized by the con - cluding sentence of the preface : '' To explain fully the conditions under which her life was passed is not possible within limited space , but an honest attempt will here be made to place the events of her che - quered career faithfully before the reader , so that he may draw his own conclusions . ''

		The book is , in the main , a careful and not too detailed presentation of facts .

		Regarding the famous Casket Letters , for example , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's conclusion is cited , that '' while some portions of the most incriminating letters are genuine , these have been tampered with , '' and the ad - ditional important fact is stated that neither
Norfolk	LOCATION	nor Sir
Francis Knollys	PERSON	laid stress upon them .

		-- The second of these biographies , by Miss
Hilda T. Skae	PERSON	-LRB- published by
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , is less judicial in tone .

		Referring to the episode just spoken of , we find the statement , '' Mary must be prevented from appearing in her own defence ... No originals of these documents were asked for ; nor , supposing they had ever existed , do they appear to have been seen since the date of their alleged discovery ... The Conferences neither established nor disproved
Mary	PERSON	's guilt ; but they served the purpose of giving publicity to charges which her detractors were only too interested in spreading . ''

		-LRB- The italics are the reviewer 's . -RRB-

		This is certainly an attempt to bias opinion in Mary 's behalf .

		The full truth , however , will never be known .

		The student can not but won - der , sometimes , whether
Schiller	PERSON	's poetic insight has not given a fairer appreciation of Mary 's character , despite the fact that he dealt with historic material with the utmost freedom and invented the three points upon which the plot of his tragedy turns , than is to be gained by searching the archives and follow - ing the devious mazes of political intrigue that deter - mined the career of the beautiful and unhappy queen .

		The storv of '' ^ distinctly notable contribution to a wayivard OUT comprehension of the vicissitudes personaiitv .

		Qf personality has been made by Dr.
Morton	PERSON	Prince in his story of '' The Dissociation of a Personality '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		Professor James has given a classic description of the manner by which an individual becomes the complex self that he is by the several furtherings and relinquishments of the possible selves that he might have been ; and thiis the unity of our personality may well be said to be an achievement , however natural a one .

		The storm and stress period of an impressignable adolescence precipitates these struggles of inner conflict , com - plicated by outer circumstance .

		The story of
Miss Beauchamp	PERSON	is that of a young woman in whom these several potentialities -- conflicting embodiments of a complex and abnormal nature -- alternately and interferingly took command and divided the house against itself .

		The assimilative processes became grouped about several centres with complex relations to one another ; and the '' eccentric '' selves , neglect - ing and antagonizing the interests , each of the other , gave rise to many a hopeless conflict in the practical arena .

		The several characters thus selfishly shaping their several fortunes developed such opposed char - acteristics that Dr. Prince acknowledges the tempta - tion to call his book '' The Saint , the Woman , and the Devil . ''

		Most startling of all is the revelation that the
Miss Beauchamp	PERSON	who sought his professional aid , then a college student whom her friends thought '' queer , '' but yet one of themselves , proved to be but a variant of the original Miss B. , who was at last discovered as the rightful heir of this personality disinherited by a violent hysterical attack , and in the end restored to her OAvn , and the several rivals ejected .

		267 threads , and to prove that truth is stranger than fic - tion , and yet more coherent .

		This `` biographical study in abnormal psychology '' is most discerningly portraved , and is recommended alike for the fasci - nation of the theme and the insight that it affords into the methods by which psychology comes to the aid of practical treatment and diagnosis .

		Yet the ■ whole story is but the abnormal development , vrrit large , of what in miniature phase we all recognize as a factor in the genesis of self-expression .

		By no means the slightest service of the volume will be that of showing the kind of analysis that alone is adequate for an understanding of the wawardness of our wonderfuUv and fearfullv made minds .

		The story of a Platonic friendship .

		A truly Platonic friendship between two boys is related in language so choice and beautiful as almost to > mack of preciosity - , by Mr.
Forrest Reid	PERSON	-- a name that has a somewhat pseudonymous look -- in his sumptuous little quarto entitled `` The Garden Grod , '' which is published by ` Mr.
David Nutt	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	in a limited edition of 250 copies .

		The hero of this prose poem is
Graham Iddesleigh	PERSON	, who seems to have been early inf ecte < l with the divine madness described in the '' Phaedrus , '' -- the madness caused by a re - newed vision of that supernal beauty wherein the soul revelled in its unembodied state .

		This madness , finding in
Harold Brocklehurst	PERSON	a living embodiment of that faintly remembered beauty , issues in a friend - ship at once vehemently passionate and absolutely pure .

		The untimely death of
Harold	PERSON	leaves his friend inconsolable ; and so the story of their love , told thirty years after by the mourning survivor , is an elegy , though in prose .

		The memory of the beauti - ftd youth is not to die '' without the meed of some melodious tear . ''

		We have been assured , by one who is no mean poet himself , that we do poets and their song a grievous wrong if our own soul does not bring to their high imagining as much beauty as they sing . ''

		` The Garden God '' is emphatically the kind of book to which one must bring a spirit of sympathy , a submission to the tale-teller 's magic spell .

		The friendship described is as transcendently beautiful as that pre-terrestial loveliness whereof the Platonist has fleeting glimpses , and which the
Wordsworth	PERSON	- lover is dimly conscious of as having its dwelling in * ' the light of setting suns , and the round ocean , and the living air , and the blue sky , and in the mind of man . '' '

		Exactly who or what the garden god is , re - mains a little vague .

		One thing at least is certain : it is neither Priapus nor Yertxmanus .

		But lest any attempted explanation should end only in further befogging the question , it shall here be left to the ingenious reader .


Balthasar Hiibmaier	PERSON	has been here - tofore sadly neglected in the bio - graphical literature of the English language relating to the Protestant Reformers of the
Sixteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	; and of the two published biog - raphies of him , one is in the Bohemian language and the other is in German .

		The Reverend Dr.
Henry	PERSON	A hero and leader of the
Reformation C. Tedder	PERSON	,
Professor of Church History	ORGANIZATION	in the
Crozer Theological Seminary	ORGANIZATION	, has laid all students of reli - gious history under obligation to him for his contri - bution of a life of Hiibmaier to the series of * ' Heroes of the Reformation '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The difficulties encountered in the preparation of the book have not been easily overcome , for the bibliography of the sub - ject contains few works in the English language .

		While not the founder of the sect of Anabaptists , and while himself repudiating that title as recognizing the validity of infant baptism ,
Hiibmaier	PERSON	was the leader of the sect , was recognized as such in his day , and rose to the distinction of being fourth on the list of heretics whose works were placed by the Roman Church on the `` Index Librorum Prohibitorum , '' in
1616	DATE	.

		He was at one time friendly with the Swiss Reformers , but later engaged in controversial writ - ings with
Zwingli	PERSON	.

		He entered upon his task of re - form in
1523	DATE	, which left only five years of his life for that work , for he suffered martyrdom as a leader of the Anabaptists , by burning , on the 10th of
March , 1528	DATE	.

		His life of about fortj ' - seven years was wholly spent in
Switzerland	LOCATION	and in the valley of the
Dan	PERSON	- ube , and was lacking in incident ; but twenty-six of his writings are extant , and to bring the volume up to the standard size set for the series , an appendix has been added containing his excursus '' On the Sword '' and his '' Hymn , '' -- the latter both in German and in English translation .

		With its numerous illustra - tions the book gives an interesting picture of certain phases of the great Protestant Reformation not to be found elsewhere .

Frederick Grant Gleason	PERSON	has been awarded a similar honor .

		Mr.

		Although Mr.
Brown	PERSON	feels thor - oughly the ever-fleeting , ever-varying charm of this wonderful city , unique among all the cities of the world , he does not write simply of its picturesque aspects .

		He is learned in all the lore of the region , historical , geographical , practical , and artistic .

		The history he divides into four great periods , -- of con - solidation , of empire , of entanglement , and of decline .

		Most brilliant of these , of course , was the second .

		Then it was that
Venice	LOCATION	emerged victorious from her struggle for the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	empire ; then wealth was pouring into her coffers and bringing in the pomp of art , the pageantry of existence , her palace fronts along the Grand Canal , her learned academies , her printing-press , her schools of painting , her regal receptions , the splendor of her state functions , the sumptuousness of private life , -- all , in short , that made her what she was , the dazzling pleasure-garden of
Europe	LOCATION	, the envied of other states .

		But her great - ness and pride led on to her downfall ; ceasing to be the mart of
Europe	LOCATION	, she gradually wasted away till she was but a wreck and hollow show of her former glory .

		Nevertheless , our own
Venice	LOCATION	, the
Venice	LOCATION	of to-day , has a charm all its own ; and it is with this that the present work chiefly concerns itself .

		There are interesting chapters on the old Campanile , both before and since its
fall	DATE	; chapters on each of the two columns which guard the Piazzetta , on Knockers , on PUes and Pile-driving , on Fetes , etc. .

		The latter half of the book is given to the surrounding country and villages , such as the river
Brenta	LOCATION	, the
Eugenean Hills	LOCATION	, and
Istria	LOCATION	.

		The illustrations , though not nu - merous , are very satisfactory , and are in direct rela - tion to the text rather than merely ornamental , as so often is the case in books of this kind .

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , for which Dr.
George E. Street	PERSON	gathered the material , and which , since Dr. Street 's death , another enthusiastic Mount Deserter has ed - ited .

		A memoir of Dr. Street and the editor 's pre - face give some account of the pains that have been taken to make the history complete and accurate and the illustrations varied and interesting .

		French ex - plorations , Jesuit settlements , the visits of the Indians who were the earliest settlers to use the island as a
summer	DATE	resort , the warfare between
New England	LOCATION	and
New France	LOCATION	, the coming of Tory proprietors , -- all make romantic chapters , full of lively interest .

		With the division of the island into townships , a more prosaic era begins ; but Dr. Street has managed to find material for two readable chapters dealing re - spectively with the life of the farmers and fishermen whose peaceful ownership of the islands was dis ^ turbed by the advent of the
summer	DATE	colonies , and with the island 's churches .

		The rapid development of the various
summer	DATE	resorts , from the simple begin - nings of the sixties and seventies , is briefly chron - icled .

		The whole history is simply and interestingly told , and is attractively illustrated with artistic views of island scenery and with portraits of explorers as old settlers .

		The volume contains little that is new ; but the author tells well the tragic story of

NEW YORK	LOCATION	1906 -RSB- THE DLAX 277 EVERY LIBRARY SHOULD HAVE The Sumptuous and

London	LOCATION	.

		1st edition .

		Photog ^ vure portrait .

		^ 2.60 .

		Postpaid , 32.80 .

		This handsome volume , with its wide-margined 400 pages , contains 350 of the best Sonnets which the author has produced during a life devoted to poetry .

		In every way the book is a remarkable production .

		It contains many new Sonnets not before published .

		Xo American library can be considered complete mthout it .

		READ THE VERDICT OF HIGH AUTHORITIES IN GREAT
BRITAIN	LOCATION	AND
AMERICA	LOCATION	Westminster Review : -- ilr .

		Lloyd Mifflin 's sonnets exceed in number the Rime of
Petrarch	LOCATION	, and cover a wider field of thought , experience , and imagination .

		... It would be idle to attempt , in the limits of a short notice , anything like a critical examination of this wonderful collection ... He possesses a vivid imagination , kept under severe restraint , a delicate ear for rhythm , together with the faculty of pictorial presentation .

		These qualities , combined with a well-nigh faultless technique , render him unapproachable by any living English sonneteer .

		Mrs.
Ella Higginson	PERSON	: -- No American has ever made such an enduring and noteworthy contribution to the sonnet literatiire of the world .

		He stands beside
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		His work has the dignity , the serenity , the seriousness , the fine imagination and the diction , exquisitely simple and rich , that mark the great poet .

		Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	: -- A little more courage to know what is undeniably great , although it is our own , seems to me still desirable in our criticism , and when it comes -RCB- klr .

		Mifflin 's poetry will have its reward .


St. Andrew 's University	ORGANIZATION	: --
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	is a poet bom , not made .

		We can not withhold our admira - tion from a collection of sonnets which have a charm and a beauty about them giving evidence of the work of a poet of remarkable poetic genius .

		A herdeen Free Press : -- To the rare gift of a penetrative imagination he brings a finely balanced intel - lect and a keen sense of poetic diction .

		... In his highest flights he shows a warmth of imagination , a richness of colour , a clarity of thought , and an almost perfect technique that shows him not imworthy to walk beside the greatest sonneteers in the annals of the English language .

		Prof.
A. S. Mackenzie	PERSON	,
Kentucky State College	ORGANIZATION	, in the
Louisville	LOCATION	Courier-Journal : --
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	, in my opinion , is the greatest poet of
America	LOCATION	, past or present ... The sad part of it is that a man has to die to become famous .

		Dundee Advertiser : -- There are some critics who maintain that American poetry is on the decline .

		The halcyon days of
Bryant	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, ^ V ^ littier and
Whitman	PERSON	are gone , it is said .

		While there may be a grain of truth in the accusation , it can not justly be alleged that poetry of the higher order no longer has an exponent in
America	LOCATION	while
Lloyd Mifflin	LOCATION	still remains to carry on the great tradition of song .

		Yorkshire Post : -- ... Some are suffused with tenderness and beauty : a few , very few , are splendidly strong .

		To say that some half-dozen shovdd find a place in the most choice '' Sonnet Anthology '' of the future is the greatest praise we can conceive .

		Evening Post : -- Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	is justly entitled to a high position as a sonneteer .

		In his own way there is no one now living to equal him .

		Indeed , it is only just to remember that there have been in the course of English literarj - history only a very few poets who could get together a collection of sonnets at once so numerous as this and of such high technical excellence .

		The volume contains three hundred and fifty pieces , and is then but a selection .


R. H. Stoddard	PERSON	: -- His faults are condoned by many excellent qualities , and by one in which he has no superior among living American poets , if indeed an eqiial -- a glorious imagination ... The man who wrote this sonnet -LRB- '' The Flight '' -RRB- is a true poet , and must soon be reckoned among the masters of American song .

S0	ORGANIZATION	, The Story of the Constitution of the United States By
ROSSITER JOHNSON	PERSON	, LL.D .

		IF THERE is one subject in which we may reasonably expect every American citizen to be interested , that subject is the
National Constitution	ORGANIZATION	, which is the supreme law of the land .

		Many of our intel - ligent citizens possess a copy of the Constitution , or at least have read it .

		But few indeed are familiar with the story of its formation .

		The whole narrative is not only a significant piece of history , but an intensely interesting story , and will surprise some who imagine they are familiar with the history of our country .

		We commonly think the Fathers of the Republic framed it in their patriotic wisdom .

		How many of us are aware that some of them opposed it and did their utmost to defeat its acceptance ?

		How many know that one of our most honored Presidents was among these opponents ?

		How many know of the impracticable sections that escaped being incorporated in it ?

		How many are aware that in some States it was ratified by a bare majority ?

		How many are famUiar with the agency of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Franklin	PERSON	, and
Madison	PERSON	in its forma - tion ?

		How many know that
George Clinton	PERSON	-- then Governor of
New York	LOCATION	, and afterwards Vice-President of the
United States	LOCATION	-- tried hard to have
New York	LOCATION	reject it ?

		Heretofore this wonderful story was to be found only in pieces scattered through many books and doc - uments .

		Now it may be had in a single handy volume , '' The Story of the Constitution of the

		COMMENTS OF THE PRESS
BOSTON	LOCATION	TRANSCRIPT : '' A valuable and interesting compilation of the writings of
Franklin	LOCATION	, revealing more completely than any other the private character of the man . ''

		BOSTON HERALD : ''
Franklin	PERSON	's significance in literature appears when we remember that he was the fiist American to transcend provincial bomidaries and limitations , and the first author and scientist to achieve wide and permanent reputation in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		His autobiography was vivid , truthful , thrilling with life , for it was the simple , fascinating narrative of a career that began in lowly surroundings and ended in splendor .

		It contained therefore the substance of the stories that have chiefly interested the world . ''

		CHICAGO TRIBUNE : '' There was never a man whose interest extended to so many widely severed fields as did
Franklin	PERSON	's .

		Besides the scientific problems which he studied out to a satisfactory soliition , we find foreshadowed in his casual suggestions the germs of many later discoveries .

		His literary and political activity is mirrored in his writings , and his own autobiography is one of the classics of English literature . ''

		NEW YORK TRIBUNE : '' No more worthy tribute to the great philosopher and patriot could well have been contrived than the wholly admirable edition of his writings which Professor
Smyth	PERSON	has collected and edited with so much reverent scholarship and painstaking research . ''

		THE FORUM , -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	-RRB- : '' Everywhere we touch him he is the human and therefore the fascmating Franklin ... when his limitations have been duly considered , it remains true that
Franklin	PERSON	, like
Defoe	PERSON	, and for much the same reasons , is one of the most fascinating of mortals , at least to students who examine his char - acter by means of his self-revealing writings . ''

		NOTES 302 TOPICS IN LEADING PERIODICALS 303 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 303 GOVERXMENT DOCUMENTS .

		The largest printing and publishing estab - lishment in this eounti ^ , perhaps in the world , is conducted by the
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It is operated at an annual cost of from six to
seven millions of dollars	MONEY	, it em - ploys about five thousand people , and it issues more than a thousand separate books and pam - phlets every year .

		A single publication , the '' Year book '' of the
Department of Agrictdtiire	ORGANIZATION	, is published in an edition of half a million copies .

		The production and distribution of the millions of copies thus annually poured forth from the
Government Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	naturally present a number of practical problems of the highest importance , and there is much evidence that these problems are dealt with in anything but the scientific spirit .

		To establish certain general principles in connection with this phase of governmental enterprise , and to suggest the reforms most greatly needed in the interests of rationality and economy , are the aims of a recent Bulletin of the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	, pre - pared by the expert labors of jVIr .

		James
Inger	PERSON	- soU
Wyer	PERSON	.

		The first of the problems calling for consid - eration is that of cost of production .

		President
Roosevelt	PERSON	has recently had something to say upon this subject , and has put it in his emphatic and effective way , with the consequence of a slight decrease -LRB- about three per cent -RRB- , of last year 's printing bill from that of the year pre - ceding .

		This is far from the reduction of fifty per cent that the President believes to be possi - ble , but it is at least a step in the right direction .

		The sweeping reduction thus suggested -LRB- in the Message of
1904	DATE	-RRB- was to be brought about rather by a lessening of output than by a low - ering of labor-cost : expert private testimony , however , stands ready to declare that even the amoimt of printing now done would cost under private contract only from one-half to two-thirds of what is now paid for it .

		It will thus be seen that a combination of both these methods of economy might be made to reduce the appro - priation for printing purposes to about one-third of its present amount .

		Such a saving is well worth attempting , even in the face of the dis - heartening thought that the sum saved might very likely go to help building another battle - 284 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, ship , or to subsidize a few ship-owners , or to increase the monstrous extravagance of the pen - sion system , or to stuff the '' pork-barrel '' of appropriations for rivers and harbors and pub - lic buildings .

		The wastefulness of the methods employed by the
Government Printing Office	ORGANIZATION	becomes obvious upon the most superficial inquiry .

		It has for long been nothing short of a national scandal that the aid of labor-saving machmery should have been rejected at the arrogant behest of the labor-unions .

		This evil has been in part reme - died , but much yet remains to be accomplished .

		The needless multiplication of jobs is an evil inherent in every governmental enterprise , but the public has a right to be indignant at the bare-faced mamier in which , until recently , the printing business of the
United States	LOCATION	was con - ducted with an eye single to the amoimt of patronage that was to be got out of it .

		There are also many minor sources of wastefiUness .

		There is the imnecessary duplication of material , there is the printing of matter that serves only to magnify the importance of the bureau or individual that produces it , and there is the pub - lication of editions so large that they can not even be forced as gifts upon an unwilling public .

		The statistics for
1904	DATE	report the destruction as waste paper of no less than 126,112 volumes of public documents , which fact offers an eloquent revelation of haphazard management .

		The methods employed in the distribution of government docmnents appear to be as haphaz - ard as the methods of production .

		There are , to begin with , '' depository libraries , '' which receive fidl sets , and '' remainder libraries , '' which get the fractional remnants of editions not otherwise exhausted .

		The system of depository libraries produces some curious results .

		All state libraries are authorized depositories , and each member of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	may designate a library on his own account .

		For example , '' though there are ten depository libraries in
Minnesota	LOCATION	, the third city in the state ,
Diduth	LOCATION	, has none , and there is not one within one hundred and fifty nules either in
Minnesota	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, or
Michi	PERSON	- gan , while the library designated for the district in which
Duluth	LOCATION	is located is at a high school in a town of five or six thousand people . ''

		Again , Mr.
Wyer	PERSON	ventures to wonder , and we may wonder with him , '' Why the Woman 's
Harmony Club of Smith Centre	ORGANIZATION	,
Kansas	LOCATION	, the Public Li - brary of
Hopkinsville	LOCATION	,
Kentucky	LOCATION	-LRB- which does not appear on the Commissioner of Education 's latest list -RRB- , and the Ladies '
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	,
Greenville	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	, are on the depository list ; why there are four depository libraries in
Nash	PERSON	- ville and only one in
Memphis	LOCATION	; why there are two in
Tallahassee	LOCATION	with three thousand inhabi - tants and only two in
Cleveland	LOCATION	with four hun - dred thousand ; five in
New Orleans	LOCATION	and but two in either
San Francisco	LOCATION	or
Buffalo	LOCATION	. ''

		And the wonder is accentuated when we attempt to realize in imagination the actual receipt and housing by , say , the Woman 's
Harmony Club of Smith Centre	ORGANIZATION	,
Kansas	LOCATION	, of the more than five hundred volumes that are automatically lavished upon a depository library .

		The unsuspecting individual , no less than the unprepared library , is also the victim of this in - discriminate bounty .

		Every member of Con - gress has something like a couple of thousand volumes at his disposal annually , and feels bound to scatter them broadcast to gladden the hearts of his constituents . ''

		The over-zealous Con - gressman means well without doubt , but beware of him , specially if he be a new one with first enthusiasm and a desire to do favors to every man , woman , and prospective voter in his district .

		He is very likely to make your library the dump - ing ground for all the scraps , remamders , and job lots of documents , bound and imboxmd , which he can beg , coax , or wheedle from his brother Congressmen or the government officers .

		You first hear of his benefaction when the postmaster informs you of one or a dozen sacks of maU at the office for you . ''

		This is a case in which there ceases to be a virtue in the familiar counsel about gift horses .

		As a mere matter of self-defence , the mouth of this particular horse should be gently but firmly opened , and his teeth carefidly examined , before he is admitted into the stable .

		Even the library , which is popularly supposed to be an institution that welcomes books , may be seriously embarrassed by the supply of free liter - ature .

		A depository library must find a hundred feet of new shelving every year for this particidar accretion , which is no easy matter for a large institution , and a quite impossible matter for a small one .

		Then of course there is the further demand which these books make upon the admin - istrative expenses of the library . ''

		It is certainly true , '' says our writer , '' that the sudden sight of a government document fills the breast of the average librarian with sensations ranging from vague distrust and uncertainty to a distinct sink - ing of the heart and a feeling of real dread and helplessness .

		One librarian , very capable and sensible and not at all cowardly in most things , carefully sets aside on a particular shelf each government document as it reaches her library , letting them accumulate there till long after she

		THE DIAL 285 might have made some of them very useful , wait - ing , as she expresses it , ' till she gets up courage enough to tackle them . ' ''

		This is by no means humorous exaggeration ; it is a literal portrayal of the attitude of most librarians toward these portentous guests from the
Government Print	ORGANIZATION	-
ing Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a matter of fact -LRB- and of common sense -RRB- , only the largest libraries should attempt to accommodate these books in complete sets , or in anything but a narrowly limited selection .

		And the chief value of the Bulletin in which Mr. T \ `` yer has discussed the subject lies in the guidance it offers to the small library .

		It tells what publications are of sufficient usefulness to deserve a place in the lesser collections , and it also teUs how to classify and catalogue them .

		This information is of the greatest practical value , and the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	is to be thanked for having provided it in so con - venient a form .

		AYe may have to wait a long while for any general reform in the methods of production and distribution , but every library may do something on its own account to make the best of a bad matter and to adapt a faidty svstem to everyday needs .

		trayed when in later life he undertook to write on religion , need not here concern us ; what does interest us is the man 's ardent devotion to the amelioration of our lot through the enlightenment of intellectual blindness and the straightening out of crooked pro- cesses of thought .

		His heart was , after alL , better than his head , which is saying a good deaL '' A hook in breeches , '' he was often called ; and
Carlyle	PERSON	, after reading his autobiography , denominated the writer `` a thing of mechanized iron , '' and his book `` the autobiography of a steam engine , '' utterly lacking in human qualities .

		But Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	and others who knew him have testified to the warmth of his emotions and the nobility of his nature , while such records as we have of his life present numerous instances of generous self-sacrifice and of unusual kindness of heart .

		So ardent in fact was his tempera - ment , beneath his perfect self-discipline , that it has been said of him , as was said of his admired Tui ^ t. by
Condorcet	LOCATION	, that he was `` a volcano clothed in ice . ''

		The ice in Mill 's case was the result of a frigidly unemotional training received at the hands of a se - verely exacting father .

		Bishop ThirlwaU , in one of his letters , comes near the truth in calling Mill * ' a noble spirit who had the misfortune of being edu - cated by a narrow-minded pedant , who cultivated his intellectual faculties at the expense of all the rest , yet did not succeed in stifling them '' -LRB- t. e. , the non - inteUectual faculties -RRB- .

		In similar vein .

		Professor
George S. Morris	PERSON	writes : `` I conclude that
J. S. Mill	PERSON	's greatest personal misfortune was that he was bom the son of
James Mill	PERSON	, and not of
Johann Gott	PERSON	- lieb Fichte .

		He presents the appearance of a noble nature confined in intellectual fetters , which , forged for him , he himself did his best to rivet upon himself without wholly succeeding .

		He attracts a sympathy at once regretful and affectionate .

		Perhaps his spec - ulative failures , engraved already so conspicuously upon the tablets of the intellectual history of his race , may contribute more for the world 's final instruc - tion than the inconspicuous successes of many another less renowned . ''

		A more repressive influence than the elder Mill 's on anything like boyish spirits , or the outbreak of those nameless enthusiasms that belong to healthy adolesence , could not well be conceived .

		Life , to
James Mill	PERSON	, was at best a necessarj - evil , to be gone through with as much avoidance of pain as possible , and with little or no expectation of pleasure .

		Yet even he gave at least one proof of the impracticability of so drearv a doctrine .

		As a penniless literary adven - turer in
London	LOCATION	, he allowed himself to fall in love , to marrj ' , and to become the father of a family , eight children being born to him .

		This was a course of conduct than which , as his son points out , nothing could be more at variance with his later teachings ; and
James ^	PERSON	lill himself , as if repenting of this con - cession to the promptings of nature , sought to atone for it by a harshness toward wife and children that attracted the notice of visitors .

		It is significant that the son , in his autobiography , makes no mention , or next to none , of his mother .

		He would almost seem 286 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	to have had no mother , but to have sprung ,
Minerva	LOCATION	- like , in full intellectual panoply from his father 's brain .

		Of the training he received from his father , of its inhibitive no less than its educative influence , much might be said .

		That it habituated him to the doing of violence to his own deeper and warmer nature , many indications , pathetic to us now , go to prove .

		Perhaps most if not all of the inconsistencies and self - contradictions that we encounter in his philosophy are traceable to the glaring defects in that astonishing system of '' cram '' to which he was early subjected .

		Lisping Greek vocables at three , he had , by the time he was eight years old , gone through .

		^ sop 's Fables , the whole of Herodotus and of
Xenophon	LOCATION	's Cyro - paedia , the Anabasis wholly or in part , the
Memora	ORGANIZATION	- bilia of
Socrates	LOCATION	, some of the lives of the philosophers by
Diogenes Laertius	PERSON	, a part of
Lucian	PERSON	, two orations of Isocrates , and six dialogues of Plato .

		If the list makes us gasp , we are in danger of losing our breath entirely when we reflect that in those days Greek - English lexicons were not , and their Greek-Latin progenitors were shut to Mill because he had not yet learned Latin .

		His father , engaged at the same table in writing his monumental * ' History of British In - dia , '' served him as Greek dictionary , -- an exertion of patience on the part of this impatient and hard - worked man that must be placed to his credit .

		Fur - ther details of this remarkable experiment in education need not here be given .

		The Autobiography and Professor
Bain	PERSON	's life of Mill contain fuU informa - tion .

		The pupil 's loyalty to his teacher in after life , despite the warping and stunting effects of this in - human system of training , is one of the most pathetic and also one of the most admirable traits of Mill 's character .

		Of the insufficiency of his education to satisfy the cravings of his deeper self , he experienced an early proof ; although it was to no culpability on his father 's part that he ascribed the painful crisis through which he passed in
1826	DATE	.

		Taught to believe in the greatest-happiness principle of
Bentham	PERSON	and his disciple , the elder Mill , the young man suddenly realized that , were the greatest immediate happiness of the greatest number to be attained , he for one should still cherish unsatisfied longings .

		This dis - covery plunged him into a state of deep and long - continued dejection , from which he at last fought his way out by the help of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's poetry , and with the hard-earned conviction that the happiness prin - ciple , however irrefutable in theory , can not stand the test of practice , and that happiness itself , even though the end and aim of .

		our desires , is not to be attained by directly seeking it .

		But though he was forced to make this partial surrender , he continued to the last to maintain , with that doggedness of in - tellect that refused to deny theoretical principles in which he had been drilled , that '' happiness is the test of aU rules of conduct and the end of life . ''

		To be sure , it may be said in passing , a definition of '' happiness '' might conceivably be so framed as to render this theory acceptable to the austerest moralist , and perhaps it was with some such definition in mind that the theory came at last to be held by Mill .

		So much at least is true , that he , like the rest of us , must have held changing notions of what constitutes true happiness , as he advanced from the cradle to the grave .

		If it be true , as Professor
Jevons	PERSON	has ven - tured to assert in criticising Mill , that `` there is hardly one of his more important and peculiar doc - trines which he has not himself amply refuted , '' this is due , as has already been said , to the conflict be - tween the precepts impressed on his intellect by his father and the promptings of his own more ardent nature .

		Despite all failures in his life-long endeavor to arrive at truth .

		Mill may nevertheless be styled the apostle of clear thinking .

		The weak parts of his abstract speculation lose their importance in com - parison with the indomitable passion for justice with which he strove to disseminate the truth as embodied in practical reforms .

		Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	, writing of Mill 's resemblance to Turgot and of '' the nobleness and rarity of this type , '' says : '' Its force lies not in single elements , but in that combination of an ardent interest in human improvement with a reasoned attention to the law of its conditions , which alone deserves to be honoured with the high name of wis - dom .

		This completeness was one of the secrets of Mr.
Mill	PERSON	's peculiar attraction for young men , and for the comparatively few women whose intellectual interest was strong enough to draw them to his books .

		He satisfied the ingenuous moral ardour which is instinctive in the best natures , untU the dust of daily life dulls or extinguishes it , and at the same time he satisfied the rationalistic qualities , which are not less marked in the youthful temperament of those who by-and-by do the work of the world .

		This mixture of intellectual gravity with a passionate love of im - provement in all the aims and instruments of life , made many intelligences alive , who would otherwise have slumbered , or sunk either into a dry pedantry on the one hand , or a windy , mischievous philan - thropy on the other ... He recognized the social destination of knowledge , and kept the elevation of the great art of social existence ever before him , as the ultimate end of all speculative activity . ''

		It was as a clear thinker and cogent reasoner , not by any imposing and majestic authority , that he won over his followers and still commands the admiration of his readers .

		The impersonal but irresistible per - suasion of truth itself appeals to us in his pages .

		No drum-and-trumpet proclamations , but rather self - effacement and a modest reverence for the sacred purity of truth , are what we find in his life and works .

		So little did he seek the fame of a discoverer of truth , if only the truth might finally be reached , that he took more pains to disguise and obscure his origi - nality than most writers do to give prominence to theirs .

		He accords so much credit to his predecessors , even where he differs from them , that , as Professor
Cairnes	PERSON	has remarked in discussing his '' Political Economy , '' he seems to leave little credit to himself .

		It is this attitude of detachment , of freedom from prejudice , of willingness and even eagerness to be refuted if he is in the wrong , that makes Mill so

		287 attractiYe to the lover of fair play . ''

		I found hardly any one , '' he tells us in writing of himself , '' who made such a point of examining what was said in defence of all opinions , however new or however old , in the conviction that even if they were errors there might be a substratum of truth underneath them , and that in any case the discovery of what it was that made them plausible , would be a benefit to truth . ''

		Mill was happily situated for the prosecution of his favorite studies .

		Holding an increasingly remu - nerative position in the
India House	LOCATION	, where his duties were not very burdensome , and from which he retired on a handsome pension at fiftj -- two , he could devote his hours of leisure to the writing of books whose pecuniary ' success or failure was a minor considera - tion .

		As he himself has well said , • ' the writings by which one can live are not the writings which them - selves live , and are never those in which the writer does his best . '' '

		It was characteristic of him , too , that he early shook off those irksome bonds to whose constraint the frequenters of fashionable society think themselves obliged to submit . ''

		I was enabled , '' he says , writing of himself at the age of thirty-seven , ' * to indulge the inclination , natural to thinking persons when the age of boyish vanity is once past , for limiting my own society to a very few persons .

		Greneral society , as now carried on in
England	LOCATION	, is so insipid an affair even to the persons who make it what it is , that it is kept up for any reason rather than the pleasure it affords . ''

		Of the impression he himself made on others in society , we have abundant testimony , mostly favorable .

		Carlyle 's description of his conversation as ' • sawdustish '' we must hold to be rather ill-natured than apt .

		But would any talker in
Carlyle	LOCATION	's company receive his unqualified praise ? '

		• His -LSB- Mill 's -RSB- demeanor with reference to the other participants in the conversation , '' says Pro- fessor
Bain	ORGANIZATION	, his biographer and intimate friend , `` was sufficiently marked .

		He never lectured or declaimed , or engrossed the talk .

		He paused at due intervals , to hear what the others had to say ; and not merely heard , but took in , and embodied that in his reply .

		With him , talk was , what it ought to be , an exchange of information , thought and argument ; and an exchange of sympathies when the feelings were concerned .

		He did not care to converse on any other terms than perfect mutualitj ' .

		He would expound or narrate at length when it was specially wished ; and there were , of course , subjects that it was agreeable to him to dilate upon : but he wished to be in accord with his hearers , and to feel that they also had due openings for expressing concur - rence or otherwise . ''

		Characteristic of this desire to let the light in from all sides , in the interest of clear thinking and right reasoning , was his attitude as a parliamentary candi - date .

		Excepting the one subject of religion , which could well be excluded as irrelevant , he invited ques - tions and objections of whatever sort when he ap - peared on the platform to address the voters of West - minster .

		The wit and readiness there displayed by him , to the surprise and delight of his acquaintance , must have contributed no little to his election , to which he had conscientiously refused to contribute anything in money .

		One reply of his , a reply of two words only , to an opponent 's question , is so character - istic of his ethical and intellectual honesty , that it de - serves mention here .

		Asked by a hostile hearer , who hoped to overwhelm him with confusion , whether he had in any of his writings called the English working classes liars .

		Mill promptly and calmly answered , '' I did . ''

		After a pause to recover from their aston - ishment , his hearers broke into enthusiastic applause , and acknowledged , in the words of a spokesman , that they wished , not to be flattered , but to be told of their faults .

		Minor biographical details of this kind , even in so short an article as the present , need no apology if we bear in mind that a thinker 's life is the master - key to the interpretation of his thought .

		Through the allurements of biography some readers , previously shrinking from the task , may perchance be won over to the serious study of the grand problems of phi - losophy , to a sense of their perennial digfnity and beauty , and to a conviction of their present vital import .

		The lives of few philosophers are so worthy of contemplation , so free from disquieting and dis - enchanting features , so stimulative to high thought and noble endeavor , as the life of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	.

		IMPROVISED MEANS OF NAVAL WARFARK -LRB- To the Editor of Th `` Dial . -RRB-

		The commtuiication from Captain
A. T. Mahan	PERSON	, in your issue of
April 16	DATE	, relative to my former article on the fighting value of privateers in the war of
1812	DATE	, is interesting and valuable .

		I seem , however , to have worded my article in a way that has caused me to be misunderstood .

		Will you therefore give me a little further space in which to explain my meaning , and also to add a few words in support of one contention that I made ?

		I should care less about the matter had the articles appeared in a publication of less weight and importance than
The Diai	LOCATION	.

		; as it is , I feel that I ought in justice to myself to add something further .

		The passage showing that I was not fully understood is that with which Captain
Mahan	PERSON	closes his communi - cation .

		He admits -LRB- earher -RRB- that we all have liberty to express our opinions , and thinks that , though he regards my contention as wrong , the chief harm is in what it preaches as to the future .

		He believes that it reflects a dangerous tendency of the times with regard to our naval policy .

		I wish to say , then , that I did not for a moment mean to advocate a policy of '' trusting to im - provised means '' as to our naval defenses .

		On the con - trary , I beheve that the changed conditions of naval warfare call for the most careful and elaborate prepara - tions in the matter of fighting ships .

		Our long
Atlantic	LOCATION	seaboard needs a strong naval defense , just as a tall boxer needs his two strong arms to protect both his face and his body .

		I trust that I have made myself clear on that point , and that I have not urged our success -LRB- whatever that 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, success was -RRB- in
1812	DATE	as a justification for trusting in * ' improvised means '' of defense now .

		Captain
Mahan	PERSON	further says that he is not correctly quoted as admitting that our privateers in
1812	DATE	were largely instrumental in bringing about the conclusion of that war .

		If I have been dull in understanding Cap - tain
Mahan	PERSON	's meaning , I am sorry for it ; but I must remark that I did not quote his book as wholly sustain - ing my contention .

		I said that his book admitted it '' in part . ''

		I supposed that it did , and quoted from it a passage regarding the injury done to British commerce by our cruisers , including privateers , in the course of the war .

		I now imderstand Captain
Mahan	PERSON	to mean that , while the harm was great , it was not much greater than
England	LOCATION	had previously sustained from
France	LOCATION	, and so was of moderate importance .

		The book can be read , and the meaning judged .

		I certainly meant to be fair .

		As to the matter in the first instance at issue , it would appear almost presumptuous for one not an acknowl - edged authority to contend with one of Captain
Mahan	PERSON	's standing ; yet it is also true that great authorities differ , and it is better to think for oneself at times , and be wrong , than not to think at all .

		I will try to be brief in covering this point .

		Captain
Mahan	PERSON	says , speaking of the war , '' We had fought and lost . ''

		This is seemingly because
Great Britain	LOCATION	refused to change her position on either of the issues for which we went to war , -- a purely technical conclusion , as it seems to me .

		As a matter of fact , we had won the greater mmiber of our sea-battles , while
Great Britain	LOCATION	had not done anything of moment to us on land ; and the fact that after this she nearly or wholly discontinued her odious impressment practices , shows how she regarded our attitude in that matter .

		If we had not fought her , it is likely that she woidd have con - tinued to impress American seamen ; as a result of the war , she stopped .

		We certainly had reason , if we may trust some information that has come down to us , to believe that she meant to stop the practices complained of , but regarded it as humiliating to say so formally .

		As to the amoimt of harm done by our privateers , which was the original question at issue .

		Captain
Mahan	PERSON	now says that the
British Minister for Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, who was abroad at the time , and who conducted the business of his office for the time by letter , does not even mention it ; furthermore , that the loss was not much greater than in the war with
France	LOCATION	.

		It is easy to be wrong , but it seems to me that the omission by the Minister to comment on this matter is not a proof that it was not felt to be serious .

		It might have been seri - oiis , and yet not have seemed sufficiently so to compel immediate attention .

		It must be remembered that the loss inflicted on English commerce by our privateers was mainly falling on the people , and not on the gov - ernment direct ; and that the British government of that day , though in a way responsible to the people , by no means always bent its immediate views to agree with the popular desire .

		Moreover , it is not alone the amoimt of damage that is done in the course of a war that is most effective .

		As one writer puts it , '' The object of all wars is to operate on the mind of the enemy to the extent of bringing him to the desired terms . ''

		What effect did our privateers have on the public mind of
England	LOCATION	, in addition to the harm they actually accomplished ?

		It is of course impos - sible to answer this question ; we can only guess .

		But we know that our privateers were far more daring in their exploits than were the French , and that the fear of them helped to raise the price of many staples of living to a serious pitch -- flour to S58 .

		per barrel , beef to
$ 38.	MONEY	, etc. .

		We must bear in mind that the contests of our regular navy with
England	LOCATION	's did not result in the capture of very many ships , though relatively we made an excellent showing ; and yet our victories made a powerful impression in
England	LOCATION	.

		The victories of our privateers were generally of a kind to touch the pockets of the English rather than their pride , and so were not of a kind to call for so much public comment ; never - theless they told in a very practical direction .

		Let me quote a little on this point .

		Speaking of the loss of the first English frigate , the
London	LOCATION	'' Times '' said : '' We know not any calamity of twenty times its amoimt that might have been attended with more serious consequences to the worsted party , had it not been counterbalanced by a con - temporaneous advantage of a much greater magnitude '' -LSB- refer - ring to
Wellington	LOCATION	's victories in
Spain	LOCATION	-RSB- .

		Yet
England	LOCATION	had lost one thirty-eight gun frigate out of a navy consisting of hundreds of ships .

		Governments where the people , if pressed too hard , will rise and overturn the existing authority , caimot in war go the limit of the people 's resources .

		An attempt to do very much less has often brought rulers and ministers disas - trously to the ground .

		Again , `` The Times , '' in speaking of the victory of the `` United States '' over the `` Macedonian , '' says : `` Oh , what a charm is here dissolved !

		What hopes will be excited in the breasts of our enemies ! ''

		etc. .

		Again a mere frigate action , and the loss of a thirty - eight , with its captain and a few men killed .

		Mr.
Spears	PERSON	, in his '' History of our
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, '' says : '' The selfish interest of an individual in his property is , as has often been noted , a pledge of good citizenship .

		His selfish inter - est in his property , bluntly speaking , tends to making him behave himself becomingly ... The same rule applies to nations .

		The possession of property liable to be lost through war is a pledge of peace on the part of the nation owning it . ''

		That this '' selfish interest '' would or did endure quietly the rise of prices in
England	LOCATION	caused largely by our pri - vateers , and the other troubles consequent on this har - rowing kind of warfare , is certainly hard to believe .

		It does not agree with what the ship-owners as well as the consumers said at the time .

		Finally -LRB- since I have already used too much space -RRB- , I will finish my quotations by a brief one from '' The American Merchant Marine , '' page 128 : '' The master of a British merchantman who had been three times captured and as many _ times recaptured , said that he had sighted no fewer than ten American privateers in a single voyage .

		... But the most dramatic and effective work of the privateers was right on the British coast , and in the chops of the English Channel .

		This produced in
Britain	LOCATION	a comical blending of fury and despondency , which found voice in the memorials of the merchants of
Liverpool	LOCATION	and other seaport towns .

		A typical remonstrance is that of the merchants of
Glasgow	LOCATION	. ''

		This remonstrance is given in full , but is too long to insert here .

		It recites that insurance was affected , a heavy tax liad to be paid for convoys , etc. .

		It is worth reading entire , as mdeed is the rest of the book , if one wishes to see just what our practical '' irregulars '' did at that time .

		With all this and much more before me , I must still believe that our privateers were a mighty factor , if not the mightiest , in causing
Great Britain	LOCATION	, relieved of Xapoleon , and before she had heard of her defeat at
New Orleans	LOCATION	, to consent to make peace .

		That we did not win as to the form of this , is true ; but I am unable to see why we did not win the substance .

1873	DATE	the will of a Bal - timore merchant provided for the founding of a new imiversit -RCB- - , and a propitious mood of fortxme which had favored the selection of a sagacious body of trustees extended its favor to their ap - pointment of a capable president .


Daniel Coit Oilman	PERSON	, bom at
Norwich	LOCATION	in
Connecticut	LOCATION	, became a graduate of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	in
1852	DATE	, and continued his studies both there and at
Harvard	LOCATION	as well as in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The following years saw him connected with the
Sheffield Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	and holding a chair at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, imtil , in
1872	DATE	, he was called to the presidency of
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	, where `` he helped to rescue a
State University	ORGANIZATION	from the limitations of a college of agriculture and enlarge it to meet the requirements of a magnificent commonwealth . ''

		With this valuar ble training the first president of
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	brought an invaluable spirit , -- a combination which made him not only a master craftsman before the final laimching of the imiversity , but a reliable and confidence-inspiring pilot for the first twenty-five years of the subsequent voyage .

		That the waters shoidd always be smooth , and that favoring breezes shoidd always sweU the sails , no pilot coidd ensure .

		Of the stormy waters , however , only incidental mention is made in the present volume .

		The new president suggested the emphasizing of the idea of a '' university '' and the desira - bility of building up an institution quite different from a ' • coUege '' ; he wished '' to make an ad - dition to American education , not introduce a rival . ''

		The times were ripe .

		Opportunities for graduate study were then few ; the relation of the professional schools to the college of liberal arts was but ill adjusted ; research was largely a matter of indi \ ` idual initiative and pursuit ; facilities for the publication of original articles were inadequate ; withal , there was a goodly body of young men ready to profit by a better order of things .

		order .

		President Oilman devoted his exceptional ability - and energy .

		Sparing himself at not a single turn , he exhibited a laudable self-reliance ; but he exhibited also that strength of the strong which can profit by the strength of others .

		As a people , we owe much to
James B. Angell	PERSON	,
Charles W. Eliot	PERSON	, and
Andrew D. WTiite	PERSON	; but for no other service should we be more grateful than for their timely encouragement and practi - cal helpfidness in the formative period of the new university .

		Their willing kindness is grate - fully recognized in the dedication of the volume before us , and it will not be forgotten by future generations .

		The far-seeing head of the institution destined to be so important staked everything upon his facidty .

		Again and again he insists on the supreme importance of the teaching staff in a university , a fact not undeserving of notice in these days when the university president looms so large before the public eye and the ordinary professor is lost in the crowd . ''

		But the idea , '' he says , '' is not lost sight of , that the power of the university will depend upon the character of its resident staff of permanent professors .

		It is their researches in the library and laboratory ; their utterances in the classroom and in private life : their examples as students and investiga - tors , and as champions of the truth ; their pub - lications , through the journals and the scientific treatises , which will make the
University of Baltimore	ORGANIZATION	an attraction to the best students , and serviceable to the intellectual growth of the land . ''

		But if President Oilman staked every - thing upon his facidty , he took good care that his stake should not be lost .

		The first professors were Sylvester ,
Oildersleeve	LOCATION	,
Remsen	LOCATION	,
Rowland	PERSON	,
Morris	PERSON	, and ^ lartin ; a few years later ,
Welch	PERSON	,
Halsted	LOCATION	,
Kelly	PERSON	, and
Osier	PERSON	formed the nucleus of the medical facult -RCB- * .

		These ten names in themselves would constitute a eulogy on the wis - dom of the trustees , which was doubtless in this connection the wisdom of the President .

		All of the hopes implied in the above quotation were realized , and more ; for these giants may be said to have fashioned the mould for the future of the American university .

		To a cause , however , as to an individual , blessing comes but seldom imattended by bane ; and the new order of things was not productive solely of good .

		When the far-reaching benefits of
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	and the other great universities Ijecame obvious , donations on a magnificent scale began to grow common , until , as our author points out , more than one institution to-day has an endowment larger than that of all the insti - 290 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, tutions which were in existence in
1850	DATE	.

		But if a strong university is a great good , a nominal university is a great evil ; and we find the dan - ger noted that '' the country will soon have a superfluity of feeble universities , as it has had a superfluity of endowed colleges . ''

		When a searcher for real conditions in our higher educa - tion begins to peer behind the
august	DATE	mask of the word '' university , '' he finds everything from the highest type of an institution of learning to the lowest representative of the propagation of vanity , -- everything , in fact , from
Harvard	LOCATION	to an institution of which it can only be said that the dead are there .

		When a denominational university with a small facidty confers more advanced degrees than
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, words lose their meaning .

		Flagrant cases , however , will ulti - mately defeat their own ends , by cheapening the donor 's degrees in competition with the degrees of standard institutions ; and on the whole we are doing better .

		Another danger , -- that graduate work , with its insistence on research and printed results , would lead to sterile investigation and unprofitable publication , -- is upon us .

		Too often we investigate the fluctuations in the price of woolen socks in
New England	LOCATION	during two colo - nial decades , when we might more profitably be acquiring a decent historical horizon and eco - nomic perspective ; nor should we be eager to put forth a thesis on the hiccough of Aristophanes in Plato 's '' Symposium '' before we have read the '' Republic . ''

		With regard to printing , we are the victims of a veritable cacoethes ; we have too many '' Studies , '' '' Investigations , '' and similar publications of such strange double power that in them a worthy article may be entombed or an unworthy article be given a temporary sem - blance of life .

		To change our author 's words a little , there should be less printing and more editing .

		Furthermore , the young instructor , fresh from the seminar , is sadly inclined to be a pedant rather than a pedagogue ; the minute in - vestigator too often fails to become the inspiring teacher , and '' it does not appear that the under - graduates receive better instruction than they received in the earlier days . ''

		Howbeit , all of these features are incidental , and can be changed .

		As to any responsibility therefor on the part of
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	, we may quote a characteristic statement made by Professor GUdersleeve years ago to the present writer . ''

		Young man , '' he said , '' whatever benefits have accrued to Amer - ican education from graduate work may be traced to
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	; the evils all came from ... '' `` The Laimching of a University , '' consist - ing of a '' Sheaf of Remembrances , '' is divided into two parts , the first -LRB- chapters I. - IX . -RRB-

		being concerned more immediately with the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, the second -LRB- chapters X. - XXII . -RRB-

		embodying various addresses .

		The previous publication of certain portions is men - tioned in the preface .

		The thoroughly inter - esting first part , with chapters X. and XIV. , would have made a valuable volume . ''

		Fun - damental Principles , '' '' The Original Faculty , '' '' Some Noteworthy Teachers , '' '' Resignation , '' '' Remembrances , '' and '' Research '' are the captions of chapters that prove to be as fruitful as the headings suggest .

		Indeed , there is no disappointment save in the sixth chapter , which includes an accoimt of the establishment of the Carnegie Institution ; but here the disappoint - ment is keen .

		It wiU be remembered that the original purpose of Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	was '' to make the gift directly to the nation , and for that reason he communicated an outline of his plan to the President of the
United States	LOCATION	, by whom it was received with the most generous appre - ciation .

		Reflection led to a change . ''

		It was about this reflection and change that we had hoped for enlightenment .

		Whatever title might have been given to an institution founded on the unchanged plans , it could have been made to mean a
National University	ORGANIZATION	endowed with
$ 10,000,000	MONEY	as a mere beginning , admitting of correlation with existing governmental scientific departments and with other educational institu - tions of the country , incorporating the most advanced ideas and the highest ideals , and pro- viding thoroughly adequate means for investi - gation and leadership .

		Such an institution appeared to many educators as a wellspring of almost unlimited possibilities .

		When '' reflec - tion led to a change , '' it was widely charged that a few eminent university leaders , fearing pos - sible competition for their own graduate schools , had fostered this reflection unduly ; it was , and is , generally believed that , at any rate , they could have ensured the success of the original conception of the '' evangelist of beneficence '' if they had deemed it best for our national edu - cational interests .

		From President Oilman we expected the enlightening word ; but darkness is still upon our eyes , and we must still believe where we can not prove .

		That these eminent and honorable men must have been influenced by altruistic and compelling motives , we are all anxious to believe ; but it would have been pleasant to change faith for knowledge .

		THE DIAL 291 The second part of Dr.
Gilman	PERSON	's book inevi - tably suffers in comparison with the significant chapters of the first part .

		The topics include '' Books and Politics , '' '' De Juventute , '' '' Greek Art in a Manufacturing Town , '' '' Hand-Craft and Rede-Craft , '' '' Civil Service Reform , '' and so forth .

		In the treatment , of course , there are always manifested sanity , lucidity , breadth of view , and generosity of sentiment ; but one or two of the addresses must strike a careful reader as approaching dangerously near to hack-work .

		One feels that the first part could have been wTitten by but few men , whereas the second could have been written by many , and might better have appeared as a separate volimie with a frankly descriptive title .

		A respectful reviewer may be allowed to submit that there are too many cases of the publication of miscellaneous essays and addresses imder attractive titles suggestive of imity of theme .

		Publishers admit that they are only human , -- and on the whole it is per - haps desirable that university presidents should share that amiable weakness ; but the title on the cover ought to convey the same idea as the words on the title-page .

		It is needless to say that in the present instance the title-page is above reproach .

		Were the task not so uncongenial , it wovdd be possible to point out a few slips of the pen or lapses from careful jiresentation .

		A volume containing an address on Greek Art should hardly be guilty of the following : '' The touch of Phidias was his own , and so inimitable that not long ago an American , scanning with his practised eye the galleries of the
Louvre	LOCATION	, dis - covered a fragment of the work of Phidias long separated from the other fragments by that sculptor which Lord
Elgin	ORGANIZATION	had sent to
London	LOCATION	.

		The artist 's stroke could not be mistaken , -- it was his own , as truly as our sign-manuals , our autographs . ''

		Our author can refer only to the discovery by Waldstein of the Lapith head in the
Louvre	LOCATION	and its relation to one of the
Parthe	PERSON	- non metopes , and he certainly leaves the impres - sion that Phidias actually carved the metopes with his own hand .

		Of course the metopes are the work of the great Athenian in a perfectly true sense ; but that they show the actual strokes of his chisel , few would venture to maintain .

		A slip of a different sort attached the heading '' Incidents of the Early Years '' to a chapter of which a fourth is devoted to the
Carnegie Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tution founded so recently .

		Minor lapses and an occasional awkward sentence in a volume of three hundred and eighty-six pages are pardon - able even if undesirable .

		Our closing impression , however , should not be given by words suggestive of fault-finding .

		President
Gilman	PERSON	's book has been welcome reading , and will doubtless be warmly received by all interested in higher education and in the history of our great institutions of learning .

		To few gleaners in this field is it allowed to present such a '' sheaf of remembrances . ''

		Two Views of a Great Exgl.ish Ktng .

		* It may seem to many that there is no great need for a new biography of
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		Few names in English history are more generally familiar than that of the second
Tudor	PERSON	, and the leading facts of his long reign are known to all who have read the story of
Britain	LOCATION	.

		It is true , the world knows what happened in
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's reign , but just why and how it happened is still a mat - ter of dispute .

		Especially when we approach the subject of the
King	ORGANIZATION	's character and motives , of his plans and policies , of his personal achieve - ments and those due to his ministers , we meet the most diverse opinions .

		Where one writer condemns , another condones or justifies ; one offers an apology where another merely ventures to explain ; what one attributes to royal foresight another ascribes to the shrewdness of a councillor .

		This disagreement is due in part to the fact that the sources necessary to an exhaustive study of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's reign were not accessible to earlier writers .

		Recently , however , there have been col - lected from various parts of
Europe	LOCATION	-- from
Spain	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Venice	LOCATION	,
Ireland	LOCATION	, and
Great Bri	PERSON	- tain , -- thousands of documents dating from Tu - dor times , the study of which will add materially to our knowledge of the sixteenth century .

		These newer sources , we are told by
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's most recent biographer , `` probably contain at least a million definite facts relating to the reign of Henry VTII . ''

		To write the story of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's life and achievements is evidently no easy task .

		For - timately , however , the work of sifting and inter - preting these materials has been undertaken by one whose great knowledge of the Tudor period renders him pecidiarly fitted for such an effort .

		It was with pleasure that students noted three years ago that Prof ,
A. F. Pollard	PERSON	, of
University College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, had written a biography of Henry VEIL Unfortimately , the edition then published was of the more expensive order , and

		292 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, the work was consequently placed beyond the reach of the average book-buyer .

		Since then it has been revised and republished , and now appears as a plain , solid , but attractive volume , which the lover of history will be glad to possess .

		The story begins with a brief sketch of the early Tudors , in which the author emphasizes the fact that
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's great strength lay in the pop - ular belief and fear that he alone stood between English prosperity and a return of the anarchy that
England	LOCATION	had experienced during the Wars of the Roses .

		In the next chapter we get a view of '' Prince
Henry	PERSON	and his environment , '' and an effort is made to account for his wonderful pop - ularity then and later .

		The average Englishman could not help admiring a prince who was the best athlete in the kingdom ; and , continues the author , if `` there ascended the throne to-day a young prince , the hero of the athletic world , the finest oar , the best bat , the crack marksman of his day ... endowed with the iron will , the instinctive insight into the hearts of his people , the profound aptitude for government that
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		displayed , he would be a rash man who would guarantee even now the integrity of parliamentary power or the continuance of cab - inet rule . ''

		From this passage , and others like it that might be quoted , it appears that Professor
Pollard	PERSON	does not value the political sense of his countrymen very highly .

		But here we must be allowed to retain our doubts .

		In the third chapter we learn how Henry was taught statecraft . ''

		The young
King	PERSON	entered the arena of
Europe	LOCATION	, a child of generous impulse in a throng of hoary intriguers -- Ferdinand ,
Max	PERSON	- imilian ,
Louis XII.	PERSON	,
Julius II.	PERSON	, each of whom was nearly three times his age . ''

		The scheming and plotting of these royal highwaymen is told in striking terms . ''

		But the meekest and saintli - est monarch could scarce pass unscathed through the baptism of fraud practised on
Henry	ORGANIZATION	, and
Henry	PERSON	was at no time saintly or meek . ''

		He learned that he too coidd employ the methods of diplomacy , so-called , and when the '' hoary in - triguers '' passed off the stage in
the second decade of the sixteenth century	DATE	, the centre of diplomatic intrigue shifted to the English court .

		The subject of foreign affairs continues through the following three chapters , with the interest centering about the person of
Cardinal Wolsey	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Cardinal was , says Professor Pol - lard , `` the greatest , as he was the last , of the ecclesiastical statesmen who have governed En - gland .

		As a diplomat pure and simple , he has never been surpassed ; and as an administrator he has had few equals . ''

		But the author does not believe that
Wolsey	PERSON	's management of affairs was ever so complete as has been thought .

		The King , though much taken up with theology , with his navy , with tournaments , and with a thousand other matters that appealed to the royal vanity , watched details very closely and became in - creasingly vigilant after
1519	DATE	.

		Nor does he con - sider the passing of
Wolsey	LOCATION	as something to be regretted either by
Henry	ORGANIZATION	or by the nation .

		Henry 's government achieved nothing while the Cardinal was at the helm .

		It is true , he '' staved off for many years the ruin of the church , but he only did it Ijy plunging
England	LOCATION	into the mael - strom of foreign intrigue and of futile wars . ''

		The discord that appeared in the royal famdy about
1527	DATE	is treated more from the political than from the domestic side .

		This subject , and the later matrimonial ventures of the
King	PERSON	, the author can not avoid discussing ; but he gives them no more space than their importance seems to demand .

		Henry had not been married long before serious misunderstandings arose in the royal household .

		Catherine was not only queen of
England	LOCATION	, she was also the accredited Spanish ambassador at the English court .

		As such , she strove earnestly , if not always tactfully , to hold
Spain	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	in close alliance ; but
Henry	ORGANIZATION	soon found that to follow the erratic Ferdinand about as an ally was not only difficult but dan - gerous , and the queen 's position soon became a trying one .

		To this was added personal bereave - ment in the death of nearly all her cliildren .

		Professor
Pollard	PERSON	believes that '' there is no rea - son to doubt
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's assertion that he had come to regard the death of his cliildren as a Divine judgment , and that he was impelled to question his marriage by the dictates of conscience '' ; but he adds that conscience '' often moves men in directions indicated by other than conscientious motives ; and of the other motives which influ - enced
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's mind , some were respectable and some the reverse . ''

		Perhaps the strongest part of Professor Pol - lard 's work is his account of the origin and progTess of the movement that separated Eng - land from
Rome	LOCATION	.

		With the origin of this move - ment the
King	ORGANIZATION	's domestic difficidties had nothing to do .

		The author shows that the governing elements in
England	LOCATION	were at that time strongly anti-ecclesiastical .

		Any action taken in oppo - sition to Papacy was sure to be popidar ; and no one understood this better than
Henry	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author also holds that while the King earlier in his reign respected Papacy more than any other monarch in
Europe	LOCATION	, he had always considered himself supreme ruler of the English church .


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 293 * ' Even in the height of his fervor against heresy , Henry was in no mood to abate one jot or tittle of his royal authority in ecclesiastical matters . ''

		The question of ecclesiastical supremacy be - came a practical one in
1529	DATE	, when the Pope allied himself to
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's enemy Charles and transferred the hearing of the suit between
Henry	ORGANIZATION	and
Catherine	PERSON	to the Papal court .

		Henry inmiediately summoned
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and the pro- cess of actual separation from Kome began .

		So obedient did this body seem to be , that it is often spoken of as a
ser %	PERCENT	ale
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		But Professor
Pollard	PERSON	denies that it ever showed any signs of servility ; frequently , he says , it displayed the very opposite temper .

		Some historians believe that the
King	PERSON	must have packed the Pai ` liament ; but the author holds tliat this belief is not sup - ported by any evidence whatever . ''

		The general harmony between
King and Parliament	ORGANIZATION	was based on a fimdamental similarity of interests ; the harmony in detail was worked out , not by the forcefid exertion of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's will , but by
Ins	ORGANIZATION	caref id and skilful manipulation of both Houses , '' especially of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		No one can read the story of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's career , as Professor
Pollard	PERSON	tells it , without feeling that he must have been a remarkable man .

		But that he was `` the most remarkable man that ever sat on the English throne ' few are prepared to be - lieve .

		On the whole , it seems that the author 's view of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's character as man and monarch is entirely too favorable .

		The unlovely side of the
King	PERSON	's life is by no means ignored . ''

		His besetting sin was egotism , a sin which princes can hardly and Tudors coidd nowise avoid '' ; and this egotism promoted the development of many other traits of the mean , mmianly sort .

		But this side of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's character is not given the usual prominence .

		The emphasis is placed on those qualities that made him a great king , shrewd - ness and energy , foresight and power . '

		• He had the strength of a lion , and like a lion he used it . '

		* When the reader passes from Professor PoUard 's biography to Major
Hume	PERSON	's history of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's marriages , he soon finds himself on a decidedly lower plane .

		The English is more colloquial and less dignified ; but as the subject itself frequently lacks in dignity , this can be forgiven .

		Major
Hiune	PERSON	also has had access to great bodies of new sources , but in the inter - pretation of these he sometimes differs i-adically from the author just considered .

		Instead of the imposing monarch that Professor
Pollard	PERSON	paints , he sketches a mean , cowardly , selfish wretch , whose abilities were extremely small , and whose vanity and wickedness alone were great .

		The author 's purpose is to show how the powerful men who stood about the
King	PERSON	made use of his weaknesses to further political and religious ends , and particularly '' how each of his wives in turn was but an instrument of politicians , intended to sway the King on one side or the other . ''

		Thus
Catherine	PERSON	stood for close relations with
Rome	LOCATION	and the Empire ;
Anne Boleyn	PERSON	for a French alliance and Lutherz ^ n reform .

		After
Anne	PERSON	's death , the two factions alternately dictated matrimonial terms to the
King	LOCATION	, imtil with
Catherine Parr	PERSON	'' the Protestants won the last trick . ''

		Major
Himie	PERSON	admits that reform was in the air in the
early sixteenth century	DATE	, but he does not seem to think that
England	LOCATION	was seriously disaffected .

		`` The real author of the great schism of
England	LOCATION	was not
Anne or Cranmer	PERSON	, but Luther 's enemy
Charles V.	PERSON	, the champion of Catholicism . ''

		Had he not so persistently urged the Pope to refuse the annulment of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's marriage -LRB- not through love or sym - pathy for his aunt , but to prevent an alliance between
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	-RRB- , no one in En - land would have defied
Rome	LOCATION	and no schism would have appeared .

		The view that the author gives us of society during the reign of
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		is a dismal one .

		In his characterizations of the leading pei `` Sons of the period , he displays no appreciation or sym - pathy ; apparently he finds no one with whom he can sjnnpathize unless it be the Emperor Charles .

		Catherine of
Aragon	LOCATION	, of whom the world would fain think with respect at least , is said to have been '' no better than those about her in moral principle , '' not a saint or a meek martyr , but one who was '' fully a match in duplicity for those against whom she was pitted . ''

		From one who speaks in this way of that strong and resolute queen , kindly treatment of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's other con - sorts , not to mention
Cranmer	PERSON	and
Cromwell	PERSON	, is not to be expected .

		There is much in both of these volumes that helps us to understand more fully this difficult age , but the great riddles of the Tudor period still remain unanswered .

		The rather attractive gentieman whom we learn to know in Professor
Pollard	PERSON	's biography the world will probably not accept as the true
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		The question of the source of
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's strength is not answered by saying , as Major Hmne virtually does , that he hatl no strength .

		On several minor points , also , the reviewer would like to question the interpretations proposed ; but he remembers that there are a million facts that he has not exam - ined , and considers it more discreet to refrain .

		294 THE DIAJ ^ -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, Slavery and its Aftermath .

		* That the Negro American has been the central fact of American history is illustrated by Mr.
George S. Merriam	PERSON	's volume on '' The Negro and the Nation '' ; and that he still occu - pies a considerable part of the stage is empha - sized by Mr.
William A. Sinclair	PERSON	's perfervid rhetoric in his book called `` The Aftermath of Slavery . ''

		The first is an octavo volume of 436 pages which aims to show , in short chapters and in popular style , the connection of slavery with
United States	ORGANIZATION	history .

		The result is a history of the
United States	LOCATION	with the Negro as the cen - tral fact .

		The narrative is perhaps naturally a bit disjointed and sketchy , and the almost inevit - able mistakes of the popidar writer have crept in -- for instance , when the slave trade is said to have been made piracy in
1808	DATE	instead of
1820	DATE	-LRB- p. 22 -RRB- , when
Calhoun	PERSON	is made secretary of war in
1844	DATE	instead of secretary of state -LRB- p. 75 -RRB- , and
Benjamin Harrison	PERSON	president at the tender age of seven -LRB- p. 71 -RRB- .

		Probably many such small errors and slips could be found , which , while they mar , do not by any means seriously detract from the real value of the work .

		This real value lies in the new point of view from which the Negro is studied .

		The literature of American slavery is large , and the literature of the '' Negro problem '' growing ; and yet we seldom get a sane , sober narrative which treats both these things as parts of one continuous whole , and that whole as one ordinary chapter of human history clustering about the rise of a na ^ tion in a nation .

		The every-day point of view , therefore , the lack of partisanship or intense fervor , makes the book useful as a college text - book or as perhaps the only easily-obtainable simunary of an intensely-interesting history .

		Mr.
Merriam	PERSON	's attitude toward the Negro , the South , and Slavery is on the whole the attitude of the Rebound , so to speak , -- that is , of the mass of the thinking part of the nation who , having had their feelings intensely harrowed by slavery , wrought to fever heat by war , and worried by Re - construction , are now disposed to discoimt much of their former fervor , philosophize over events , and pass calm judgments on events that were not calm . '

		The danger of this attitude is that often in an attempt to be judicious we miss the larger truth .

		an economic catastrophe brought on by imwise political theorizing and precipitated by fanatics , or was it a great moral question of right and wrong which caused the economic and political crisis ?

		Mr.
Merriam	PERSON	apparently would lean to - ward the second of these interpretations , and yet not wholly .

		He is fearful of being luijust to the South .

		His picture of slavery is not unpleasant , and there is a shade of something like contempt in his estimate of
Nat Turner	PERSON	,
John Brown	PERSON	, and
William Lloyd Garrison	PERSON	.

		They had their plax3e , he would seem to say , and their virtues , but on the whole they did about as much harm as good , and were lamentably weak in the head .

		In other words , Mr.
Merriam	PERSON	, in a generous attempt to be fair to the '' other side , '' is in some respects unfair to the Abolitionist .

		Yet his sin - ning here is so mild compared with the Southern ranters and Northerners like the
Columbia Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity school of political fable that one lays down the book with a feeling of considerable satisfaction and with thankfulness for an author who stands on a broad platform of humanity and who hopes to hear '' the pathetic melody of the Negro spirituals , the brave rollicking strains of ' Dixie , ' and the triumphant harmony of ' The Star-Spangled Banner ' blend and interweave in the Symphony of
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p. 411 -RRB- .

		Both Mr.
Merriam	PERSON	and Mr.
Sinclair	PERSON	believe in national aid to
Southern	LOCATION	education ; but what Mr.
Merriam	PERSON	suggests as possibly wise , Mr.
Sinclair	PERSON	demands as '' an imperative necessity . ''

		These pa8sd , ges suggest the difference in the spirit of the two books .

		Mr.
Sinclair	PERSON	has given 358 pages of passionful fervid commentary on the Negro since emancipation .

		The over-zealous critic might point out many faults in the work .

		It is not well digested , there are some over - statements , and much padding in the way of poetry and quotations from easily-accessible sources .

		And yet the book is of great value .

		It is alive .

		It carries a mes - sage , and the soul of the writer is so full that the words , facts , periods , and phrases tumble out often incoherently with many repetitions and a liberal sprinkling of exclamation points .

		The collection of facts and especially quotations , the vivid portrayal of recent public opinion toward the Negro , and the flat , outspoken ac - count of the demands of black men , have seldom been better done .

		One unfamiliar with the great American problem would be mystified by the book , but a newspaper and periodical reading American of to-day will find that it gives him a flesh-and-blood point of view .

		He is speaking of human difficulties in which he has lived and moved .

		He is , as a Negro , demanding the things which he wants as a man , not by indirection or implication , but by plain blimt words .

		He says of the South : '' The South was wrong , even if it was united , on the slavery question -- but public opinion destroyed slavery . ''

		The South was wrong , even if it was united , in making war on the republic -- but public opinion saved the republic . ''

		The South was wrong , even if it was united , in its threats to shoot colored soldiers and their white officers when captured -- but public opinion kept the colored soldiers on the firing line and protected them . ''

		Here we have , then , in these two books , the voice of the calmer retrospective North , charit - able toward error , suspicious of fervor , believing in American freedom and democracy ; and the voice of the Negro , eloquent with his wrongs , insistent for his rights , with the shadow of pain across his words .

		* In reading the later history of the
Third Republic	ORGANIZATION	, it is difficult to avoid a sense of con - fusion .

		Until
1901	DATE	, when the great problem of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	seemed to concentrate atten - tion , there was a distracting succession of short ministries with constant revision of policy .

		Of course , upon a less superficial view confusion disappears and the lines of development become clear .

		But in the earlier and more heroic period , when the Republic was battling for life , the issues are plainer and events fall into natural groups without the aid of serious reflection .

		This has given both of M. Hanotaux 's volumes unity of theme .

		eration of the territory through the efforts of
M. Thiers	PERSON	, and , as an epilogue , the overthrow of
Thiers	PERSON	on the twenty-fourth of
May	DATE	.

		In the present volume -LRB- II . -RRB-

		, it is the campaign of
1873	DATE	for the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy .

		A little less than a third of the volume is given to the story of the royalist intrigue .

		As soon as the tale is concluded and the minor political struggle involving the fate of the Broglie cabi - net becomes the subject , the interest falls off decidedly .

		This volume also includes several chapters on the literary , artistic , and religious situation as the country recovered from the effects of the war .

		M. Hanotaux is an historian and an Acade - mician , as well as an ardent republican of the school of
Grambetta	LOCATION	; consequently , every fig - ure is sketched sympathetically and each phase of the absorbing drama is described with an objectivity rare even in French historical writ - ings , and remarkable when one recalls that not aU the actors , nor all the issues , are dead .

		Only in one instance does a sentence seem to contain a particle of political venom .

		This is where the author refers to the '' senile vanity '' of
M. Thiers	PERSON	.

		The treatment is not only sympathetic , it is fresh , because
M. Hanotaux	PERSON	has had access to important unpublished material , memoirs , and private papers .

		M. Hanotaux has told the story in such a way as to make perfectly clear its true dramatic in - terest .

		This comes not merely from the bearing of the struggle upon the fate of the Republic , although such a stake would give dignity to any political conflict .

		The deeper interest is pro- duced by the note of luiiversality in the struggle of the actors , -- the
Comte de Chambord	ORGANIZATION	, the Comte de
Paris	LOCATION	,
Marshal MacMahon	PERSON	, the
Due de Broglie	ORGANIZATION	,
M. de Chesnelong	ORGANIZATION	,
M. Louis Veuil	PERSON	- lot , -- to drag
France	LOCATION	back from the inevitable , from what they regarded as the abyss of the re - public .

		They felt sure of success , for the Nat - tional Assembly had a monarchist majority , and it could use the constituent power , if only princes , president , and deputies could reach an under - standing upon the significance of the restoration of the
Comte de Chambord	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was a much easier matter to patch up the personal difficulties between the younger and the elder branch ; for while the Comte de
Paris	LOCATION	was ready to recognize Chambord 's legitimate claims to the throne , neither he nor his followers were willing to repu - diate
1830	DATE	and return to
1814	DATE	.

		All the formu - las which they were able to devise rested upon the basis of popular sovereignty .

		But the
Comte de Chambord	ORGANIZATION	would come back with his '' prin - 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, ciple '' and its symbol , the white flag , or he would not return at all .

		Otherwise he felt he would simply be '' a stout man with a limp , '' The climax was reached when the Comte de Chambord came secretly to
Versailles	LOCATION	, after his letter of
October 27	DATE	had ruined all chance of a restoration by vote of the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		He loved
France	LOCATION	and the army , and honestly believed that if he presented himself to the army the soldiers would see in him their chief and would accept the white flag as the emblem of French military glory , consecrated by the remembrance of the '' deeds that God had wrought through his beloved
Franks	PERSON	. ''

		The politicians and their compromising formulas might be waved aside .

		There was one obstacle : the support of the Mar - shal-President was necessary .

		But , monarchist though he was ,
MacMahon	PERSON	could not ignore the Assembly which had clothed him with authority .

		This looked to him like an intrigue which would tarnish his honor .

		There was nothing left the prince but to go away as secretly as he had come .

		On his journey to
Versailles	LOCATION	he had passed through
Paris	LOCATION	and had been driven by the black - ened walls of the TuUeries .

		On this journey also he passed through
Paris	LOCATION	, and drove to the Invalides , the palace sacred to the glories of the army .

		From the depths of his carriage he gazed at a military funeral as it marched out of the gates . ''

		This funeral ceremony was his last con - tact with the army , with
Paris	LOCATION	, with
France	LOCATION	.

		He went away and returned to the exile which he was never to leave again . ''

		In M. Hanotaux 's chapter on the literature of the period , he interprets suggestively the effect of the debacle upon the tendencies of French thought , particularly among writers whose work liad matured before the disasters of
1870	DATE	and of
1871	DATE	.

		To the historical student , the most interest - ing passage describes the spiritual mood in which Taine undertook his work on the '' Origins of Contemporary
France	LOCATION	. ''

		In reaching his con - clusion , M. Hanotaux has used the unpublished letters of Taine .

		He says that if Taine '' had written later , he would have written another book .

		Further from the events of
1871	DATE	, the im - pression would have been less strong , the work more just perhaps , but less beautiful .

		What is this book , on the whole , save the supreme ex - pression of patriotic anxiety , the poem of sorrow and doubt ?

		... If posterity wishes to know the condition of the soul of
France	LOCATION	on the morrow of the war , it will open this book , which , in its despairing pages , prolongs and repeats the plaint of the vanquished . ''

		The pages on the religious consciousness of the French twenty-five years ago appear almost an attempt to outline a lay religion for men '' Wandering between two worlds , one dead , The other powerless to be born . ''

		At times one wonders if this be not a personal confession .

		Not only in this chapter on '' The Moral Crisis , '' but elsewhere , the book is more than a history , it is the reflection of attitudes of mind of a contemporary Frenchman of a fine type .

		This enhances the value of a book which aims to interpret for us Contemporary
France	LOCATION	.

		* Sectarianism has played an important role in the profession of medicine and in theology , and social science has no right to hope for exemption .

		THE DIAL 297 find room in a happy valley .

		Nothing smaller than a whole planet will answer for the larger conception of the world-state .

		There are the usual stage prop - erties of socialistic speculation , advanced notions of stirpiculture , rewards for legitimate and well-bred children , travel two hundred miles over a noiseless track while you glance out of the window , and a love - story in broken narrative of ejaculations .

		There are , apparently , people who like their economics and pol - itics in dilution , with a flavor of classic salt : and Mr.
WeUs	PERSON	will afPord them enjojinent .

		Those who ask for facts in support of hypotheses will grow wear > ' of following the digressions .

		But why quarrel with one who brings us up to problems of the ages in sparkling dialogue ?

		Whatever one may think of the economic reasoning and conclusions of Mr.
George	PERSON	, we must confess ad - miration for his loyalty to the life-aims of his famous father .

		The root of all evil , we are still told , is monop - oly of land , for from that
spring	DATE	all the wrongs of privilege .

		The story is depressing and harrowing : merchant princes or their heirs revel in luxury and shameless excess ; the workingmen are becoming poorer , feebler , more hopeless ; the trade-unions , or - ganized to resist privilege but ignoring the single-tax , run into absui-d blunders : the masters of privilege per - vert law , rule by injunctions and bayonets , purchase bosses , resist reforms in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, corrupt politics , enslave the editors , stifle the voice of truth in uni - versities , tune the pulpit , excite wars of conquest , and .

		generally , hurry the Republic downward toward the fate of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	.

		There is truth in the lugubrious indictment , as there is a dark side to all life .

		But it is not the whole truth , and it would not be difficult to exhibit evidence that , bad as some parts of life are , we are gaining ground .

		Education has not altogether failed : courts are not the sinks of * injustice here described .

		Socialists would say that Mr.
George	PERSON	does not go more than half-way to the goal : if landed property ought to be confiscated , why not `` expropriate '' all capital ?

		So we come back to the controversy waged years ago over * • Progress and Poverty . ''

		The arg ^ ument is the same , only the illustrations are different .

		Mr.
Jack London	PERSON	, author of '' The Sea Wolf '' and '' The Call of the Wild , '' ventures into the field of socialistic theorj ' in his `` War of the Classes , '' and his style betrays the hunter 's eagerness and thirst for blood .

		He not only explains , but also incites , the '' war '' of which he treats .

		Here ag ^ in there are valuable suggestions carried up from contact with the under-world ; explanations of opposition to mili - tia among wage-workers , and the rapidly growing movement toward political action .

		The economic reasoning , however , is not clear , and there is little constructive thinking .

		The chief value of the book lies in its power to paint in vivid colors the senti - ments which are gathering force in cities , and which it were folly to ignore or minimize .

		It is a curious experience to turn from Mr.
London	LOCATION	's passionate plea for Socialism to the protest just as passionate against collectivism in the Rev. Mr.
Holland	PERSON	's `` The Commonwealth of Man . ''

		This clerical advocate of capitalism and wars of conquest bums with the same fire which blazes in the rhetoric of the iconoclast .

		One can almost see them take each other by the throat .

		How conciliatory to the wage - earner must this sentence appear : '' Why is not the workingman in Church ?

		... The banker is there , the merchant , the manufacturer , the lawj ` er , the doctor , the teacher , -- every class but the labor class .

		Can the
Church be Christ	ORGANIZATION	's which wins every class that believes in soul , but can not win the one class that believes in body ? ''

		One of these writers -- the optimistic preacher -- gives his energy to paint the bright side of the present world ; the other denounces all present arrangements and offers a paradise in a socialistic future .

		The task of the reader must be to sift out wheat by means of these whirlwinds , and add some considerations which both duellists were too excited to notice .

		After the warmth of Single-tax and the fever of Socialism comes the chill wind of Individualism in Mr.
GrinneU	PERSON	's '' Social Theories and Social Facts '' ; and here statistics are arrayed to make at least a show of proof .

		We are told that railroad com - panies may safely be left to a policy of undisturbed freedom , and that captains of industry and orgjan - izers of monopoly wiU tenderly care for the common good ; but that trade-unions .

		Socialists , advocates of municipal ownership ,
Interstate Commerce CoDMnis	ORGANIZATION	- sions and collectivism in general , are all '' contrary to natvu-e . ''

		It is vaguely hinted that rich men may occasionally be guilty of peccadilloes , but that real crimes must mostly be laid at the door of operatives , especially when they unite their efforts to better their lot . ''

		The poor in a loomp is bad , '' especially when they attempt collective bargaining .

		An example of judicial and balanced argument is given by Professor
Ashley	PERSON	, who attempts to clear the air in a fiscal controversy in
England	LOCATION	, and is compelled to investigate the question whether the German workmen , under a regime where the
State	ORGANIZATION	recognizes a moral duty to its citizens , are as badly off as they are represented to be in
England	LOCATION	.

		Opponents of a protective tariff on imports in
Great Britain	LOCATION	have been accustomed to paint the misery of German workingmen in dark tints , because it belongs to their argument to trace poverty to such a policy .

		Inci - dentally , the historian of industry has rendered a service to the discussion of workingmen 's insurance which of late has become interesting to American capitalfsts and wage-workers .

		Partisans of private corporations engaged in the insurance business have gone out of their way to tell us that obligator -RCB- - insur - ance in
Germany	LOCATION	has lowered wages and enslaved the employes .

		With the touch of a master .

		Professor
Ashley	PERSON	shows beyond question that the years during which insurance has become national in extent have been most profitable for both capital and labor .

		During precisely these years when the nation took the best care of its producers , it has marched to the 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, first rank among the manufacturers and traders of the world ; its soil is largely owned by small proprie - tors , who are prospering ; higher wages are earned in shorter hours and with increased output ; deposits in savings banks are larger than formerly ; coopera - tive trading is popular ; more and better food is con - sumed ; the use of distilled liquor has diminished ; the death-rate falls ; suicide is less frequent ; emi - gration has dwindled ; there are fewer paupers in a larger population ; the relation of employers to employees has become less antagonistic .

		A competent representative of the
Charity Organi	ORGANIZATION	- zation Society movement , with broad university training in economic science , offers in outline the essential aspects of a new discipline which he calls '' Social Economy . ''

		The problem treated is that of efficiency , -- the ability to attain and hold a place in a productive and normal society .

		Since efficiency is the result of all the cooperating agencies which affect health , income , and education , the knowledge required to promote efficiency must be assembled from all the sciences that deal with hygiene , sanita - tion , economic activity , and culture .

		The specific point at which the author natiirally enters this field is that of relief to social debtors ; and his illustra - tions are drawn from the constructive efforts of one of the most powerful and influential philanthropic agencies in the world .

		The little book is packed with ideas , and is larger than it looks . ''

		Agricultural Economics , '' by Mr.
H. C. Taylor	PERSON	, is a clear and instructive discussion of that large branch of special and practical economics which so vitally concerns the principal industry of this coun - try .

		It marks a departure from the conventional English and American treatises on political econ - omy , and follows more nearly the German method which has produced such immense results .

		This volume is scientific in its substance , although for the most part popular in style .

		It deals with the factors of agricultural production , the organization of the farm , the forces which determine prices , the distri - bution of wealth , values of farm property , means of acquiring land , tenancy , and landownership .

		Of all this group of books , that of Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	, '' The Bitter Cry of the Children , '' makes most direct and cogent appeal to the home feeling , the national interest , and the social conscience .

		We must leave to the medical men a final judgment of the asser - tion that all infants start life as equals , and we may reserve our own estimate of the number of under-fed children in this country .

		But there are two facts made as clear as sunlight in this searching volume : in our cities a vast number of innocent children are suffering and dying , or growing up to weakness and inefficiency ; and , short of radical measures , we have it in our power to prevent most of this social degra - dation .

		Testimonies of physicians and charity vis - itors , statistics , economic reasoning , pathetic stories and pictures are employed in turn to awaken the apathetic and rally the just and humane to a com - mon standard .

		The author is a Socialist , and that may prejudice certain minds against his message ; but it were better to listen , because the very life of the nation is involved , and the measures recommended might have been offered , as they have actually been invented and tested , by persons who were never suspected of extreme political views .

A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a book of real vitality .

		It contains no very novel views , and its style is not atti'active ; but there is life in it , and a personality behind it that almost disarms criticism .

		We could wish to be reminded less often that the author is a Roman Catholic .

		Distinctions of that sort seem to us not wholly appropriate to literary discussion , for literature shows its celestial affinities partly by being '' no respecter of persons . ''

		Dr.
Egan	PERSON	's sobriety of judgment is , however , in no way injured by his religious convictions .

		Of a book by the late
Richard Simpson	PERSON	, on `` The Religion of Shake - speare , '' he observes that `` to persons who have already made up their minds that all the greatest actors in the world 's history were of the one Faith , either by anticipation or participation , it will be delightfully edifying and perennially refreshing . ''

		He quotes the following comment , by Father
Bowden	PERSON	of the Oratory , on the passage in
Cymbeline	LOCATION	, '' For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse than priests and fanes that lie '' : '' Read ironically , the text means , ' You talk of the lying priests and their lying temples ; I hold your vile psalm-singing to be ten times worse ' '' ; upon which he remarks , not too severely , that such interpretation implies '' chronic Philistinism . ''

		`` If Shakespeare , '' he adds , `` wrote that very human and exaggerated and sweet speech of Guiderius to be ' read ironically , ' he deserves to be deprived of the honor of having written it . ''

		Dr.
Egan	PERSON	calls these papers '' essays in comparative literature '' ; and one of them , not the most interest - ing , is devoted to `` The Comparative Method in Literature . ''

		The volume gives a pleasant impres - sion of the author 's wide reading .

		German , French , and Spanish literature is laid under contribution , and one of the papers , `` The Greatest of Shake - speare 's Contemporaries , '' is an interesting sketch of
Calderon	PERSON	.

		The essay on '' Imitators of Shakespeare '' is devoted to a comparison of Aubrey Thomas De Vere 's play , '' Saint Thomas of Canterbury , '' with
Tennyson	PERSON	's ''
Becket	PERSON	, '' greatly to the disadvan - tage of the latter . ''

		He had a noble figure and a sublime time , '' says Dr.
Egan	PERSON	, '' and he belittled them both , because he would not understand them , or because he was desirous of the applause of the fre - quenters of theatres . ''

		The titular essay of the vol - ume , though interesting , is unsatisfactory as an interpretation of Hamlet 's character . ''

		This is to lay undue stress upon the direc - tion of the Ghost , '' Taint not thy mind . ''

James Schouler	PERSON	, author of a American ^ ■ manner * and well-known `` History of the

		States , '' has enlarged a series of lec - tures on
American History	ORGANIZATION	into a volume of three hundred pages bearing the title '' Americans of
1776	DATE	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Although concise and euphonistic , the title is not sufficiently explanatory .

		Instead of a fidsome panegyric , the book is an excel - lent study of the economic , social , and intellectual life of the American colonists about the time of the
American Revolution	ORGANIZATION	.

		What Weeden and Lodge have done for the colonies during theu '' entire exist - ence as such , this investigation does for them at a given period .

		Among the chapter titles may be found : ' `` Freemen and Bondmen , '' `` Dress and Diet , '' `` Amusements , '' `` Houses and Homes , '' '' Fine Arts , '' '' The Press , '' and • ' Education . ''

		Other writers have in recent times attempted with varWng success to give us glimpses of the enviromnent of our fore - fathei 's theu * homes , their furniture , and their customs : but no one has approached the task with the scholarly experience of Mr.
Schouler	PERSON	.

		The result shows that certain difficulties exist in an attempt of this kind , even for the trained specialist .

		In the first place , no chain of events , such as is found in political history , gives continuity to the recital ; bio - graphy is wanting to give personality to the dry facts ; in the end .

		the reader has a kaleidoscopic im - pression rather than a perspective .

		Taking into due consideration these difficulties , the present volume can not fail to satisfy .

		It is a storehouse of informa - tion , collected , as the author says , from newspapers , magazines , pamphlets , letters , and diaries of the pe - riod under considei'ation .

		The paucity of references at first thought seems imfortimate ; but reflection shows the impossibility of certifying the multitude of statements drawn from such diverse sources .

		The index , containing only proper names casually men - tioned , is inadequate for a volume devoted to social and economic topics , in which men are secondary .

		Residents of
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, which abolished sla - very through a court decision in
1784	DATE	, will scarcely approve the statement that ' •
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, solitary and alone of these commonwealths , shook off the curse by a determined effort , and deduced in

		Space is wanting for extracts illustrating Ameri - can life when politics were provincial , machinery crude , mining and metallurgy almost unknown , pub - lic libraries wanting , art undeveloped , and when clubs were confined almost wholly to men 's eating and drinking coteries .

		Excessive drinking , the au - thor tells us , was
America	LOCATION	's greatest vice imtil far down into the nineteenth century , when temperance crusades first began .

		The people were utilitarians in their pursuits , displaying little real culture or taste in art .

		Impudent quackery imposed upon the simple and credulous of the common people .

		Repression and retribution , and not reformation , were the ob - jects of penal laws .

		Scarcely five years before the
First Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	assembled in
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia , a ship-load of English girls was brought to that city and the girls placed on sale , presumably for marriage .

		Such are a few of the many interesting glimpses afforded by this unique volume on the Americans of 177fi .

		The same publicity makes it possible to gather recoi-ds of the kind of lives they led and the kind of chai-acters they possessed .

		The data for such appraisal ai-e abundant for the distin - guished king or prince ; but it is often at the cost of much ransacking of records that even a sparse statement can be foimd in regard to all the mem - bers of the family on the paternal and the ma - ternal side , who survived to adult life .

		Dr.
Woods	PERSON	insists upon a complete genealogy on both sides ; for his ultimate comparisons are statistical in na - ture , and , to be fair , require as careful an account - ing of the obscure as of the prominent , of the weak as of the strong .

		Hence the ` scions of the great Houses --

Hohenzollern	ORGANIZATION	, Orange and

		Side by side with the central conclusion that blood makes the man , and that the men of high grade are apt to have high-gi ` ade ancestors and descendants , is the equally important conclusion that mental and moral traits are themselves correlated , and that the strongest mentally are in the same statistical sense the worthiest morally .

		Equally corroborative is the negative evi - dence that shows how poor strains of blood , especially in the case of nervous defect , continues its vitiating potency , -- again in support of heredity determinar tion .

		Quite natm-ally , such conclusions must be judi - cially applied as well as derived .

		Dr.
Woods	PERSON	rarely goes much beyond the statistical warrant of his evi - dence , and has at all events presented his case more strongly and more judicially , as well as scientific - ally , than has any other contributor to this particular problem .

		Of the writing of Utopias there will probably never be an end -- unless -LRB- terrible thought ! -RRB-

		Utopia should one day be realized .

		Nor will there ever be lacking readers of these social studies in the guise of fiction .

		Mr.
Joaquin Miller	PERSON	's dreamily beautiful and poetic little story , `` The Building of the City Beautiful , '' issued in attractive form by Mr.
Albert Brandt	PERSON	,
Trenton	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, is now added to the number .

		The scene is laid partly in
Palestine	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	, partly in
California	LOCATION	.

		The hero is nameless , simply designated as '' the man '' ; the heroine is a nobly beautiful Rus - sian Jewess ,
Miriam	PERSON	, sometime secretary to Sir
Moses Montefiore	PERSON	.

		The attempt to rear a '' city beautiful '' on the heights overlooking
San Francisco	LOCATION	results , of course , in failure ; for below is the great city with its temptations , and man is but mortal after all .

		Yet hear the words of the builder 's mother at the close of the book : '' My son , there is no failure , there can be no failure for those who really try .

		The only failure possible in life is the failure to try , and persistently try , for the best .

		The good , the glory , the consola - tion of it all is the ennobling effort .

		Let us bravely leave results to Him . ''

		To the average novel-reader the book will seem but the vague and dreamy lucu - bration of a visionary hermit .

		It certainly takes no firm hold on the hard realities that most of us feel bound to reckon with .

		The rose must have its thorn -LRB- we speak not of the Burbanked rose -RRB- , the fairest face will have its mole or birth-mark , -- or , as the old Latin punningly puts it , '' Ubi uber , ibi tuber . ''

		Let us not , however , deprecate any such attempts as the Californian poet 's to ameliorate our condition , even though we are well assured that entire success would leave us wretched , with nothing further to strive for , no more ideals to cherish , no hope of better tilings to gild with promise each to-morrow .

		A pictm-e of the author and his venerable mother forms a frontispiece to the book , whose autobiographic flavor adds still further to its interest .

		Studies and The geologist wanders over a wide speculations onn ^ ^ ^ .

		.

		lij the
Earth	LOCATION	and field and penetrates many a neglected its foundation , path .

		Occasionally he is persuaded to sit by the roadside and expound to laymen some - thing of what he has seen .

		The tales he tells are often of marvellous interest ; and it is as good for the geologist to talk as for the layman to hear , since he is thereby forced to submit his conclusions to the common-sense review of his fellows .

		English geolo - gists have done rather better in this particular than have the Americans .

		In the book entitled `` The Age of the
Earth	LOCATION	, and other Geological Studies '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , Dr. SoUas , Professor of Geology at
Oxford	LOCATION	, expoimds and speculates entertainingly on the age and fig ^ e of the earth , the formation of coral islands , the genesis of flints and of fresh water faunas , and gives a very human sketch of a visit to the
Lipari Isles	LOCATION	.

		The age of the earth has been a fruitful topic for discussion since Steno first attempted to harmonize his observations in
Italy	LOCATION	with the ortho - dox interpretations of the Mosaic account .

		Geolo - gists in general have argued for some hundred or more millions of years .

		Physicists have attempted to beat them down to a beggarly twenty to forty millions , -- '' nearer twenty than forty , '' according to
Kelvin	PERSON	.

		Professor
Sollas	PERSON	works out to his satisfac - tion a median figure , approximately fifty millions , though this impresses one rather as an averaging of figm * es than an independent result .

		The doubts emphasized by American investigators regarding the physical data upon which
Kelvin	PERSON	's estimate is based are apparently unknown to Professor Sollas .

		The whole subject would seem for the present to be wholly within the field of speculation .

		Two of the best chapters in the book relate to the influence of Oxford on the history of geology and to the use of fossils in the study of strata .

		In the former , inter - esting side-lights are tlirown upon the development of English scientific opinion ; and in the latter ,
Huxley	LOCATION	's homotaxis conception is very justly criti - cised .

		The objections which Huxley found to believ - ing in wide contemporaneity of geologic formations are met by arguments based on past climates and an elaboration of
Heilprin	ORGANIZATION	's objections from migrations .

		The very strong argument which may be based upon the known physical history of the earth is not used .

		The book closes with a chapter on '' Geologies and Deluges , '' in which the difficulties in the way of a universal Noachian deluge are considered in con - nection with the historical evidence of floods in
Chaldea	LOCATION	and elsewhere .

		THE DIAL 301 aug ^ urated this movement in art -- Rubens ,
Nicolas Poussin	PERSON	, and
Claude	PERSON	. ''

		Landscape Painting and Modem Dutch Artists '' -LRB- Baker-Taylor -RRB- is a concise historj ' of this branch of painting from the awaken - ing of art to the recent French Impressionists and the modern revival in
Holland	LOCATION	.

		The author , Mr.
E. B. Greenshields	PERSON	.

		points out that all through the history of landscape art a strong subjective element is found in the works of the g ^ eat artists , each one revealing the individual manner in which the painter was af - fected by
Nature	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was
Whistler	LOCATION	who propounded the theory that there is no such thing as a national art , but that aU art is purely personal to the individ - uality of the artist .

		In treating modern Dutch art .

		the present author does not pretend to any finality of judgment , but has made note of opinions arrived at by one who is fond of their pictures .

		Biographical and critical sketches are furnished of
Josef Israels	PERSON	, the father of the school , the revered of his country - men , the sympathetic portrayer of
Holland	LOCATION	's peasan - try ; of
Matthew Maris	PERSON	, the painter of dreams ; of
William	LOCATION	and
James Maris	PERSON	; of
Bosboom	LOCATION	,
Mauve	LOCATION	, and
Weissenbruch	ORGANIZATION	.

		Most people know of the Dutch ar - tists in an indefinite way , associating them vaguely with picturesque landscapes , odd-looking peasants , and mist-enveloped canals .

		To them , this volume will come with all the interest of noveltj ' .

		Mr.
Green	PERSON	- shields , who has established himself as an authority on the artists under discussion , has approached his task with ardor , and has assembled his material with an eye keen both to the true and the interesting .

		The numerous illustrations are helpful to the text .

		TheerUicUm With the completion of '' The Life of life and of Reason , '' in Professor
Santayana	PERSON	's humanideau .

		volume `` Reason in Science '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- , we may be permitted to repeat the judgment expressed in these columns on the earlier volumes , that both philosophy and literature have been enriched by a work of very remarkable qualities .

		Indeed , for the combination of fertUitj ' , sanity , and keenness of insight in the criticism of life and human ideals , with a high degree of literary charm , it would be difficult to point to its equal in modern philosophical litera - ture .

		That it represents a final point of view for philosophy , is indeed not so evident .

		One should perhaps hesitate to confess to a prejudice , which , according to Professor Santay ana .

		is the certain mark of an iijcompetent thinker .

		But it may be ques - tioned whether the time-honored craving which men have had , or have thought they had , to know things in terms of their so-called ' * existence , '' will so readily yield to this proposed reinterpretation of all beliefs as formulations of an ideal of life .

		That such beliefs are • • mj-thical , '' in the sense that they are not subject to the sort of verification which is called scientific is no doubt true .

		Doubtless also this false substantializing into concretions of existence of what are in truth laws or aspects of spiritual experience , is a frequent -- a verj ' frequent -- thing in human thought ; and the criticism of it is fruitful .

		But that no real place whatever is left for belief about existence is , one may still be permitted to think , a trifle too thoroughgoing in the light alike of consist - ency of theory and of the satisfaction of our concrete human interests .

		For , after all , the real point comes back to a question of the fundamental meaning and value of life ; and , with all admiration for Professor
Santayana	PERSON	, it is still possible to feel that he misses something vital in the deepest human experience , the lack of which is likely now and again to bring the reader up with a sharp feeling of protest .

		But this need not interfere with the almost unqualified appre - ciation of very much of the author 's philosophy of life .

		In the brilliant analysis and interpretation of ideals in relation to their natural basis , the work offers a contribution of permanent value to philo - sophical literature .

		Early voyager ,
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have on the coast of recently published one of those per - iVetr

		It is entitled '' Sailors ' Narratives of Voyages along the
New England Coast	LOCATION	, 1524-1624 , '' and is the work of that well-known authority on Colonial Historj ' , -RSB- VIr .

		George
Parker Winship	PERSON	, of the
John Carter Brown Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		In most beautiful pages of text set between rules in the manner in use in the age of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, he has given us Giovanni da Ver - razano ,
Bartholomew Gosnold	PERSON	,
Martin Pring	PERSON	,
Samuel de Champlain	ORGANIZATION	,
George Waymouth	PERSON	,
George Popham	PERSON	,
Raleigh Gilbert	LOCATION	,
Henry Hudson	PERSON	,
Samuel Argall	PERSON	,
John Smith	PERSON	,
Thomas Dermer	PERSON	, and
Christopher Levitt	PERSON	.

		Introducing each selection is a sketch of the traveller and of the causes and purposes of his ad - venture .

		There are also maps from the narrations of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	and
Champlain	LOCATION	, and beautiful facsimile title-pages from the books of
Brereton	PERSON	and Rosier , containing the voyages of Grosnold , and
Waymouth	LOCATION	, and also from
Captain Smith	ORGANIZATION	's '' Description . ''

		Here the lover of old voyages and adventures has the whole
New England	LOCATION	section in a delightful form , worthy of the famous mariners thus associated together .

		Especially welcome are the somewhat rare narratives of Gk > snold ,
Pring	PERSON	,
Waymouth	LOCATION	, and Pop - ham .

		Here , too , is good and vigorous English from men as sturdy with the pen as yrith the sword or on the quarterdeck , -- English of the type of
King James	ORGANIZATION	's Version , resonant with fire and life .

		It is a good style to contemplate , in view of the dilutions that more recent literature has tolerated ; it is the language of men who did things and took no great credit for the doing .

		, , , ^ ^ ^ ^ ' • ■ , beautiful character , while skating with a friend on the
Ottawa River	LOCATION	, came suddenly in the twilight upon a wide space of open water , and before the danger could be avoided the two found themselves submerged in the icy current Henry
Albert Harper	PERSON	, a young journalist and writer on economic and social questions , after vainly attempting a rescue by other means , plunged in to assist the drowning .

		He per - 302 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, ished with
Miss Blair	PERSON	, who had nobly endeavored to dissuade him from an attempt that meant almost cer - tain death , but to whom he could only reply , '' What else can I do ! ''

		The young lady 's companion , a young man , escaped as by a miracle , else the world would have been the poorer for not knowing how courageous and self-denying the two victims had shown themselves .


Harper	PERSON	's oldest and nearest friend , Mr.
W. L. Mackenzie King	PERSON	, now offers in a small volume entitled '' The Secret of Heroism '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , a tribute to the memory of his brave com - rade .

		It gives in brief an account of the tragic event , a history of the Sir
Galahad	PERSON	monument erected to
Harper	PERSON	's memory on
Parliament Hill	ORGANIZATION	,
Ottawa	LOCATION	, and an outline of
Harper	PERSON	's life with extracts from his let - ters and journals .

		It is a book to make the reader humbler , braver , pm ` er , and , whether for a lifetime or but for a day , every way better .

		Fixh ttoriex Good fishermen are proverbially si - hv an English lent , at least while engaged in the xpoHsman .

		sport , and their skill is reported to be inversely proportional to the magnitude of their own accounts of their success .

		Whatever craft Mr.
Beavan	PERSON	may display with rod and line at sea or on the banks of the
Medway	LOCATION	, the reader of his volume entitled `` Fishes I Have Known '' -LRB-
Wessels	PERSON	-RRB- is left in no doubt as to the effectiveness of his tales of the fishes he has caught in British waters , in those of the colonies , and of
South America	LOCATION	.

		The author appears not to have tested his skill in
North Ameri	LOCATION	- can waters .

		One does not look for strict adherence to scientific accm-acy of statement in an account of fishing methods and experiences by an enthusiastic angler , but this hardly excuses the statement that soundings in the Sargasso Sea seldom give more than one hundred fathoms !

		The book is written from the sportsman 's point of view , but by one who is evidently a nature-lover as well as a good story - teller .

		There are a number of interesting illustrar tions .

$ 2.60	MONEY	.

		This handsome volume , with its wide-margined 400 pages , contains 350 of the best Somiets which the author has produced during a life devoted to poetry .

		In every way the book is a remarkable production .

		It contains many new Sonnets not before published .

		No American library can be considered complete without it .

		Read the
Verdict of High Authorities	ORGANIZATION	in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	Westminster Review : -- Mr.
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	's sonnets exceed in number the Rime of
Petrarch	LOCATION	, and cover a wider field of thought , experience , and imagination .

		... It would be idle to attempt , in the limits of a short notice , anything like a critical examination of this wonderfid collection ... He possesses a vivid imagination , kept under severe restraint , a delicate ear for rhythm , together with the faculty of pictorial presentation .

		These qualities , combined with a well-nigh faultless technique , render him miapproachable by any living English sonneteer .

		Mrs.
Ella Higginson	PERSON	: -- No American has ever made such an enduring and noteworthy contribution to the sonnet literature of the world .

		He stands beside
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		His work has the dignity , the serenity , the seriousness , the fine imagination and the diction , exquisitely simple and rich , that mark the great poet .

		Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	: -- A little more courage to know what is undeniably great , although it is our own , seems to me still desirable in our criticism , and when it comes Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	's poetry will have its reward .


St. Andrew ^ s University	ORGANIZATION	: --
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	is a poet born , not made .

		We camiot withhold our admira - tion from a collection of sonnets which have a charm and a beauty about them giving evidence of the work of a poet of remarkable poetic genius .

		A herdeen Free Press : -- To the rare gift of a penetrative imagination he brings a finely balanced intel - lect and a keen sense of poetic * diction .

		... In his highest flights he shows a warmth of imagination , a richness of colour , a clarity of thought , and an almost perfect technique that shows him not unworthy to walk beside the greatest sonneteers in the annals of the English language .

		Prof , A .


S. Mackenzie	PERSON	,
Kentucky State College	ORGANIZATION	, in the
Louisville	LOCATION	Courier-Journal : --
Lloyd Mifflin	PERSON	, in my opinion , is the greatest poet of
America	LOCATION	, past or present ... The sad part of it is that a man has to die to become famous .

		Dundee A dvertiser : -- There are some critics who maintain that American poetry is on the decline .

		The halcyon days of
Bryant	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Whittier	LOCATION	and
Whitman	PERSON	are gone , it is said .

		While there may be a grain of truth in the accusation , it can not justly be alleged that poetry of the higher order no longer has an exponent in
America	LOCATION	while
Lloyd Mifflin	LOCATION	still remains to carry on the great tradition of song .

		Yorkshire Post : -- ... Some are suffused with tenderness and beauty : a few , very few , are splendidly strong .

		To say that some half-dozen should find a place in the most choice '' Somiet Anthology '' of the future is the greatest praise we can conceive .

		Evening Post : -- Mr.
Mifflin	PERSON	is justly entitled to a high position as a sonneteer .

		In his own way there is no one now living to equal him .

		Indeed , it is only just to remember that there have been in the course of English literary history only a very few poets who could get together a collection of sonnets at once so mmaerous as this and of such high technical excellence .

		The volume contains three hundred and fifty pieces , and is then but a selection .


R. H. Stoddard	PERSON	: -- His faults are condoned by many excellent qualities , and by one in which he has no superior among living American poets , if indeed an equal -- a glorious imagination ... The man who wrote this sonnet -LRB- '' The Flight '' -RRB- is a true poet , and must soon be reckoned among the masters of American song .

		BRIEFER MENTION 333 NOTES 334 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 335 TRE TEACHING PROFESSION .

		No greater evil could befall the educational system of this country than that of becoming definitely crystallized into the type of organiza - tion exemplified by mercantile and corporate enterprise .

		The evil is imminent , and sometimes seems inevitable , so pervasive are the influences that tend to make educational administration a matter of business , and so persuasive is the argu - ment from analogy when addressed to ears pre - disposed by every familiar association to accept its validity .

		^ laterial and commercial modes of thinking prevail so largely in our national con - sciousness , and impose themselves so masterfully upon our narrowed imagination , that most people are ready to accept without hesitation their ex - tension into the domain of our intellectual con - cerns , particularly into that of the great concern of education .

		AVTiy , it is naively asked , why should not the methods that we apply with such pronounced success to the management of a bank or a railway prove equally efficient in the man - agement of a system of schools or a university ?

		Why should there not result from their employ - ment here the same sort of efficiency that results from their employment elsewhere ?

		Why should not the educational fruits of autocratic control , centralized administration , and the hierarchical gradation of responsibility and authority , be similar to their fruits in the field of commercial activity ?

		These questions are not difficidt to answer , but it is difficult to frame the answer in terms that the successfid man of affairs will fiLnd in - telligible .

		The subject is one that he approaches with a prejudiced mind , although his bias is not so much due to perversity as to sheer inability to realize the fundamental nature of the question at issue .

		He is so fixed in the commercial way of looking at organized enterprise that he can not so shift his bearings as to occupy , even tempo - rarily , the professional point of view .

		Now the idea of professionalism lies at the very core of educational endeavor , and whoever engages in educational work fails of his purpose in just so far as he faUs to assert the inherent prerogatives of his calling .

		He becomes a hireling , in fact 314 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, if not in name , when lie suffers , unprotesting , the deprivation of all initiative , and contentedly plays the part of a cog in a mechanism whose motions are controlled from without .

		Yet the tendency in our country is to-day strongly set toward the recognition of this devitalized system of educational activity as suitable and praise - worthy , and the spirit of professionalism in teaching is engaged in what is nothing less than a life-and-death struggle .

		When a university president or a school principal can indulge un - rebuked in the insufferable arrogance of such an expression as '' my faculty '' or '' one of my teachers , '' when school trustees are capable of calling superintendents and principals and teach - ers '' employees , '' it is time to consider the matter somewhat seriously , and inquire into the probable consequences of so gross a misconception of the nature of educational service .

		There is one general consequence which sub - sumes all the others .

		It is that yoimg men of character and self-respect will refuse to engage in the work of teaching -LRB- except as a makeshift -RRB- as long as the authorities in charge of education remain blind to the professional character of the occupation , and deal with those engaged in it as objects of suspicion , or , at best , as irresponsible and unpractical theorists whose actions must be kept constantly under control and restricted by all manner of limitations and petty regulations .

		Membership in a profession implies a certain franchise , an emancipation from dictation , and a degree of liberty in the exercise of judgment , which most members of the teaching profession find are denied them by the prevalent forms of educational organization .

		And the denial is made the more exasperating by the conscious - ness that these rights -LRB- which are elementary and should be inalienable -RRB- are withheld by per - sons whose tenure of authority is more apt to be based upon the executive energy or the ability of the schemer or the success of the man of prac - tical affairs than upon expert acquaintance with the conditions of educational work .

		The '' busi - ness '' president or administrative board is bad enough , and the '' political '' president or board is worse ; yet upon the anything but tender mercies of the one or the other most men who devote their lives to the noble work of teaching must in large measure depend .

		The inevitable consequence of this condition is , as we have said , that a process of natural selection is constantly tending to drive the most capable men into professions which may be pur - sued upon professional terms , and to make the teaching profession more and more the resort of the poor in spirit , to whom the words of the Beatitude must have a distinctly ironical ring .

		To become a teacher in this country is , except in the case of a few favored institutions or systems , to subordinate one 's individuality to a mechanism , and to expose one 's self-respect to indignities of a peculiarly wanton sort .

		It is no wonder that the yoimg man of parts is not over-anxious to enter a profession so forbidding to every professional instinct , and that he turns aside from the educational field , however strong his natural inclination to enter it , when he gets sight of the artificial obstacles to its proper cultivation .

		It is often urged that the money rewards of the teaching profession are insufficient to attract to it the better class of men .

		This is undoubt - edly true up to a certain point , but to insist upon it overmuch is to take a more cynical view of human nature than we are willing to take .

		Inadequate compensation is a grievous fault of our educational provision , but it is not so grievous as the faults that undermine profes - sional self-respect , and sap educational vitality at its very root .

		Yet these graver faults are easily remediable , and would be promptly rem - edied if we could once rid ourselves of the obsession of the commercial or military type of administrative organization .

		K the educational laborer is worthy of his hire , he is even more worthy of the trust and confidence that neces - sarily appertain to his delicate and specialized duties , and to refuse him these is to degrade his effort into the mere journeyman 's task .

		The whole question of the relative importance of compensation and consideration was thus stated by one of the speakers at the
Illinois Trustees	ORGANIZATION	' Conference of
last October	DATE	: '' Young men of power and ambition scorn what should be reck - oned the noblest of professions , not because that profession condenms them to poverty , but be - cause it dooms them to a sort of servitude ... The problem is not one of wages ; for no university can become rich enough to buy the independence of any man who is really worth purchasing . ''

		The more closely the business analogy is ex - amined the more apparent is its failure to fit the conditions of education .

		Efficiency in busi - ness is achieved by the subordination of individ - ual initiative to centralized direction .

		A highly capable manager makes all the plans , and trans - mits his ideas , through his heads of departments , to the host of workers , who are expected to do
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 315 exactly as they are told .

		Now this arrangement , entirely proper in a department store or a rail - way company , becomes almost worthless when fitted to a university or a system of public schools , for here the one essential factor of suc - cess is that the teachers , who are in this case the host of workers , should be left unhampered by specific directions , and free to apply their own specialized intelligence to their work .

		Every attempt to shape that work from above , except in such mechanical or formal matters as the allotment of duties and the arrangement of pro- granunes , especially every attempt to impose tests or dictate concerning methods , is likely to work direct injury , and is certain in time to eliminate from the body of workers the very persons whom it is most desirable to retain .

		For it can not be said too often or too emphat - ically that teaching is the personal concern of instructor and student , and that any meddling with this delicate and intimate relation will work much more mischief than good .

		So the com - mercial ideal of high-priced imperious manage - ment and low-priced docUe labor can have no place in educational work , where the ideal should be rather that of cordial cooperation between all the forces engaged , with the distinct admission that educational policy -LRB- as far as such a thing is found desirable -RRB- must proceed from the established teaching relation rather than from the doctrinaire mandate of the exec - utive theorist .

		We know very well the clamorous objections that will be raised against the fundamental prop - ositions above outlined . ''

		Chaos is come asrain '' wlQ be the outcry whenever education is sought to be rearranged upon these conditions .

		To such rigidity of mind have the majority of edu - cational leaders been reduced by the ideal of regimentation and the fetich - worship of system and uniformity that they are honestly incapable of realizing the individualist attitude or of sym - pathizing with the more hvmiane and rational principles which we have endeavored to set forth .

		Jealous enough of professional privilege on their own accoimt , they take a slighting view of the equally valid claims to professional con - sideration made by the body of actual teachers .

		They are so impressed by their smoothly - working machinery as to forget completely that the fash - ioning of soids is a very different affair from the manufacture of watches or other products of the mechanic arts .

		To their view , the alternative offered in place of their elaborate systems of executive control and the graded devolution of authority may well seem to deserve the name of chaos , but intelligent minds will not be ter - rified by a word which means , in this instance and in the last analysis , nothing more than a recognition of the fact that teachers and stu - dents are alike individuals , and that prescrip - tion en masse is the poorest possible way of dealing with difficulties that concern individuals alone .

		Aside from the cry of chaos , every plea for the rehabilitation of the teaching profession is sure to be met by the assertion that large num - bers of those engaged in it are unfit for the burden of professional responsibility .

		This is probably true .

		It would be surprising if it were not true , when we consider the meagreness of the rewards hitherto held out to the rank and file of the profession , and the constant growth of the regulative tendency which imfailingly operates to deter the best men from becoming teachers , and to drive from the ranks the best of those already enlisted .

		The situation , more - over , as respects the sort of ability , the type of outstanding personality , most to be desired , tends constantly to grow worse rather than bet - ter through the continuous operation of the same malisrn influences .

		But was there ever a more vicious circle of argument than that which de - fends the persistence in a system productive of such unfortunate results by urging that the per - sonnel of the profession has now been brought so low that the restoration of its inherent rights would entail disastrous consequences ?

		Very possibly it would , and e \ Tls of this sort might have to be faced , but they wovdd be in their nature temporary , and not nearly as dishearten - ing as the lasting and deepening evils involved in the perpetuation of an administrative policy which is an affront to every professional instinct .

		Professor
Joseph Jastrow	PERSON	, in a remarkably forceful and enlightened discussion of this sub - ject in its bearings upon university administra - tion -LRB- '' Science , ''
April 13	DATE	-RRB- puts the whole matter in a nutshell when he declares for the substitu - tion of '' government by cooperation '' for `` gov - ernment by imposition . ''

		This is surely the ideal toward which everyone having at heart the in - terests of education as a professional matter should strive , in fields both high and low , and we have observed numerous recent indications of a reaction in this sense from the military or corporate ideal which has hitherto had things its own way .

		But the enemy is still strongly in - trenched , and his position will not easily be forced .

		Ax AcTOK 's Memories of a Fellow Actor .

		* For years , as one gathers from the pages of Mr.
Francis Wilson	PERSON	's ''
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	, '' the younger comedian has been dogging , with Boswellian intent , the footsteps of his elder fellow player .

		But the image here used is not well chosen ; nor , perhaps , woidd the author of the book feel himself complimented by being likened to
Johnson	PERSON	's obsequious admirer .

		There was evidently but little of the Johnson-Boswell relation between the two men , at least according to the Macaiday conception of the great Doctor 's biographer .

		Like ideals and kindred enthu - siasms appear to have rendered the two actors congenial to each other .

		Fondness for and familiarity with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	may be noted in both , with something more than a nodding ac - quaintance with the great masters of painting , a liking for literature and facility in the use of the pen , and a high sense of the dignity of their calling as dramatic artists .

		Having introduced the name of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	, let us permit Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	to do what
Boswell	PERSON	has done in the first part of his book ; that is , let us listen while the younger man narrates the cir - cumstances of his first entering the presence of the elder . ''

		I first saw him one
Saturday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	, in
1870	DATE	, as I can see him now , on the southwest corner of Twenty - third Street and Sixth Avenue ,
New York	LOCATION	, eating
Malaga	LOCATION	grapes out of a paper bag .

		In those days there was a fruit-stand on that corner .

		He stood on the curb - stone abstractedly eating the grapes and watching the crowd file into Booth 's Theatre for the matinee per - formance of ' Rip van Winkle , ' which was then in the midst of an eight months ' run .

		How I drank him in and ate him up as he stood there , -- and I remember how , boy-like , I brushed past him just to be able to feel that I had come in contact with him !

		My action had not disturbed him , for he did not turn toward me or make any sign that he had heard my frightened words of apology .

		This relieved me , for I was so scared at my temerity that I should not have known what to say or do .

		I followed him , at a respectful distance , across the street , past the main entrance of the theatre , to that mysterious portal , the stage door , through which he vanished from my admiring gaze . ''

		The actual meeting of the two and the begin - ning of their acquaintance are thus described : '' I had been corresponding with Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	about his Autobiography , but newly begun in the
November	DATE	• Century Magazine , ' and he had promised to help with *
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	.

		Reminiscences of a Fellow Player .

		By

		gifts of prints and letters in the extra-illustrating of my own copy when the Autobiography should be published in book form .

		He asked me to come and see him , ap - pointing the business office of the
Park Theatre	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, as the place , and one o'clock as the hour .

		As I entered , he sprang from his chair , and before anyone could introduce us , he had grasped me by the hand , -- and thus was realized my youthful dream of meeting Rip van
Jefferson	PERSON	. ''

		The curious reader will thank Mr.
Wilson	PERSON	for having adopted , as he himself confesses , some - thing of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	's pertinacious inquisitiveness in gathering information for his intended vol - ume .

		On one page we are somewhat amused to come upon the great actor in his dressing - room at the Fifth Avenue Theatre , arraj ' ^ ed in a brown padded Chinese smoking jacket , and dozing in his chair , while his valet , the all-useful Karl , is in patient attendance , tickling the soles of his master 's feet with a feather , -- a gentle stimulation that drew off the blood from the head and superinduced a feeling of drowsy com - fort .

		Again , the biographer finds Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	clothed in a full suit of blue jeans and engrossed in his favorite avocation , painting . ''

		He must have known I was taking notes , for he said I must not print the Irving discussion -- at least , not now .

		Sometimes I read aloud what he said , and he corrected me if I had mistaken him .

		Like
Boswell	PERSON	, ' I know not .

		how such whimsical ideas come into my head , ' but I asked him the most disconnected things , which often extracted a laugh from him and always a reply ... Boswell-like , I asked him a variety of im - related questions about his daughters , his sons , whether he meant to revive ' The Rivals , ' why he painted with his fingers , why his hair kept so dark , how long he had been playing '
Rip van Winkle	PERSON	, ' and the like .

		He told me about his daughters , one of whom , Mrs.
Farjeon	PERSON	, wife of the novelist , he had not seen for twenty years . '

		Farjeon doesn ' t write any more , does he ? '

		I asked .

		` Not now , ' he replied ; ` his style has gone out of fashion , I suppose .

		I am ashamed to say I have never read but one or two of his books . ' ''

		The most interesting chapter in the volume is the one giving a full account -LRB- already known in part to magazine-readers -RRB- of the all-star pre - sentation of '' The Rivals , '' ten years ago this month .

		Portraits of the actors and actresses in character , with their autographs in facsimile , accompany the narrative .

		The ludicrous pic - ture of the author himseK as ''
David	PERSON	'' is the only portrait of him that the book contains .

		Many matters throughout the volume are , per - haps unavoidably , already familiar to readers of Mr.
Jefferson	PERSON	's Autobiography .

		The chapter entitled '' The Author '' is avowedly drawn largely from that work , and is somewhat of the nature of padding -- very readable padding though it unquestionably is .

		In an excellent chapter called '' Characteristic Days '' occurs
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI .

		317 this paragraph on the burning of ''
Crow	PERSON	's Nest , '' the actor 's
summer	DATE	home at
Buzzard	ORGANIZATION	's Bay : '' ♦ When I got your letter of sympathy , ' he remarked , * I said : Of all men ,
Wilson	PERSON	has lost most by this con - flagration in the way of autograph letters , programs , and what not , which I intended to send him .

		When it was seen that the house must go , ' he continued , ' my Cape Cod neighbors bethought them of saving the household goods , and rushed for the piano , a rattle-trap thing I had long thought of replacing .

		They made for that because it was big and had shiny legs , I suppose , and pulled it out on the grass .

		Much less exertion would have saved thousands of dollars ' worth of beautiful paintings .

		Nevertheless , I appreciate their intention , and am grateful for their efforts . ' ''

		As the author remarks , '' the quiet way in which he laughed at the thought of the ' natives ' tug - ging away at heavy furniture , while Corots ,
Diazes	LOCATION	, Troyons ,
Daubignj	ORGANIZATION	's , and Mauves were threatened with destruction , spoke volumes for his philosophy that could thus permit him to snule in the face of such a loss .

		Perhaps the most i-emarkable thing about it , though , was the keen sense of the ridiculous shown .

		It was alto - gether charming . ''

		The next year , however ,
1892	DATE	, ''
Crow	PERSON	's Nest '' was rebuilt , and its o \ \ Tier continued , with the same success as before , to play the country gentleman , entertaining his friends , as one may infer , with lavish hospitality .

		With a delightfid touch of humor , the author i-epresents him as wrestling unsuccessfully -LRB- he was an unskilful carver -RRB- with refractory fowls and joints at the head of his own board .

		A fondness for anecdote and reminiscence still further delayed the ser \ `` ing of his guests .

		On one occasion , when he was engaged in the labori - ous dismemberment of a duck , while each visitor sat in breathless expectation of ha ^ ^ ing at any moment to catch the bird and return it to the platter , he paused to tell the company that he was reminded of
Bill Nye	PERSON	's observation that in amateur carving the gravy seldom matches the wall-paper .

		Of more seriously instructive matters , we have a good account of the genesis and development of the Jeffersonian '' Rip van Winkle '' and ** The Rivals , '' pages of conversation on painting and the drama , and every now and then bits of the genial actor 's philosophy of life and glimpses of his simny disposition .

		A firm belief in a future existence to which this is but the merest prelude , and at the same time a keen enjojinent of this life and a determination to make the most of it , are what one must especially admire in this ever - active , alertly alive , and infectiously cheerfxd veteran of the stage .

		Ex-President
Cleveland	LOCATION	figures somewhat prominentiy in the book , in connection with
Jefferson	PERSON	's fishing diversions .

		Just a paragraph from Mr.
Cleveland	PERSON	's remin - iscences of his holiday companion , contributed to the book , must be given here .

		The incident narrated is of the most trivial sort , but is a welcome aid to the imagination .

		* '' We were fishing for weakfish -- called by
Buzzard	ORGANIZATION	's Bay fishermen ' Squeteague . '

		He -LSB-
Jefferson	PERSON	-RSB- had a most exasperating habit of viciously jerking a fish after he was fairly hooked and during his struggling efforts to resist fatal persuasion boatwards .

		It looked to me like courting failure on the part of the fisherman to indulge in these unnecessary twitches .

		So on one occa - sion when he had a fish hooked and was enlivening the fight by terrific yanks , I said to him , ' What do you jerk him that way for ? '

		With an expression that comprises really all there is of the story , he turned his face to me and said , ' Because he jerked me . '

		What a trivial thing this is to tell , and yet I can not recall anything that illus - trates better the quickness and droUery of his conceits . ''

		What wiU be new to many readers is the fact that
Jefferson	PERSON	was so much of a painter that he gave two exhibitions of his own work -- sixteen pictures at the first , fifty-five at the second -- at the
Fisher Galleries	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, and , what is more , actually sold some of his canvases .

		Con - scious that even a great actor 's fame is of short duration , he longed to create something in this other branch of art that should survive him .

		But perhaps , after all , he rested his hopes of lasting renown most confidentiy on his one con - siderable work of literature , the Autobiography .

		^ Ir .

		Wilson 's loving intimacy with his brother player -LRB- though '' father ' * would perhaps be the better word here -RRB- , as well as his familiarity with the literatiire , especially the biography , of his profession , well qualifies him to produce , as he has produced , a pleasing and worthy portrait of one whom the theatre-goers of
America	LOCATION	, En - gland , and
Australia	LOCATION	will long cherish in fond remembrance .

B. L. Putnam Weale	PERSON	published his pioneer volvune in the field of
Far Eastern	ORGANIZATION	politics .

		This work , entitied `` Manchu and Muscovite , '' comprised an illu - minating , if not altogether novel , exposition of Russian power and policy in the disputed district of
Manchuria	LOCATION	.

		318 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, basis of its accuracy and judiciousness , students of international relations gladly acclaimed Mr.
Weale	PERSON	as one of the most keen-sighted and fair - minded of the many people who write or have written on the affairs of the Orient .

		When , therefore , it was announced several months ago that a larger and in many ways more ambitious work was forthcoming from his pen , those who have a special interest in such subjects looked for its appearance with more than ordinary in - terest .

		It was but fair to expect from such a writer a first-hand discussion of conditions and problems in
Eastern Asia	LOCATION	surpassing in compre - hensiveness , virility , and general excellence , as well as in timeliness , all other treatises of its character as yet available .

		It is pleasant to be assured , after an examination of the two stout volumes just published , that in nearly all essen - tial respects confidence has not been misplaced and favorable anticipation has been at least fairly well justified . ''

		The Re-Shaping of the Far East '' is by no means a perfect work of its kind , but its indisputable merits far outweigh the faidts which even the most captious critic could ascribe to it .

		The task which Mr.
Weale	PERSON	has set himself is a stupendous one .

		It is nothing less than to describe the
Far East	LOCATION	as it had come to be , a century or more ago , under the interplay of peoples and forces native to it ; to trace the in - troduction and growth of foreign , chiefly
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean and American , influences ; and , finally , to estimate the political , commercial , and social effects of these influences , and to forecast certain grave changes which they give promise of bring - ing about in the not remote future .

		This being its purpose , it must be observed before going further that the book suffers to a certain extent from the fact that it was written , and unfortu - nately sent to press , while the Russo-Japanese war was still in progress .

		While engaged in its preparation , Mr.
Weale	PERSON	was laboring under the impression that that conflict would be waged to the bitter end , -- that it would be prolonged indefinitely , until one of the contestants should be compelled to abandon it from sheer exhaustion .

		This misjudgment is not to be imputed to him as evidence of serious disqualification as an observer , for everybody knows that the early conclusion of peace came about in a whoUy unan - ticipated manner , and that many another expert on the field of hostilities held the same opinion .

		But , obviously , a book on the re-shaping of the
Orient	ORGANIZATION	must sacrifice an appreciable measure of value to the reader of to-day by stopping short of the renewal of the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Japanese Alliance , the fijial and complete defeat of the Russians on land and sea , and the negotiation and ratifica - tion of the Peace of
Portsmouth	LOCATION	.

		Events now move so rapidly in the
Far East	LOCATION	that if one were always to await the outcome of situations there it is to be feared that he would never have a chance to write at all ; at the same time , every reader of Mr.
Weale	PERSON	's book , and no doubt the author himself , can not but regret that its pub - lication was not held back a bare six months .

		In fairness it ought to be said that even in the light of conditions now existing the bulk of it would call for comparatively little modifica - tion ; but of course such matters as the future of British influence in the
Orient	ORGANIZATION	, the destiny of
Korea	LOCATION	and
Manchuria	LOCATION	, and the probabili - ties of Russian aggression on the northwest frontier of
China	LOCATION	, could be dealt with in a far more satisfactory fashion now that the war is ended than while its outcome was still proble - matical .

		Taken as a whole , Mr.
Weale	PERSON	's work may be regarded as essentially a '' reading journey '' through the Orient , particularly the regions north of the Yangtsze , with occasional pauses for the introduction of more or less elaborate discussions of important topics .

		Of the dozen or more chapters taken up with a narrative of the hypothetical journey on which the reader is conducted , and with descriptions of people en - countered and places visited , two are devoted to the ascent of the Yangtsze from
Shanghai	LOCATION	to
Hankow	LOCATION	, three to the trip by rail and cart from
Hankow	LOCATION	to Peking , and four to a tour from Peking by way of Tientsin , across the
Gulf of Pechili	ORGANIZATION	, past Chefoo and aroimd the Shantimg coast to the little '' Kaiser-stadt '' of
Tsingtao	ORGANIZATION	, and thence over the German railway to the Shantung capital ,
Chinanfu	LOCATION	.

		Then we are taken to
Japan	LOCATION	for a journey by rail -LRB- one chapter -RRB- from
Nagasaki	LOCATION	to
Tokyo	LOCATION	in war-time .

		Finally , returning to the continent , we find ourselves in
Korea	LOCATION	, and three chapters more carry us from Fusan , in the '' heel of the boot , '' to the '' panto - mime '' capital ,
Seoul	LOCATION	.

		These narrative chap - ters are not consecutive , however , and though as a rule delightfully written and abounding in information , they are manifestly designed mainly to keep up interest , -- in the words of the author , '' to supply the necessary atmosphere . ''

		The reader will hardly agree that the travels recorded in them are '' unimportant , '' as Mr.
Weale	PERSON	mod - estly affirms in his Preface , -- unless , perchance , he is hurried , and dislikes the somewhat discur - sive character which they impart to the book .

		But it is quite possible to omit their story and yet
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 319 get the essential things which the author has to say about Far Eastern conditions and prospects .

		The wealth of material contained in the twenty or more chapters composing the real body of -RSB- VIr .

		Weale 's work defies analysis or even adequate description within brief space .

		The most im - portant topics discussed at length -LRB- aside from historical matters -RRB- are railways as political weapons in the Orient , the foreign dominance in
Peking	LOCATION	, the character of the present Chinese government , the foreign services of
China	LOCATION	, Ger - man operations and ambitions in
China	LOCATION	,
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- Japanese relations , Japanese and non-Japanese interests in
Korea	LOCATION	, the attitude of Oriental governments and peoples toward the late war , Russo-Chinese and Chino-Japanese relations , Franco-Belgian scheming in the
Far East	LOCATION	, the attitude of the
United States	LOCATION	toward Oriental problems , and the re-arming and general rehab - ilitation of
China	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Weale	PERSON	's fundamental conception is that the
Far East	LOCATION	is in a state of unstable equilibrium , and ^ t11 so continue for a long time to come , quite irrespective of the results of the war which was in progress as he wrote , or of any similar future contest which now seems at all possible .

		With unqualified emphasis he repudiates the notion that the defeat of
Russia	LOCATION	will mean that everything will be quiet in the
Far East	LOCATION	for decades to come , without any other work being necessary than that which may be accomplished by the victorious Japanese armies .

		From his point of view , the war which the world has lately followed with so much interest is to be regarded as not in any sense a final struggle over the issues involved , but rather a mere episode , likely to have only temporary effects , and , in one form or another , to be repeated many times before international concord shall become the normal condition in the Orient .

		This may not be an altogether agreeable opinion , but it is one which many carefid students besides Mr.
Weale	PERSON	have been forced to adopt , and on the whole it must be admitted that existing conditions give it good warrant .

		So far as occasions for dispute , rivalry , and open conflict are concerned , the recent war certainly leaves the situation in all essential respects about as bad as before .

		All the old elements remain , -- the same nationali - ties , the same jealotisies , the same suspicions , even the same old pledges concerning the evacu - ation and garrisoning of
Manchuria	LOCATION	.

		The
Far Eastern Question	ORGANIZATION	has lost not a whit of its capac - ity for inducing international friction .

		As Mr.
Weale	PERSON	clearly points out , this unset - tlement of the Orient is an inevitable consequence of the helplessness and inunobility of
China	LOCATION	.

		A condition of permanent amity and stability is to be expected only when
China	LOCATION	shall have become a reaUy modernized nation , able and determined to manage her own affairs without any interposi - tion on the part of foreign powers .

		Obviously this consummation is yet a good way off , though the signs of its approach are now rapidly in - creasing .

		In many respects the most satisfactory portions of Mr.
Weale	PERSON	's book are those which have to do with the great awakening now indis - putably in progress in the empire of the
Celes	PERSON	- tials .

		Particular stress is laid on the efforts at present being made to provide the nation , for the first time in its history , with a thoroughly organized and disciplined army .

		Two years ago the Chinese army nimibered 100,000 men ; to - day it numbers just twice as many ; and when the plans which have lately been determined upon shall have been realized , its fighting strength will be 1,250,000 .

		General YinTchang , who will presently return to Peking from
Berlin	LOCATION	where he has been studying the greatest military machine known to modem times , and who wiU have supreme charge of the upbuilding of the new army , declares that his nation proposes no longer to depend for her territorial integrity upon the good graces of foreign powers , and that it is her firm purpose henceforth to conunand respect by being in a position to enforce it .

		It is the belief of Mr.
Weale	PERSON	that the arming of
China	LOCATION	is to be no mere fiction , but a bitter reality with which other nations will shortly be compelled to reckon .

		On this point he writes as follows : '' During a voyage of at least 2,500 miles through a number of provinces I was careful to pay special atten - tion to the military question and to engage every Chinese officer and man time would permit in conversation .

		I was thus able to convince myself amply of several im - portant things , chief of which is the following : that every Chinese commander and soldier has at last real - ized that rifles and ammunition must be properly kept , that drill must be constant , that discipline must be very strict , and that the art of war must be studied day and night before troops can dare to face modem armies .

		Everywhere I found clean rifles and proper ammuni - tion , suitable uniforms and splendid-looking men housed in good , modem barracks .

		In his
summer	DATE	straw hat and imitation khaki clothing , or in his winter turban of sombre black and tight-fitting timic and loose trousers , the modem Chinese soldier presents a most business - like and resolute appearance , and when a battalion of such fellows click through their drill , the immense g ^ ulf separating them from the former eflFete creatures who , miserably paid and entirely under-fed , masqueraded as serious soldiery , is clearly apparent .

		And whilst the ordinary man all over the world still pictures the Chinese soldier as this effete and worthless coolie , the fact is becoming more and more clear to European military agents in
China	LOCATION	that the Chinaman is not only not effete and worthless but that he is being developed into the 320 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, most formidable soldier on the contment of
Asia	LOCATION	.

		Con - temptuous of death , physically far superior to the Japanese , with an immense pride of race and a quick - ness and an ingenuity which far eclipse that of all other Eastern races , it requires but good leaders and a careful selection from the great masses of men available to evolve regiments , divisions , and army corps , which , conscious of their strength , will defy the best troops of
Europe	LOCATION	...
China	LOCATION	and her swarming millions , who now number nearly ten times the population of
Japan	LOCATION	, is and will be to the Continent of
Asia	LOCATION	what
Russia	LOCATION	is and will be to the Continent of
Europe	LOCATION	.


Russia	LOCATION	has temporarily failed because her imagination -- that im - mense and wonderful imagination -- has been too big for her .


China	LOCATION	has failed often , too , for other reasons .

		But , failures or no failures , considered in its broadest aspect , the Chinese are destined to be one of the three great nationalities of the world . ''

		The operation of foreign influences in
China	LOCATION	is discussed by Mr.
Weale	PERSON	at great length , but , unfortunately , in a spirit so narrow and inhos - pitable that the conclusions at which he arrives are often sadly vitiated by his ill-chosen point of view .

		Mr.
Weale	PERSON	is an Englishman to the core , and he writes with little sympathy for anything that is not English .

		The burden of his book is a lamentation at the recent weakness and ineffi - ciency of English diplomacy in the Orient and a solemn call to firmer policies and bolder meth - ods .

		He coolly assumes that
England	LOCATION	has a pecvdiar mission in the
East	LOCATION	, -- a mission which , sad to relate , she has not recently been fulfilling as she should , but which , none the less , every other power is bound in honor to respect and in no wise hinder .

		On this theory , quite naturally , the Germans , the French , the Belgians , the Russians , and even the Americans , come in for more or less severe castigation .

		The remarkable achievements of the Germans in
Shantung	LOCATION	and the Yangtsze valley form a fascinating chapter in recent Far Eastern history , simply as an ex - ample of daring national enterprise .

		One may not approve of what has been done , but he must at least lament that Mr.
Weale	PERSON	's anti-German proclivities have caused him to lose a splendid opportimity to give the world a full and impre - judiced account of this subject .

		In a similar way , the part which the
United States	LOCATION	has taken in the development of the Orient is very inade - quately presented , if not actually perverted .

		The author plainly proposes to heap ridicide upon American influence and policies in
China	LOCATION	, but the attempt falls rather flat .

		That there have been errors , nobody doubts ; and that American diplomats and consuls in the Far East have not always been what might be desired , everybody admits ; but that the same thing can be said of even the English , is a fact equally obvious .

		So far as subject-matter is concerned , then , Mr.
Weale	PERSON	's book is of very uneven value .

		The portions which are least adequate are as a rule those which deal with the topics of largest im - portance .

		As a record of travel , it is very good indeed ; as a summary of historical develop - ments , it is even better ; but as a presentation of actual existing conditions and problems , it is in places all but an utter failure , -- and owing entirely , as has been suggested , not to the author 's lack of information , but to his prejudice and partisanship .

		The work is distinctly worth while , but it might easily have been made more valuable than it is .

		At the very least , it might have been wi'itten with a little more regard for considerations of style .

		The narrative chapters not infrequently fall into a strain quite a bit more gossipy , even slangy , than is defensible in a book of such solid character .

		The careful reader will often be annoyed by evidences of hasty preparation and inadequate revision .

		The work of the proofreader has likewise been far from perfect .

		There are curious errors in the printing of titles and sub-titles -LRB- as on pages 45 and 334 of Volume I. -RRB- , where of all places one woiUd expect absolute correctness .

		The punctu - ation , too , aboimds in anomalies , for which presumably the author is responsible .

		On the other hand , mention should not fail to be made of the abundant and uniforndy excellent illus - trations with which the book is embellished ; also of the elaborate appendix containing a dozen or more useful documents relating to Far Eastern aifairs since

		Walpole Letters , Old axd New .

		* Mrs.
Paget Toynbee	PERSON	's new edition of Wal - pole 's letters runs to sixteen handsome volumes ; and contains over three thousand letters , about a hundred of which are now printed for the first time .

		Many of the old letters are here given in fuller form than they had in previous editions ; and there is evidence on every hand that the editor has flinched from none of that almost painful assiduity in research and collation which we now exact of all comers .

		On the whole , her text would seem to be more accurate and more nearly intact than any of its predecessors .

		In one respect , however , the editorial method must be said to have been regTcttably arbitrary , not * The Letters of

		321 to say unscrupulous .

		It would not be true to say that Mrs.
Paget Toynbee	PERSON	has bowdlerized
Walpole	LOCATION	.

		One might find ground of quarrel that she attempts no consistent expurgation .

		She has allowed very many passages to stand which are not to be recommended to the young person or easily stomached by the old one who wishes to mend his author to fit his individual sense of propriety .

		Two safe courses woidd seem to be open to the editor of a writer like
Walpole	LOCATION	: to clip , amend , and otherwise pretty frankly manipulate him for '' popular '' use : or to take him as he comes and present him as he was , without fear or favor , without any sort of sense of personal responsibility for him .

		It is qvute clear that in her present attempt to pro- duce something approaching a '' final '' edition of
Walpole	LOCATION	, -- a certainly elaborate edition cal - culated to take its place with some state upon other than '' popular ' * shelves , -- the editor should have taken the latter course .

		As a mat - ter of fact , many passages have been omitted from the earlier letters as '' unfit for publica - tion . ''

		These omissions have all been scru - pulously indicated in the footnotes ; but the reader is left with an uneasy sense of incom - pleteness .

		It woidd certainly be more com - fortable for persons of delicacy if all gifted tongues and pens had from the beginning of things been untainted with double meanings , not to say such frank indecencies as our eight - eenth century letter-writer was capable of .

		One may reasonably contend that a world which we shoidd like to see moral , or proper , does not need to have preserved for it the passing leers and innuendoes of a defrmct man about town .

		But there is a special reason why , since the edition lays claim to authority , most of Mrs.
Paget	PERSON	To -RCB-
Tibee	ORGANIZATION	's omissions must be deplored .

		They occur in the important correspondence with
Horace Mann	PERSON	.

		This cori'espondence Wal - pole himself transcribed with a direct view to its publication .

		He allowed the passages in question to stand , and thus , however mistakenly , gave them his authority .

		The original manu - script still exists , and it is hardly to be doubted that sooner or later the passages in question will take their place in some version which , other things heing equal , will supplant ^
Irs	ORGANIZATION	.


Paget Toynbee	PERSON	's .

		For the moment she may be excus - able in preferring to connect her name with a more presentable
Walpole	LOCATION	: but
Walpole	LOCATION	was not always presentable according to modern stand - ards of propriety , and it is by his personal standard , like that of a Montaigne , a
Pepys	LOCATION	, or a
Rousseau	PERSON	, that we shall in the end wish to judge him .

		We resent the decision of any editor as to what is `` fit for publication . ''

		A certain piquant edge is given to our distrust of the present editor 's judgment by the retention of > ` arious passages in letters from
Walpole	LOCATION	to -- of all conceivable persons -- Miss Hannah More .

		To read with some consecutiveness , let us not say all , but many of these old letters , is to ask oneself wherein their charm lies , what has kept them alive so long .

		Their writer was neither a very noble nor a very amiable character .

		In youth he was everything offensive suggested by the eighteenth century label '' Wit . ''

		He was a popinjay , a fopling , an insincere beau , a blase man about town ; in middle life he remained a superannuated sophomore ; in age even he did not cease to ogle or to sneer .

		He had the con - ceit of a Montaigne or a Pepys without their healthy frdl-blooded joy in being alive .

		He was , in short , by his own laborious testimony , very much an ass .

		Yet he did not err in fancying that he would be remembered and read not un - gratefidly by posterity .

		For better as well as for worse he was that antiquated phenomenon , a Wit .

		Is his esprit artificially cvdtivated under glass ?

		It lives .

		Is his man-of-the-worldliness now become a somewhat discredited exhibit ?

		We still regard it with some attention .

		To the student of eighteenth century society
Walpole	LOCATION	is of course in ^ ` aluable .

		Here is gossip concerning : how many of those notabilities of whom we know something from Pope , from Bos - well , or from
Fanny Bumey	ORGANIZATION	.

		Here are other touches which reveal to us the common point of view , or the fashionable point of view , in con - nection with all sorts of matters , from small-pox to the French Revolution , from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	to Loo .

		Here is gossip of the royalties , properly obscure as to nomenclature , -- hints about the latest court scandals , -- description of the most fashionable routs , of executions at
Tyburn	LOCATION	; here is a slighting allusion to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and quaint mention of
Pepys	PERSON	, not yet made famous through the publication of the Diary , as '' the Secretary of the Admiralty , '' and of
Charlotte Corday	PERSON	as '' the woman who stabbed
Marat	PERSON	. ''

		Here , too , are not a few excellent criticisms of contemporary work , such as this on Mme. D'Arblay 's '' Ca - milla ' : '' I will only reply by a word or two to the question you seem to ask ; how I like ' Ca - milla ' ?

		I do not care to say how little .

		Alas I she has reversed experience , which I have long thought reverses its own utility by coming at the wrons : end of our life when we do not x ^ - ant it .

		This author knew the world and penetrated characters before she had stepped over the thresh - 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, old ; and now she has seen so much of it , she has little or no insight at all : perhaps she appre - hended having seen too much , and kept the bags of foul air that she brought from the Cave of Tempests too closely tied . ''

		This is a plain and summary way of speech , which , with true cour - tesy , he avoids uttering to Dr.
Burney	PERSON	, who makes fond inquiry of him upon the same head .

		And indeed
Walpole	LOCATION	is not so bad as , in his self-conscious youth and prime , he chose to paint himself .

		Steadily he mellows and softens with increasing years ; gradually the mask of cynicism slips away from him ; gradually the hard outline of his self-absorption is modified .

		The last of these volmnes , containing letters written during the decade by which he survived the three score and ten years , are those which come nearest attaching one personally to
Walpole	LOCATION	, by a tie comparable to that which binds one to Gray or
Cowper	PERSON	.

		With all their ancient gallantries and valetudinarian complaints , they ring truer , are pleasanter to re-read , than the artful records of his earlier and sprightlier pen .

		A Commercial , Traveller ix the LiAnd OF PiZARRO .

		* `` The Isthmian Canal and the
West Coast Coun	LOCATION	- tries of
South America	LOCATION	'' is the subject of the very latest volume added to our library of South American travel .

		The author , Mr.
C. M. Pepper	PERSON	, is announced as a '' newspaper man '' and a member of the '' per - manent Pan-American railway committee '' ; he is evidently a traveller of experience , he is a competent observer , and in this fine volume has made skilful and by no means tedious use of the latest available statistics .

		As a result we have an unusual book .

		While the style is that of the `` newspaper man , '' rather cursory and with no pretence to grace , the subject-matter is interesting both for what the author experiences and for the evident sincerity with which he presents his view .

		We have to do with a real traveller , who goes with a purpose , who sees the regions he describes and sees them in an interesting way ; his observations are accurate , and his statistics are no more extended than is essential to the argument .

		Our author sets out to demonstrate the effect which the Isthmian canal is having , and is likely to have , upon the commercial relations of the South American republics .

		The book is really an argument for the speedy construction of the great canal , and the attempt is to show that , once this bit of interoceanic •

Brazil	LOCATION	, forsooth , may still in that day have
Rio Janeiro	LOCATION	and Para , and a few other cities of the eastern coast may still be allowed a place on the map , to carry on dealings with
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	as heretofore ; but the vast bulk of South American commerce must pres - ently flow westward and northward , not from the coast alone of
Chile	LOCATION	and
Peru	LOCATION	, but from Ai-gentina and the Amazons , and from many an unsuspected and unheard-of valley in the
Andes	LOCATION	and the
Cordil	LOCATION	- leras , to
New Orleans	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	, thence to be redistributed , if need be , to the waiting shores of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It must be confessed that Mr.
Pepper	PERSON	, by his energy , enthusiasm , and industiy , has gone far to establish his contention .

		What with shortened sea - routes , the impulse of new enterprise , the activity of the American market , the increasing demand in the
United States	LOCATION	for South American rubber , and above all , the rapid extension of railway service between all the states in question , it does seem as if all things American were presently '' coming our way . ''

		It will surprise most readers , we think , to learn that the great rivers of
South America	LOCATION	, the forks and tributaries of the
Amazon	LOCATION	, are navigable for large steamers to within a few hundred -LRB- actually less than three hundred -RRB- miles of the
Pacific Ocean	LOCATION	I It is as if one could enter the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and sail to the
Humboldt Basin !	LOCATION

		Of course , in the Andes railways may not follow altogether the shortest trails ; but the railway necessary to connect the Peruvian port of Paita with
Bellenista	PERSON	on the
Maranon	LOCATION	, a branch of the
Amazon	LOCATION	, will be only three hundred and ten miles in length , and sixty miles are already in operation .

		From Bellenista to the falls of Monserriche , on the same river , is less than one hundred miles , and there the traveller meets steamers from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	sea - board .

		Over such a situation and such a prospect , the Isthmian canal once built , our traveller grows naturally enthusiastic ; he would reverse the centu - ries , almost the current of the rivers ; the whole tide of Amazonian commerce , with all the untold wealth of the Brazilian forests , shall flow westward to Bal - boa 's sea , and enter the trade channels of the world by the gates of
Panama	LOCATION	.

		But Paita is not the only port of vantage .

		There is
Callao	LOCATION	; only two hundred and twenty-five miles of difficult railway-building is needed to bring
Callao	LOCATION	in touch with the flood-plains of
Brazil	LOCATION	.

		In similar fashion , every South American port on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast is shown to have a prospect and a promise .

		Guayaquil is already the exit of
Ecuador	LOCATION	, with a narrow-guage road already '' creeping '' toward
Quito	LOCATION	.

		This , once arrived , will of course bring westward all the commerce of the little republic .

		Peruvian
Arica	LOCATION	is the port for imprisoned

		aU the products of the wide plains of
Argentina	LOCATION	, soon to be farmed like the prairies of
Iowa	LOCATION	and
Illinois	LOCATION	, must seek an outlet westward along railways even now building , and pour through the capital of
Chile	LOCATION	.

		Such is the argument of the volume .

		Its twenty - two chapters exhibit no arrangement , follow no par - ticular sequence ; the reader may essay any one of them , and find a discussion of some South American problem , -- but always from the isthmian view-point , and everj ' chapter closes in a reference to the great canal .

		But because we have to deal with commerce and trade , it must by no means be inferred that we have time for nothing else .

		Our traveller is a traveller , and he takes the reader along comfortably , and has often time to stop and show him the exquisite beauty of some sheltered Andean valley , or the glittering summits of eternal snow where these limit some Peruvian or Bolivian landscape .

		With him , we listen to rushing mountain torrents or cross the almost im - passable mountain deserts .

		Sometimes he takes us with him to visit his friends , and we catch pleasant glimpses of the cosmopolitan social life that domi - nates the far-off southern capitals .

		Betimes socio - logical problems come to view .

		We walk among the * ` cholos , '' we see the hard conditions of the poor in
Valparaiso	LOCATION	, -- no vale of paradise , alas I for thou - sands of its people .

		Again , we watch the formal processions of the church , or hear of the conduct of elections , where open fraud determines the event with a completeness that would make our most ex - pert political manipulator faint for astonishment .

		But for all the order and disorder of our South American neighbors , a better day is dawning .

		They are doing great things for themselves .

		Long ener - vated by too easily acquired wealth , the sale of their natural resources , they now look forward to per - manent social and political relations and to stable industries .

		For a prime stimulus to effort , and for a perpetual determinant in all the future weal of millions of South American people , intelligent men in ever \ ' South American republic now look to the completion of the
Panama	LOCATION	canal .

		The book before us will be of value to every American who would keep in touch with our own commercial development ; nor less does it deserve a place in the alcove devoted to books of travel .

		It is well-printed , and has many interesting half-tone illustrations .

		The maps , while helpful , are not as good by any means as the subject deserves .

		They appear to be copies , in some cases at least , and the names they bear are not infrequentiy illegible .

		The
Basis of Christiaxtty	ORGANIZATION	.

		* The motive ' of Professor
Pfleiderer	ORGANIZATION	's book on '' Christian Origins '' is best described in his own words : '' The viewpoint from which the origin of Christianity is herein described is pvrdy historical .

		... It lies in the nature of things that such a porely historical description of the ori - gin of our religion will differ vastly and in many ways from the traditional Church presentation .

		Hence , this book has not been written for snch readers as feel satisfied by the tra - ditional chorch-f ^ th .

		It may hnrt t ^ eir feelings eanly , and confnse them in their convictions ; I wonld feel sorry for that , becanse I cherish a respect for every honest faith .

		But I know that in all classes and circles of society to-day there are many men and women who have entirely ontgrown the tra - ditional church-faith and who are possessed of an urgent desire to learn what is to be thought , from the standpoint of modem science , concerning the origin of this faith and con - cerning the eternal and temporal in it .

		To go out toward snch truth-teekers is a dnty which the trained representative of science dare not shirk . ''

		The work is condensed and devoid of technicalities , and has been rendered into excellent English , Its author is a distinguished and highly competent scholar , who has devoted many years to the subject .

		So far as any discussion of such intricate and obscure matters can be said to have authority .

		Dr.
Pfleiderer	ORGANIZATION	's book may be admitted to possess that attribute .

		It will come as a revelation to many whose ideas have been completely muddled by the combination of ignorant and evasive teaching current to-day , and the prediction may be ventured that it will do much more , in the long run , to fortify religion than to de - stroy it .

		It is impossible to give any useful summary in this place .

		It may suffice to record the feeling that just as evolution , properly understood , is a far grander idea than that of arbitrary creation , so the beginnings of Christianity ' , in their true histori - cal setting , loom up in such a way as to make the orthodox account almost colorless by comparison .

		Such a statement will seem to many persons extrava - gant in the highest degree , if they have never tried to understand the historical point of view ; but it is hard to beb ` eve that they can come to a complete appreciation of the latter without acknowledging the truth of the former .

		If this is the case , such work as Dr.
Pfleiderer	ORGANIZATION	's rescues for us the most precious heritage of mankind , which is in danger of being dis - carded because a stupid and intellectually dishonest generation will not separate it from the obsolete elements with which it has been mixed .

		Daily and hourly , people are abandoning religious ideals or the young are failing to acquire them , because they are accompanied by tenets which can not stand the test of criticism .

		These do not know , and there are few to tell them , that the story of Jesus means more , not less , than it did before , since it is the story of what man has done and been , not of the arbitrary and unconditioned acts of a god .

		Scanty as are the authentic details concerning the life and work of • Chkistian Obigiss .

		324 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, Jesus , his teachings have come down through the ages , in spite of misunderstanding and misrepresentation .

		Shorn of recognizably spurious elements , they shine out more clearly than ever before , and one might well think they have now a chance to be accepted at their face-value .

		Are they thereby robbed of that mystery which religion demands ?

		Yes , in one sense ; but no , in another and better one ; for in them we find the greatest of all mysteries , the aspiration of the human soul to God .

		Dr.
Pfleiderer	PERSON	takes the trouble to remark , in his preface , that no historical writer considers himself infallible , and least of all one who deals with such difficult problems as those of early Christianity .

		In spite of this , he shows more assurance in treating some of the knotty points than the facts possibly warrant .

		There is perhaps no harm in this , if the reader remembers the prefatory caution ; but in deal - ing with the resurrection story in particular , there seems to be a tendency to explain things away too completely .

		Thus : '' For the sake of this popular need of concrete proofs , the narrator did not avoid the contradiction that the resurrected body displayed its earthly materiality by the touching and the eating , while , on the other hand , his sudden appearance , disappearance and ascension to heaven proved its supermun - dane , ethereal nature ... For historical investigators , such contradictions are imerring signs that they are dealing , not with tradition based on any kind of recollection , not with naive legend , but with a secondary form of legend , influenced by apologetic considerations '' -LRB- p. 231 -RRB- .

		Now why are they unerring signs of the kind indi - cated ?

		I have re-read the whole account with a mind as open as possible , and I must say that the impression it leaves is simply this : that Jesus sur - vived the cross , and that things occurred very much as narrated , -- except , of course , the ascension , which , it will be noted , breaks abruptly into an otherwise logical narrative .

		One would certainly hesitate to insist upon this or any other special interpretation ; but it seems at least probable that the story is based on more than apologetic fabrications and subjective hallucinations .

		In dealing with
Peter	PERSON	's answer to Jesus on the road to
Caesarea	LOCATION	, `` Thou art the Christ , '' Dr.
Pfleiderer	PERSON	remarks : '' But this circumstance , that the scene of
Caesarea	LOCATION	contra - dicts the other presupposition of the gospels so crassly , is a strong proof in favor of the historic character of
Peter	PERSON	's answer ; the distinct statement of time and place is also in its favor . ''

		Why not apply the same argument to the resurrec - tion story ?

		Professor Foster 's book on '' The Finality of the Christian Religion '' is a much larger and more elab - orate work , intended for professional theologians rather than for the general public .

		A second vol - ume , increasingly constructive in character , is prom - ised in the near future .

		In many respects , this work is what might result from a combination of
Sabatier	PERSON	's `` Religions of Authority and the Religion of the Spirit '' and
Pfleiderer	ORGANIZATION	's volume just noticed , -- not , of course , without much else of an illuminating and interesting nature .

		The author explains that the book was written before that of
Sabatier	PERSON	appeared ; .

		while as for the portion dealing with the history of Christianity , it is admittedly a compilation , princi - pally from
Wernle	PERSON	and Bousset .

		The author , in his preface , thus explains his attitude : '' The book is a mirror of the development of the author 's own experience -- a development , moreover , which has not yet come to a close ; a fact which is also mirrored in the book .

		He believes that a multitude of thoughtful men and women are passing through an experience similar to his own ; and that a greater multitude will travel , with bleeding feet , the same via dolorosa to-morrow and the day after .

		It is a pathetic and tragic , or inspiring and illuminating , spectacle , according as one looks at it .

		Be that as it may , to all such the author offers himself as a fellow-pilgrim , not without some hope that they may be a little less lonely for his com - radeship , a little less bewUdered for his guidance , and a little less sorrowful and discouraged for his own joy and hope .

		At all events , he has said what he sees , as was his duty , in a straightforward way , obedient to
Robert Browning	PERSON	's advice : ' Preach your truth ; then let it work . ' ''

		As a perfectly honest and courageous presentation of Christianity , in the light of the most recent infor - mation as to physical facts , and the most earnest thought as to spiritual matters .

		Professor Foster 's volume can not fail to have a great and beneficial influence .

		If it is not in any sense unique , but is rather a sign of the times , its significance is thereby increased more than diminished .

		It has naturally been criticized by those of the old school , and prob - ably no one regrets more than the author the mental sufEering it is likely to occasion ; but no one sees more clearly than he does that all this is necessary and inevitable , for the sake of religion itself .

		Indeed ^ it would ill befit a follower of Christ , of all people , to be afraid of new truth .

		From the standpoint of a layman , I must confess that the book seems to me too much elaborated in many places .

		The individual sentences are clear , but arguments are carried so far , and fortified by such a multitude of considerations , that one is in danger at times of losing sight of the point .

		The style is much more like that which we are prone to regard as '' made in
Germany	LOCATION	'' than that of Dr ''
Pfleiderer	ORGANIZATION	's book , which did really come from thence .

		For my own use , I have underlined in red a large number of the most significant paragraphs and sen - tences , and I find this a distinct help ; perhaps in another edition italics might serve the same purpose .

		THE DIAL 325 Recext English Poetry .

		* When Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	puhlished the first sec - tion of '' The Dynasts , '' he warned his public that the rest of the work might never see the light .

		Ap - parently , the reception given to that experimental publication has been of an encouraging nature , for we now have the second section of this colossal and deeply-moving work , and may reasonably hope for the third section needed in order to complete it .

		The six acts and forty-three scenes of the instalment here given us begin just before the battle of .

		Jena and end with
Napoleon	PERSON	's crushing defeat in the
Peninsula	LOCATION	.

		Wagram and
Walcheren	PERSON	are intermediate episodes , and an element of quasi-private interest is provided by the scenes which lead to the divorce of .

		Josephine and the subsequent Austrian marriage .

		As before , we have again the rapid shifting of action , the pano - ramic stage-setting , and the supernatural apparatus that proved so bewilderingly impressive when we first made their acquaintance .

		The author thinks nothing of a jump from
Coruiia	LOCATION	to
Vienna	LOCATION	, or of a scene that requires us to take in at one glance both
Ijondon	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	, and the intervening leagues of land and sea .

		Nor does he hesitate , when human speech seems inadequate , to invoke the hosts of '' phantom intelligences '' created by his cosmic imagination , and to record theu - comment -- pitiful , sinister , and ironic -- upon the actions of the human puppets whose antics they view from their serene point of vantage .

		It is to the utterances of these ethereal beings that we must look for whatever of poetry there may be found in this dramatic pageant .

		The unfortunate Walcheren expedition inspires the finest poetical outburst of any length to be found within the volume .

		It is the following
Chorus of Pities	ORGANIZATION	, which we are to take as echoing the plaint of the stricken English soldiery , and to think of as sung to aerial music : '' We who withstood the blasting blaze of war When marshalled by the gallant
Moore	PERSON	awhile , Beheld the grazing death-bolt with a smile , Closed combat edge to edge and bore to bore , Now rot upon this Isle I • The Dynasts .

		The ever wan morass , the dnne , the blear Sandweed , and tepid pool , and putrid smell .

		Emaciate purpose to a fractions fear , Beckon the body to its last low cell -- A chink no chart will tell . ''

		O ancient
Delta	ORGANIZATION	, where the f en-lighta flit !

		Ignoble sediment of loftier lands , Thy humour clings about our hearts and hands And solves us to its softness , till we sit As we were part of it . ''

		Such force as fever leaves is maddened now , With tidings trickling in from day to day Of others ' difEering fortunes , wording how They yield their lives to baulk a tyrant 's sway -- Yielded not vainly , they ! ''

		In champaign green and purple , far and near , In town and thorpe where quiet spire-cocks turn .

		Through vales , by rocks , beside the brooding bum Echoes the aggressor 's arrogant career , And we bent pithless here ! ''

		Here , where each creeping day the creeping file Draws past with shouldered comrades score on score .

		Bearing them to their lightless last asile .

		Where weary wave-wails from the clammy shore Will reach their ears no more . ''

		We might have fought , and had we died , died well , Even if in dynasts ' discords not our own ; Our death-spot some sad haunter might have shown .

		Some tongue have asked our sires or sons to tell The tale of how we fell . ''

		But such bechanced not .

		Like the mist we fade .

		No lustrous lines engrave in story we .

		Our country 's chiefs , for their own fames afraid .

		Will leave our names and fates by this pale sea To perish silently ! ''

		To this chorus the Spirit of the Years replies : '' Why must ye echo as mechanic mimes These mortal minions ' bootless cadences , Played on the stops of their anatomy As is the mewling music on the strings Of yonder ship-masts by the unweeting wind .

		Or the frail tune upon this withering sedge That holds its papery blades against the gale ?

		-- Men pass to dark corruption , at the best .

		Ere I can count five score : these why not now ?

		-- `` The Immanent Shaper builds Its beings so Whether ye sigh their sighs with them or no I '' And for a stage direction , to close the scene , we read that '' the night fog enwraps the isle and the dying English army . ''

		This is a grim sort of poetry , but its impressiveness is unquestionable .

		The concep - tion of the Immanent Shaper here illustrated is the metaphysical basis of IVIr .

		Hardy 's drama .

		It is a conception that sometimes employs the language of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, `` So doth the Will objectify itself , '' and suggests , now the mood of
Lucretius	PERSON	, now that of the poet of `` Vastness , '' but without the note of passionate faith that relieves the despair of that out - cry .

		It appears over and over again .

		The Spirit Ironic thus disposes of the defeat of
Prussia	LOCATION	and the grief of Queen Louise : '' So the Will plays at flux and reflux still .

		This monarchy , one-half whose pedestal Is built of Polish bones , has bones home-made !

		Let the fair woman bear it .


Poland	LOCATION	did . ''

		326 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, The tragedy of the Spanish expedition is thus fore - shadowed by the Spirit of the Years : `` So the Will heaves through Space , and moulds the times , With mortals for Its fingers !

		We shall see Again men 's passions , virtues , visions , crimes , Obey resistlessly The purposive , unmotived , dominant Thing Which sways in brooding dark their wayfaring ! ''

		The Spirit of the Pities thus comments upon the distraught mind of the King of England : '' The tears that lie about this plightful scene Of heavy travail in a suffering soul , Mocked with the forms and feints of royalty While scarified by briery Circumstance , Might drive Compassion past her patiency To hold that some mean , monstrous ironism Had built this mistimed fabric of the Spheres To watch the throbbings of its captive lives , -LRB- The which may Truth forfend -RRB- and not thy said Unmaliced , unimpassioned , nescient Will I '' And the same subject evokes this interchange : SPIRIT OF THE PITIES . ''

		Something within me aches to pray To some
Great Heart	ORGANIZATION	, to take away This evil day , this evil day !

		CHOBUS IBOKIC . ''

		Ha-ha !

		That 's good .

		He '11 pray to It : -- But where does Its compassion sit ?

		Yea , where abides the heart of It ? ''

		Is it where sky - fires flame and flit .

		Or solar craters spew and spit , Or ultra-stellar night-webs knit ? ''

		What is Its shape ?

		Man 's counterfeit ?

		That turns in some far sphere unlit The Wheel which drives the Infinite ?

		SPHUT OF THE PITIES . ''

		Mock on , mock on !

		Yet I '11 go pray To some Great Heart , who haply may Charm mortal miseries away ! ''

		It requires a superhuman degree of fortitude to ac - cept this view of the mystery of life , yet no other seems vouchsafed to the inquiring eye of our poet , and he makes us feel , while under the spell of his imaginative vision , as if all others were but tricks of our self-delusion .

		To descend from great matters to small , we must mention that a wrong accentuation of the name Rom ^ nofP has spoiled several verses of the drama .

		Although '' The Dynasts '' is written largely in prose , and although what verse it contains is of a rugged and uncompromising character , the work seems to us to contain more of the essential stuff of poetry than may be found in all the smoothly-flowing measures of `` Nero , '' the latest dramatic poem of Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	, at least , has `` wrought in a sad sincerity , '' however faulty his expression ; while artifice and rhetoric seem to be the chief ingredients of the work of the younger poet .

		The decline from '' Paolo and Francesca '' and '' Ulysses '' is discouragingly marked .

		The nearest approach to a purple patch is the following page , in which Nero 's imagination pictures a conflagration which shall consume the world : '' Nay , while I live !

		The sight !

		A burning world !

		And to be dead and miss it I There 's an end Of all satiety : such fire imagine !

		Born in some obscure alley of the poor Then leaping to embrace a splendid street .

		Palaces , temples , morsels that but whet Her appetite : the eating of huge forests : Then with redoubled fury rushing high , Smacking her lips over a continent .

		And licking old civilizations up !

		Then in tremendous battle fire and sea Joined : and the ending of the mighty sea : Then heaven in conflagration , stars like cinders Falling in tempest : then the reeling poles Crash : and the smouldering firmament subsides .

		And last , this universe a single flame . ''

		In reading this , one is all the time conscious of the workman , and can almost see him as he pieces the composition bit by bit , until he thinks he has said enough .

		A comparison of this passage with the clos - ing scene of Mr.
Moody	PERSON	's `` Masque of Judgment '' would afford an instructive illustration of the differ - ence between mechanical artifice and imaginative vision . ''

		Nero '' is in four acts , beginning with the secret murder of
Claudius	PERSON	, and ending with the burn - ing of the city .

		The chief element of artistic unity is provided by the character of Agrippina : her ambi - tion makes Nero emperor ; her own murder avenges that crime ; and the crime of the son is in a measure avenged by the remorse that gnaws his consciousness thereafter .

		Aside from this , the trait of Nero most emphasized is that of his artistic dilettanteism , which is the key to the author 's treatment of his character .

		Mr.
John Payne	PERSON	is widely known as the founder of the VUlon Society and as the translator of Villon and of the Arabian Nights .

		He is perhaps less widely known as the translator of
Boccaccio	PERSON	and Bandello , of Omar and
Hafiz	PERSON	, and of many miscella - neous Arabic tales .

		These translations , numbering twenty-seven volumes , have been the main occupa - tion of his life , and have , to a certain extent , ob - scured his original work .

		But no lover of what is noblest in English poetry can afford to neglect his five volumes of verse , or the new matter that accom - panies the
Villon Society	ORGANIZATION	reprint of that verse in two quarto volumes .

		American readers should , then , be deeply gratefid to Mr. and Mrs.
Tracy Robinson	PERSON	for their labor of love in editing for the American public the '' Selections from the Poetry of
John Payne	PERSON	, '' which is now published in a single substan - tial volume , and which is supplied with an extremely interesting study of his work as a whole .

		Mr.
Payne	PERSON	has never been a popular poet , and possibly never will become one , but he long ago won .

		the suffrages of the elect , and the praise of such men as
Arnold	LOCATION	, Home ,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Browning	PERSON	,

		A prodigious scholar , an accomplished musician , a lover of children and animals , a thorough technician , and an indefatigable worker , he has raised to himself a literary monu - ment that will not easily be overthrown .

		Of the
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 327 poems included in the present selection , the ballads are perhaps the most striking , but their length and closely-knit texture preclude our making use of them for purposes of illustration .

		The beautiful poem called '' Shadow-SouL '' although a long one , is more amenable to the extractive process , and yields such stanzas as these : ' * Bnt over me a charm is cast , A spell of flowers and fate and fire ; Thy hands stretch out through wastes more vast .

		Thy dreams from deeper deeps aspire : Life throbs around me , like a blast That sweeps the courses of a lyre . '' ''

		By times , too .

		as I walk alone , The mists roll up before my eyes And unto me strange lights are shown And many a dream of sapphire skies ; The world and all its cares are gone ; I walk awhile in Paradise . '' ''

		Haply , one day these songs of mine Some world-worn mortal shall console With savour of the bitter wine Of t `` ar8 crushed out from a man 's dole ; And he shall say , tears in his eyne , There iros great lore in this man 's soul I '' The poet 's preoccupation with music is here chiefly illustrated in a lovely poem inspired by
Gluck	PERSON	's '' Armide , '' and in a copy of dedicatory verses to
Richard Wagner	PERSON	. '

		* O strong sweet soid .

		whose life is as a mountain .

		Hymned round about with stress of spirit-choirs , Whose mighty song leaps sunward like a fountain .

		Reaching for lightnings from celestial fires , -- '' O burning heart and tender , highest , mildest , Xightingale-throated , with the eagle 's wing , -- This sheaf of songs , culled where the ways are wildest And the shade deepest , to thy feet I bring .

		** Thine is the Future -- hardly theirs the Present , The flowerless days that put forth leaf and die -- Theirs that lie steeped in idle days and pleasant .

		Letting the pageant of the years pass by . ''

		For the days hasten when shall all adore thee , All at thy
spring	DATE	shall drink and know it sweet ; All the false temples shall fall down before thee .

		Ay , and the false gods crumble at thy feet . ''

		Then shall men set thee in their holy places , Hymn thee with anthems of remembering ; Faiths shall
spring	DATE	up and blossom in thy traces .

		Thick as the violets cluster round the Sprii ^ . ''

		The poem which includes these stanzas is dated
1872	DATE	, which shows it to be the product of an inde - pendent and far-seeing judgment .

		The echo of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Mater Triumphalis '' is obvious , but that makes the verses none the less significant .

		Of the score or more of sonnets here given , we must quote one of the four inscribed to the Indian Savior of mankind .

		The one preceding has asked the question : '' Is there no sage of all we turn unto Will guide us to the guerdon of our strife ?

		^ And the answer is thus g ^ ven : '' Yes , there is one : for the sad sons of man , That languish in the deserts , travail-worn .

		Five times five hundred years ago was bom Under those Orient skies , from whence began All light , a saviour from the triple ban Of birth and life and death renewed forlorn .

		How what is best is ceasii ^ from the light And putting off life 's raiment of duress .

		And tanght it to the weary race of men . ''

		Of the influences that have shaped the development of this poet , we are thus told by the editors : '' The poets to whom he acknowledges an actual debt are , first of all , the singer -- and ' Whose radiant brow is crowned With triple coronals ineffable .

		Attesting the assay of heaven and hell , ' ' The glad master standing with one foot On euth and one foot in the Faerv land . '

Andrew Lang	PERSON	, following the famous example of Bottom , takes care to explain that things are not always what they seem in his `` New Collected Rh -RCB- - mes . ''

		and that his '' Loyal Lyrics '' in praise of the Stuart cause * ' must not be understood as implying a rebellious desire for the subversion of the present illustrious dynasty . ''

		On Any Beach '' is perhaps the best . ''

		For , in the stream and stress of things That breaks around us like the sea , There comes to Peasants and to Kings The solemn Hour of Jubilee ; If they , till strenuous Nature give Some fifty harvests , chance to live ! ''

		Ah , Fifty harvests !

		But the com Is grown beside the barren main , Is salt with sea-spray , blown and borne Across the green unvintaged plain ; And life , lived out for fifty years , Is briny with the spray of tears ! ''

		Ah , such is Life , to us that live Here , in the twilight of the Gods , Who weigh each gift the world can give .

		And sigh and murmur .

		What 's the odds So long 's you 're happy ?

		Nay , what Man Finds Happiness since Time began ? ''

		Mr.
Herbert	PERSON	's ' • Poems of the Seen and the Un - seen '' proclaim the author a Wordsworthian , not merely by their frequent use of quotations from
Wordsworth	PERSON	, but also by the spirit in which they approach the shrine of nature . ''

		Anima Alauda '' may illustrate this point . ''

		A heaven of light doth compass round , In prayer , the laverock-soul ; Outsoaring , in her song , the ground , -- Upswinging tow ` rds her Goal ; '' Until the world , a blending mist , Hath melted from her eyes ; And all above , like amethyst , There gleam the unchanging skies . ''

		In another aspect , Mr.
Herbert	PERSON	's verse has aflfinities with the utterance of the transcendentalists and the mystics , a quality revealed in his paraphrases from
Platen	LOCATION	and Rtlckert , as well as by echoes of philoso - phers from
Plato to Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	.

		The following irre - gular sonnet is peculiarly typical of his mode of thought and expression : '' The mind of Man reflects the Universe : No cosmic law , no rule of the great Pan , But in that mind its being doth rehearse : If aU was made , then all was made for Man .

		Witness the words of one , who scarce had known Their deep , oracular truth , -- for he would rise .

		From gross and palpable things , to thought 's high throne : God doth eternally geometrize .

		Could Plato dream , how point , and line , and curve , -- All forms of thought , and modes of the ideal , -- Would prove to be embodied in the real : Of
Faraday	DATE	's force-centres ;
Newton	ORGANIZATION	's law Of mass unswayed , that wiU nor halt nor swerve ; And pathways of the stars , which
Kepler	PERSON	saw ? ''

		These poems make up for their deficiency in musical utterance by the earnestness of their aspiration and the compactness of their thought .

		Mr.
Rickett	PERSON	's '' Poems of Love and Nature '' are fairly commonplace in thought , but occasionally arrest the attention by a bit of rhapsodical outburst or startling imagery . ''

		Discord !

		and Death !

		and Dust !

		Rot !

		and devouring Rust !

		From the lover 's heart a god shall start , But devils are bom of lust . ''

		This author does better when , as in '' The Sea , '' he adopts a more quiet diction . ''

		The sorrow of the mighty sea Murmurs in its immensity , And for its one long , sounding grief Eternity has no relief Nor word for all the rock-white pain .

		But out , far out , upon the main The troubled sapphire of its breast Sinks to a silence without rest . ''

		Blue synabol of an active power That stirs the passive Earth to flower !

		The gentle , passive Earth a bride Who blossoms answer to the tide : And down the hills , along the plains .

		Love pours back through her river-veins .

		Till from the kisses of the sea In time she bears humanity . ''

		A slender volume containing '' The Last Poems of
Richard Watson Dixon	PERSON	'' comes to us under the editorial supervision of Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	, and with a preface by
Miss M. E. Coleridge	PERSON	.

		Canon
Dixon	PERSON	was a poet of sincerity and thoughtfulness , whose work won the suffrage of the elect , particularly in the case of his terza rima narrative `` Mano , '' which no less a critic than Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	called a `` triumphant success . ''

		There are less than two - score pages in this final sheaf of song , and more than half of them are occupied by `` Too Much Friendship , '' a miniature epic having for its hero an Athenian whose fortunes -LRB- or misfortunes -RRB- suggest those of both
King Candaules	LOCATION	and Job .

		Our quota - tion shall be '' The Earth Planet , '' which is remark - able for its compact and vivid imagination . ''

		Thou fliest far , thou fliest far , Companion of each circling star , But yet thou dost but fill thy year : Thy orbit mayst thou not forsake .

		The path in space which thou dost make , Till death shall touch thy charmed sphere . ''

		Half turning to the weary blaze Which measures out thy countless days , Half bathing in the depths of night , Thou urgest thy unfaltering speed .

		As if thou wouldst of force be freed : But still thou art the slave of light . ''

		Or moved or fixed in vacancy Thy pitying sisters gaze on thee .

		Where'er be sped thy wondrous race : Nigher to thee they may not come ; Their eyes weep light , their lips are dumb ;
Time	ORGANIZATION	is their lord , their prison space . ''

		Thy lord is Time ; to imitate Eternity , yet bring thy date : Space holds thee ; but seems infinite .

		But what of them ?

		Thy mystery Or shared or not by them with thee .

		Lies in thy breast -- thy parasite .

		329 '' Art thou alone the planet .

		Earth , That gives to being that new birth Of which the womb is care and pain ?

		Lives man alone in that thick space Which through thin space doth hugely race , A clot that swims the immeasured main ? ''

		Who answers ?

		Not the instruments .

		To pierce all space which he invents .

		And to untwist each ray that beats From the fire-fountain of these things And those remote sparks , whose wings Win flame from nature 's other seats . '' ''

		Love 's Testament '' is a sonnet-sequence of sixty - six numbers , the work of -RSB- Mr.
G. Constant Lounsberj	PERSON	' .

		There are eleven groups of six sonnets each , classified under the captions of love , absence , passion , doubt , philosophy , content , separation , solitude , reconcilia - tion , jealousy , and retrospect .

		We select an example from the sixth group . ''

		Petal by petal , the sweet hours are shed , The seasons pass , the old leaves fall away Stained with the scarlet of the wounded day .

		The ancient year bows down his whitened head .

		Oh love , with stealthy feet and hurried tread
Time	ORGANIZATION	urges all things on and waits his prey , Nor shall our t `` ar8 prevent , our prayers gainsay .

		The hour that adds us to its buried dead . ''

		Oh mortal loveliness , immortal change , While memory whispers us this prophecy , That the sweet lingering past shall ever be A sweeter future , while our hearts exchange The new-bom pleasure of familiar love .

		Whose wings are folded , like a nesting dove . ''

		After all the tenderness and rapture of the preced - ing sonnets , we must confess to considerable disap - pointment at the cynical conclusion of the whole matter , which counsels us to '' Count not upon a woman , '' to '' trust her not , '' nor lend her '' The holy , tranquil , steadfast name of friend . ''

		Nevertheless , there is much excellent poetry in Mr.
Loimsbery	PERSON	's volume .

		A weak dilution of Job and Omar , of Lucretius and
Dante	PERSON	, of MUton and
Tennyson	PERSON	, of all the poets who have pondered over the mysteries of life and death , of sorrow and sin , of the soul and its Maker , is offered us in • • The Tree of Knowledge , '' a se - quence of one hundred and fifty-three sonnets .

		A fair example is the following : '' He look 'd without , and saw the rolling seas , The heav ` ns alit with stars , the earth with flowers ; He heard the wail of winds when tempest lowers , The gentle sighing of the
summer	DATE	breeze .

		The nightingale that sang his love to please .

		And on a day the mountain belch 'd forth flame ,
Earth	LOCATION	shook for fear , and all this solid frame Seem 'd to dissolve , and he along with these .

		He look 'd within -- and there he found a world .

		Where storms as fierce arose as those which hnrl 'd The waves on high and laid the forest low -- Tides of desire and hate , restless as those That give the other ocean no repose , Red flames of love and wrath , redder than lightning 's glow . ''

		The lyrics of the late '' Ethna Carbery '' -LRB- Mrs.
Macmanus	PERSON	-RRB- are collected into a small but precious volmne by Mr.
Seumas Macmanus	PERSON	, who contributes a brief and touching introduction .

		These Celtic songs are if anything more Celtic than those of the other Irish poets with whom their author is grouped .

		Their characteristic imager -RCB- - , their wistful sentiment , and their haimting melody are tj-pically illustrated in the stanzas '' I-BreasiL '' '' There is a way I am fain to go -- To the mystical land where all are young , Where the silver branches have bnds of snow , And every leaf is a singing tongue . ''

		It lies beyond the
night	TIME	and day , Over shadowy hill , and moorland wide .

		And whoso enters casts care away .

		And wistful longings unsatisfied . ''

		There are sweet white women , a radiant throng , Swaying like flowers in a scented wind : But between us the veil of earth is strong .

		And my eyes to their luring eyes are blind . ''

		A blossom of fire is each beauteous bird .

		Scarlet and gold on melodious wings .

		And never so hannting a strain was heard From royal harp in the
Hall of Kings	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The sacred trees stand in rainbow dew ,
Apple	ORGANIZATION	^ id ash and the twisted thorn .

		Quicken and holly and dusky yew .

		Ancient ere ever gray Time was bom . ''

		The oak spreads mighty beneath the sun In a wonderful dazzle of moonlight green -- O would I might hasten from tasks undone .

		And journey , whither no grief hath been I '' Were I past the mountains of opal flame , I would seek a conch of the king-fern brown , And when from its seed glad slumber came , A flock of rare dreams would flutter down . '

		• But I move without in an endless fret .

		While somewhere beyond earth 's brink , afar , For ^ tten of men .

		in a rose-rim set , I-Breasil shines like a beckoning star . '' ''

		The Three Resurrections and the Triumph of Maeve '' is the title of a new volimie of poems by Miss
Eva Gore-Booth	PERSON	.

		The first part of the title is accounted for by the three pieces that open the vol - ume , poems upon the themes of
Lazarus	LOCATION	,
Alcestis	LOCATION	, and Psyche .

		The second part of the title stands for a romance in dramatic form that fills the latter half of the volume .

		Miss Gure-Booth is a very thoughtful poet , who avoids affected diction , and combines depth with simplicity .

		The following exquisite stanzas on '' Poverty '' will illustrate her workmanship : '' One swallow dared not trust the idle dream That called her South through fading skies and gray .

		One spirit feared to follow the wild gleam That drives the soul forth on her starlit way . '

		* As the starved swallow on the frozen wold Lies dying , with her swift wings stiff and furled , So does the soul grow colder and more cold .

		In the dark
winter	DATE	of this starless world . ''

		Poorer than slaves of any vain ideal .

		These are the saddest of all living things -- Souls that have dreamed the Unseen LigLt unreal .

		And birds without the courage of their wings . ''

		These poems are filled with the sense of wonder , of the myster -RCB- ' beneath the surface of things , of the unrealities which alone are truly real .

		This is voiced in the words of Alcestis returned from the g ^ ave. 330 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, '' * Fear not ,
Admetos	PERSON	, the long road ' -- she said -- Led me through wind and fire , made pure by these , I bring no deadly vapours from the dead , No dreadful grave dust clings about my knees . '' '

		How shouldst thou , hearing but the last harsh sigh Of the poor noisy flesh , dream of the smile , Of the unheard , invisible ecstasy , Lo , I have lived in light a little while ! ' ''

		This is the burden of '' Beyond , '' which comes nearer to being a sound argument for immortality than all the labored efforts of the theologian . ''

		Because the world 's soul looks me through and through From every breaking wave and wild bird 's wing , I trust my own soul , knowing to be true .

		Full many a worn-out old discrowned thing . ''

		Because of those unearthly fires that shine Beyond Duneira of the sunset waves , I know that life is deathless and divine , And dead men 's souls rest never in their graves . ''

		Because of twilight over miles of green And one small fishing vessel sailing far Pn through the torment of wild winds unseen I steer my little boat by a great star . ''

		Because the rose is sweeter after rain , Because fierce lightning strengthens the weak sod , I know life flares behind the golden grain , And ecstasy beyond the thought of God . ''

		Of '' The Trimnph of
Maeve	ORGANIZATION	, '' which fills two-thirds of this volume , we have no space to speak , beyond saying that it is a very beautiful poem , wrought in grave and subtle melodies , and filled with the haunt - ing spirit of Celtic mysticism .

		Briefs on New Books .

		Problems of ^ ^ '
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	's new book ''
Irish Ireland	LOCATION	and History and the Irish Question '' -LRB- Mc - the Irish .

		Clure-Phillips Co. -RRB- is the latest addi - tion to the large and increasing stock of literature dealing with the Irish situation .

		It consists of a brief review of the history of
Ireland	LOCATION	from the earliest times to the present , and is prefaced by a discussion of the natural resources of the island and the race traits and characteristics of the Irish people .

		It is the saddest of aU histories , says the author , being a record of seven centuries of strife between races , bloodshed , mis-government , civil war , oppression and misery .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	reaffirms the view expressed in his little book on '' Irish History and Irish Charac - ter , '' published forty years ago , that most of the woes of
Ireland	LOCATION	have been due to natural circumstances and historical accident , quite as much as to the crimes and follies of her rulers .

		Nature 's fatal mistake , he maintains , was in peopling
England	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	with different and uncongenial races .

		The Papacy , by inciting the Irish to rebellion , brought upon them no small portion of their sufferings .

		English protec - tionism must also bear a part of the blame .

		Never - theless , the Liberal party did its best for
Ireland	LOCATION	; and had the Irish members of Parliament done what they should have done , more rapid progress might have been made .

		As it was ,
Ireland	LOCATION	shared the great measures of Parliamentary and municipal reform which she probably would not have achieved by her - self .

		She received the blessing of national and un - sectarian education a generation before
England	LOCATION	did , and but for the attitude of the Irish priesthood would have received it in full measure .

		Concerning present grievances , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	points out that
Ireland	LOCATION	has more than her share of representation in Par - liament , that she has no established Church , that if her priesthood would permit it she might have a complete system of national education , that her land - law is more favorable to the tenant than that of either
England	LOCATION	or
Scotland	LOCATION	, that she receives subventions from the imperial treasury in aid of her land tenants which neither those of
England	LOCATION	nor
Scotland	LOCATION	receive , that the markets of the Empire are open to her and so are its offices , and that so long as the Irish people will abstain from outrage and murder they will enjoy the personal privileges of British freemen .

		Regard - ing the alleged grievance of Castle government , he points out that its abolition was offered to
Ireland	LOCATION	long ago and by her was rejected .

		If granted inde - pendence , she would have to assume many burdens and responsibilities now borne by the Empire , in - cluding military and naval defense .

		A general repudiation of rent would follow , and with it the extinction of the landed gentry .

		The establishment of a stable democracy among a people whose political training has been agitation against government and law , would be an arduous if not an impossible un - dertaking .

		In the opinion of Mr.
Smith	PERSON	, the choice lies between separation and legislative union .


Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eration along provincial lines he pronounces pre - posterous .

		A larger measure of local self-government , however , might be conceded without an abandonment of principle , and would doubtless do much to improve the situation .

		^_^ _ ^ _____ ^ _ New edition of ^ ^ ^ Swinbume 's '' Tragedies '' are
Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	's now published by Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	dramatic ivorks .

		&
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	in a five-volume edition , uniform with the six-volume edition of the `` Poems '' which appeared more than a year ago .

		The entire poetical product of the greatest of living poets is thus made available in this collected form .

		We hope that some day we may have the prose writings to put be - side them .

		Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	does not revise his work ; as far as our examination has gone , it has shown no changes whatever from the original texts .

		The first of these volumes gives us '' The Queen Mother '' and ''
Rosamond	PERSON	, '' the next three are devoted to the
Mary Stuart	PERSON	trilogy , and the fifth includes the four later dramas , '' Locrine , '' '' The Sisters , '' ''
Marino Faliero	PERSON	, '' and ``
Rosamund	PERSON	, Queen of the Lombards . ''

		At the close of the trilogy we have -LRB- very appropri - ately -RRB- reprinted the poet 's `` Encyclopaedia
Britan	LOCATION	- nica '' essay on ``
Mary Stuart	PERSON	, '' and his note on '' The Character of the Queen of Scots . ''

		The nine dramas which this edition includes , together with '' Atalanta in Calydon '' and `` Erechtheus '' -LRB- clas - sified with the '' Poems '' -RRB- constitute one of the most
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 331 impressive achievements of English literature in the nineteenth century , an achievement which sends us back to Elizabethan times for a parallel , just as we must go back to Chaucer for a parallel to `` The Earthly Paradise '' of
William Morris	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is hardly necessary to say -LRB- although '' Locrine '' was once per - formed in
London	LOCATION	-RRB- that these are not acting plays -LRB- except for the purposes of the stage of antiquity -RRB- , but they constitute a perennial source of deep and noble pleasure for all lovers of poetry .

		Their highest level is reached in ''
Mary Stuart	PERSON	'' and in ''
Marino Faliero	PERSON	, '' the one being an almost faultless example of grave restrained diction , the other of fervid poetic eloquence .

		Concerning the value of the Tragedies as compared with that of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's lyrical work , critical opinion has differed greatly . ''

		I have been told , '' says the author , `` by reviewers of note and position that a single one of them is worth all my lyric and otherwise undramatic achievements or attempts : and I have been told on equal or similar authority that whatever I may be in any other field , as a dramatist I am demonstrably nothing . ''

		No wonder that he has found this conflict of judgments both '' diverting and curious . ''

		But such a question does not reaUy need to be decided at all , for , which - ever of these grand divisions of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's work makes the stronger appeal to us , we may none the less be devoutly thankful that he has given us the other also .

		The second volume of Mr.
Elroy McKendree Avery	PERSON	's `` History of the United States '' has recently ap - peared , together with the announcement that the publishers , Messrs.
Burrows Brothers & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, have decided to increase the number of volumes in the finished product from twelve to fifteen .

		A publica - tion 80 unmistakably popular in character , and yet so thorough-going in its breadth of treatment and accuracy of statement , can not fail to influence general opinions and at the same time to win the good-will of historical scholars ; therefore we welcome every in - dication of detailed labor .

		As in the first volume , the illustrations are an attractive and commendable feature , while the index to them , occurring in the front part of the book , is decidedly instructive .

		This index is very much more than a mere list of maps , autographs , and documents in facsimile ; rather might it be called a series of descriptive notices , giving , in most instances , the history and present whereabouts of its subjects .

		It is followed by a brief account of seventeenth-century chronology , the introductory value of which is much appreciated in a work of this sort .

		The Appendix is made up of two distinct parts -- the one statistical , the other bibliographical .

		The former contains the names , not only of the early colo - nial governors , but also of the Mayflower passengers , gfTouped in a somewhat more convenient order than in
Bradford	LOCATION	; the latter is a chapter bibliography , deserv - ing of very favorable comment .

		It is complete even to the inclusion of works yet in press , and , above all , it is critical .

		The body of the text brings our history down to 1660 , and , since the arrangement of material A meritorious history of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		is strictly chronological , an excellent opportunity is afforded for seeing the colonies develop side by side .

		The discriminating use of authorities is very evident , comparison and collocation being with our author a favorite method of procedure .

		Nevertheless , for each group of facts he has invariably one main source of information , upon which he draws with scrupulous exactness .

		Thus , for
Maryland	LOCATION	there is
Brantly	PERSON	's chapter in
Winsor	LOCATION	; for
Virginia	LOCATION	, the works of Alexan - der
Brown	PERSON	; for
Rhode Island	LOCATION	,
Richman	PERSON	; and for
New York	LOCATION	,
Wilson	PERSON	's '' Memorial History . ''

		In spite of a few trivial errors in matters of date and the like , this second volume is in the highest degree satisfactory .

		It contains the very latest theories respecting such subjects as the introduction of women and of negroes into
Virginia	LOCATION	, and is especially happy in its correct interpretation of the territorial grant of
1606	DATE	.

		We regret , however , that more attention has not been paid to the economic motives influencing the concession of religious liberty .

		It is true , there is reference to the matter , but it is only rncidentaL We await with interest the third volume of this meritorious history .

		Styaiige pranks ^ '
Camille Flammarion	PERSON	, as is well - played by known , is especially attracted by sub - hghtniny .

		jects that are fanciful or capricious .

		His recent book entitled '' Thunder and Lightning '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	, & ,
Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- offers a fine illustration of this peculiarity of his mind .

		Instead of being a scientific treatise on the phenomena of atmospheric electricity , it is almost exclusively a collection of nar - ratives of the strange pranks which lightning plays .

		A majority of the stories are devoted to freaks of lightning in various parts of
France	LOCATION	; they are there - fore not lacking in color .

		But after all reasonable allowances have been made for the excited condition of those who witnessed the results of the lightning strokes , and for their usual lack of scientific train - ing , the residuum of fact is sufiiciently astonishing .

		Several instances are related where lightning has destroyed the clothing without doing any serious harm to the wearer of it ; for the shoes of its victims it appears to have a special antipathy , usually tear - ing them to pieces even when the destruction of the rest of the clothing is incomplete .

		Occasionally its effects are beneficial to the person struck , as when it restores sight to the blind , hearing to the deaf , and speech to the dumb ; paralysis is cured at times by a lightning stroke , at other times it is caused by the same means .

		Animals are generally more sus - ceptible to death by lightning than men : sheep are killed while the shepherd is spared ; the ploughman 's horses are killed while he escapes .

		The reader is apt to wonder whether some of the stories may not be pure fabrications , sent to the author in a spirit of pleasantry , as the following : '' During a storm which took place in the month of
August , 1901	DATE	, lightning entered by a half-open door into a stable where there were twenty cows , and killed ten .

		Beginning with that which was nearest the door , the second was spared , the third killed , the fourth was uninjured , and so on .

		All the uneven numbers were killed 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, the others were not even burned .

		The shepherd , who was in the stable at the time of the shock , got up unhurt .

		The lightning did not burn the building , although the stable was full of straw . ''

		One who will read carefully the hundreds of accounts collected by the industry of the author , and then attempt to form a theory as to the laws which govern the behavior of atmospheric electricity , will find himself in com - plete agreement with the closing sentence of the book : '' Decidedly , we have much to learn in this as well as in all the other branches of knowledge . ''

		Eleven famous Dr.
Beverly Warner	ORGANIZATION	's `` Famous In - to the plays troductions to bhakespeare s Flays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is another infringement of the self-denying ordinance that con - scientious publishers and editors should enact , -- never to duplicate , without necessity , good work already in the field .

		Of the eleven introductions printed in this book , six were included in -RSB- Mr.
Nichol Smith	PERSON	's `` Eighteenth Century Essays on Shake - speare , '' which was reviewed in these columns two years ago .

		They are the prefaces to the editions of
Rowe	PERSON	, Pope ,
Theobald	PERSON	,
Hanmer	PERSON	,
Warburton	PERSON	, and
Johnson	PERSON	.

		To them Dr.
Warner	PERSON	has added the intro - ductions to the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	and to the editions of
Stevens	PERSON	,
Capell	LOCATION	,
Reed	ORGANIZATION	, and
Malone	PERSON	.

		He nowhere alludes to Mr.
Nichol Smith	PERSON	's volume , the editorial matter of which would have been of service to him .

		For example , he regards
Rowe	PERSON	's
Life of Shake	ORGANIZATION	- speare `` as the most important of all contributions to Shakespearean literature , next to the plays printed from the lost manuscripts which Heminge and Con - dell included in their Folio '' ; yet the version of it which he prints is Pope 's mutilated one , as a refer - ence to Mr.
Smith	PERSON	's volume would have shown .

		His own editorial matter is not of great value , and there is no index .

		The English , too , is not always irre - proachable .

		The introductions themselves are of a curious historical interest , they indicate so clearly the source of the best modern theories of editing , and they reveal so entertainingly the internecine rivalries of eighteenth-century criticism .

		The art of slaying one 's adversary in the manner of
Warburton	PERSON	and Pope is , perhaps happUy , lost ; but its extinction has done much to eclipse the gayety of nations .


Warburton	PERSON	's castigation of
Theobald	ORGANIZATION	can never lose its charm : `` What he read , he could transcribe ; but as to what he thought , if he ever did think , he could ill express , so he read on , and by that means got a character of learning , without risquing to every observer the imputation of wanting a better talent . ''

		In the light of the best modern views on the staging of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, one reads with some amusement
Malone	PERSON	's complacent remark : `` All the stage direc - tions , throughout this work , I have considered as wholly in my power , and have regulated them in the best manner I could .

		The reader will also , I think , be pleased to find the place in which every scene is supposed to pass , precisely ascertained . ''

		It would perhaps have been well if he had not done his work so thoroughly .

		Life and letters of Though the ordinary manual of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- an unfortunate glish history has much to say of the Italian princess , `` glorious revolution '' of
1688	DATE	, it pays but scant attention to the Italian princess whose coming to
England	LOCATION	was one of the chief causes of that event .

		There can be no doubt that the marriage of the
Duke of York	ORGANIZATION	to
Mary Beatrice	PERSON	of
Modena	LOCATION	had much to do with the positive stand that he took on religious questions when he ascended the throne as James II .

		Mr.
Martin Haile	PERSON	has recently published a study of the life and times of this unfortunate princess in a volume entitled '' Queen Mary of
Modena	LOCATION	, her Life and Letters '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The work is largely a collection of source materials , gathered principally from the Queen 's own letters , but also from diplo - matic correspondence and reports .

		Many of the extracts given are both interesting and valuable ; but the author has also included a great deal of informa - tion that is relatively unimportant .

		As a history , the volume has decided value in two respects : it shows us the more attractive side of the Restoration court , and it disposes of a nmnber of problems con - nected with the Jacobite movements of the Orange -
Stuart	PERSON	period .

		At the court of
Charles II.	LOCATION	, the sur - roundings and behavior of the young
Duchess Mary	ORGANIZATION	were in striking contrast to those that prevailed about her . ''

		Not her beauty alone , but the candour , grace and goodness which accompanied it , captivated the people . ''

		After the exile in
1688	DATE	,
Queen Mary	ORGANIZATION	was the moving force in nearly all the Jacobite plots and conspiracies against the '' usurpers '' in
England	LOCATION	, both before and after the death of James II .

		Had it not been for the stubbornness of her selfish friend ,
Louis XIV.	PERSON	, it seems that the Queen 's plans would have succeeded in the end .

		While clearly in sym - pathy with his subject , Mr.
Haile	PERSON	writes in a calm , temperate manner , and has produced a readable biography .

		The volume is provided with a number of excellent illustrations , portraits of members of the
Stuart	PERSON	and
Modenese	PERSON	families , and of distinguished contemporaries .

		The book is written throughout with the fluent ease of a scholar who carries in memory the outline of Greek history , and has pondered fruit - fully on its most significant movements .

		Professor
Shuckburgh	PERSON	published a summary `` History of the Greek People '' about five years ago ; and some of the present volume 's contents are apparently worked over from that .

		On p. 17 , `` Hellenic '' should evidently be '' Homeric '' ; '' dreaming '' -LRB- p. 215 -RRB- is allowed to stand for '' claiming , '' or , better , `` asserting '' ; the death of Euripides -LRB- p. 154 -RRB- is put two years too lat `` ; in a passage -LRB- p. 146 -RRB- recounting the splendors of Athenian art under
Pericles	LOCATION	, it is as surprising to find the
Parthenon	LOCATION	dismissed with a single allusion as it is to see the Venus of Melos assigned to this period .

		Plato 's name , too , might weU have been included in the list -LRB- p. 264 -RRB- of eminent literary visitors to Sicilian courts .

		There are several other minor slips which detract from the pleasant impression made by the book as a whole .

		The numerous illustrations are excellent reproduc - tions of some of the best specimens of Hellenic art .

		There is always an interest attaching ThememMrtof ^ q t ^ g account of a great movement an abolition ist ... ■ , - ir by one who was himself a part of it , even though the account may be partial and preju - diced : the personal element is present to g ^ ive life , and life is worth more than minute historical ac - curacy .

		The book of ^ Ir .


John F. Hume	PERSON	, '' The Abolitionists , together with Personal Memoirs of the Struggle for Human Rights , 1830-1864 '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , is of this class .

		The author was reared in an aboli - tionist family in
Ohio	LOCATION	; in his youth he saw the workings of the Underground Railroad , and as lawyer and editor in
St. Louis	LOCATION	at the outbreak of the Civil War he was a vigorous worker for the abolitionist cause .

		Naturally , he retains the point of view of the abolitionists and the outspoken cer - tainty that the abolitionists were right and all others wrong .

		The book was called out by the slighting references to the abolitionists made by President
Roosevelt	PERSON	in his life of
Benton	LOCATION	, written twenty years ago , and is a vigorous statement of the part that they played in bringing on the Civil War and the aboli - tion of slaverj ' .

		An interesting aspect of the book is the evidence it gives that the old abolitionist hostility to
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	has not yet given way to the unbounded admiration for him that now generally prevails .

		The author considers him as by no means the all-important factor in the national life of his day .

		AnEnglieh Jx is evidently a firmly rooted con - Germany'i viction of Mr.
O. Eltzbacher	PERSON	that his development .

		country .

		Great
Britain	LOCATION	, by no means makes the most of her potential utilities .


Germany	LOCATION	, on the other hand , with far less natural endowment , has adopted a political and economic policy so prac - tical and far-sighted that her development , especially since
Bismarck	PERSON	's time , has been nothing short of phenomenal .

		Mr.
Eltzbacher	PERSON	's aim in writing his book on ' `` Modern
Germany	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is to con - sider , primarily , this policy , together with its results in
Grermany	LOCATION	; and , secondarily , to study
Great Britain	LOCATION	's national problems in the light of Ger - man experience .

		He takes , as his point of departure , the distinction between EngUsh individualism on the one hand and German governmentalism on the other , and recognizes that a weU-balanced union of these forces produces national success .

		In many directions , he believes , can
Great Britain	LOCATION	turn to
Grermany	LOCATION	for instruction : in the organization of her army ; in the conducting of her agriculture and agricultural education ; in the management of her canals and railroads ; and in her economic policy of protection .

		The facts Mr.
Eltzbacher	PERSON	gives about
Germany	LOCATION	are interesting , and are substantiated by statistics ; but one is tempted to take issue with him when he disparages , almost to the point of vindio - tiveness , his home government .

		His statements here would carry more weight were they less extravagant , -- notably in the comparison between the railroad systems of the two countries .

		The general reader can scarcely fail to be interested in the chapters on
Grermany	ORGANIZATION	's expansion , its world policy , its attitude toward
Russia	LOCATION	, and the rise of the Social Democratic party ; for these subjects are vigorously and vividly described by one who is evidently conversant with them . ''

		Modern Grermany '' is both instructive and opportune .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
James Harvey Robinson	PERSON	's valuable source - book for students of the mediaeval and modem ages , hitherto published in two volumes , is now abridged into one .

		These '' Readings in European History '' are selected with wide knowledge of the field , and nice judg - ment of the needs of youthful learners .

		The value of a narrative manual is at least doubled by the collateral use of such a work as this .

		Messrs.
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers . ''

		Elson 's
Music Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	, '' edited by Mr.
Louis C. Elson	PERSON	, and published by the
Oliver Ditson Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is a volume of moderate size and extreme usefulness .

		The definitions are generally brief , and there are great num - bers of them , including the most modem expressions in German , French , Italian , and English .

		Particular at - tention is paid to the work of indicating pronunciation , a much-needed matter .

		We can cordially commend this book to students and teachers alike .

		A series of lectures by Dr.
Melville Bigelow	PERSON	, dehv - ered on various occasions before the
Boston University Law School	ORGANIZATION	as a '' part of the plan of legal extension now on foot there , '' now appear in a volume with the title `` Centralization and the Law '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The main lines of thought centre around the ideas -LRB- 1 -RRB- of
Equafity	LOCATION	, which , according to the author , was formerly the dominant legal force in American life ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- of
Inequafity	LOCATION	, which is characteristic of present con - ditions ; and -LRB- 3 -RRB- of
Administration	ORGANIZATION	, which is the supreme end of legal , and , in fact , of all education intended to fit men for the practical affairs of life .

		Specifically , the more important subjects discussed are the extension of legal education , the nature of law , monopoly , the scien - tific aspects of law , and government regulation of raVl - wav rates .

		EDWDf BrBRTTT
SMITH	PERSON	.

		The death of
Edwin Burritt Smith	PERSON	, on the ninth of this month , was the loss of an aggressive force exerted for many years in the cause of civic morality and politi - cal righteousness .

		In the former field , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	was one of the small band of earnest men who , through the agency of the Municipal Voters ' League , have wrought a transformation in the city government of
Chicago	LOCATION	that has made this city the cynosure and working model of municipal reformers throughout the country .

		In the latter and larger field , his activities were chiefly enlisted in the struggle for civil service reform , in the war against pri \ - ilege as exemplified by the unholy protective system , and in the effort to check the national madness of imperialism .

		As head and front of the crusade con - ducted -LRB- not as fruitlessly as many may now imagine -RRB- by the Anti-Imperialist League , his splendid services in behalf of the principles to which
America	LOCATION	owes all its greatness are not likely to be forgotten , and will be better appreciated fifty years from now than they are at present .

		He was a practical idealist in the best sense , never deluded by idle visions , never wasting his energies upon schemes that leave human nature out of their reckoning , but ever battling with all his might for con - crete reforms , and accomplishing no little in the direction of their realization .

		He was a man of the most absolute intellectual integrity , incapable of making any compro - mise with evil , a single-hearted man , simple and direct in his methods , a plain blunt man whose sincerity nobody dreamed of questioning .

		His faith was rooted in the reasonableness of democracy , and in the words of Lincoln and
Lowell	PERSON	he found his highest inspiration .

		Men of his type are none too common , and there are few Americans living who could not have been better spared .

		The descendant of pioneer stock , Mr.
Smith	PERSON	was bom in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	in
1854	DATE	; , spent his early years on an
Illi	PERSON	- nois farm , became successively a school-teacher and a law-student , and finally settled in
Chicago	LOCATION	for the prac - tice of his profession , in which he rose to merited dis - tinction .

		He was a ready and forceftil speaker and writer , and was an occasional but always welcome con - tributor to The
Diax	ORGANIZATION	.

		Until a year or so ago
Air	ORGANIZATION	.


Smith	PERSON	was the embodiment of physical and intellectual vigor ; then he became the victim of the insidious disease to which , after a wearying struggle , he at last suc - cumbed .

		Those of us who loved him know well how poorer the world is for his loss and how richer for the example of his life .

		THIS volume is an extremely suggestive contribution to the litera - ture of Immortality .

		It deals in a large way with two propositions : 1 .

		Thought is a function of the brain .

		2 .

		The soul of man is immortal .

		Its aim is to show that these propositions are not mutually destruc - tive , as many have supposed them , but mutually corroborative ; that the thoroughly established truth of the former carries in itself assur - ance of the latter .

		Incidentally to its purpose , the correspondence is an admirable review in general of the attitude of modem science in its endeavor to interpret the universe , and particularly in its outlook upon the immortality theory .

HENRIK IBSEN	PERSON	.

		Full of years and honors ,
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	died on the twenty-third of
May	DATE	, ending a career of impressive example and memorable achievement .

		Bom in poverty , struggling until long past his prime for the bare means of decent livelihood , and writing in an obscure tongue of which cul - ture takes small account , he so imited native genius with single-souled intensity of purpose that his message reached the farthest comers of the ci ^ ^ lized earth , and all mankind is made grave by the news of his death .

		Yet '' nothing is here for tears , '' even in this hour of bereave - ment , for we feel that his task was rounded out to completeness , and that he has not been called upon before his time to pay the debt that nature inevitably demands of each and every one of us .

		He had , moreover , the satisfaction that comes from the consciousness of world-wide influence , and the assurance that ere his own torch was extinguished many others had been kindled from its flame . ''

		As he willed , he worked , And , as he worked , he wanted not , be snre , Triumph his whole life through , submitting work To work 's right judges , never to the wrong , To competency , not ineptitude . ''

		The dying nineteenth century bequeathed to its successor a scant half dozen writers of the first rank , and to this small company Ibsen unquestionably belonged .

		But the fact of his greatness , although now generally recognized by those whose verdict is decisive in such mat - ters , has only recently emerged from the welter of a controversy as fierce and as protracted as that which , diiring substantially the same period , obscured the epoch-making achievements of
Darwin	PERSON	and of
Wagner	PERSON	.

		It was in the sixties that Ibsen created '' Brand '' and '' Peer Gynt , '' the masterpieces upon which his literary fame must chiefly rest , but it was not vmtil the eighties that his work came to be generally known , and his name widely familiar , outside of the Scan - dinavian countries .

		And when the name found its way into the larger world , it brought with it not peace but a sword , for it belonged to a man whose convictions were not shaped by conven - 352 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, tion , who made no concessions to sentiment , whose analysis of ideas was radical , and whose diagnosis of the conditions of modern life was far from flattering to complacency and self - esteem .

		So the ideas of this man , and the dra - matic pieces which embodied them , had to fight their way by slow degrees , for they found arrayed against them all the forces of philistinism , and all the prejudices of a society given over to materialism , and self-satisfaction , and comfort - able compromise .

		To such a society the message of this un - compromising idealist came like a cold blast from the north ; it was too bracing for weak - ened natures , too tonic for enervated consti - tutions .

		Its fundamental note was that of passionate indignation , and most of those who heard it coidd not see in modern society any particular cause for indignation .

		It had for its overtones spiritual rapture and a sublime faith in himian regeneration , but the hearing of its auditors was deaf to these harmonic elements . ''

		Soon the jeers grew : ' Cold hater of his kind , A sea-cave suits him , not the vulgar hearth ! ' ''

		Thus there came into existence what we have called '' the Ibsen legend , '' a congeries of fanciful notions as far as possible removed from the truth , but a convenient defence against this persistent unveiler of hypocrisies , this doughty knight-errant of absolute truth and absolute righteousness .

		According to the legend ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is an ugly realist in his artistic method , a cold analyst de - void of human sympathies , a cynical contemner of mankind , and a pessimist of the deepest dye .

		This arraignment , grotesque as it is to the care - ful reader of what
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	has written , has been most effectively brought against him , has proved convincing to the generality of careless ob - servers , and , although it has - now lost much of its force , still needs to be met by the emphatic denial of those who have seen beneath the sur - face of the great dramatist 's teaching , and are grateful for its ethical uplift .

		Those who have taken
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	to their hearts know him to be keenly sensitive to the beauty of artistic ex - pression , know him to be quivering with tender sympathies , know him to have an abiding faith in humanity and in the essential worth of life .

		He has , it is true , laid bare many plague-spots of our civilization , but merely as a disagreeable necessity , and solely for the purpose of hasten - ing that fairer future day in which his faith has remained invincible .

		Just forty years ago ,
Ibsen	PERSON	wrote these words : '' It ^ not for a care-free existence I am fighting , but for the possibility of devoting myself to the task which I believe and know has been laid upon me by God -- the work which seems to me more important and needful in
Norway	LOCATION	than any other , that of arousing the nation and lead - ing it to think great thoughts . ''

		The man who had completed '' Brand '' only a few months before mightwellexpresshimself in these proudly self-confident terms .

		Yet with all his conscious - ness of power , he could hardly have imagined the extent of the influence that would be his in the coming years -- that it would lead , not
Norway	LOCATION	alone , but the wide world on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	, to '' think great thoughts , '' and to hold his name in grateful memory forever .

		THOREAU A ND H IS CRITICS .

		Probably no writer in
America	LOCATION	can lay claim to a sounder foundation for fame than
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		He has earned every inch of the way he has gained .

		There has been no boom for him .

		He has had few helping hands , and has had to contend against a singular combination of misunderstanding , lack of appreciation , ignorance , and , in one case at least , of misrepresentation that is said to have been inspired by personal prejudice .

		It is amusing , and occasionally startling , to observe the infinite variety of criticism that has been stirred up by
Thoreau	PERSON	's life and works .

		Many writers , for example , are agreed in describing his temperament as ascetic .


Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, however , is not alone in holding the opposite view . ''

		He was not ascetic , '' says
Stevenson	PERSON	-LRB- `` Familiar Studies '' -RRB- , '' rather an Epicurean of the nobler sort . ''

		Professor
Nichols	PERSON	, in his little work on Anerican Literature , apparently is satisfied with middle ground , when he applies to Thoreau the classification , '' lethargic , self - complacently defiant , too nearly a stoico-epicurean adiaphorist to discompose himself in party or even in national strifes . ''

		Nearly all the critics are agi'eed that
Thoreau	PERSON	was a humorist , though they are by no means agreed as to the quality of his humor .

		Another school , headed by
Lowell	LOCATION	, is quite certain that he possessed no humor whatever .

		One writer speaks of him as '' repellent , cold , and unamiable , '' while another declares that `` in all social relations he was guided by a fine instinct of courtesy , '' and
Emerson	PERSON	, who knew him nearly as well as anybody ever did , says that '' he was really fond of sympathy '' ; a highly appreciative essayist speaks of the '' fine resonant quality of his emotional side , '' and finds that he was '' always thoroughly kindly and sympathetic . ''

		`` Thoreau is dry , priggish , and selfish , '' again announces
Stevenson	PERSON	, in one of his most oracular moods ; and a writer in the '' Chiu * ch Quarterly Re - view '' says that he was '' thoroughly selfish , quite
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 353 out of sympathy with men and their sufferings , bar - baric if not animal in his tastes , and needlessly profane . ''

		On the other hand , Mr.
John Weiss	PERSON	, who was a fellow-collegian with
Thoreau	PERSON	and has written an essay dealing almost entirely with his personality , takes a somewhat different view when he says that '' no writer to-day is more religious '' ; and according to Mr.
William Kennedy Sloane	PERSON	, '' the influence of his rugged energy , his fine idealism , the purity and honesty and manliness of his life , shall for genera - tions breathe through the literature and the life of
America	LOCATION	like a strengthening breeze , ''
Emerson	PERSON	, in the familiar biographical sketch prefaced to the `` Excursions , '' after paying a loving tribute to his departed friend , sums up his life as a practical failure : '' Instead of engineering for aU
America	LOCATION	, he was the captain of a huckleberry-party .

		Pounding beans is good to the end of poimding empires one of these days ; but if , at the end of years , it is still beans ! ''

		Mr.
Sloane	PERSON	, however , at once applies the antidote : '' He excites envy by his success .

		His life is a rebuke which is felt and resented '' ; and Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	backs this up in his '' Short Studies , '' when he says , ' • It is common to speak of his life as a failure , but to me it seems , with all its drawbacks , to have been a great and eminent success . ''

		A writer in the '' Knickerbocker Magazine '' re - garded
Thoreau	PERSON	as a `` rural humbug '' ; whereas
Emerson	PERSON	has conferred upon him the degree of
Bachelor of Nature	ORGANIZATION	, and ISIr .

		Torrey has elevated him to that of Master of the Art of Living .

		One school woidd have him a '' skulker , '' '' imperfect , unfinished , inaiiistic , parochial , '' '' a mixture of misanthropy and self-conceit '' ; while others have said that he was '' sinceritj ^ itself , and might fortify the convictions of prophets in the ethical laws by his holy living . ''

		He is often called a '' thrifty Yankee , '' yet the same '' Knickerbocker '' reviewer is of the opinion that ''
Walden	PERSON	'' is `` a book needed where the philosophy of thrift is too prevalent . '' ''

		He attempts no flights , '' says one . ''

		For the moment
Thoreau	PERSON	soars the em - pyrean with eagle sweep , '' says another .

		Again , it was said by a reviewer writing in
1891	DATE	, that '' upon the whole , there seems to be no reason for concluding that
Thoreau	PERSON	can maintain his present prominence among American writers , or that his place in litera - ture , if permanent , will be a high one . ''

		In opposi - tion to this , we have the prophecy of many , as indicated by Mr.
Sanborn	PERSON	, that
Thoreau	PERSON	is likely to occupy a higher place in American literature than
Emerson	LOCATION	himself . ''

		He lived some time by the sea , '' writes another , '' and often visited its shore ; yet , so far as we may judge from his writings , he was not much affected by the wondrous beauty and majesty of old ocean . ''

		To offset this is '' Cape Cod '' with its now famous descriptions of old ocean , quoted by such a discriminating artist as
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	; and also the confession of Thoreau himself , who admits that the ocean was , after aU , a bigger and a more inspiring thing than even his beloved Concord and
Lincoln Pond	LOCATION	.

		The same delightful variety of criticism extends , more impersonally , to
Thoreau	LOCATION	's books . ''

		Cape Cod , '' for example , is ' * dry reading , '' according to Mr.
Sloane	PERSON	.

		A reviewer in ''
Frazer	PERSON	's Magazine , '' however , finds it `` a curious and valuable work . ''

		`` The volume on
Cape Cod	LOCATION	is deliberately formless in style , '' is the judgment of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's sympathetic biographer , Mr.
H. S. Salt	PERSON	. ''

		Of all his books , ' Cape Cod ' has the most finished and sustained style , '' is the somewhat contrary view of 3Ir .

		Weiss . ''

		He inflicts his full quantity -LSB- of dulness -RSB- in such books as '
Cape Cod	LOCATION	, ' or ' The Yankee in
Canada	LOCATION	, ' '' sol - emnly declares
Stevenson	PERSON	; whereas Mr.
Weiss	PERSON	observes that `` the pages of ` Cape Cod ' bear the reader along without conscious effort , '' and others are equally certain that it is the most human , con - nected , and interesting of all of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's writingps .

		One writer , however , insists that the book is '' juice - less , uninspired , perishable , a third-rate work , '' -- an opinion that is not corroborated by a reviewer in the contemporaneous '' Dial , '' who prescribes the volume as a cure for the blues .

		In speaking of ''
Walden	PERSON	, '' one critic observes that very few will be able to read the book a second time .

		Mr.
Higginson	PERSON	thinks it is '' one of the few books in all literature that may be read with pleasure once a year . ''

		Of those opinions of Thoreau which have evidently been based on insufficient information , the most in - complete , unsatisfactory , inadequate , though possibly the cleverest and most brilliant , is that of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	.

		He has presumed to reveal Tho - reau 's character and opinions fortified only by a perusal of the published letters , of `` Walden , '' of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's biographical sketch , and by a scrutiny of a badly executed wood-cut .

		He thinks he sees a rude nobility , like that of a barbarian king , in the imshaken confidence which
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	has in himself , and in his indifference to the wants , thoughts , or sufferings of others ; and he quotes , as illustrating this point , '' If ever I did any good in their -LSB- men 's -RSB- sense , of course it M ^ as something exceptional and insignificant com - pared ynXh .

		the good or evil I am constantly doing by being what I am '' But in what respect does this show indifference to the wants , thoughts , or suf - ferings of others ?

		To indulge in a little paradox on our own account , right here lies the very unsel - fishness of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's selfishness .

		The poet-naturalist , as he was constituted , was better able to help his fellow-man by living his own life as perfectly as pos - sible than by mere commonplace acts of charity . ''

		Walden '' was the foundation for
Stevenson	PERSON	's screed ; yet it is plain that the pages on '' Philan - thropy '' must have been skipped , for there
Thoreau	PERSON	says , '' I would not subtract anything from the praise that is due to philanthropy , but merely demand jus - tice for all who by their lives and works are a blessing to mankind . ''

		It appears that after
Stevenson	PERSON	had published his little essay in the `` Cornhill Magazine , '' it met the eye of
Thoreau 's Scotch	ORGANIZATION	disciple .

		Dr.
A. H.	PERSON	354 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, Japp ; and the latter gentleman immediately took the reviewer to task .

		Therefore , when the essay was presented in book form in the collection entitled ^ ' Familiar Studies of Men and Books , ''
Stevenson	PERSON	wrote his `` preface by way of criticism , '' in which he is kind enough to retract a number of the harsh things he had said about the poet-naturalist , attri - buting them to a `` too earnest reflection on imper - fect facts . ''

		The preface is highly entertaining , and shows with what unerring aim two
Scotchmen	PERSON	, shooting at long range , can miss the bull 's - eye of fact , and the circumadjacent rings of easily de - duced inference .

		After this illumination from Dr.
Japp	PERSON	,
Stevenson	PERSON	learns that if
Thoreau	LOCATION	were content to dwell on
Walden Pond	LOCATION	it was not merely with designs of self-improvement , but in order to serve mankind in the highest sense . ''

		Hither -LSB- to
Walden	PERSON	-RSB- came the fleeing slave ; thence was he despatched along the road to freedom .

		That shanty in the woods was a station in the great Underground Railroad . ''

		Of course we all know how the underground railroad story originated , -- how
Thoreau	PERSON	once received a fleeing slave under his protection , and , at the cost of infinite discomfort and considerable risk to him - self , had him sent safely to
Canada	LOCATION	.

		But that this was his practice , and that the retreat to
Walden	LOCATION	was undertaken for this purpose , can not be believed by anyone who has an adequate acquaintance with the facts .

		It is said that
Lowell	PERSON	entertained a prejudice against
Thoreau	PERSON	, occasioned by a certain matter that affected the latter 's pride and hurt the former 's edi - torial dignity .

		Even if this prejudice existed , we do not believe that it inspired the mistaken and un - just criticism of Thoreau in `` My Study Windows . ''

		The criticism was the result , we believe , of a lack of sympathy , and of constitutional inability , on
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's part , to comprehend the point of view of the poet-naturalist .

		Indeed , never were two men more widely , more hopelessly apart .

		On the one hand is
Lowell	LOCATION	, the polished gentleman , the future Minister to the Court of
St. James	ORGANIZATION	, the genial poet and ac - complished scholar , the college professor of belles - lettres , the affable companion , full of grace , courtesy , sparkling wit and crackling humor , with well - trimmed whiskers and perfectly fitting clothes .

		On the other hand we have
Thoreau	PERSON	, -- a man of the woods , a rustic , who avoided the society of women because he felt ill at ease , was hardly affable even to his most intimate friends , but was congenial to woodsmen and woodchucks , jumping fences to make a short cut , walking the backbone of
Cape Cod	LOCATION	with a brown paper parcel and an umbrella , sitting by the roadside in order to study the configuration of a skunk , writing of himself -LRB- `` A Yankee in
Canada	LOCATION	'' -RRB- , `` I had for all head-covering a thin palmleaf hat without lining , that cost
twenty-five cents	MONEY	, and over my coat one of those unspeakably cheap , as well as thin , brown linen sacks of the Oak Hall pattern , which every
summer	DATE	appear all over
New England	LOCATION	, thick as the leaves upon the trees .

		It was a thor - oughly Yankee costume , which some of my fellow - travellers wore in the cars to save their coats a dusting .

		I wore mine at first because it looked better than the coat it covered , and last because two coats are warmer than one , though one is thin and dirty . ''

		In one of those singularly apt figures for which
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	is noted , he shows , to the satisfaction of many readers -LRB- judging from the approbation which his essay has received -RRB- , that
Thoreau	PERSON	is an imitator of
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		Thoreau has '' picked his strawberries from
Emerson	PERSON	's garden ... He is a pistillate plant kindled to fruitage by the Emersonian pollen ... He has stolen the windfall apples from
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's orchard , '' and so on .

		That there was a certain resemblance between
Thoreau	PERSON	and
Emerson	PERSON	, can not be denied .

		It appears to be generally agreed by all those who were personally acquainted with both that the philosopher made his influence felt on the poet - naturalist .

		Some writers assei * t with confidence that all of
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy was inspired by
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's lecture on '' Nature , '' although there are certain awkward objections to this , the principal of which is that
Thoreau	PERSON	was not acquainted with '' Nature '' untU after he had done considerable phi - losophizing independent of a tutor .

		Others have maintained that
Thoreau	PERSON	was not only unconsciously affected by the magnetic power of his friend and townsman , but that he deliberately set himself to work to copy him in manner , in speech , in mode of walk , in the fashion of wearing his beard , and -LRB- but perhaps this was less deliberate -RRB- in the shape of his nose .

		There can , of course , be no doubt that
Emerson	PERSON	exerted a very subtle and irresistible influence on all who came into contact with him .

		Indeed , many pilgrims visited him in order that they might come within this influence .

		His was without question the most powerfully aesthetic , the most originally trans - cendental mind in
America	LOCATION	at the time when
Thoreau	PERSON	lived , and this powerful and original mind was united with a personality singularly sweet and engaging .

		Thoreau , a young man some sixteen years the junior of his patron , was greatly indebted to
Emerson	LOCATION	, -- more so , probably , than appears in any of the bio - graphical records .

		No doubt he was in a measure influenced by
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		In our view , whatever there was in Thoreau of professed trans - cendentalism was due largely to the influence of
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		But that he was a mere imitator , -- that his work , liis thoughts , his philosophy , is a mere reflection of the great light shed by his brilliant contemporary , -- it is impossible to believe .

		Though the two were alike in many superficial aspects , they were poles apart in many essentials .

		Emerson him - self has warmly resented the idea that
Thoreau	PERSON	was only a disciple , and as stoutly maintained that his friend was an original genius .

		And
Emerson	PERSON	's son , in `` Emerson in
Concord	LOCATION	, '' says : `` The charge of imitating
Emerson	PERSON	, too often made against
Thoreau	PERSON	, is idle and untenable , though unfortunately it has
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 355 received some degree of sanction in high quarters .

		...
Thoreau	PERSON	was incapable of conscious imitation .

		His faults , if any , lay in exactly the opposite direc - tion . ''

		And Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	, in his '' Life of Emerson '' says : `` Thoreau lent him -LSB-
Emerson	PERSON	-RSB- a new set of organs of sense of wonderful delicacy .

		Emerson looked at nature as a poet , and his natural history , if left to himself , would have been as vague as that of Polonius ...
Emerson	PERSON	's long intimacy with him taught him to g ^ ve an outline to many natural ob - jects which would have been poetic nebulae to him but for this companionship . ''

		Lowell ag ^ in says : * ' He looked with utter con - tempt on the
august	DATE	drama of destiny of which his country was the scene , and on which the curtain had already risen . ''

		It is difficult to understand how these lines could have been written by anyone who had the slightest acquaintance with
Thoreau	PERSON	's views and activity in regard to the great political question that agitated the country during his later years .

		None of the animadversions on
Thoreau	PERSON	has appeared to be more unjust than this .

		Is it possible that
Lowell	PERSON	was ignorant of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's attitude toward slavery ?

		of his incarceration for refusal to pay a tax , and the reason he gave therefor ?

		of his ad - dresses concerning
John Brown	PERSON	?

		It is true that
Thoreau	PERSON	abhorred politics , and , in his exaggerated way , never spared an opportunity to give vent to those views which were regarded by his neighbors as stamping him an oddity .

		But to say that he looked with contempt on the ''
august	DATE	drama of destiny '' of which his countrj - was the scene , is surely erroneous .

		For not only did he not look with contempt on this drama , but he was an actor in it , and an actor of great spirit and earnestnesss .

		Lowell , indeed , has given us his clever ''
Biglow Papers	PERSON	, '' and may therefore be said to have been more than a mere spectator at that memorable performance ; but while he was composing congenial drolleries in the cosy solitude of his library , while the North was seeking compromise , while many even of the most pronounced Abolitionists were playing only thinking parts , it was
Thoreau	PERSON	, the hermit , the skulker , the selfish recluse who had no concern for the suffe ` rings of his fellows , who boldly came to the front and championed
John Brown	PERSON	--
John Brown	PERSON	, the crazy man who was so foolish as to * ' lose his life for a few niggers . '' ''

		What avail all your scholarly ac - complishments and learning , '' said
Thoreau	PERSON	on that historic occasion when he addressed the citizens of
Concord	LOCATION	, '' compared with wisdom and manhood ?

		To omit his -LSB-
Brown	PERSON	's -RSB- other behavior , see what a work this comparatively unread and unlettered man wrote within six weeks !

		Where is our professor of belles-lettres , or of logic and rhetoric , who can write so well ? ''

		Did this stray shaft lodge in
Lowell	LOCATION	's library ?

		Lowell further says : ''
Thoreau	PERSON	's shanty life was a mere impossibility , as far as his own conception of it goes , of an entire independency of mankind , '' and he goes on to say that his experiment actually presupposed all that complicated civilization which it practically abjured , and triumphantly points out that
Thoreau	PERSON	squatted on another man 's land , bor - rowed still another man 's axe , and obtained from society his boards , his nails , his bricks , his lamp , his fishhooks , his plow , his hoe .

		But would
Lowell	PERSON	have
Thoreau	PERSON	purchase his land ?

		That would involve bargain and sale , the transfer of money , the regis - tration of deeds , and other incidentals more nearly '' presupposing all that complicated civilization '' than mere squatting .

		And would
Lowell	PERSON	insist that
Thoreau	PERSON	make his own axe , mix his own mortar , bake his own bricks , forge his own plough , and write his own library , before he retires to the woods for a little contemplation ?

		It strikes us that the genial
Lowell	PERSON	is here a little severe on `` the adroit and philosophic solitaire . ''

		It is true that the latter wrote by far the larger part of his own library , which he playfully says consisted of nearly nine hundred volimies , over seven hundred of which he wrote him - self ; but it is manifestly too exacting to demand of any reasonable anchorite , no matter how profound his abjuration of society , that he should return to the condition of
Adam	PERSON	, and construct his shanty without nails , bricks , axe , or mortar .

		Possibly
Lowell	PERSON	would insist on the fig-leaf .

		Other critics , like him , disturbed by
Thoreau	PERSON	's shanty life , insisted that he should return to a state of savagery if he would camp out on the pine-clad shore of
Walden	LOCATION	.

		The axe that he borrowed of
Bronson Alcott	PERSON	becomes a formidable weapon in their hands , with which they would demolish at a blow the '' shanty '' and the whole fanciful structure of domestic economy and idealistic philosophy .

		Thoreau with an axe is a humbug .

		He should retiirn to the stone age , and burrow in the earth like a muskrat ; nothing less will satisfy the demands of those who would have him live up to the very letter of what they conceive to be his self-banishment from society .

		And here is how
Thoreau	PERSON	, in an anticipative mood , answers these cavillers : '' It is difficult to begin without bor - rowing , but perhaps it is the most generous course to permit your fellow-man to have an interest in your enterprise . ''

		It is natural that this retreat to
Walden	PERSON	should stand out as thie most conspicuous feature of Tho - reau 's career .

		It was something new ; the reasons he gave for it were novel and stimulating ; it threw an atmosphere of picturesque romance about a fig ^ e already sufficiently odd and perplexing .

		The book that he wrote there has an attractive title , and its contents are such as to invite many shades of criti - cism .

		Most of the conflicting judgments of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's life and work may be traced to a false conception of the
Walden	LOCATION	episode .

		The real purpose of this epi - sode , it seems to us , is ' that
Thoreau	PERSON	might have leisure and opportunity for his reading , his study of nature , his wi'iting , -- and a general good time in the bargain .

		`` I went into the woods to transact some private business , '' he writes ; and that might well end the matter .

		356 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, The chief error of many of
Thoreau	LOCATION	's critics is that they fail to detect his humor , his fondness for extravagance of statement , his hyperhole .

		They accept him literally .

		Thoreau should be read through his life as well as through his books .

		Much that he writes is written in the effort at paradox .

		He is a confessed exaggerator .

		There is about him , on the surface , a great deal of charming and innocent boasting .

		But it belongs to the surface only .

		Under - neath , we find the loving friend , the often true phi - losopher , the preacher , the moralist , the narrator , and , above all and saving all , the humorist .

		As for his writings , some persons have compared them to the freshness of an ocean breeze .

		They are more .

		They are like an electric current in a live wire .

		You are liable to be shocked at any moment .

		But it is a stimulating , an inspiring shock .

		You need not read him consecutively , '' -- you need not worry about the paradoxes , the exaggerations , the boasting , the self-complacency , the false economy .

		They may all be safely taken for the sake of the tonic that goes with them .

		But his humor is the essential thing for his critics to perceive .

		No man can be said to be a recluse , to be a misanthrope , to be really in earnest in his hyperbolic and paradoxical desire to demolish society , who possesses a humor such as
Thoreau 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is his supremely genuine quality , and it is the quality in him that makes him most human and most persuasive .

		Those who do not find this quality in him , read his books in vain .

		Thoreau is too valuable a possession , not only to American literature but to all literature , to be dealt with in an inappreciative or superficial manner by any critic , however witty or brilliant .

		His is a com - plex nature , not readily understood , and it is some - times difficult to see with his vision .

		It is for this reason that those who wovJd approach him in a crit - ical spirit should approach him with caution and with sympathy .

		His is one of the rare cases known in literature where a noble spirit , a witty and inspiring mind , and a moral force of g ^ eat value and attrac - tion , have been brought together in one man .

		Tho - reau inspires , charms , and elevates .

		The reader who comes to
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	's books in a sympathetic and ap - preciative spirit will leave them a better man .

		He will hear sermons without dulness , he will hear music without discord , and there will be revealed to him a religion that insists on no dogmas or creeds , and is wide enough to embrace all sects .

		`` To live rightly and never to swerve , and to believe that we have in ourselves a drop of the Original Goodness besides the well-known deluge of original sin , -- these strains sing through
Thoreau	PERSON	's writings . ''

		We would not wish every man a
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		Civilization has not reached that ideal stage of development when it would be other than awkward for all able-bodied men to sit , rapt in reverie on the shore of a
Walden	LOCATION	pond , speculating on the character of mists or on the immortality of the pine .

		But we would wish a part of Thoreau for every man .

		Tales of a Sportsman-Natitralist .

		* Success , at all hazards and even by any method , is the motto attributed to many who to - day dominate the fields of finance and industry .

		The arena of hiunan activity seems , for the time , not to be a fair field with no favors .

		In these days of the literature of exposure , both serious and frenzied , it is refreshing to find one field of strenuous endeavor in which the spirit of fair-play is cultivated , where gentlemen 's agreements are honorable and are honored in their observance , and where an equal chance is an essential feature of the game .

		Much might be said from several points of view about the cruelty of the sportsman 's art and the debasing effect of the needless slaughter of animals .

		Modem arms and ammunition have sealed the doom of every animal on the face of the earth large enough to become a target , imless protective measures are speedily taken .

		But when all is said , the fact remains that the blood of the hunter runs in man 's veins , and the hunting instinct is by no means eradicated by the advance of civilization .

		Since hunt we will for the pleasure of it , let us play fair with the denizens of field and forest and the finny tribes of stream and sea .

		Few men have done as much to develop and maintain this spirit of fairness to the him ted as Professor Charles
Frederick Holder	PERSON	, sportsman - naturalist and prince of anglers .

		His two recent works , '' The Log of a Sea Angler '' and '' Life in the Open , '' breathe this spirit of fair play in their pages , though neither is a brief for beasts , birds , and fishes , nor is there special pleading for their cause .

		The wild goat on the slopes of
Orizaba	LOCATION	must have a fair chance . ''

		Hunting is what it is made .

		One may coop a jack - rabbit in a large corral and watch greyhounds run it down , and imagine it sport ; so , too , the hunter may at times corral the goat of
Santa Catalina	LOCATION	in some cor - ner and slay it without trouble with the aid of a guide , who is also seeking minimum physical exertion ; but the hunter who will go out into the open and climb the crags of the big mountains or peaks will , I venture to say , in the majority of instances , have hunting and climbing that would be considered aU sufficient if for ' wild goat ' had been substituted the term < big-horn .

		THE DIAL 367 organization of the famous
Tuna Club	ORGANIZATION	of
Santa Catalina	LOCATION	, whose influence has been such that nowhere in the world does a higher standard of sport prevail than on the famous fishing-grounds of
Southern California	LOCATION	. ''

		It was this capture , and the unsportsmanlike condi - tions of fishing at the island , which caused me to sug - gest the organization of the
Tuna Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		The splendid fishes of the region , yellowtaU , white sea-bass , and others , were being slaughtered by the ton .

		How to stop it was the question , and I conceived the idea of an appeal to the innate sense of fair play that is foimd among nearly all anglers .

		I suggested the
Tuna Club	ORGANIZATION	' for the protection of the game fishes of
Southern California	LOCATION	, ' and a constitution and by-laws that would permit the mse of lines up to twenty-four thread only and light rods , with the condition that every angler must land his own fish .

		Some of the best known anglers in the coimtry joined the movement , a club without a club house , and I was honored with the presidency .

		The result was remarkable .

		The example of these gentlemen was so potent that hand-line fishing was abolished , and I doubt if any hand-lines can be found at
Santa Catalina	LOCATION	to-day .

		With a rope-like hand - line , a twenty-five pound yellowtail can be landed in one minute , or possibly two ; but with a rod and a thread - like line , from a nine to a twenty-one thread , it is a matter of fifteen or thirty minutes , and fifty per cent of the game escapes . ''

		Aside from its incidental but none the less potent value as a document on the ethics of sport , ' • The Log of a Sea Angler '' is a well - spun yarn , or rather a series of yams , in which the author 's angling experiences are reeled off in such an entertaining fashion that we instinct - ively look up our fishing tackle and plan at once for an outing at the shore .

		The author has cast his line in many waters , from
Maine	LOCATION	to
Cuba	LOCATION	, but more especially off Loggerhead Key in
Florida	LOCATION	, and in the unsurpassed paradise of anglers off Avalon and the adjacent waters of
Southern California	LOCATION	.

		He i ^ no conventional fisherman , but employs all the tackle known to the craft , -- not only the rod , reel , and line , but the spear and grains .

		Nor is he limited in his quest to fish of wide repute ; but any denizen of the deep whose wariness , strength , or agility can test himian patience or endurance is added to the list of game fishes .

		Thus turtles , sharks , and rays , and even the devil-fish , are not safe when -RSB- VIr .

		Holder goes a-fishing .

		The author 's records as a naturalist are both interesting and valuable , though an occasional statement of fact or inference is open to criti - cism , -- as , for example , his report that jellyfish are the natural food of whalebone whales !

		Li the main , keen observation of nature 's secrets , and wide experience with the sea and its life , are revealed in these angler 's tales , and there is an occasional bit of spirited wTiting as well . ''

		On nearing the school , the fishes become more dis - tinct and the splendid spectacle is afforded of large tunas feeding .

		A stretch of perhaps twenty acres is a mass of foam .

		Some of the fish are playing along the sur - face , churning the blue water into silver .

		Some are leaping high into the air , going up like arrows , eight or more feet .

		The boatman is bearing off and is several feet ahead , but suddenly slows down to half-speed .

		Big flying-fishes are speeding away in every direction , a foot or more above the water , looking like gigantic dragon - flies .

		Now the bait is in the line of march of the school .

		The boatman stands like a statue , his hand on the little engine , ready to stop and reverse .

		Suddenly he whis - pers , * Look out , sir ! '

		his voice hoarse with what should be suppressed excitement , and two or three flying-fishes cross the exact location of the baits .

		He knows that a nemesis , one or more , is directly behind .

		Then comes a rush of something , a blaze of silvery foam along the surface , tossing the spume high in air , and two rods are jerked to the water 's edge , while the reel gives tongue in clear vibrant notes like the melody of an old hound that one angler had known in the
Virginia	LOCATION	fox-himting country long ago . ''

		The other new book by Mr.
Holder	PERSON	, '' Life in the Open , '' is in the main , as its sub-title suggests , a record of sport with rod , gun , horse , and hound , in
Southern California	LOCATION	, -- a spirited account of the hunt for hare , wolf , lynx , and fox in the foot-hills of the
Sierra Madre	ORGANIZATION	, and of the deer , bighorn , and mountain lion amid the crags and precipices of the
Southern Sierras	LOCATION	.

		While most of the chapters tell of the author 's personal experience in the sport , we search in vain for it in the chapter on the moimtain lion .

		The cur - tain rises revealing the stage , the magnificent panorama of forest , mountain , and sea , but alas !

		where is Hamlet ?

		Indeed , the whole book is an enthusiastic panegyric of this
summer	DATE	- land , this
Italy	LOCATION	of
America	LOCATION	, with a few inci - dental remarks about the fine sport to be had amidst beautiful scenery in a matchless climate .

		But after all , what matters it , if the lion was not found ?

		The s ^ xch for him , however , was a roundrof delights .

		A nimiber of pages are devoted to the varied sport which the angler finds with tuna , black sea-bass , and yellowtail , with deep-sea trolling and still-anglmg off the shores of
Southern California	LOCATION	and its adjacent islands , and with the trout of the clear mountain streams of the
Coast Range	ORGANIZATION	and of the high
Sierras	LOCATION	.

		The work is superbly illustrated wath many reproductions from photographs of scenery , the old missions of
California	LOCATION	, and fishing scenes about Avalon on famous
Santa Catalina Island	LOCATION	.

		Not all of the subjects are pertinent to the professed theme of the book , but they nevertheless contribute to the enjoyment of its pages , and afford the setting indispensable to an adequate appreciation of the 358 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, attractions of our American paradise .

		The charm of the work lies in its spirited and enthusiastic appreciation of out-of-door life , of the possibilities of enjoyment of nature , even though one go a-hunting or a-fishing .

		It woidd make a gdod docimient for the ubiquitous Cali - fornia

		The Amebica ^ t Tree Book .

		* Among recent popular publications treating of the natural world .

		Miss
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	's `` Tree Book '' takes high rank .

		It is one of the fruits of efforts recently made to bring the literature of popular science and nature-study to a sane and solid basis .

		While not an avowed nature-study book , it will inevitably supplant in part the less desirable literature on that subject , and wiU materially reinforce that which is good .

		It will be more particidarly welcomed , however , by those who love trees and forests , as weU as by those who take a purely practical view of their care and preservation .

		The author comes to her work with excellent training , long experience , and , above all , a healthy and infectious enthusiasm for the subject ; and these qualities are abimd - antly shown throughout the volume , which gives evidence of wide observation and extensive read - ing .

		The style is pleasing and popular , while on the whole the work is scientifically accurate .

		The greater part of the book -LRB- about 450 pages -RRB- is given to the various groups of native and introduced forest trees , which are considered in separate chapters .

		Much valuable informa - tion is given , not only concerning identity of species , but their habits , distribution , and culti - vation as well .

		A key to the principal families of trees , and separate keys fdi * the species in each family , wiU be of assistance even to the in - experienced layman ; while the numerous illus - trations are well grouped to bring the details of each species together .

		Valuable hints concerning the usefulness of various species of trees are given in connection with the specific descriptions , and this feature wiU be appreciated especially by those who cultivate trees .

		However , it is evident that this part of the book is written largely from the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	standpoint , although the author is not without Western experience .

		Thus , those who have seen the solitary cotton - wood grow to symmetrical proportions out on the wind-swept prairies will scarcely agree that • The Tree Book .

		Illustrated in color , the '' brittle wood can not withstand the winds , '' or that this species is more useful in the city than in the open country .

		Nor will we of the West feel like accepting the pleasant words which the author bestows upon the
Lombardy	LOCATION	poplar .

		It should also be noted that the com - mendation of the Western catalpa as a tree suitable for planting in the West applies only to the region south of central
Iowa	LOCATION	.

		The white pine , while useful northeastward , is not the best pine for the prairies , both Scotch and Austrian pines being more suitable , and the latter pre - ferable where it can be started under proper protection .

		The bur-oak should not have been singled out as suitable for planting on the prai - ries , as several other species of trees are much more satisfactory .

		The useful glossary will assist the average reader in understanding more technical terms , but greater care should have been exercised in defining some of these terms .

		Thus , the term pericarp should apply only to the outer walls of the ovary ; resin is not restricted to the wood of conifers ; stomata are often found on the upper side of the leaf , and on twigs ; the term terete refers not only to cylindrical forms , but applies to all elongated forms which are circular in cross-section ; and flower-clusters other than cymes are flat-topped .

		Notwithstanding these and other minor errors , however , the first part of this delightful volume will be of great assist - ance to aU who have a real desire to learn to know trees .

		Part II .

		is devoted to Forestry ; and this por - tion of the work will be especially valuable in view of the increasing interest in this subject , which will no doubt be further stimulated by this book .

		A great amount of information is here presented in clear and concise form .

		The several chapters deal successively with the his - tory of forestry in our country ; Ivunbering pro- cesses in the
East	LOCATION	; profitable tree-planting ; the farmer 's wood-lot ; the transplanting of trees ; the method of midtiplication and dispersal ; the methods of measuring trees ; the pruning of trees ; and the enemies of trees .

		The amateur tree-grower will receive many valuable hints and directions in these chapters , and the reader who seeks general information will find it here in attractive form .

		The chapter on profitable tree - planting is especially pleasing because it is hope - ful .

		Some modifications of the chapter on transplanting trees would , however , be necessary for the drier portions of the central West , where a dense shallow root-system endangers the tree during both dry winters and summers .


1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 359 Part III .

		is devoted to the discussioA of the products of the forest .

		The uses and methods of finishing woods are considered , and the meth - ods of wood-preservation , and of the manufacture of wood-paper pulp , are described .

		The several subjects are treated very happily , but one regrets that the author did not more severely condemn the evils of the Christmas-tree traffic .

		Part IV. , which describes the life of the tree , concludes the text of the book .

		A popular dis - cussion of plant physiology is always unsatis - factory , and to some extent this is true of the part under consideration .

		The author describes the work of the leaves ; the growth of the tree ; the fall of the leaves ; and the winter condition of trees .

		Since microscopic structure can not be exactly set forth in a work of this character , it follows that much of the discussion of functions can not be clear .

		This is especially true , in the present case , of the fimctions of the green leaves , and of the part played by various cells of the sap-wood in the transportation of sap and the storing of starch .

		Neither is it possible to make clear the structure of wood , or the changes which take place in leaves in the
fall	DATE	.

		The propriety of certain positive statements concerning the functions of structures which are not yet well understood may be questioned .

		This is espe - cially true of the statements made concerning the fimctions of lenticels .

		There is no doubt that these structures will transmit gases under pressure , but their exact function is by no means clear , and positive statements concerning such mooted questions are better omitted from popu - lar works .

		The Appendix is also worthy of mention , for it contains a great amount of condensed special information concerning trees , and will be found both interesting and valuable .

		The mechanical appearance of the volume is very satisfactory , though a imrform background for each plate would have produced a more pleasing effect .

		The minor errors to which attention has been called do not materially diminish the value of the book , which must prove a source of inspi - ration and encouragement to everyone who loves and appreciates trees .

		Nor is the reason for this fancy far to seek .

		Of late , it is true that many women have entered the lists of that delightful tourna - ment in which the rival claims of plants and plantings are jousted for ; but the great old garden-books written by the great old sons of '' the grand old gardener and his wife '' were nearly all written by men called John , --

		The chapter on the

		What we have to be especially thankfid for are the accounts of the
Ancient Market Towne of Titchfield	ORGANIZATION	, and the salty breezes of the chronicles of
Port	LOCATION	- chester .

		The literary charm of the book is marked , and it is altogether a work of distinc - tion and value .

		In '' Common-Sense Gardens , '' by Mr.
Cor	PERSON	- nelius
V. V. Sewell	PERSON	, we enter a world of far less scholarly interest , but of the practical value we need if we woidd avoid the cruel disappoint - ments that so often befall him who plants with more zeal than knowledge .

		Two points in this excellent and amply illustrated book are worthy of especial notice , -- the author 's praises of Box , and his pictures of enclosed gardens .

		If one has had the good fortune to live with alleys of Box older than the Republic ; has inhaled the imforgettable odor of this imperial shrub during long hot simuner days , and has watched its mysterious affinities with frost and snow , one has learned that no plant can strike its roots so deep in the heart , or fill so large a place in the memory .

		To plant Box , not wholly for our - selves , but for those who shall walk '' in far-off summers that we shall not see , '' this is an act of high civic virtue .

		And as one knows the value of Box only by living with it , so no one can imagine the delights of an enclosed garden who has not owned one .

		Mr.
Sewell	PERSON	demurs at the idea of its seclusion as im - American and out of sympathy with true democracy .

		A little more reserve , a little more dignity , a little less of parade , even of our roses , -- surely if these much-needed lessons can be taught by a well - clipped hedge , a brick wall gadded over by roses , or even by a wire netting overgrown by morn - ing-glories , they are doubly worth the learning .

		In '' The Seasons in a Flower Garden , '' Miss
Louise Shelton	PERSON	has given us a practical and pleasant garden manual .

		The directions are clearly worded , well grouped , and reasonable -- a quality not too often to be found among such books .

		The lists omit many important plants , and include others not generally regarded as desirable .

		For a small garden and a young gardener , the book will render the real service for which it was written .

		Travels by
Sea	ORGANIZATION	and liAND .

		* We are inclined to disagree with those who assert that the instinct to travel is the lowest mental incentive that urges mankind to seek strange lands and new sights .

		Moreover , we believe that this migratory or nomadic instinct , this wanderlust , has a distinct literary value .

		How tasteless is a book of travels that recounts with statistical dryness the dull catalogue of common things found in a venturesome journey !

		Darwin , among the scientists , in his '' Voyage of the Beagle , ''
Henry M. Stanley	PERSON	among the great explorers , and Mrs.
Bishop	PERSON	among those who travel for descriptive material , had this instinct and managed to impart a goodly share of it to their books .

		Nor is this instinct con - fined to the records of actual travel .

		Nowhere can it be found to better advantage than in ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' and '' Gulliver 's Travels . ''

		On the other hand , we miss this wander-spirit in many otherwise commendable books .

		Long - fellow 's '' Outre Mer , ''
Hawthorne	PERSON	's note-books of travel ,
Holmes	PERSON	's '' Our Hundred Days in
Europe	LOCATION	, ''
Emerson	PERSON	's `` English Traits , '' -- to limit our list to books by Americans , -- are lacking in this zest of the human desire to go a-wandering .

		Certainly so good a traveller and writer as the author of '' Travels with a Donkey '' and '' An Inland Voyage '' would not make the spirit of travel a minor motive in mankind or a minimum literary force in books of travel .

		Nowhere is this spirit more apparent than in books dealing with the attempts to find the two poles of the earth .

		The great sums of money , the sacrifice of life , the rivalry of the nations , and the undying energy exhibited , are sufficient evidence that mankind is prompted to seek the imknown in order to satisfy a powerful human passion .

		Indomitable courage , the will to do , and the endurance of heart-breaking hardships , characterize those men who would discover a point of zero in the earth 's latitude and longi - tude .

		Such is the spirit that infuses the \ avid and instructive book entitled '' The Siege of the

		THE DIAL 361 who admits that he has never been within two thousand mil ^ of the
Antarctic Circle	ORGANIZATION	, has had the rare fortune '' to possess the personal friend - ship of all , or almost all , the living explorers and promoters of exploration in the Antarctic Regions . ''

		He can , consequently , give a per - sonal touch to his summary of Antarctic travel .

		His volume is very complete in its descrip - tions of all the efforts that have been made to reach the
South Pole	LOCATION	.

		AVe find a good sum - mary of the earlier voyages which fell short of the Circle ; then we read at great length of the noteworthy voyages from the time of
Cook	ORGANIZATION	, in
1772	DATE	, down to our own time , -- to the voyages of
Scott	LOCATION	,
Drygalski	LOCATION	,
Nordenskjold	ORGANIZATION	,
Bruce	PERSON	, and Charcot .

		Nearly all of these explorers left personal records of their trips ; but many of their accounts , especially those between the voyages of the `` Resolution '' in
1772	DATE	and the '' Chal - lenger '' in
1874	DATE	, are now out of print or are difficult to consult .

		This is notably true of Admiral
Bellingshausen	PERSON	's story of his voyage and discoveries , made in 1819-21 , and hitherto accessible only in the Russian language and in a Grerman translation made in
1902	DATE	.

		For these reasons , Dr.
Mill	PERSON	's book is a very acceptable contribution to the literature of exploration at the
South Pole	LOCATION	.

		That • ' the siege of the
South Pole	LOCATION	has been a spasmodic operation , proceeding by magnificent efforts separated by long inter - vals of inertness and inattention , '' and that each fresh expedition had to begin at the beginning , acquiring its own experience by repeating the errors of its predecessors , is only too evident in reading this volume .

		Dr. Mill , however , is not pessimistic about the ultimate discovery of the
South Pole	LOCATION	.

		Soon , probably within the
first quarter	DATE	of the present century , some explorer , the author thinks , will wipe '' the reproach of
Terra Incognita	ORGANIZATION	from the surface of our little globe . ''

		Our space forbids our making even the briefest summary of a book that is intended to be a compact handbook .

		VTe do not hesi - tate to say , however , that Dr. ^ Mill 's book does for Antarctic exploration what General
A. W. Greely	PERSON	's ' • Handbook of Arctic Discoveries '' does for the history of exploration at the
North Pole	LOCATION	, and that it does it equally well .

		After the somewhat heavy but wholesome fare of Dr.
Mill	PERSON	's volume , one relishes the slighter and more superficial quality of Mr.
Richard Arthur	PERSON	's `` Ten Thousand Miles in a Yacht . ''

		Ten men and a lad left
New York	LOCATION	in
November , 1904	DATE	, in the palatial j-acht ''
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' cap - tained by Mr.
E. C. Benedict	PERSON	; they visited
Bermuda	LOCATION	, sailed `` across the tropical sapphire seas , along the palm-fringed Carribean island - coasts , '' touching at
Dominica	LOCATION	,
Martinique	LOCATION	,
Santa Lucia	LOCATION	,
Barbadoes	LOCATION	, and thence passed up the
Amazon	LOCATION	for a thousand miles , past Para and
Santarem	LOCATION	to
Manaos	LOCATION	, where they remained a week , thence voyaging back along the coasts of
South America	LOCATION	to
Jamaica	LOCATION	and
Havana	LOCATION	, and finally , on
January 30 , 1905	DATE	, they dropped anchor in
East River	LOCATION	in '' Little Old
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		We hare chosen the following ex - cerpts as revealing the better quality of the book . ''

		Many optiinistic people look forward to the time when the
Amazon	LOCATION	country will be thickly populated , and prosperous plantations will occupy the riyer front on each side for thousands of miles .

		I am aware that it is generally as rash a thing to foretell what will not happen as to predict what will happen ; but I can not see in the future the thick population and the prosperous ` plantations that have been prophesied .

		There certainly will be development on the higher lands ; but on the lower
Amazon	LOCATION	, for some hundreds of miles , there seems little prospect of reclaiming the alluvial flats from the grip of the river .

		A great deal of this land is sub - merged in the high-river season , and if the forest were stripped from it the river would eat it up like so much salt . ''

		Here is a fish story : '' It was the evening of
January 5	DATE	, about 10 o'clock .

		The yacht was gliding through the sea at nearly fifteen knots an hour and rolling about twenty-five degrees .

		One of the stewards was sitting in the dining room .

		He was dozing and dreaming -- doubtless of the girl he left behind .

		Suddenly he was awakened by some - thing swishing through the open window , over his right shoulder close to his face .

		Before he could open his eyes he heard the flop of something weighty on the floor beneath the dining-room table , and then , to his amazement , he saw the gleaming back of a good-sized , tail-flapping all-alive-o fish .

		A brother steward was immediately summoned , and then nearly the whole crew , and the fish was duly measured and weighed .

		The official report made him 2 feet 3 inches long and gave him 3 ^ pounds avoirdupois .

		He certainly made a famous leap to get out of the sea into the dining room . ''

		One of the best features of the volume is the introduction , written by Mr.
William M. Ivins	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Ivins	PERSON	, who has business interests in
Brazil	LOCATION	, and has made other trips to that country , is evidently well informed about the land and the people -- so well , indeed , that some readers may wish that the author and the introductory writer had exchanged places .

		Benares has always had a strangely fasci - nating interest for travellers in
Lidia	LOCATION	.

		The reason is apparent : there is seen , in all its degradation and splendor , the microcosm of Tnflian religious life .

		To know all the ramifica - tions of this life , with its three hundred million 362 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, deities , is probably beyond the psychology of the ordinary western mind .

		Hence one ap - preciates a calm , dispassionate , well-ordered , and studious unravelling of the labyrinth of Hindu life and religion .

		Principal
E. B. Havell	PERSON	, of the
Government School of Art	ORGANIZATION	at
Calcutta	LOCATION	, has done this in a masterly manner in his book entitled ''
Benares	LOCATION	, the Sacred City . ''

		We read in his book about the Vedic times , the great Hindu epics , the latest discoveries at Samath the birthplace of Buddhism , the rise of modern
Hinduism	LOCATION	, and , at more length , of the worship of
Shiva	ORGANIZATION	, the presiding deity of
Benares	LOCATION	.

		We voyage with him along the
Granges	ORGANIZATION	river , seeing the wonderfid rites and ceremonies of the bathers , visiting the ghats and temples -- of which there are over fifteen hundred , -- and making the pilgrimages to the various holy places .

		No part of his interesting book is more graphic and picturesque than the following account of one of the Hindu festivals : '' The most beautiful of all the latter is the
Diwali	LOCATION	, or Feast of Lamps , in honor of
Lakshmi	LOCATION	, the goddess of Fortune .

		In the
evening	TIME	, when the short
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	gloaming is merging into night , numbers of girls and young women , graceful as Greek nymphs in their many - coloured saris , come silently down to the ghats , bearing little earthen lamps , which they light and carefully set afloat .

		Then with eager faces they watch them carried away on the rippling surface of the water , still shimmer - ing with opalescent tints from the last rays of the after - glow .

		For if a tiny wavelet should upset the frail craft , or if the light should flicker and go out , it bodes mis - fortune in the coming year .

		But if the light bums strong and well , till the lamp is borne far away by the current in midstream , happiness is in store for her who launched it on the waters .

		By the time the twilight fades there are himdreds of twinkling lights dotted over the river , as if holy
Ganga	PERSON	had borrowed the stars from heaven , whence she came , to adorn her earthly robes . ''

		Principal
Havell	PERSON	, in closing his book , says : '' No doubt
Hinduism	LOCATION	will continue to be modi - fied by the inflow of Western ideas .

		There can be no greater mistake than to consider
Hinduism	LOCATION	as so many immutable customs and forms of ritual and belief , which may be uprooted , but can not be trained or adapted . ''

		The volimie is well illustrated with appropriate pictures -- pic - tures that assist the text .

		Mr.
G. F. Abbott	PERSON	's book entitled '' Through
India	LOCATION	with the Prince '' covers the whole country and touches on every imaginable topic that
India	LOCATION	offers to a writer .

		As special correspondent for the
Calcutta	LOCATION	'' Statesman , '' a journal of which he has for some years been editor , the author accompanied their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of
Wales	LOCATION	on their recent Indian tour .

		The royal party travelled north from
Bombay	LOCATION	to
Jaipur	LOCATION	,
Lahore	LOCATION	,
Peshawar	LOCATION	; thence , turning east and south , they visited
Amritsar	LOCATION	,
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	,
Agra	LOCATION	,
Lucknow	LOCATION	, and
Calcutta	LOCATION	, whence they sailed to
Burma	LOCATION	, where they stopped at
Rangoon	LOCATION	and
Mandalay	LOCATION	, thence back to
Madras	LOCATION	, and then , turning north again , they visited
Hyderabad	LOCATION	,
Benares	LOCATION	,
Nepal	LOCATION	, and finally , cut ^ ting across northern
India	LOCATION	, after a stop at
Simla	LOCATION	, they departed from the country at
Karachi	LOCATION	.

		Though we give the route of the royal party , we do not wish to imply that Mr.
Abbott	PERSON	's book is mainly concerned with the doings and receptions that were everywhere held in honor of the visit of the royal pair .

		On the contrary , it gives but little more than a decent amount of attention to the many durbars of the native princes , and still less attention to the Prince and Princess of
Wales	LOCATION	.

		As the royal party did not remain long at any one place , we need not wonder that the author 's descriptions are at times rather blase and thin .

		The
Taj Mahal	ORGANIZATION	at
Agra	LOCATION	receives this comment : `` It makes me think of
Euclid	LOCATION	, or of a toy-shop .

		The Taj seems to me to need a glass case . ''

		The volume records a traveller 's impressions , marked by a certain quality of mixed cynicism , acerbity , and egotism .

		Such sentences as the following are not infrequent in the book : '' They -LSB- tigers -RSB- never attack human beings so long as they can obtain a respectable animal '' ; and , '' after all , death is only one of the minor tragedies of life . ''

		The want of de - scriptive power and the too pronounced personal note are the two blemishes that detract from the main value of the book , which is found in the writer 's comments and observations on the polit - ical status of
India	LOCATION	.

		On this subject he is sotmd and earnest , although his views are probably not in accord with government views and reports .

		Mr.
Abbott	PERSON	asserts that the
British Government	ORGANIZATION	in
India	LOCATION	has failed to earn the love of the peo - ple , and that , if the present government is to hold , it must niake concessions to the natives .

		On this point , while in
Hyderabad	LOCATION	, he wrote : '' The only condition of success -- the condition on the observance of which depends the very permanence of the British Empire in
India	LOCATION	-- is sincere cooperation between the Englishman and the native ; and as the native becomes more and more educated he is entitled to a greater and yet greater share in the government of his own country .

		The example of a native state like Baroda brilliantly proves that the talent for self-gov - ernment is not a monopoly of the
West	LOCATION	.

		The moral qualities and the material means necessary for_the work are quite as plentiful in the
East	LOCATION	. ''

		But , says the author , self-government for
India	LOCATION	, as well as many other Western ideas , is yet very distant .

		The photographic reproductions
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 363 in the book are the best we have seen of Indian sights for some time .

		`` It is a curious fact that , notwithstanding our boasted nineteenth-century progress in meth - ods , discovery , and invention , up to the coming of the motor-car man had made absolutely no progress since the dawn of history in the trans - portation of the individual vmit of society . ''

		These words , challenging us to a debate , intro - duce us to the spirited and enthusiastic account of a confirmed automobilist , who , with two equally enthusiastic and joUy companions , made a motor-car trip through
England	LOCATION	, thence across to
Paris	LOCATION	by way of
Rouen	LOCATION	, to
Lucerne	LOCATION	by way of
Basle	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	, to
Geneva	LOCATION	, and then back to
Paris	LOCATION	through Aix-les-Bains .

		Mr.
Winthrop E. Scarritt	PERSON	, a former President of the
Automo	PERSON	- bile Club of
America	LOCATION	, tells the story of this trip very well in his little volume entitled '' ■ Three Men in a Motor Car , '' although he adds nothing to our stock of information about the places he visited .

		The intrinsic ^ * alue of the book lies in the specific information that he gives to other automobilists as to how to '' do ''
Europe	LOCATION	in a motor-car .

		We learn , for example , that there is an automobile bureau in
Paris	LOCATION	, in
London	LOCATION	, and in
Stuttgardt	LOCATION	, where an automobilist may have every want supplied and every petty foreign interference removed .

		Much of the book , in fact nearly one-haK , is given to a considera - tion of the future automobile , automobile legis - lation , good roads , automobile contests , and other like subjects dear to the automobilist .

		After reading !

		Mr.
Scarritt	PERSON	's volume , one can readily agree with those charming writers on the auto - mobile ,
C. N.	ORGANIZATION	and
A. M. Williamson	PERSON	, who write the introduction to this book , when they say , * ' It is the deliberate opinion of all who have tried it , that life can offer few more vivid joys than a tour in a motor-car through a beautifid country . ''

		Although Mr.
George ^ lilton Fowles	PERSON	, the author of the book entitled * ' Down in
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, '' disclaims to write in a spirit of adverse criticism , the shadow is more pronounced than the light in his sununary of observations based on a year 's residence in the island .

		His account , moreover , is marked by a strong religious bias .

		He believes that the ultimate regeneration of the Porto Ricans must come through the Protestant religion .

		There is , to be sure , some truth in this last statement ; but that it is the whole truth is not so evident .

		We believe tha # the author makes a far more important observation when he \ ^ Tites : '' If the people learn to read American literature and come to know our ideals of national life , if they are able to converse in an intelligent manner with the American officials and citizens who reside in
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, it will not be long until this people shall be thoroughly American . ''

		For this reason the author believes that English instead of Spanish should be the basic language used in the schools .

		Among other changes that are needed , or are being made , the author cites the separation of Church and
State	ORGANIZATION	, the '' rapidly rising moral tone of family life , '' the increasing trade with the
United States	LOCATION	, the change of senti - ment toward manual labor , and the establishment of the rights of American citizenship .

		For those who have read but little about
Porto Rico	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Fowles	PERSON	's book will give much detailed informa - tion concerning the mental , physical , and spirit - ual characteristics of the Porto Ricans , and about the educational , economic , and political conditions of the island .

		The book also contains a sufficient amount of historical background to help to explain many of the existing conditions .

		Thoreau once boasted of the treasures he found on the barren sands of a desolate creek .

		A similar spirit pervades and animates Mr.
J. A. Harvie-Brown	PERSON	's two - volume work bearing the title '' Travels of a Natiualist in
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		The region of the author 's trips lies in
Norway	LOCATION	, and in extreme northeastern
Russia	LOCATION	at
Archangel	LOCATION	, near the
Dvina Delta	ORGANIZATION	, and at
Petchora	LOCATION	, near the
Arctic Circle	ORGANIZATION	.

		An unnsual feature of the book is the fact that it recounts the travels of the author made as long ago as
1871	DATE	,
1872	DATE	, and
1875	DATE	.

		The publication of the author 's journal at this late date is but scantily justified by '' the very antiquity of the relation . ''

		The real purpose and value of the book , however , lie in the observations of the author and his companions on bird and animal life , -- obser - vations that are minutely correct and scientific , and will be of interest to those deeply versed in bird and animal lore .

		Here and there are minor observations and reflections on the natives and their modes of living .

		One appen - dix is devoted to the Samoyedes of exta ^ me northern
Russia	LOCATION	.

		An excerpt will illustrate the spirit and purpose of the book .

		The naturalists were anxious to find specimens and eggs of the Little Stint and the Grey Plover .

		One day , so says the author : ''
Seebohni	PERSON	had grand success , returning shortly after me , and with a triiunphant thump laid on the table , first a Grey Plover , then a Snow Bunting ; ... lastly , and most triumphantly -- hurrah !

		-- five Little Stints , long looked for , found at last . ''

		Such a spirit of discovery of small things has 364 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, almost a kinship with
Columbus	LOCATION	's first sight of land ,
Sverdrup	ORGANIZATION	's view of a new land , or Bal - boa 's long-wished-for vision of the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		All the discoveries and observations made by the author have been tabulated and arranged in order .

		The volumes are well printed , and well illustrated with colored plates necessary to a complete understanding of the text .


H. E. COBLENTZ	PERSON	.

		Recent Fictiok .

		* ♦ * The Portreeve '' is as good a book as any that Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	has thus far written , although it does not bring to us the sense of novelty .

		The Dartmoor coloring and the types of rustic character which appear in its pages are essentially the same as in his previous books , for which reason we are unable to discover in the new novel anything but a variation upon a well-worn theme .

		Possibly the grip of character is somewhat stronger , the depiction of elemental passion more intense , and the tragic plot more inevitably logical .

		The hero is an agri - culturist and petty official of local importance , well on the way toward prosperity , who is made little more than an outcast by the rancor of a scorned woman and eventually a murderer by the desperate passions which his unmerited reverses arouse .

		The story is thus sombre enough in outline , but the gloom is somewhat relieved by the humors of the subsidiary characters , and by the quaint forms of speech that the author seems to icnow so intimately .

		Certainly , as we have remarked before , Mr.
Phillpotts	PERSON	comes nearer than anyone else to being the legitimate suc - cessor of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	as a rustic realist , and he has a considerable measure of the imaginative power which can invest a simple passionate complication with the severe attributes of high tragedy .

		Joyous romance beckons to us from the pages of `` If Youth But Knew ! ''

		To say that this book is the work of Mr. and Mrs.
Egerton Castle	ORGANIZATION	is to provide it with a certain passport to the affections of the public , for these writers have , more than most of their contemporaries , the power to command smiles and tears commingled , and to transport us into the rapturous regions of delight .

		The new book is one of their best .

		It has a historical setting , for it takes us to the toy Kingdom of
Westphalia	LOCATION	and the imitation
Paris	LOCATION	established at
Cassel	PERSON	by the puppet prince who ruled there by grace of his imperial brother until the battle of
Leipzig	LOCATION	put an end to the whole artificial arrangement .

		The story is one of love , wounded pride , and reconciliation , the destinies of the lovers being shaped by a vagabond fiddler who befriends them , and who is in reality a French emigrS of gentle birth and tragic fortune .

		It is a story throbbing with life , instinct with poetic feel - ing , and bearing the stamp of a creative power that is closely akin to genius .

		Mr.
Rex E. Beach	PERSON	is a young man who got the
Alaska	LOCATION	fever when hardly more than a boy , spent several years in the mining camps of the northern wilderness , and returned to civilization with an imperious mandate to expose the wrong-doings of which he had been a witness .

		First in a series of magazine articles , and now in his novel of `` The Spoilers , '' be has told such a tale of corruption and the perversion of justice as fairly to startle the most apathetic of listeners .

		That he has used the muck-rake to some purpose is clear ; for he substan - tiates his essential charges with solid testimony of a sort that can not be dismissed with a sneer as the invention of a sensationalist .

		Briefly , the story he tells is that a combination of
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	politicians high in office , having for their tools a masterful adventurer and a pliant federal judge , conspired to get fraudulent possession of the richest claims in the camp at
Nome	LOCATION	, ousting their legitimate owners by chicane and corrupt legal process .

		How the conspiracy triumphed , how the wrong was done , and how , in the end , very tardily , such justice pre - vailed as was still possible after so much irreparable mischief , is set forth in this virile novel , which grips us by sheer brute strength , and almost makes us forget how devoid it is of anything like grace or delicacy of workmanship .

		It is interesting to compare with Mr.
Beach	PERSON	's novel the somewhat similar `` Alton of Somasco , '' by Mr.
Harold Bindloss	PERSON	.

		Here the scene is British
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	instead of
Alaska	LOCATION	, and there is no political deviltry to impel the action , but otherwise the situa - tion is the same , being evolved out of the conflict between legitimate settlers and unscrupulous schem - ers for the possession of valuable ranching and mining properties .

		Mr.
Bindloss	PERSON	is a more urbane novelist than Mr.
Beac	PERSON	` h , and in his hands the blud - geon gives place to more civilized weapons .

		He has , moreover , powers of description and character - ization far beyond those as yet developed by the author of '' The Spoilers . ''

		An admirable novel is
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 365 the result , and one which introduces us to a territory hitherto almost unexploited in fiction . ''

		The Kentuckian '' is one of those books which , like ''
Eben Holden	PERSON	'' and ''
David Harum	PERSON	, '' seem to exist chiefly for the purpose of exploiting the fond of humorous anecdote at the command of some shrewd and garrulous yokel .

		Were the book no more than this , it would hardly call for mention , but we find that by carefully skipping all of
Bill Kirk	PERSON	's contributions to the dialogue , we may dis - cover a connected narrative of some degree of in - terest .

		It is a narrative of
Ohio	LOCATION	in the sixties , and is concerned with the operations of the Underground Railroad and the exploits of a gang of horse thieves .

		The hero is a young man from the other side of the river , who becomes the district school teacher , and falls in love with the prettiest of his pupils .

		This is not exactly an original invention , but it may be allowed to serve once more . ''

		Lady
Baltimore	LOCATION	, '' like Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	's other fiction , is defective on the side of construction , but the defect is atoned for by the author 's powers M characterization and his narrative charm .

		In the present novel he bids us sojourn for a while in the sleepy old town of
King 's Port	LOCATION	, which is with small difficulty identifiable as
Charleston	LOCATION	, and brings us into intimate relations with its denizens .

		The point of riew is that of a Northerner , but of one imbued with the fullest sympathy for the gracious aspects of a civilization that lingers yet in the Old South , although not likely to preserve its fragrance for many more years .

		We must make a somewhat lengthy quotation for the purpose of illustrating both the attitude of the writer and the manner of his expression . ''

		This
King	PERSON	's
Port	LOCATION	, this little city of oblivion , held , shut in with its lavender and pressed - rose memories , a handful of people who were like that great society of the world , the high society of distinguished men and women who exist no more , but who touched historj ' with a light hand , and left their mark upon it in a host of memoirs and letters that we read to-day with a starved and homesick longing in the midst of our sxiEen welter of demo - cracy .

		With its silent houses and gardens , its silent streets , its silent vistas of the blue water in the sun - shine , this beautiful , sad place was winning my heart and making it ache .

		Nowhere else in
America	LOCATION	such charm , such character , such true elegance as here -- and nowhere else such an overwhelming sense of finality I -- the doom of a civilization founded upon a crime .

		And yet , how much has the ballot done for that race ?

		Or , at least , how much has the ballot done for the majority of that race ?

		And what way was it to meet this problem with the sudden sweeping folly of the Fifteenth Amendment ?

		To fling the • door of hope ' wide open before those within had learned the first steps of how to walk safely through it I Ah , if it comes to blame , who goes scatheless in this heritage of error ? ''

		But we must not give the impression that Mr.
Wister	PERSON	has been writing a sociological tract ; he has , on the contrary , given us a very pretty story of the ram - bling sort , and rarely bears too heavily upon the problems that lie in the background . ''

		The Private War , '' by Mr.
Louis Joseph Vance	PERSON	, is one of those novels that just escape the category of '' shockers '' by virtue of a certain neatness of plot and a bare touch of stylistic virtue .

		More than this can not in conscience be said of the book from a literary point of view , but the readers to whom it is addressed will probably think even that sli ^ t element of art superfluous .

		For it is a book that has its being in the interest of excitement and nothing else .

		We begin with a collection of news - paper clippings called `` The Documents in the Case , '' and as the story is gradually unfolded , these incoherent fragments are seen to slip into their proper relations to the ingenious plot .

		The story has to do with the fortunes of a young American woman in
London	LOCATION	, the widow of an English noble - man , caught in the toils of private villainy and di - plomatic intrigue .

		Her old-time lover , the hero , hastens from
New York	LOCATION	in the true spirit of knight - errantry to rescue her , and straightway becomes entangled in an amazing coil of plots and counter - plots .

		The interest grows more and more breath - less , finally culminating in a triangular naval battle between Russian , German , and British warships .

		We do not quite understand how it is all brought about , but the narrative is tremendously thrilling , which is probably all that its author aimed at .

		A young college professor , at first described as '' verging upon the sixth lustrum of his age '' -LRB- a vile phrase -RRB- , and afterwards said to be about thirty years old , leaves his position in the
University of California	ORGANIZATION	, and obtains a temporary appointment in an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	college .

		The new scene of his labors is
Warwick	LOCATION	, which is easily identifiable as
Hartford	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	.

		There he becomes acquainted with '' a , swell official of the church , '' otherwise the bishop -LRB- who is the real power behind the collegiate throne -RRB- , and , what is more important , with the bishop 's daughter .

		He also becomes acquainted with a poli - tician of the demagogic type , who was formerly an employe of the local traction company , and is now a candidate for the mayoralty of the city .

		HenCe the book in which Mr.
Herbert M. Hopkins	PERSON	has told of these matters is entitled `` The Mayor of Warwick . ''

		After the pace of the narrative is fairly set , it transpires that the bishop 's daughter has been secretly married to the demagogue for two years .

		But before this fact comes to the professor 's knowl - edge he has fallen in love with the yoxmg woman , and she has become somewhat interested in him , having long since repented of her rash marriage .

		Here is a pretty complication , which is supposed to be finally disentangled by the cheap and convenient expedient of an action for divorce .

		The author , we understand , is charged with having made '' copy '' out of persons and incidents well-known in
Hart	PERSON	- ford , which may readily be believed by anyone who recalls the unblushing fashion in which , in a pre - vious novel , he used -LRB- and perverted -RRB- the materials of his observation of university life in
California	LOCATION	.

THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
June 1	DATE	.

		Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	combines in admirable balance the functions of war-correspondent and novelist .

		When the piping times of peace are at hand , he will sit down to his desk and write you as pretty a story as you could wish to read in an idle hour , and when the war-trumpet sounds , he will sally forth until he is in the thick of the scrimmage collecting observations for a graphic portrayal of the scene of carnage .

		It is this dual activity that now gives us ''
Lucy	PERSON	of the Stars '' as a successor to * ` With
Kuroki	PERSON	in
Manchuria	LOCATION	. ''

		We like Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's poi ` trait of the imaginary Lucy , as we liked his portrait of the real
Kuroki	PERSON	, but we object most strenuously to the fate that he has bestowed upon her .

		It is true that
Carniston	ORGANIZATION	is a weak creature , undeserving of her love , since he rejects it to become a mere fortune-hunter , but the story is nevertheless progressing toward a chastened romantic reconcili - ation between the two , when he abruptly abandons her for the second time , and elects to marry the American heiress .

		We also object to the wanton killing , in a railway accident , of the American poli - tician who loves the aforesaid heiress , both because his is the most sympathetic masculine figure in the novel , and because the heiress does not deserve so cruel a blow .

		Since the story itself is so unsatis - factorily managed , about all that is left for our enjoyment is Lucy herself , but she has our unquali - fied allegiance from first to last .

		The story is more than worth reading for her sake , even if its outcome does rudely shock our romantic sensibilities .

		What will the novelist do when
Southwestern Europe	LOCATION	becomes frank and obvious , like unto the rest of the tourist-ridden Continent , and it is no longer possible to carve out a mysterious Zenda or Graustark from its recesses ?

		We have had much joy in these imaginary principalities since the fashion of exploiting them began with Mr.
Hope	PERSON	's '' Prisoner , '' and
Crevonia	PERSON	, the latest of them to appear as a candidate for our favor , is quite as inter - esting as the others .

		Mr.
Ervin Wardman	PERSON	is the inventor , or discoverer , or patentee , of this latest addition to romantic geography , and '' The Princess Olga '' is the name given to his chronicle .

		The hero is an American , a mining engineer , and a very
Napoleon	PERSON	of his profession .

		He proves equally adept in executive ability , strategy and `` bluff , '' and we are serenely confident from the start that he will succeed in whatever he sets out to accomplish .

		Since one of these objects is to win the Princess
Olga	PERSON	, we care little for the trifling fact that she is the avowed opponent of his plans , even going so far AS to shoot him at a certain critical juncture .

		Of course she succumbs in the end , resigns her kingdom to the bankers , and prepares to share the hero 's life in the new world .

		The story is compact of in - trigue , adventure , and general nervous excitement ; it is a capital production of its sort , and the most jaded novel - reader will not fall asleep while read - ing it .

		`` The Genius , '' a novel which portrays the life and death of a great musician , opens unhappily with a mistaken comparison of the Russian calendar with that used elsewhere in the civilized world .

		A trivial error , no doubt , but it compels a moment 's attention .

		We are with the hero from the hour of his birth , and we toil through lengthy chapters , discursive in substance and heavy in manner of presentation , before he is brought to the verge of manhood .

		Then , by slow degrees , he becomes more and more interesting , until we approach the tragic climax , when interest gives place to absorption , and we realize that the difiiculties which beset the open - ing of the narrative were perhaps necessary to the scheme of portrayal .

		As a study of the artistic temperament , bas ^ to a certain extent upon the life of Tschaikowsky -- although more upon his works than upon the facts of his external history -- the book offers us a delineation of remarkable subtlety and sympathetic insight .

		The story is a sad one -- a story must necessarily be sad which aims to depict the character that finds expression in the
Pathetic Symphony	ORGANIZATION	, and ends with the self-destruction of the protagonist .

		Being concerned with the life musical , the writer has much to say about music , and her opinions range all the way from those which reveal a genuine appreciation of musical beauty to those which show nothing but blindness of vision .

		The latter part of this statement must be justified by a quotation , and here it is .

		The subject of the comment is
Mozart	LOCATION	, and we are told of '' the simple , wearisome , weakly-flowing syrup of obviousness , which constitutes the secret of that master 's popu - larity . ''

		With these amazing words are we directed to the very Holy of Holies of the musician 's place of worship !

		Arnold 's description of Shelley as an '' ineffectual angel '' becomes by comparison a pro- found critical pronouncement .

		The legendary settlement of
Norumbega	ORGANIZATION	is the scene of '' Randvar the Songsmith , '' the latest of the Norse romances of Miss Liljencrantz .

		The time is that of the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	, and the scene is pre - sumably the present
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, for the old En - glish mill at
Newport	LOCATION	is reinvested with its legendary attribution of Norse origin , and made to serve as a home for the hero .

		This minstrel-hero is a King 's son who lives a sort of hermit existence until he is drawn into the train of the chieftain of
Norumbega	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his subsequent relation to
Jarl Helvin	PERSON	, his part is that of a
David	PERSON	to his master 's Said , for the
Jarl	PERSON	has accessions of madness , and only the minstrel 's songs can soothe him .

		Randvar is like
David	PERSON	in another respect also , for he has a keen eye for the beauty of woman , and it is for the sake of the fair but haughty
Brynhild	LOCATION	,
Helvin	ORGANIZATION	's sister , that he de - serts solitude for the life of the court .

		It is needless to say that his passion is finally rewarded , and that
Brynhild	PERSON	's pride dissolves in tenderness .

		It is a pretty story that
Miss Liljencrantz	PERSON	has told , and has many elements of popularity .

		It exemplifies , of coui ` se , the artificial romantic convention , but only a pedant would find fault with it on that score .

		, `` A Motor Car Divorce , '' by Miss
Louise Closser Hale	PERSON	, tells the story of a tour in
Italy	LOCATION	, undertaken
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 367 by a married pair of ten years ' conjugal experience , who make an amicable agreement to separate , and plan the journey as a probable means of supplying a colorable showing of grievances .

		The idea of the divorce is the wife 's alone , but the husband gives his acquiescence with suspicious cheerfulness .

		Of course we know that nothing of the sort will ever happen , but the situation lends itself to enough effective light comedy to make an entertaining story .

		The chief ingredients thereof are modem slang , trivial humor , frothy sentiment , and pickings of guide-book infor - mation .

		From the romance of sixteenth-century
France	LOCATION	to the realism of modern
New York	LOCATION	is a long step , but
Miss Runkle	PERSON	has taken it in giving us ' • The Truth about Tolna , '' as a successor to '' The Helmet of Navarre . ''

		At first , it seems that she has at least provided us with a romantic hero , for
Tolna	ORGANIZATION	is an operatic singer with long hair and a soulful voice , whose tenor notes touch to rapture many calloused -LRB- feminine -RRB- souls in the metropolitan purgator -RCB- - .

		He is presented to us , moreover , as a patriotic Hungarian , burning with love for his oppressed country , and standing proudly aloof from the pettj - preoccupations of everj ` day humanity .

		But alas for our delusions I He is not a Hungarian at all , but a native of
New York	LOCATION	, and the patriotic-poetic business is merely a scheme of his unscrupulous manager .

		He has a marvellous voice but a commonplace individuality , and his natural speech is the debased dialect of modern society and the modern newspaper .

		His
New York	LOCATION	engagement results in a renewal of relations with a sweetheart of his childhood , and a love-match is the natural consequence .

		Another love-match is arranged between the unscrupulous manager already mentioned and a capricious heiress , and the two affairs are delayed in their consumma - tion until the narrative has been spun out to the requisite length .

		This frothy story is moderately entertaining , but is not to be taken seriously from any point of view .

June 1,1906	DATE	.

		THE JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY WITH the beginning of the current year , this important journal was changed from a quarterly to a monthly .

		It is believed that its value as a record of practical economics will now be greater than ever .

		The support which has been accorded The Journal during its thirteen years of publication warrants the editors ' confidence at this time in assuming the additional expense involved in monthly publication .

		The present year has been an eventful one for The Journal .

		Wide - spread interest was aroused by the following articles in particular : `` Railway Rates as Protective Tariffs '' By
HUGO R. MEYER	PERSON	`` Government Regulation of Railway Rates '' By
B. H. MEYER	PERSON	`` The Employment of Women in Industries '' By
SOPHONISBA P. BRECKINRIDGE	PERSON	`` The Unions versus Higher Wages '' By
J. LAURENCE LAUGHLIN	PERSON	`` Municipal Ownership in
Great Britain	LOCATION	'' By
EVERETT W. BURDETT	PERSON	We are still in a position to supply these interesting numbers if orders for the complete volume are received .

		Subscriptions may therefore be entered dating from the beginning of the year .

		The Journal will continue to represent the views of the economists of
America	LOCATION	in the broadest and most impartial way .

		It deserves the support of all scholars , journalists , and men of affairs who wish to keep in touch with contemporary thought on these subjects .

		`` Goethe 's heart , which few knew , was as great as his intellect , which all know . ''

		This was Jung-Stilling 's tribute to the personality of the great ix -RRB- et who is often taken as the type of OljTnpian detachment from the petty preoccu - pations of onlinarv humanity .

		It is the fate of genius to be misunderstood by the commonalty .

		The loftier its expression , and the more sweeping its universalit -RCB- ' , the less does genius concern itseK with those accidents of life which are the whole , or nearly the whole , of existence to the commonplace mvdtitude .

		The average man , made vaguely uncomfortable by such glimpses of the eternal verities as he gets when he at - tempts to share the vision of some great spirit , restores the balance of his self-satisfaction by charging the poet with heartlessness , or cynicism , or cold selfishness , or some other disagreeable quality .

		Among the writers of our owti time ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	has been particularly singled out as the target for this sort of criticism , yet we imagine that Jung-Stilling 's words about Groethe would closely fit
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's case also , and that it is the critics themselves who are really chargeable with defective sympathies .

		Ibsen presented , no doubt , a somewhat grim front to the world of superficial observers , and die comparative solitude of soul in which he worked out his problems upon the ethical chess - board was reflected in the hermit-like habit of his visible existence .

		But ail this was nothing more llian the iron restraint demanded by his self - imposed task : he felt himself bound to husband and concentrate his energies ; he did not dare to squander any considerable fraction of them upon barren social interests and relationships .

		He had sufficient strength of will to make this sacrifice , but there is much reason to believe that he felt it keenly , and that volcanic fires were at play beneath the cold crust of his outward seeming .

		Is not this what we really mean when we speak of any man as `` crusty , '' ' and is not the word , rightly considered , a term of praise rather than of reproach ?

		TVlioever reads with discernment the plays and poems of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	will have no difficxilty in finding passages which reveal the warmest of human sympathies , passages which fairly throb with the feelings of a singularly sensitive nature .

		Not only the romantic effusions of his early man - hood , but the ripest of the series of dramatic social studies peld such fruit as this .

		And the ineffable tenderness of certain scenes in '' Brand '' and '' Peer Gynt '' most emphatically give the lie to the assertion that their author was a '' cold hater of his kind , '' a morose and heartless spectator of the tragi-comedy of life .

		These scenes make us feel that he had to sub - ject himself to strong compulsion to keep from lapsing into an emotionalism that would have defeated the essential purpose of his work , and 380 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, to ignore them is to be wilfully blind to his deep - est teachings .

		These revelations of the Ibsen intime who was conjoined with the dramatic teclmician are clear enough for all except the most careless observers , and they may readily be corroborated by the sort of personal evidence wliich has to be our sole reliance in the case of men who produce no works whereby they may be judged .

		We can recall many instances of pilgrims , often total strangers , who have sought out '' the old bard in the solitary house , '' and returned to tell of the sincerity of their reception and the warmth of their welcome .

		Their report has been of no ogTC , but of a human being , wrapped indeed in simple dignity , but the embodiment of kindly human sympathies and interests .

		When we turn to the recently-published let - ters of the great Norwegian , we shall find no lack of the personal element needed as a corrective of the impression produced by the works alone .

		Here are some extracts from a letter addressed to his sister : '' Months have passed since I received your kind let - ter -- and only now do I answer it .

		But so much stands between and separates us , separates me from home .

		Understand this , please , and do not think that it is in - difference which has kept me silent all these long years , and even this
summer	DATE	.

		I camiot write letters ; I must be near in person and give myself wholly and entirely .

		... So our dear old mother is dead .

		I thank you for having so lovingly fulfilled the duties which were in - cumbent on us all .

		You are certainly the best .

		I do a great deal of wandering about the world .

		Who knows but that I may come to
Norway	LOCATION	next
summer	DATE	; then I must see the old home to which I still cling with so many roots .

		Give father my love ; explain to him about me -- all that you understand so well , and that he per - haps does not .

		... Do not think that I lack the warmth of heart which is the first requisite where a true and vigorous spiritual life is to tlirive . ''

		Side by side with this letter we must place the
one of eight years later	DATE	, written upon receipt of the news of his father 's death .

		`` The occasion of my writing you to-day you will , dear uncle , easily guess .

		The foreign papers and a letter from
Hedvig	ORGANIZATION	have informed me of my old father 's death ; and I feel impelled to express my heartfelt thanks to all those of the family whose affectionate assistance has made life easier for him for so many years , and who have , therefore , done in my behalf or in my stead what imtil quite lately I have not been in a position to do .

		... It has been a great consolation to me to know that my parents were surrounded by attached relatives ; and the thanks that I now offer for all the kind assistance rendered to those who are gone , are also due for the assistance thereby rendered myself .

		Yes , dear imcle , let me tell you , and ask you in turn to tell the others , tliat your and their fulfillment , out of affection for my parents , of what was my boimden duty , has been a great support to me during my toils and endeavours , and has furthered the accomplishment of my work in this world . ''

		The real
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	is very apparent in the two family letters from which quotation has just been made .

		And it is apparent in many scattered passages concerning his domestic affairs , pas - sages which reveal the sympathetic aspect of his relations with his wife , and the solicitude with which he superintended the education of his only son .

		There is also the evidence of a real genius for friendship in the letters to
Brandes	LOCATION	,
Hegel	PERSON	, and a few others -- even in the letters to and about
Bjornson	PERSON	, for
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's break with the latter was an affair of the intellect , which , although it tugged at his heart-strings , did not tear them asunder .

		It is true that
Ibsen	PERSON	did not admit many friends to his intimacy -- deeming them a luxury denied him by his sacred mission , -- but he gi'appled the chosen few to his soul ^ vith hoops of steel .

		And if he did not freely give himself to others in life , he assuredly did so in his books , which need only to be read aright to reveal a rich and many-sided j -RRB- ersonality rather than the coldly intellectual monster of popidar legend .

		COMMUNICATIONS .

		A DISTINGUISHED EDITORIAL CAREER .

		-LRB- To the Editor of The Dial . -RRB-

		Editorial continuity is so rare a virtue in the period - ical literature of the time that one might well be jjar - doned for forgetting that it exists at all .

		Even the permanence of an individual editor is no guarantee of permanence in editorial policy , for editors themselves are often prone to strike the momentarily popular note .

		In a period of such capricious change , a long career of editorial work upon lines wisely chosen and consistently maintained constitutes one of the most valuable services which it is in the power of an educated and thoughtfid citizen to render to American life and literature .

		Length and quality of service both considered , we know no more honorable example of such a career than that of Mr.
Wendell Phillips Garrison	PERSON	, who has felt constrained to pass over to yomiger shoulders the edi - torial responsibility for '' The Nation , '' which he has borne so admirably from the initial number down to the end of the present volume .

		Associated with the late Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	in all the earlier years of this career , Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	applied to the field of literature the same high standards that his colleague insisted upon in the realm of politics .

		No literary '' fad '' was ever reflected in the columns of his paper because it was popular , no shabby woi ' k was praised or condoned through a desire to pro- pitiate an influential author or publisher .

		Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	's editorial plan had no place in it for the exploitation of any individual , least of all of himself .

		Year after year '' The Nation '' has borne to its readers , without the slightest indication of authorship , the work of men so distinguished in the field of scholarsliip and letters that many periodicals would have blazoned their names across the cover in huge letters as the chief feature of the issue .

		Of course there are those who believe in signed rather than unsigned reviews , and have good grounds
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 381 for their opinion .

		We do not discuss that question here , but merely call attention to Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	's unswerving adherence to his ideal , although he was able to command the collaboration of men whose mere names could readily have been used to the material advantage of his paper .

		His steady aim was to give to '' The Nation '' a character and influence of its own , wholly independent of the various and necessarily changing personalities engaged in its production ; and in this aim he has achieved a dis - tinguished success .

		The foundations which he has laid give to his followers a magnificent opportunity .

		They take over a periodical whose influence with its constit - uency , a constituency of exceptional cultivation and thoughtfulness , has rarely had its counterpart in the history of the American periodical press .

		They are men who have observed the methods by which a great literary institution has been built up , and it is safe to assume that they are aware of the hold which that institution possesses upon the respect and affection of its constituency .

		It is to be assumed that they will take pride in maintaining the high ideals which have had so firm a rooting and so steady a growth under the direction of Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	, and with those ideals to mark their general course no one will begrudge them the legitimate exercise of their individual gifts in the conduct of the work to which , thanks to efforts of their prede - cessor , we may call it their distinguished good fortime to have been chosen .

		As for Mr.
Garrison	PERSON	himself , everyone will hope that the laying down of his editorial burden will leave him still many years of health and comfort , with physical strength suifficient to put into permanent form some record of the impressions which his unique editorial experience of so many years has left upon him .

		A NEW THEORY OF ENGLISH METRE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
Thk Dial	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		Theories of English versification have been so numer - ous , so hopelessly contradictory , and so regardless of passages which nullify their validity , that most students either ignore all theories and follow their own whims or else fall back upon dogma and defy exceptions .

		In twenty years , of many books and essays on the subject only two in English have won anything like unstinted and general praise ; and they are not praised because they have set forth satisfying theories .

		The delight which most students have taken in Professor Mayor 's '' Chapters on English Metre '' is due , I think , rather to his willingness to admit other points of view than to any g ^ reat success in explaining contradictory passages .

		Professor
Alden	PERSON	's '' English Verse , '' although surprising for the amount of its material and the skill with which it is arranged , is so far from solving the many problems which it states with great care and precision , that it provoked one well-known writer to suggest , in `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	, '' his willingness to dispense with theories altogether .

		As a matter of history , it can be shown that the varying theories held from generation to generation have modified , sometimes in important respects , the practice of our poets .

		Happily , however , most of our poets have risen superior to the bonds of imperfect theories , and have left perennially delightful and satisfying poetry .

		It is hard to believe , therefore , that there is not some law of verse which is really fundamental , and which has thus far escaped clear statement and general acceptance only because , under its Protean applications , we have failed to recognize its simplicity .

		In
1903	DATE	, Mr.
T. S. Omond	PERSON	issued '' A Study of Metre '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	: Grant
Richards	PERSON	-RRB- , a thoughtful and acute essay , which seems thus far to have attracted relatively little attention .

		Within a few months , Mr.
Omond	PERSON	has again entered the field with a pamphlet entitled '' Metrical Rhythm '' -LRB- Tunbridge Wells :
R. Pelton	PERSON	,
1905	DATE	-RRB- , in which he applies his theory to the examination of another pamphlet , '' The Basis of English Rhythm , '' by Will - iam
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Glasgow	LOCATION	:
W. & R. Holmes	ORGANIZATION	,
1904	DATE	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	's essay is at least difBcult to understand , and unsatisfactory , even after patient study .

		Mr.
Omond	PERSON	's theory , however , seems to me so reasonable and so ade - quate as to deserve open-minded consideration .

		Mr.
Omond	PERSON	's theory is , briefly , that we confuse syl - lables , which only mark the time , with the time itself .

		The tune of the different feet in a line is relatively the same , but this time may be more or less fully taken up by the syllables .

		In Mr.
Omond	PERSON	's own words : '' If periods constitate rhythm , they must do so by unifonn succession .

		Syllables do not supply this abeolnte recorrenoe ; their order of succession is chaneefnl , capricious .

		They need to be contrasted with underlying onifonnity .

		That substratum seons afforded by time .

		Itochronu * periodt form the units of metre .

		Syllabic variation gets its whole force from contrast with these , is conceivable only in relation to these . ''

		-LRB-
Study of Metre	ORGANIZATION	, 4 .

		> '' Syllables exist before verse handles than , and are not wholly amenable to its handling .

		They can not be coaxed to keep exact time , and of course can not be chopped or carved into fragments .

		From this very inability .

		p > oets in their unconscioos inspiration draw beauty .

		They delight us by maintaining a con - tinual slight conflict between syllables and time .

		It must not go too far , or the sense of rhythm perishes , and the line becomes heavy , inert , , prosy .

		But within limits the contest is unceasing . ''

		-LRB- Metrical Rhythm .

		21 .

		i '' Accentual scansionists nearly always minimize the differ - ence between verse and prose .

		For , taking English syllables by themselves , there is reaUy no difference .

		The difference -- a real and true one -- lies in the setting .

		Verse seta syllables to equal tfane-measores , prose to unequal .

		When either poaches on the other 's preserve , we are apt to resent it .

		One heroic line in prose may escat > e notice , but hardly a second .

		That the difference does not lie in the syllables themselves appears from the fact that the same sentence may sometimes be read as prose and sometimes as verse .

		When we first read ' And the doors shall be shut in the streets when the sotmd of the grrinding is low , ' we probably hear it as prose ; but once let it be compared with -- * I am out of humanity 's reach , I must finish my journey alone , ' and it wiU be difficult ever after not to receive an impression of vCTse . ''

		-LRB- lb. , 24 . -RRB- ''

		Just as the difference between prose and verse is one of setting , so is the difference between duple and triple metre .

		It depends on bow we hear the time-beats .

		Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	says -LRB- foot of p. 36 ^ , ` Had Mr.
Lanier	PERSON	or Mr.
Omond	PERSON	met `` Who would believe '' or `` Seemed to have known '' in
Browning	PERSON	's ` Kentish Sir Byng stood for his king , ' they would have had no doubt at all of its triple character . '

		I should have had no doubt that the words were then set to triple rhythm , because to my mind that is clearly the time of
Browning	PERSON	's poem ; but when I meet these phrases in heroic or octosyllabic verse , I read them to a different time .

		In themselves the syllables are not metrical , but they can be set to either rhythm .

		The poem gives rhythm to the syllables , not the syllables to the poem . '

		For poets do not adjust time to syllables , but syllables to time . ' ''

		-LRB- lb. , 25 . -RRB-

		Almost ever since Mr.
Omond	PERSON	's Study appeared , I have been testing his theory upon the numerous puzzling lines with which our good poetry is sown thick .

		Thus far it seems to me fairly to meet all difficulties , and to harmonize apparently conflicting notions in a way that is Uluminating and satisfying .

		I wish very much that others would test Mr.
Omond	PERSON	's ideas ; if he is right , we shall have a more solid basis to bmld on ; if he is wrono - or only partly right , honest criticism will cer - tainly be instructive .

		382 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, C ^ `` ^ cto § 00 hs .

		A Rollicking Irish Story-Teller .

		* Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	has well said that '' person - ally , Lever was doubtless a charming companion , and for mere companionship his books are charming enough still .

		Only they must not be regarded as books , but simply as reports of the conversation of a lively raconteur ^ True as it is that excessive bookishness is the bane of creative authorship , it is equally beyond question that a little more of this quality in Lever would have improved the exuberant out - put of his rollicking fancy by reducing its chaotic extravagance to better form .

		Thus a good life of our effervescent Irishman might well furnish more delight to confirmed book-readers than do his wonderful attempts at novel - writing .

		The biography by Dr.
W. J. Fitzpatrick	PERSON	, published twenty-seven years ago , was felt by the family to be far from faultless .

		Chronologically inac - curate it certainly is , and the complaint has been raised against it that somehow it tends to leave the reader depressed rather than elevated , which no true picture of the jovial Lever would be expected to do .

		Mr.
Edmimd Downey	PERSON	, in his recently issued work , '' Charles Lever : His Life in his Letters , '' seeks to correct the earlier biographer 's errors , and by confining himself mainly to the novelist 's own revelations of him - self in his letters , in his early '' Log-Book of a Rambler , '' and in the autobiographical prefaces to eight of his novels -- prefaces that he wrote in the last year of his life , and therefore unfor - tunately left incomplete -- Mr.
Downey	PERSON	has produced what seems to be a trustworthy account of the man , so far as it goes ; and the average reader will probably think , on viewing the two 400-page volumes , that it goes quite far enough .

		Yet not even its careful workmanship gives it the flavor of an ideal biography .

		But ideal biographies are as rare as violets in
October	DATE	, and perhaps the subject in this instance does not admit of an ideal book .

		One attraction , how - ever , it does have for intending buyers : its price is less purgative to the purse than that of many current English two-volume works of like char - acter .

		With a disinterested desire to secure the best possible life of his hero , Mr.
Downey	PERSON	had asked Lever 's eldest daughter , Mrs.
Nevill	PERSON	, to attempt the task .

		This wa s ten years ago ; but the lady 's • Charles Lever : His Life in his Letters .

		By
Edmund Downey	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		With portraits .


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		sudden death thwarted that plan , and now Mr ,
Downey	PERSON	himself , making use of many letters placed at his disposal , essays the portrayal of Charles Lever , the author , seeking , as he says ^ to present him '' in a more intimate and pleasing light than the picture which is furnished by Dr.
Fitzpatrick	PERSON	. ''

		The preface proceeds in further explanation : '' Incidentally many errors into which Dr.
Fitzpatrick	PERSON	had fallen are corrected , but I am not making any at - tempt to supersede his painstaking , voluminous , and interesting biography .

		Dr.
Fitzpatrick	PERSON	declares that his book ' largely embraces the earlier period of Lever 's ^ life ' ; the present work deals mainly with his literary life , and contains , especially in the second volume , fresh and illuminating material which was not disclosed to - Lever 's previous biographer , and which affords an inti - mate view of the novelist as he saw himself and his work . ''

		The letters of Lever are in much the same scrambling style as his books , and from them nothing like a complete life of him could be pro- duced .

		Accordingly we are glad to find in the first volume no fewer than 119 pages of Mr.
Downey	PERSON	's filling-in , as well as 35 pages from '' The Log-Book of a Rambler , '' an account of early European wanderings and German-student life that originally appeared , in large part , in '' The
Dublin	LOCATION	Literary Gazette '' at intervals during the year
1830	DATE	.

		Mr.
Downey	PERSON	's second volume has far less matter from his own pen .

		In truth , it is safe to say that most readers would gladly have more of the modest biographer and less of the not so modest hero of his narrative .

		Comment and criticism , even where we disagree , make pleasant reading , and help to relieve the monotony .

		And monotonous Lever 's letters , in spite of their Leveresque qualities , do tend to become when offered in so generous instalments as Mr.
Downey	PERSON	has seen fit to publish .

		As an outline of Lever 's life , it may be con - venient to recall that he was bom in
Dublin	LOCATION
Aug. 31 , 1806	DATE	, g.s nearly as can now be deter - mined ; for even this initial date the reckless Irishman , unregardfid of future biographers , ^ left in much uncertainty .

		He even allowed '' Men of the Time '' to state that he was bom in
1809	DATE	-- - perhaps because of the much good company he found in that year .

		He received a medical education , and practised successfully at home and abroad , especially at
Brussels	LOCATION	, where he somewhat unwarrantably styled himself Physician to the
British Embassy	ORGANIZATION	.

		For a few years he edited '' The
Dublin University Maga	ORGANIZATION	- zine , '' an uncongenial task , but from
1845	DATE	he dwelt almost uninterruptedly abroad , chiefly at
Florence	LOCATION	,
Spezzia	LOCATION	, and
Trieste	LOCATION	-- in a considar capacity at the last two places .

		To the vnie of his youth , it is pleasant to leam , this arch - Bohemian was affectionately devoted throughout her life , which closed two years before his own .

		To her mem - ory he was no less loyally true .

		So attached had he become to this lady in his courting days that he privately wedded her , against the wishes of his parents , who desired for their brilliant son a gootl match in a pecuniary sense : whereas Miss
Kate Baker	PERSON	, of
County Meath	LOCATION	, had little but her personal charms and her virtues to recommend her .

		The '' Log - Book , '' which forms Mr.
Downey	PERSON	's second chapter , is most agreeable reading , the more so jjerhaps because it is so hard to tell whether fact is not often tinged ynth fiction .

		Two student duels at
Gottingen	LOCATION	, one of them a grave affair with pistols , prove especially in - spiring to young Lever 's graphic and lively pen .

		The letters , which claim the biographer 's space in an increasing degree as we read on , are fidl of the writer 's hopes of worldly atlvancement .

		In fact , not a few of them ti-eat very largely of pounds , shillings , and penc `` , or their continental equivalents .

		Here are portions of two tyijical letters from
Brussels	LOCATION	, written soon after Lever had established himself in practice there .

		Dots and brackets are retained as in the pi-inted copy .

		`` Although
Brussels	LOCATION	fulfils all ray expectations , I might be ultimately tempted to try my luck in
London	LOCATION	or
Paris	LOCATION	-LSB- as a medical man -RSB- ... Attending to an out - break of measles has prevented me from sending my usual contribution to the Mag .

		... I have definitely raised my fees from
5 francs	MONEY	to 10 francs -- double that of any other English physician , and five times the fee of the Belgian practitioner ... The sister of the Am - bassador has recovered under my hands from what was universally believed to be a fatal case of spasmodic croup ... There is nothing but gaiety and going out here every night , and I am half wishing for smnmer to have a little rest and quietness . '' ''

		I am carrying ahead with a very strong hand , and have little dances weekly .

		I had three earls and two ambassadors on
Tuesday	DATE	, and am keeping that set ex - clusively in my interest . ''

		This '' carrying ahead with a very strong hand '' was Lever 's weakness through life .

		Though he earned large simis from his writings , and enjoyed also a good income as a physician , and later as consul , he coidd not resist the charms of horseflesh and of the green table .

		His life , in short , was as chaotic and ill-regulated as that of
Harry Lorrequer	PERSON	or
Charles O'Malley	PERSON	.

		He seems to have been more eager for and dependent upon adidation than even his contem - porary
Dickens	PERSON	, and to have had considerably less of solid and enduring resources in himself than had the bi-illiant-necktied English novelist .

		But let us quote a most favorable description of him from the pen of Miss
Mary Boyle	PERSON	, a bright woman , a clever writer , and a friend of
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	, the Brownings , and other contemporary litter ati .

		Li a letter of
1879	DATE	she i-ecalls Lever as '' one of the most genidl spirits '' she had ever met . ''

		His conversation was like
summer	DATE	lightning -- brilliant , sparkling , harmless .

		In his wildest sallies I never heard him give utterance to an unkind thought .

		He essentially resembled his works , and whichever you preferred , that one was most like Charles Lever .

		He was the complete type and model of an Irishman -- warm-hearted , witty , rollicking , never unrefined , im - prudent , often blind to his own interests -- adored by his friends , and the playfellow of his children and the gigantic boar-hound he had brought from the
Tyrol	LOCATION	. ''

		That Lever did not care to fraternize with the
Brownings	PERSON	, his feUow-Florentines , one can easily aecoimt for ; but let us hear our author 's expla - nation .

		`` The only plausible explanation of Lever 's neglect of the Brownings is that he did not feel quite at ease in the presence of the author of '
Aurora Leigh	LOCATION	. '

		When he sought mental relaxation , after a hard day 's work , he sought it in the society of those who were content to listen to his agreeable rattle rather than in the society of those to whom he should lend his ears .

		He was by no means insensible to feminine charms , mental or physical .

		He gloried in praise coming from the mouths of intellectual women .

		But the woman of genius was not the comrade he coveted in his hours of ease : the companionship of men -- of good talkers or good lis - teners -- was what he craved . ''

		Dr.
Fitzpatrick	PERSON	, as the reader is reminded by a footnote , makes the surprising assertion that Lever was intimately associated with the Bro \ Naiings in
Florence	LOCATION	, and '' found real charm in the companionship '' -- which a letter of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's to
Miss Mitford	LOCATION	, quoted by Mr. Do \ \ Tiey , abundantly disproves .

		Lever 's never - satisfied longing for inward peace finds utterance in the following extract from one of his letters to
John Blackwood	PERSON	, of which the second volume contains rather more than a sufficiency .

		Writing from
Trieste	LOCATION	in
1868	DATE	, the novelist thus despond - ently imbosoms himself to his friendly publisher : `` It is a great aggravation to dying to feel that I must be buried here .

		I never hated a place or people so much , and it is a hard measure to lay me down amongst them where I have no chance of getting away till that grand new deal of the pack before distributing the stakes .

		I wish I could write one more O 'D .

		-- ' the last
O'Dowd	PERSON	. '

		I have a number of little valueless legacies to leave the world , and could put them into codieU form and direct their destination ... The cheque came all right , but I was not able to thank you at the time .

		Give my love to Mrs.
Blackwood	PERSON	, and say that it was always fleeting across me , in moments of relief , I was to meet you both again and be very jolly 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, And light-hearted .

		Who knows !

		I have moments still that seem to promise a rally ; hut there must be a long spell of absence from pain and anxiety -- not so easy things to accomplish . ''

		It is a relief to learn , from other sources , that when death did come to this good-natured but sadly improvident fellow-countrynian of Gold - smith , his family was left in better circumstances than might have been expected .

		And the last scene itseK of this unquiet life was beautifully peaceful , as depicted by Mrs.
Porter	PERSON	-LRB- an eye - Avitness -RRB- in '' The
House of Blackwood	ORGANIZATION	, '' from which Mr.
Downey	PERSON	has , in closing , reproduced a few paragraphs .

		Two portraits of Lever , young and old , deco - rate the volumes , and they are as unlike as were ever two pictures of one who in youth was unmistakably father of the mature man .

		Mr.
Downey	PERSON	's index -- if a critic may be allowed the privilege of a parting grumble -- leaves much to be desired .

		One looks in vain for references to
Dublin	LOCATION	,
Brussels	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	,
Spezzia	LOCATION	,
Trieste	LOCATION	, and other milestones in Lever 's life-journey ; and as there is no entry for '' Charles Lever , '' the main events of his very eventful life must be gathered from a diligent thumbing of the preceding eight hundred pages .

		Such names as the index does contain are followed merely by indication of volume and page , or by a succession of such indications , with no kindly clue to the more exact nature of the information referred to .

		But what further could one expect from merely a quinquepaginal quintessence of all the rich variety of matter gathered together by Mr.
Downey	PERSON	's industry ?

		Fortunately , the average reader -- that is , the sensible reader , who reads for entertainment and , if it so may chance , for edification -- is always chiefly interested in what precedes the index ; and in the present instance he will not search in vain for readable matter concerning this early and mid-Victorian author , whose popularity stUl continues .

		to follow the method of the critical reviewers .

		Even after reading through the
1200	DATE	pages of the two volumes before us , it is impossible to attempt any systematic review of the work .

		It will require the services of many geologists , working through a decade or more , properly to estimate and test the many startling hypotheses which the authors have presented .

		It is their own attempt to read the history of the earth in the light of principles developed in their earlier volume , which appeared in
1904	DATE	and is now in a second edition .

		In that volume was given a statement of the planetismal hypothesis of earth origin .

		In these new volumes the hypothesis is developed and applied , and its application re - quires a new reading of dynamical geology , with a consequent new interpretation of geologic his - tory .

		An excellent example of the difference appears in the interpretation of the Cambrian , where the great transgression of the sea is re - ferred to superficial rather than profound defor - mation , and is considered to mark a period of long quiescence rather than one of earth move - ment .

		Another notable feature of the work is the attention paid to past climates and the use made of them in interpretation .

		The explana - tion of glacial periods in the
Permian	LOCATION	as well as in the Pleistocene as the indirect residt of de - formation acting through changes in the consti - tution of the atmosphere , may be cited .

		The argument in bald outline is as follows : Defor - mation exposes areas of unaltered rocks and stimulates erosion .

		This leads to the carbona - tion of the rocks and so to a reduction in the amount of carbonic acid gas in the atmosphere .

		The latter , thus thinned , is unable to retain the heat radiated from the earth , and a period of low temperature results .

		The many fascinating incidental problems connected with such a hy - pothesis are attacked in detail , and plausible suggestions as to their solution are made .

		From still another point of view the books are notable .

		In
1891	DATE	, when the Congres Geo - logique International was to meet at
Washington	LOCATION	,
Major J. W. Powell	PERSON	, then Director of the
Geological Survey	ORGANIZATION	, arranged for a series of cor - relation essays in which should be discussed separately the
Carboniferous	LOCATION	, Cretaceous , Eo - cene , and other rock systems of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		These essays were designed to reflect the existing state of knowledge regarding each sys - tem , and also to throw light upon the proper methods of correlation .

		The plan grew , and the reports were not finished until after the Con - gress adjourned ; the last essay , that on the
Archean	ORGANIZATION	and Algonkian by
Van Hise	PERSON	, having
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 385 appeared in
1892	DATE	.

		The series as a whole was notable in the emphasis laid upon paleontolog -RCB- ' as the best means of correlation , The
Chamberlin	PERSON	-
Salisburj	PERSON	- text-book is the first large and sys - tematic attempt to correlate the stratigraphy of this country that has been made since the period of these essays .

		It is interesting to observ ^ e that the authors have taken physical changes as their key in making correlations .

		Their reasons for doing so are statetl as follows : '' We believe that there is a natural basis of time - division , that it is recorded dynamically in the pro- founder changes of the earth 's history , and that its basis is world-wide in its applicability .

		It is expressed in interruptions of the course of the earth 's history .

		It can hardly take accoimt of all local details , and can not be applied with minuteness to all localities , since geo - logical history is nesessarily continuous .

		But even a continuous history has its times and seasons , and the pul - sations of history are the natural basis for its divisions . ''

		In our view , the fundamental basis for geologic time divisions has its seat in the heart of the earth .

		When - ever the accumulated stresses within the body of the earth over-match its effective rigidity , a readjustment takes place .

		The deformative movements begin , for reasons previously set forth , with a depression of the bot - toms of the oceanic basins , by which their capacity is in - creased .

		The epicontinental waters are correspondingly withdra \ \ Ti into them .

		The effect of this is practically universal , and all continents are affected in a similar way and simultaneously .

		This is the reason why the classification of one continent is also applicable , in its larger features , to another , though the configuration of each individual modifies the result of the change , so far as that continent is concerned .

		The far-reaching effects of such a withdrawal of the sea have been indicated repeatedly in the preceding pages .

		Foremost among these effects is the profound influence exerted on the evolution of the shallow-water marine life , the most constant and reliable of the means of intercontinental correlation .

		Second only to this in importance is the influence on terrestrial life through the connections and disconnections that control migration .

		Springing from the same deformative movements are geographic and topographic changes , affecting not only the land but also the sea currents .

		These changes affect the climate directly , and by accelerating or retarding the chemical reactions between the atmosphere , hydrosphere , and lithosphere , affect the constitution of both sea and air , and thus indirectly influence the environment of life , and through it , its evolution .

		In these deformative movements , therefore , there seems to us to be a uni - versal , simultaneous , and fimdamental basis for the subdi ^ Tsion of the earth 's history .

		It is all the more effective and applicable , because it controls the progress of life , which furnishes the most available criteria for its application in detail to the varied rock formations in all quarters of the globe . ''

		The use of these criteria gives M-idespread im - conformities large importance , and accordingly certain changes in nomenclature are made .

		The old Lower Silurian is reorganized as truly inde - pendent , as many have contended , and is called Ordovician .

		It is suggested that possibly a portion of the Cambrian belongs with it .

		The
Mississippi	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and Permian are given systematic rather than serial rank , so that the old Carboniferous disappears , unless it is retained as synonym for Pennsylvanian -- the period of the coal measures .

		The Lower Cretaceous is set off by itself and called the Comanchean , and in the Tertiary only the
Eocene	LOCATION	,
Xiocene	LOCATION	, and Pliocene are recognized .

		Whether this nomenclature will prove to be final or will be followed by others remains to be seen .

		The treatment of the Pleistocene and the human or present periods is unusually fidl and satisfactory .

		The authors find no sufficient evi - dence as yet for accepting the presence of man in
America	LOCATION	during the glacial period , though placing the European determinations on a dif - ferent basis .

		The book closes with a very inter - esting and suggestive discussion of man as a geologic agent , and as influenced by his geo - logic environment .

		While the work is called a text-book , its bulk will probably preclude its wide use in schools .

		On the other hand , it is not sufficiently complete to be an entirely satisfactory book of reference .

		European and foreign geology in general is much less fully discussed than in the older manuals .

		For the general reader the book has a charm and freshness not common to scientific texts , but it contains so much new and not yet accepted doctrine that such a reader will need to take careful note of the qiiaUfying phrases .

		It is to working geologists that the book wiU make the strongest appeal ; with some maturity of judgment and with some store of facts to draw on , they will find in it a great stimvdus and a surprising number of fruitfid suggestions and hyphotheses .

		* Lord
Randolph Churchill	PERSON	was for a period of i six years a striking figure in English political I life : and if the estimate of his son be accepted , I he was a much mis-judged and ill-used statesman .

		I While his ability and force were universally rec - ognized , his consistency and statesmanship have been as imiversally denied ; and these latter qualities it has been the purpose of Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	, himself a notable figure in the polit - ical world , to claim and prove for his father .

		In this the author has largely succeeded , if one can concede that close relationship is consistent •
Life of Lord Randolph Chcbchill	ORGANIZATION	.

M.P.	LOCATION	.

		In two volumes , niostrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		386 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, with critical and judicial fairness in analyzing character and motives .

		Certain it is that the work is remarkable for its seeming freedom from personal bias , for its frankness , for its remote - ness even , as well as for its attractive stjde , and in truth for all those qualities that stamp the really great biogi * aphy .

		Lord
Randolph Churchill	ORGANIZATION	entered Parliament with disinclination , or at least with apathy , yield - ing to the insistence of his family that he repre - sent a constituency wholly at their disposal .

		He was a Tory by traditional instinct , but his emer - gence from obscurity came through indirect opposition to what he considered the inefficient leadership of his party in the
House of Com	ORGANIZATION	- mons .

		Together with three other dissatisfied Tories ,
Arthur Balfour	PERSON	, Sir
Henry WolfP	PERSON	, and Mr.
Gorst	PERSON	, he assumed an attitude of inde - pendence of party control based originally not so much upon dislike of party principles as upon the weakness of the Tory opposition to Mr.
Glad	PERSON	- stone 's government .

		These four men formed a `` lose alliance that soon came to be known as the * ' Fourth Party , '' so called at first in derision , but later recognized as a distmct power .

		The alliance , as the author frankly admits , was formed , in part , to further the political interests of the men who composed it , and membership in it required first of all that the men shoidd defend each other .

		In fact , the conservative and acquiescent opposition to
Gladstone	LOCATION	practised by Sir
Stafford Northcote	PERSON	was irksome to the members of the '' Fourth Party '' who believed in fighting , and who had instincts and abilities for rough political warfare .

		Thus , nominally breaking loose from party control , they became very rapidly unauthorized leaders of the fighting element of the Tory party , and were thorns in the flesh of
Gladstone	LOCATION	and
Northcote	PERSON	alike .

		Churchill 's ability in political opposition has never been denied , nor his shrewdness in find - ing the weak spot in his opponent 's armor .

		He had also an unusual gift for hard-hitting speeches , and for a sarcasm that delighted his audiences , whether in Parliament or country , as audiences are always delighted with clever personal attacks .

		Moreover , his style of ora - tory , while it woidd have attracted less attention from an Irish Nationalist or from a Radical , aroused interest and amused , simply because it came from the mouth of a Tory who by birth and breeding might have been expected to follow the customary dignified type of Tory eloquence .

		In
1884	DATE	, in a speech at
Blackpool	LOCATION	, he referred to
Gladstone	PERSON	in a way that at first astomided , then delighted his Tory audience . '' '

		Vanity of vanities , ' says the preacher , ' all is vanity . ' '

		Humbug of humbugs , ' says the radical , ' all is humbug . '

		Gentlemen , we live in an age of advertise - ment , the age of HoUoway 's pills , of
Colman	ORGANIZATION	's mustard , and of Horniman 's pure tea ; and the policy of lavish advertisement has been so successful in commerce that the Liberal party , with its usual entei-prise , has adapted it to politics .

		The Prime Minister is the greatest li \ ` ing master of the art of personal political advertisement .

		... For the purposes of recreation he has selected the felling of trees ; and we may usefully remark that his amusements , like his politics , are essentially destructive .

		Every afternoon the whole world is invited to assist at the crashing fall of some beech or elm or oak .

		The forest laments , in order that Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	may per - spire , and full accounts of these proceedings are for - warded by special correspondents to every daily paper every recurring morning . ''

		Later , describing Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	's methotl of re - ceiving a dejmtation at Ha warden Castle , he said : '' It has always appeared to me somewhat incongruous and inappropriate that the great chief of the Radical party should live in a castle .

		But to proceed .

		One would have thought that the deputation would have been received in the house , in the study , in the drawing - room , or even in the dining-room .

		Not at all .

		Tliat would have been out of harmony with the advertisement ` boom . '

		Another scene had been arranged .

		The work - ingmen were guided through the ornamental grounds , into the wide-spreading park , strewn with the wreckage and ruins of the Prime Minister 's sport .

		All around them , we may suppose , lay the rotting trimks of once umbrageous trees ; all around them , tossed by the winds , were boughs and bark and withered shoots .

		They come suddenly on the Prime Minister and
Master Herbert	PERSON	, in scanty attire and profuse perspiration , engaged in the destruction of a gigantic oak , just giving its last dying groan .

		They are permitted to gaze and to worsliip and adore , and , having conducted themselves with exemplary propriety , are each presented with a few chips as a memorial of that memorable scene . ''

		In the
House of Conunons	ORGANIZATION	also he was equally effective , though more parliamentary , in sarcasm ; while , on the other hand , his straightforward clearly-expressed arguments often gave the To - ries those party catch-words and raUyuig cries of which the most famous is undoubtedly that drawn forth by the Home Rule bill of
1886	DATE	, when he prophesied rebellion in Protestant Ulster with the words , '' Ulster will fight ; and Ulster will be right . ''

		Churchill and his three associates soon as - sumed an importance wholly out of proportion to their numbers .

		As their power increased their irritation at
Northcote	ORGANIZATION	's feeble leadership became more pronounced .

		Disraeli alone of the older Tories understood and liked them , but he had practically withdrawn from political life .

		Yet he intervened to save them to the Tories , teUing Wolff : '' I fully appreciate your feelings and those of your friends ; but you must stick to
Northcote	PERSON	.

		He repre - sents the respectability of the party .

		I wholly sympa -

		THE DIAL 387 thise with you all , because I never was respectable myself .

		In my time the respectability of the party was represented by ... a horrid man ; but I had to do as well as I could ; you must do the same . ''

		But when
Disraeli	PERSON	died , in
1881	DATE	, the only chance , according to Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	, of a permanent and effective alliance between the old and new element in the Tory party was lost .

		The author says of Disraeli : '' He was an old man lifted high above his contempo - raries , and he liked to look past them to the new gene - ration and to feel that he could gain the sympathy and confidence of yoxmger men .

		If he liked jouth , he liked Tory Democracy even more .

		He had , moreover , good reason to know how a Parliamentary Opposition shoidd be conducted .

		He saw with perfect clearness the inca - pacity above the gangway , and the enterprise and pluck below it .

		Had his life been prolonged a few more years the
Fourth Party	ORGANIZATION	might have marched , as his
Young Guard	ORGANIZATION	, by a smoother road , and this story might have reached a less melancholy conclusion .

		He was removed from the petty vexations of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		Surely he would not have allowed these clever ardent men to drift into antagonism against the mass of the Conservative party and into fierce feud with its leaders .

		He alone could have kept their loyalty , as he alone com - manded their respect ; and never would he have counte - nanced the solemn excommunication by dullness and prejudice of all that preserved the sparkling life of Torj ` ism in times of depression and defeat .

		But
Lord Beaconsfield	LOCATION	was gone ; and those whom he left behind him had other views of how his inheritance -- such as it was -- should be divided . ''

		Yet the break did not come until years later , and then was in reality a break that involved
Churchill	LOCATION	alone ; for the other members of the
Fourth Party	ORGANIZATION	, and in particular
Balfour	PERSON	, had fallen into more ' • regular '' lines of jjolitical conduct .

		It was , in fact , liy remaining independent that Churchni became , earlier than any of his former associates , a power in his pai * ty .

		He had shown courage , fighting qualities of the highest order , and originality , and now as a campaign drew near he developed unexpecte < l strength in polit - ical manipulation .

		He , more than any other , organized the partj ' machinery that was to over - throw the
Gladstone	PERSON	administration in
1885	DATE	, and forcetl upon his party new ideas of Tory Democracy and of service to the j -RRB- eople of En - gland .

		It was a strange and unwelcome plat - form for his party , but its effectiveness was recognized and it was perforce accepted .

		But the agility shown by
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	in preWous polit - ical opposition made even the members of his o \ ^ Ti part -RRB- - doubt the sincerity of his constructive principles ; and when in
1886	DATE	, as Chancellor of the Exchequer , he insisted that platform principles should be earned into effect , he was regarded as merely fighting for personal prestige in the Cabinet and was suddenlv thrown over - board by the
Salisbury	PERSON	government .

		His brief term of office had shown brilliant qualities as leader of the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		His biog - rapher says of the position Churchill had won : '' It is a pity not to end the story here .

		Lord Ran - dolph
Churchill	PERSON	seems at this time to have been sepa - rated only by a single step from a career of dazzling prosperity and fame .

		With a swiftness which in modem Parliamentar -RCB- - history had been excelled only by the younger
Pitt	PERSON	, he had risen by no man 's leave or monarch 's favor from the station of a private gentleman to almost the first position \ mder the Crown ... Who coidd have guessed that ruin , utter and irretrievable , was mar - ching swiftly upon this triumphant figure ; that the great party who had followed his lead so blithely woidd in a few brief months turn upon him in abiding displeasure ; and that the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	which had assembled to find him so powerfid and to accept his guidance would watch him creep away in sadness and alone ? ''

		The entire controversy in regard to the char - acter of
Lord Randolph Churchill	ORGANIZATION	really centres about this resignation , -- a resignation that came nominally on a controversy with the
War Office	ORGANIZATION	caused by
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	's demand for a reduction of expenses .

		But the author thinks that the break was inevitable , -- that it was a contro - versy between a young , enthusiastic Tory Demo - crat and an old-fashioned Conservative statesman -- Salisbury . ''

		They represented , '' he says , '' conflicting schools of political philosophy .

		They stood for ideas mutually incompatible .

		Sooner or later the breach must have come ; and no doubt the strong realization of this imderlay the action of the one and the acquiesence of the other . ''

		Lord
Randolph	PERSON	Churchill '' looked upon the action as the most exalted of his life , and as an event of which , whatever the residts to him - self , he might be justly proud ... Among aU these indications of the healthy and generous conditions of English public life , so fuU of honour to our race and of vindication for its institutions , the resignation of Lord
Randolph Churchill	PERSON	need not suffer by any imijortant comparison . ''

		Yet '' a more patient man would have waited . ''

		On the other hand , the general conception of the situation , both then and later , was that the controversy reaUy centred about a struggle for power within the Cabinet ; that
Churchill	LOCATION	, unduly exalted by his rapid rise , overestimated his im - portance , and was cast aside as a disturbing element ; that he was even ambitious of idti - mately displacing
Salisbury	PERSON	and himseK -RSB- > ecom - ing the leader of the Tory party , and that there was little but personal ambition in his action .

		From such a condenmatory estimate his son rescues him , and with con \ ` iction to the reader .

		But that
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	was so wholly devoted to 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	^ principle , so little moved by personal ambition , as the author would have us believe , is difficult of realization .

		Churchill had risen by his fight - ing qualities , but he ceased to fight ; he disap - pointed the very element in his party that he had created and that had made his principles seem possible of realization .

		If he resigned on principle he should have fought for principle , but he seems rather to have meekly acquiesced in his hvuniliation , and to have sought by sub - serviency to regain a place in the councils of his party .

		This is not the author 's estimate , but his analysis does not successfidly overthrow all elements of the older opinion .

		Churchill ex - pected to regain quickly his former importance , but he had been too original , too impetuous , too dangerous for the Tory leaders , and while wel - comed as an ally in times of political danger he was never again in close touch with his party .

		His bitterness and discontent at the sudden close of a brilliant career were extreme and coidd not be veiled in so violent a nature .

		By
1891	DATE	he had practically given up hope of re - gaining place , as the lines from
Dryden	PERSON	copied out in his own hand give evidence : '' Happy the man , and happy he alone , He who can call to-day his own -- He who , secure within , can say : * To-morrow do thy worst , for I have lived to-day .

		Come fair or foul , or rain , or shine .

		The joys I have possessed , in spite of fate , are mine .

		Not Heaven itself over the past hath power ; But what has been has been , and I have had my hour . ' ''

		It would be imjust to Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	to conclude this review without noting that his work is not only a masterly biography , a book in a thousand , but is also an intimate critical history of Tory politics and factions from
1880	DATE	to
1886	DATE	.

		It has , then , both biographical im - portance and historical value , for it gives us a clearer insight into the workings of Tory machinery than any other volume .

		Also , it indirectly presents new and striking character - izations of the men with whom
Churchill	ORGANIZATION	was in contact , --
Salisbury	LOCATION	,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Balfour	PERSON	,
Chamberlain	PERSON	, and a score of others , many of them important in present-day English politics .

		And from the many apt quotations used by the author in his chapter-headings , that taken from
Carlyle	LOCATION	on Mirabeau seems best to describe Lord
Randolph Churchill	PERSON	's personality : `` This is no man of system , then ; he is only a man of instincts and insights .

		A man , nevertheless , who will glare fiercely on any object , and see through it , and conquer it ; for he has intellect , he has will , force beyond other men .

		A man not with logic-spectacles ; but with an eye ! ''

		A familiar passage might be thus transposed : '' A voice crying : -- In the wilderness , prepare a highway for our God . ''

		THE DIAL 389 guage .

		The Japanese have reversed the record of the ages .

		Centuries of the records of hiunan slaughter show that four men die of disease in camp or field to one death at the hands of the enemy .

		But in the Japanese war with
Russia	LOCATION	there were four deaths from bullets to one from disease .

		Of a total mortality , from all causes , of 64,938 .

		there were 40,954 moi-e from '' casual - ties '' than from disease .

		Dr.
Seaman	PERSON	gives his figures and comparisons , and tells most interest - ingly of
his %	PERCENT	` isits to hospitals , his experiences on the march , on shipboard , the railways , and on the field .

		He also shows how , after Port
Arthur	PERSON	had been won by astounding heroism and scien - tific gunnery , the Japanese gave the place such a cleaning-up that ' • the demon of Pestilence was foUed , after the fiend of War had been anni - hilated . ''

		Then , -- lest we forget , and
Congress	ORGANIZATION	go to sleep , -- he gives us a chapter with the familiar title from
Kipling	LOCATION	, and recalls disagree - able memories .

		He proves that our government ration itself creates disease , while our organized incompetence cooperates with the silent foe in killing eighty per cent of our soldiers .

		Briefly put , the burden of this prophet is that ' • the -LSB- American -RSB- medical officer can make a recommendation , but never issue an order ... Therein lies the secret of the failure of the -LSB- American -RSB- medical department . ''

		The deaths in the Spanish - American war from preventable diseases were fourteen times as great as those from `` casualties ' '' received in the conflict .

		Dr.
Seaman	PERSON	's effort is to prevent disease rather than cure it , and with a thousand proofs and con - vincing argxunents he calls the attention of the world to the fact that the Japanese have at last put the horse before the cart .

		Of course , when the shoemaker leaves his last or the prophet his message , his judgments are not so convincing .

		When the doctor tells in Chapter XI . ''

		the history of medical science in
Japan	LOCATION	, '' one is not to take his text too seriously .

		The Japanese have certainly taken him in when they tell him , or anybody else , about what hap - pened before the sixth century -- the `` records '' of which were made almost entirely a thousand years after the time alleged .

		The Japanese will never succeed in silencing the almost universal suspicion concerning their integrity or good faith , vmtil they tell the truth officially about their early history , and treat with respect even mod - em facts which rub their conceit hard .

		Japanese history before
the fourth century	DATE	can be con - structed only out of mythology ' , fossils , and tribal legends .

		Only when the truth-loving critic in
Japan	LOCATION	is as welcome as the flatterer , will the clouds hanging over Japanese character , as co '' - cems truth and honesty , roU away .

		Even when we come to modem times , there are those living -LRB- including the present reviewer -RRB- who attended the opening of the first government hospital in
Japan	LOCATION	, when a hospital open to the public -- or dispensaries , as we understand them -- had no existence .

		All Japanese official history scru - pulously ignores what American missionaries have done .

		It was
James Curtis Hepburn	PERSON	,
M. D.	PERSON	, who , early in the sixties , opened the first dis - pensary in
Japan	LOCATION	.

		It was
Guido F. Verbeck	PERSON	who recommended that medical education and training should be conducted in the Grerman language .

		It was Dr.
J. C. Berry	PERSON	who first be - gan the training of women nurses .

		It can be • said , with strict historical truth , that the plan and idea of the modem Japanese national army whose soldiers are trained first in the public schools , originated in the parlor of Dr.
Verbeck	PERSON	ID the autiunn of
1870	DATE	.

		No history , or even a glance at histon , - .

		can leave out the work of the Dutch medical training , with dissection , at I
Nagasaki	LOCATION	; nor ignore the labors of such men as - ' the daimio of Echizen and Dr.
Hajimoto	PERSON	.

		In - deed , the Japanese mind was kept fertilized by liie Dutch during two centuries , and their work in opening the coimtry was most discreditably ignored by
Commodore Perry	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Seaman	PERSON	's view of later developments , however , especially since
1882	DATE	, is excellent .

		The American patriot , the soldier in the ranks and his relative at home , as well as the book - critic , can gladly commend this well-written work and be thankful for it .

		It is a trumpet-blast of prophecy .

Greek Tragic Stage	ORGANIZATION	.

		* In a less conservative journal , a more enter - prising reviewer might have headed this notice `` A Greek
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, '' or `` Ibsen in
Athens	LOCATION	, '' or something else equally alluring .

		Moreover , he coidd have justified his caption by merely quoting passages from the work of Professor Decharme and leaving the reader to decide whether they were more pertinent to Euripides than to whichever of these two modem radicals he selected for comparison .

		It certainly does not require many passages like the following to recall
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	with almost painful vividness : • Euripides axd tbce Spirit op his Dramas .

		Translated from the French of
Paul Decharme	PERSON	, by
James Loeb	PERSON	,
A.B. New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		390 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, '' In common with them -LSB- the Sophists -RSB- , he had the spirit of iuquiry which penetrates prevailing prejudices and conventional ideas , the skeptical aiidacity which shakes beliefs to their very foundations ... Euripides was not one of those who submit to public opmiou , or flatter it ; but of those who oppose and guide it .

		He guided it much too far , to the thinking of Athenian conserva - tives ... Our poet was a philosopher whom philoso - phy had so enthralled that he could never escape from it ... The critical spirit in
Euripides	LOCATION	is often nothing less than the philosophical spirit , which disguises itself so little in his dramas that certain Greek critics could say of him that he was the philosopher of the stage .

		... His philosophy was prejudicial to his genius as an artist ... One of the secondary reasons for Euripides ' success with posterity constituted a real defect in his dramas , -- that critical spirit , everywhere manifest , which spares the gods no more than it spares mankind , which deals with the ancient stories as it deals with con - tenaporary morals , which attacks accepted ideas , social conventions and all forms of tradition ... Evil , which has succeeded in creating a considerable place for itself in the world , no doubt seemed to him to deserve at least a small place on the stage , the world in miniature ; for , side by side with the beautiful , he now and then exhib - ited the ugly , putting immoral women on the stage . ''

		When our hypothetical reviewer passed to consider the attitude of our dramatists to women , he could fill a volimie with significant parallels .

		^ ' It was above all the women who had ground for complaint against Euripides . ''

		Women , al - ready becoming emancipated , '' meant to oblige men to reckon with them , '' and Euripides as a result of his reckoning '' expresses views about women which are often of extreme severity ; -- he said little of them that is good , and a gi * eat deal that is bad . ''

		At the same time , Euripides had
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's perception , which recognizes tre - mendous cleverness in women , although he em - phasizes the devotion of that cleverness to CA-il ends .

		The general attitude of Euripides to the sex , and of the sex to
Euripides	LOCATION	, is grimly implied in the tradition that he was done to death by vengeful women ; and at times one would shudder for the fate of his modern incar - nation , were it not that in these days we have substituted the figurative tearing of limb from limb in our reviews and women 's clubs .

		Fur - thermore , the reviewer could propose that the occasional interruption of a play of Euripides by a scandalized audience corresponds to the interference with
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's plays by the police , rep - resenting a scandalized public ; he could com - pare Euripides ' debt to
Socrates	PERSON	and Anaxagoras with
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's debt to
Nietzsche	LOCATION	; he could point out that Euripides deliberately entered into competition with JEschylus , even as
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	chal - lenges comparison with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	; he could suggest that the thousand critical shafts so zealously winged at
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	by our critics of to-day correspond to the terrible club wielded by the titanic Aristoplianes against his contemporary ; in short , he could call attention to feature after feature until the resemblance should become so unendurably significant that every sensible reader not familiar with
Euripides	PERSON	and his times would cry out that it must be all nonsense .

		At any rate , even the adumbration we have given must suggest that the complete picture woidd show Euripides as a strangely modern figure , a critical and philosophical radical representing the new cosmopolitanism and religiously engaged in the sacrilegious task of tearing up ancient boundary stones in every field of life .

		If to this conception we were to add the thought that he was a brilliant poet and dramatic artist , with not a few points of weakness , who had a remark - able influence upon his contemporaries and pos - terity , we should not be further from the truth than many who have struggled more painfully for accuracy .

		Some twenty-five hundred years ago , an old - fashioned Athenian named Strepsiades , with before-the-war ideas , came to blows with his son , a freshman from the school of
Socra	LOCATION	- tes , over a contemporary poet ; and ever since the Periclean age , the great household of those interested in letters has been divided against itself on the subject of Euripides .

		On the whole , the figurative quarrel has been more favorable to the old conservative than was the physical eneoimter in the '' Clouds '' of Aristophanes ; but not a few great men , in - cluding many of our greatest poets , have sided with the son in his admiration of this tragedian of the dawning cosmopolitanism , who repre - sented the spirit of his times , who painted men as they were , who had tears for sorrow , and withal could give to his shifting moods such adequate expression with the aid of effective dramatic music and polished verse .

		In
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ripides the philosophical radical and the S -RCB- ^ npa - thetic poet found a meeting-place , and such a meeting-place inevitably becomes a field of com - bat for later critics .

		Some thirteen years ago .

		Professor
Paul Decharme	PERSON	, the talented Professor of Greek Poetry in the Faculte des Lettres of
Paris	LOCATION	, came to occupy the most prominent place in the conti'oversy , with a considerable volume on '' Euripide et I ` esprit de son theatre . ''

		The book at once attracted favorable conunent wherever read , and the German reviewers contributed the well-deserved epithets of '' eingehend '' and `` geistreich '' ; that it aroused much discussion , was only another tribute to its worth .

		Obvi -
1906	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 391 ously , for any detailed criticism these columns must refer the reader to the more technical jour - nals : but the most controversial re \ ` iewer was bound to give a generally favorable verdict , and it is safely conservative to say that anybody interested in the drama must read this book as a duty , and will be glad to re-read many chapters thereof as a pleasure .

		The second part , pages 145-378 of the English edition , dealing with * ' Dramatic Art in Euripides , '' is not so attrac - tive to the less technical reader as the first part , which treats of the poet 's views on social , polit - ical , and philosohical questions ; but from the whole book one rises vnth the verdict that the rather ambitious title has been fidly justified .

		It was a labor of love on the part of Professor Decharme , whose work has since been ended by a death which the worid of letters has sincerely deplored .

		Many of us who knew him only thi * ough his writings will recall these words from the Y > oet whom he served so well : '' A wise man , though in earth 's remotest parts He dwell , though ne'er I see him , -- count I my friend . ''

		The volume before us is an English transla - tion by
James Loeb	PERSON	,
A.B.	LOCATION	, for whom
Professor John Williams White of Harvard \	ORGANIZATION	^ Tites a very strongly pro-Euripidean introduction containing a brief appreciation of that author 's influence on later poets .

		Touching the need of a transla - tion , the present reviewer is by no means clear , inasmuch as most readers who are deeply enough interested in
Euripides	LOCATION	to pursue the spirit of his dramas through three himdred and seventj - eight generous pages wovdd probably be able to read the French original .

		On this point , how - ever , publishers and librarians are doubtless the best judges , so that we may content ourselves with answering the question whether the work has been well done ; and oiu * answer must be in the affirmative .

		To demand that the English version should breathe the charm of the French original , would be extravagant ; but a detailed comparison of a number of passages inspired confidence in the trustworthiness of our trans - lator , even if it did give rise to some differences of opinion .

		That the idea of securing Mr.
Arthur S. Way	PERSON	's metrical renderings from the Greek was most happy , is shown by their con - tribution to the attractiveness of the work .

		The value of the analytical index can be passed upon with finality only after continued handling ; but an examination of selected points left an impres - sion of reliability .

		The book is bound in the well - known dark-blue that is always prepossessing to many readers , among them the present writer .

		The typography is good , the illustrations few and pertinent .

		K the original Parisian edition had been consulted , it could not have demanded a more appropriate garb for its presentation to an English-speaking public .

		Thoughtful While admitting the impossibility of pretent ^ nd * ' predicting the future from a study of future .

		the past , Mr.
C. F. G. Masterman	PERSON	, in the title-essay of his volume , '' In Peril of Change '' -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- , points out three of
England	LOCATION	's institu - tions -- '' the Landed System , the
Established Church	ORGANIZATION	, and the Popular Religion '' -- that are seemingly on the verge of transformation , with more or less of menace to the country from the change .

		Indeed , the author finds in
England	LOCATION	's present condition some of the sjonptoms manifest in the Roman Empire before its decline and faU , and in
France	LOCATION	before the Revolution .

		Balance has become unstable , and , says Mr.
Masterman	PERSON	, `` the study of the past can but guarantee that through rough courses or smooth , heedless of violence and pain , in methods imexpected and often through hazardous ways , equilibrium will be attained . ''

		These essays , in large part reprinted from leading magazines and reviews , have a char - acter so positive and individual as to raise them above the common level .

		Their author , a
Cambridge	LOCATION	graduate of but ten years ' standing , and at present a fellow of Christ 's College in that university , pre - faces his chapters by explaining that `` some are attempts to examine the ideals of the age immedi - ately past ... Some deal with the life of the present ... And some are concerned with the future , seeking to interpret , in literature , in religion , in social ideals , those obscure beginnings which are to direct the progress of the years to come . ''

		In the opening essay , `` After the Reaction , '' the author 's dispraise of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	and the brazen-throated poets of war and world-empire , his lament over '' the pitiful destruction of two free nations in
South Africa	LOCATION	, '' and his advocacy of a return to the larger and kindlier humanities and sj-mpathies , will endear him to many readers ; as will also , in another part of the book , his outspoken contempt for `` the alltu * - ing claptrap concerning the White Man 's Burden and the Trustees of Progress . ''

		Some of the best of these twentj ' chapters treat of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	and '' the blasphemy of optimism , ''

		But in read - ing the signs of the times he now and then seems at fault , as when he declares that the present abhor - rence of any violation of the monogamic order of society belongs to a vanishing
England	LOCATION	.

		Disclaim - ing pretensions to excellences of style , he has never - theless said forcibly and well what he was moved to say .

		A little more attention to the accuracies of 392 THE DIAL -LSB-

George Gissing	PERSON	analyze '' into its constituent atoms the ma - trix of which is composed the characteristic city population . ''

		Easily , too , could he have corrected the pleonasm in
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's `` long struggle for persistence against poverty . ''

		A university man , even if not a first-class in classics , should think twice before writing '' negligeable '' ; such second thought would recall that the word follows the analogy of intelligible , legible , corrigible , derigible , erigible , and countless other adjectives of potentiality from third-conjugation Latin verbs .

South Carolina	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- Dr.
Barnett A. Elzas	PERSON	of
Charleston	LOCATION	has given a full account of his people in that
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author 's aim has been to show the part taken by the Jew in commercial , professional , political , and social activi - ties ; and the showing is a very favorable one .

		The volume includes chapters on the beginnings of the Jewish settlements in the colony , their religious organization and religious dissensions , the part taken by Jews in the wars and in the affairs of govern - ment , the expansion of the Jews over the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and short biographies of the most prominent members of the race .

		The first Jewish congregation of Charles - ton was an offshoot of the Spanish-Portuguese com - munity of
Bevis Marks	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		In
South Carolina	LOCATION	, then not friendly to slavery but desirous of obtaining a white population , the Jews were welcomed .

		The author declares that `` in
South Carolina	LOCATION	, from the day of his settlement the Jew has never labored under the slightest civil or religious disability what - ever .

		In this respect
South Carolina	LOCATION	was unique among the British provinces .

		It took the Jews of
England	LOCATION	over one hundred and fifty years to win by steady fighting , step by step , the civil and religious equality that was guaranteed to the first Jew that set foot on
South Carolina	LOCATION	soil . ''

		And it is a notable fact that the newer States to the west and south of
South Carolina	LOCATION	have been influenced by the former 's example .

		In the Lower South , the Jews have at all times exercised an influence out of proportion to their numbers .

		Perhaps it was one of the results of slavery which united aU whites , but at any rate the Jews have from the beginning formed a respected portion of the population , and have mingled socially with Gentiles to a greater extent than elsewhere .

		This is partly a cause and partly a result of the supe - riority of the Southern Jews .

		In
South Carolina	LOCATION	, Dr.
Elzas	PERSON	declares , was to be found , before
1825	DATE	at least , the best Jewish population in
America	LOCATION	; and cer - tainly the
Southern Jew	ORGANIZATION	has not yet been surpassed .

		Many of the Jewish leaders of other sections have come from the South .

		The Jew is usually considered a man of peace , but the record in
South Carolina	LOCATION	tells a different story .

		In every war the Jews fur - nished more than their share of men . ''

		South
Caro	PERSON	- lina can boast of no more loyal and devoted sons and daughters than were the Jewish citizens in the hour of her need . ''

		For material on which to base his account , Dr.
Elzas	PERSON	has searched all the records of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, printed and in manuscript , as well as Jew - ish records in other States , leaving no source of information unexamined .

		The bibliography ap - pended '' is not complete , '' he says ; but it is not likely to be completed .

		As an instance of his in - dustry , we may mention that to get the names of the Jewish soldiers in the Civil War he went over '' several times '' the lists of 70,000 names in the archives at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and examined the complete file of Gazettes in the
Charleston Library	LOCATION	.

		The gen - eral reader will object to the padding with long lists of names taken from directories , and to the numer - ous extracts from newspapers ; but to one who is directly interested , and to the future historian , these sources of information are valuable .

		The '' general reader '' can do some judicious skipping .

		It would have been well had the author explained more fully the distinctions , historically and socially , which he hints at , between the German Jews and the Spanish - Portuguese Jews of
South Carolina	LOCATION	.

		But in spite of minor defects , the work has a great value as an account of one of the influential elements in
Southern	LOCATION	society .

		On the nature ^ ince the publication of the fundar and oriijin of mental researches of Pasteur in livinv matter .


France	LOCATION	and
Tyndall	ORGANIZATION	in
England	LOCATION	on the spontaneous generation of living from non-living matter , it has been considered as one of the most firmly grounded generalizations of biology that , under the conditions which now obtain upon the earth , living things only originate by th ^ multipli - cation of preceding -- that is , ancestral -- organisms of the same kind .

		Omne vivum ex vivo is almost the first law which the biological tyro learns .

		But as old as the history of all science is the '' paradoxer , '' the '' lone and lorn '' individual who with all his might combats the conclusions which other and intellectually more ordinary persons consider to be demonstrated .

		The geniuses of this kind who in older times settled the most pressing mathematical and physical problems of the universe have an enduring monument to recall them to memory in Augustus De
Morgan	PERSON	's delightful '' Budget of Par - adoxes , '' -- to the literary and scientific charm of which
Holmes	PERSON	has paid tribute .

		Unfortunately , the biological paradoxers have had no De Morgan to do them justice , and in consequence one fears that Dr.
H. Charlton Bastian	PERSON	's life-long effort to upset the accepted teachings of biology will too soon be forgot - ten .

		For more than thirty-five years he has been ex - perimenting and publishing books and memoirs for the purpose of establishing two fundamental theses .

		The first of these is that at the present time living organisms are everywhere originating as a result of a process of '' archebiosis , '' by which less vulgar term our author designates what ordinarily goes by the name of spontaneous generation .

		Especially is Dr.
Bastian	PERSON	convinced that bacteria originate in this

		THE DIAL .

		393 way .

		His second thesis is that the substance of many of the higher organisms is frequently changed by some unknown process into altogether different organisms .

		Thus , the living substance of a plant may be directly transformed into a number of simple animals , and so on .

		This phenomenon is called '' heterogenesis . ''

		Something over half of Dr.
Bastian	PERSON	's bulky volume on `` The Nature and Origin of Living Matter '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is devoted to an account , with illustrations , of experiments which the author believes have demonstrated the truth of '' archebiosis '' and '' heterogenesis . ''

		It is safe to say that of those who possess sufficient technical knowledge of biology to really g ^ asp the nature and meaning of these experiments , the number who will agree with Dr.
Bastian	PERSON	in his conclusions is `` ran - ishingly small . ''

		The observations and experiments are absolutely inconclusive .

		The earlier chapters of the work are given to an extended exposition of the author 's views on the general subject of organic evolution .

		They add nothing essentially new , either in fact or in principle , to what has already been said on the subject .

		Messrs.
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the ^ s ^ ^ nesTfon ' American publishers of '' Everyman 's Library , '' edited by Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	.

		This library is one of the Dent enterprises , which is equivalent to saying that the volumes ex - hibit a delicate taste in typography , binding , and other mechanical matters , and give a large return of value for the small price set upon them .

		As we look over the fifty volumes now before us , with which the enterprise is inaugurated , we can not help think - ing that the problem of good reading at moderate cost is by way of being solved more satisfactorily than ever before in a similar undertaking .

		The name of the library is itself a happy thought , and nothing could be more apt than the quotation from the old morality that is put into the decorative service of the series : '' I will go with thee to be thy guide , in thy most need to go by thy side . ''

		The fifty volumes now published are classified under several heads .

		In fiction , we have a five-volume set of
Jane Austen	PERSON	, Bulwer 's '' Harold '' and * ' The Last of the Barons , ''
Reade	PERSON	's `` The Cloister and the Hearth , ''
Kingsley	PERSON	's '' Westward Ho ! ''

		and a number of other representative single works by various writers .

		In what may be called quasi-fiction , we have children 's tales by
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and
Andersen	PERSON	, besides a two-volume set of `` Le Morte d'
Arthur	PERSON	. ''

		Of poetry , there are
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	,
Browning	PERSON	, and
Coleridge	PERSON	volumes .

		In the cases of the former two , the poems are given down to
1863	DATE	, which marks the term of expired copyrights .

		History is represented by Ma - caulay 's `` England '' in three volumes ,
Carlyle	PERSON	's ^ ' French Revolution '' in two , and
Finlay	PERSON	's '' By - zantine Empire '' in one .

		In biography , there are
Boswell	PERSON	and
Lockhart	PERSON	's
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		There are vol - umes of essays by
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Coleridge	PERSON	, and
Froude	PERSON	.

		Science is represented by
White	ORGANIZATION	's * '
Selborne	LOCATION	, '' and Huxley 's '' Man 's Place in Nature . ''

		Three volumes of
Robertson	ORGANIZATION	's sermons and one of
Latimer	PERSON	's contribute the religious element .

		Speke 's '' Nile '' and Borrow 's '' Wild Wales '' occupy the travel section , and a volume of
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	completes the list with a classical offering .

		Many of these volumes are provided with really notable introductions , of which a few instances may be given .

		Mr.
Watts-Dimton	PERSON	stands sponsor for Borrow , Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	for
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	for
Brown	PERSON	- ing , Mr.
R. Brimley Johnson	PERSON	for the
Jane Austen	PERSON	novels , Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	for '' The Cloister and the Hearth , '' and Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	for '' The Golden Book of
Coleridge	PERSON	. ''

		These introductions , in several cases quite lengthy , add materially to the interest and value of the volumes which they accompany .

		Tales of the old
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	border .

		Under the attractive title '' The Glory Seekers '' -LRB-
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
WUliam Horace Brown	PERSON	has collected a number of tales of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	, in that romantic border-land between American and Spanish domain .

		Since American authority did not always advance as rapidly as Spanish control retreated , the resulting '' no man 's land '' attracted plotters , pirates , fillibusters , and soldiers of fortune , who found there an inviting situation .

		The book , which attempts to recall their deeds and moving accidents , is not a novel ; neither is it history .

		It is a re-writing of actual facts , and a reincarnation of former personages , amplified by stirring description .

		Among the seekers for glory one finds the despicable General
Wilkinson	PERSON	, the fascinating
Aaron Burr	PERSON	,
Phillip Nolan	PERSON	, and
Ellis Bean	PERSON	,
Zebulon Pike	LOCATION	the explorer , the
Kemper	ORGANIZATION	boys , Lafitte the pirate , and persistent
Jennie Long	PERSON	.

		The tragedy of the Exiles in
Florida	LOCATION	, whose recital by
Giddings	ORGANIZATION	aided the Abolitionist cause years ago , finds a place among the stories , as does the rash expedition of the Texans against
Santa	LOCATION	F ^ .

		The author is apparently aware of the slender basis of fact upon which many of the stories rest , -- for instance , that of the beautiful
Madeline	PERSON	, who resisted the wiles of the usually irre - sistible
Aaron Burr	PERSON	, or that in which the precocious
Jennie Wilkinson	PERSON	became the wooer of Dr. Long .

		Where the author ventures on authentic narrative , he follows old pathways without much reg ^ ard for modern investigation .

		Despite the results of Pro- fessor
McCaleb	PERSON	's investigations , he writes
Burr	PERSON	down as a traitor . ''

		Burr was guilty , '' he says , curtly . ''

		He had openly talked treason for years ... That he was acquitted was just as well .

		To have hanged him -LSB- stc -RSB- would have been to punish one man for treason , when it was well known that a thousand had been guilty of the same crime without any attempt at punishing them . ''

		He couples
Burr	PERSON	with
Arnold	PERSON	as `` the only renegades to the sacred cause of a free and united country . ''

		All this not - withstanding the fact that
John Marshall	PERSON	, the most impartial judge who ever tried a criminal case , declared that
Burr	PERSON	had not been guilty of treason .

		The stories are worth re-telling , and the author tells them most interestingly .

		Doubtless many facts of 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, history will be absorbed incidentally by the reader in reviewing these stories of adventurous spirits who tried at various times to establish an empire in the early days of the
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two examples ^ ^ ^ * .

		* `` * ^ ^ '' ^ ^ ** ^ ^ ' `` * . ''

		^ ° ^ `` St perfect of the book technical workmanship , the charac - beautifui .

		teristic that most impresses those who have followed the work of the special limited edition department at the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	is the variety of its output , -- the marked versatility shown in fitting typographical form to literary substance .

		Nearly all of those who have produced the best work in this field heretofore , as the Kelmscott and Doves presses , have each developed a certain distinct and individual style of bookmaking , to which their entu-e output more or less monotonously conforms .

		But Mr.
Rogers	PERSON	, in his work at the
Riverside Press	ORGANIZATION	, has chosen the immensely more difiicult part of giving each of his volumes a dress that suggests somewhat the character of the contents , and is typical of the country or period to which the book belongs .

		The success with which this is usually accomplished is well illustrated by the two latest issues of the press , -- a reprint of St.
Pierre	PERSON	's `` Paul et Virginie '' in the original text , and a selection of * ' Songs and Sonnets by
Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	. ''

		The first - named is a thin quarto , printed from type of a French cut especially imported for this purpose , and set in a spacious , well-proportioned page .

		A light floriated title-page in the French manner , and four illustra - tions reengraved on wood by
M. Lament Brown	ORGANIZATION	from the originals in the first edition , make up the decorative setting .

		The binding is of French paper boards , with printed title-label .

		The whole effect of the volume , even to the illustrations , is sober and restrained , in perfect keeping with the tragic note of the tale .

		Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's poems , on the other hand , are embodied in a trim duodecimo , printed from a small size of
Caslon	PERSON	type , with a graceful rule arrangement in red surrounding the text on each page .

		Deeply embossed in the centre of the dark - green board cover is a representation of the intaglio head of Minerva that forms the subject of one of Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	's best-known lyrics .

		The idea of re - producing this '' caryen agate-stone '' in such a way was unusually happy , for no other symbol could express more appositely the general characteristics of the poetry contained within these covers .

		It should be said that for this edition Mr.
Aldrich	PERSON	has made an entirely new selection and arrangement of his poems ; and the resulting volume is one that must always hold a distinctive place in our literature .

		Mr.
Andrew It	PERSON	is hard for anyone to study the Sir
Walter	PERSON	^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
Scott	PERSON	without a pious desire to
Scott	PERSON	.

		wreak vengeance on the personages who did so much to afflict him and turn his natur - ally joyous existence into the tragedy which in later life it was .

		We have all wanted to have our fling at the caustic
Jeffrey	PERSON	, and to instil some sense into the infantile minds of the
Ballantynes	LOCATION	.

		No wonder , then , that so racy and perfervid a Scot as Mr ,
Andrew Lang	PERSON	should in his life of
Scott	PERSON	in the series of '' Literary Lives '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- display a cer - tain acridity of temper toward those who pestered
Scott	PERSON	and those who led to his ruin .

		And yet Mr.
Lang	PERSON	is fail * ;
Jeffrey	PERSON	gets no more than his due , and as much is said for the impossible Ballantynes as can well be .

		Nor is
Scott	PERSON	himself allowed to escape without bearing his share of blame for the unneces - sarily tragic close of his life .

		Lang 's biography ^ for a brief one , is very full of details without being encyclopaedically dry .

		Certain minor mistakes com - mitted by '' English innocence '' are corrected -- not silently , however , -- and a new piece of external evidence which should have fixed the authorship of the novels on
Scott	PERSON	before it was known is brought forward .

		The criticism scattered throughout the volume , following the chronological order of pro- duction , is sane and singularly free from Scottish prejudice . ''

		The Lord of the Isles '' does make one yawn , -- and Mr.
Lang	PERSON	says so .

		But he insists , and rightly , that the poetic appeal of the '' Lay , '' which in
1805	DATE	was '' absolutely fresh and poignant , '' as well as of the more polished '' Lady of the Lake , '' if not the highest , is direct and enduring .

		To the modern contemners of
Scott	PERSON	's novels , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	scornfully addresses
Cromwell	PERSON	's words to the Commissioners of the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	, '' Brethern in the bowels of Christ , believe that it is possible you may be mis - taken . ''

		It was in his capacity '' as a creator of a vast throng of living people of every grade , and every variety of nature , humour , and temperament , that
Scott	PERSON	, among British writers , is least remote from Shakespeare . ''

		Indispensable to Everyone who intends to go to the
European Europe	LOCATION	-LRB- and who in these days does tourist .

		not ? -RRB-

		is much concerned to prepare himself , both materially and mentally , for the jour - ney .

		But , do his best , on his arrival there one of the greatest drawbacks to his satisfaction proves - to be his lack of accurate knowledge .

		Owing to - baggage limitations , he can not carry many books about , and even at places where he expected to feel most at home he is surprised to find how vague and indefinite his knowledge really is .

		Even the best memory proves inadequate to supply all the names , dates , and isolated facts that continually present their questions .

		Miss
H. A. Guerber	PERSON	's little book `` How to Prepare for
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is designed to supply both of these needs .

		It is an advance guide , noting the best books to read before the contemplated journey begins ; it is also a min - iature reference book to consult en route , supplying the most important data concerning the history and art of the European and ancient world .

		It presents brief synopses of the history of aU the principal foreign countries , followed by descriptions of condi - tions and routes of travel in those countries .

		There are also separate chapters on painting , sculpture ^ architecture , and music , to which hav-e been ap - pended chronological , alphabetical , and bibliograph -

		THE DIAL 39 & ical lists relating to names , dates , events , schools , etc. .

		Each country is furnished with an admirahle map ; the illustrations have been chosen with a view to depicting characteristic features of each country , and the classified chronological tables are extremely full and satisfactory .

		The tourist should by all means secure this book as a supplement to his indis - pensable
Baedeker	PERSON	.

		\ ew letter g Readers of
Robert Browning	PERSON	's poems by
Robert	PERSON	of `` Waring '' and • • The Guardian Broicninv .

		Angel '' have known that he had a `` dear old friend '' who lived on the ' •
Wairoa	LOCATION	at the world 's far end . ''

		By the aid of commentators , they have known also that this friend was
Alfred Domett	PERSON	, author of the famous '' Christmas Hymn , '' and that the
Wairoa	LOCATION	is the name of a river in
New Zealand	LOCATION	.

		How dear , how true , and how life-long was the fi'iendship which bound together these two men we now learn for the first time through a book entitled ``
Robert Browning	PERSON	and
Alfred Domett	PERSON	, '' edited by
Frederic G. Kenyon	PERSON	, and published by
E. P. Dutton &	ORGANIZATION	.

		Co. .

		The story is told mainly through letters written by
Browning	PERSON	to
Domett	PERSON	, the replies , according to
Browning	PERSON	's custom with his letters , hav - ing been destroyed .

		Written chiefly during the years
1840	DATE	--
1846	DATE	, they cover a period of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's life of which little has been made public -- the period just preceding his marriage , while he was living at
New Cross	ORGANIZATION	, writing and publishing serially his `` BeUs and Pomegranates . ''

		Many who cared little for
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's poetry prerious to the publication of his • • Letters to
Elizabeth Barrett	PERSON	'' were charmed by them into loving both man and poet , -- so fine , so strong , so tender was the personality there re - vealed .

		And in like manner , this collection of letters , though small , revealing a masculine friend - ship surviving the strain of separation of years , and of divided interests , helps to make up an impression of a character which becomes the more exalted as it is better known .

		Portraits of
Browning	PERSON	, of Domett , and of Sir
Joseph Arnould	PERSON	-LRB- a third in this trio of CamberweU friends -RRB- illustrate the volume .

		A poem , '' A Forest Thought , '' new to most of us though pub - lished in a magazine last year , appears on the first page .

		It is in a very unusual metre for
Browning	PERSON	-- four stanzas of seven rhjoned couplets each , -- is extremely musical , and was written in
1839	DATE	as a christening poem for a child to whom
Browning	PERSON	stood as godfather .

		Organ mu ^ ic , ^ he latest volume in the `` Music UthiMtoryand Story Series '' -LRB- imported bv Charles deveiopmetit .

		Scribner 's Sons -RRB- is devoted * to • ' The Story of Organ Music , '' by Mr.
C. F. Abdy Williams	PERSON	.

		The author has outlined a historj - of the rise and development of organ music , in which the works of the leading composers are described .

		He is of the opinion that the history of organ music revolves round one gigantic personality , that of
Bach	PERSON	, and that no organ composer of any eminence has existed who has not been largely influenced by him .

		The au - thor has drawn considerably on
Ritter	PERSON	's '' Greschichte des OrgekpieLs , '' and on the collections of Comer and others .

		Among the musical illnstrations he hsuf given the whole of a toccato by
Pasquini	PERSON	, whose works until recently were supposed to have been lost to the world ; and the style of Elizabethan organ music is exemplified by a Choralvorspiel by Dr.
John Bull	PERSON	.

		In conclusion , the author points out that English composers of the first rank are producing works that are among the best of the day , and there is reason to hope that a school of English organ music is arising which will take its place as part of the great modern school of English composition that is 6o rapidly developing .

		Mr.
Williams	PERSON	's treatise is scholarly , clear , concise , and elucidative .

		Autobiography Father
George Gapon	PERSON	, the Russian of a Bussian revolutionist , was not a great man .

		but revoiudomtt .

		circumstances , brought about largely through his deep interest in the oppressed classes of
Russia	LOCATION	, made him the centre of the great strike of Russian workingmen in
January , 1905	DATE	, and a figure of international interest .

		Father
Crapon	PERSON	has written his autobiography under the title '' The Story of My Life '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , showing the rapid change in his views from love of the Czar and support of the gov - ernment of his country to hatred of both and a lead - ing position among rabid revolutionists .

		This story of his life is told with direct simplicity and with effect , both the account of his early home life and training and the account of the dramatic struggle which led to his exile ; it is instructive also as to the motives and methods of the revolutionists , and as to the corrruption , cruelty , and tyranny of the autoc - racy .

		One can get from this unpretentious book a better idea of present social conditions in
Russia	LOCATION	than from many more elaborate studies ; yet the reader must be on his guard against being misled by the sincere but volatile enthusiast whose life and opinions are here set forth .
