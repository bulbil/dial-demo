		30 THE FIRST CITIZEN OF THE REPUBLIC .

		For many years it was the custom of
John Bigelow	PERSON	to keep k ' open house '' for his friends on Thanksgiving Day , in the fine old
Gramercy Park	LOCATION	mansion which had long been his home .

		It was a pleasant way , both for him and his guests , to celebrate his birthday , which fell on the twenty-fifth of
November	DATE	.

		What proved to be the last of these gatherings was held a month ago , ushering in the ninety-fifth year of the life of the venerable host .

		He died on the nine - teenth of
December	DATE	, after an illness of three days , unexpectedly at least in the sense that a man who has carried his intellectual and phy - sical vigor far into the nineties may well keep on surprising the world indefinitely .

		The tale of his accumulated years , and of the honors that had been their fruit , had made him '' the first citizen of
New York	LOCATION	, '' as he was often styled , possibly even the most distinguished citizen of the nation which had long been proud of his fame .

		He had lived in the lifetime of
George III.	PERSON	,
Napoleon	PERSON	, and every President except Washing - ton ; as a boy he had witnessed
Lafayette	LOCATION	's tri - umphal progress through the country he had helped to call into being , and had grown up among men to whom
Bunker Hill	ORGANIZATION	was a per - sonal memory ; as a man , he had witnessed the transformation of
Europe	LOCATION	into a continent of constitutional governments , and of his own coun - try into the most powerful and prosperous na - tion on earth ; he had seen such younger men as
Hale	PERSON	and
Higginson	PERSON	and
Mitchell	PERSON	die of old age , and still he lived on in a world which by means of his vital personality was enabled to link the present with the far distant past .

		As was finely said by the newspaper which he helped to build up more than half a century ago , his dis - appearance now seems '' like the fading from a familiar landscape of a snow-crowned mountain peak . ''


John Bigelow	PERSON	was born
November 25 , 1817	DATE	, at Maiden ,
New York	LOCATION	, and was graduated from
Union College	ORGANIZATION	in
1835	DATE	.

		Three years later he was admitted to the bar , and combined a grow - ing practice with a multifarious literary activity .

		His support of
Van Buren	ORGANIZATION	in the Free Soil Cam - paign of
1848	DATE	brought him to the attention of
Bryant	PERSON	, who offered him an interest in the THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, '' Evening Poet . ''

		The offer was accepted and
Bigelow	PERSON	became one-third owner of the paper , greatly increasing its circulation and influence .

		At the outbreak of the Civil War he sold his interest to
Parke Godwin	PERSON	, and went to
Paris	LOCATION	as American consul upon
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's appointment .

		In 1 864 he was made American minister , hold - ing this post for three years .

		His public ser - vices were very great at this time of ticklish con - ditions in our affairs abroad ; he thwarted a French plot to furnish the Confederacy with ironclads , and he conducted the negotiations which put an end to
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's piratical ven - ture in Mexican imperialism .

		He then lived in
Germany	LOCATION	for a number of years , concerned with the education of his children .

		Upon bis return to
America	LOCATION	, he was appointed by Governor
Tilden	PERSON	to the
State Canal Commission	ORGANIZATION	of
New York	LOCATION	, and was elected to the office of
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		His active life , in the sense of office - holding and money-getting , was now over , al - though many an honorary position was still to be thrust upon him .

		In the better sense , his activities were in full swing , and ceased only with his death .

		He says in his autobiography : '' I was able to retire with a property which could not be fairly valued at less than
$ 175,000	MONEY	.

		This was not a large fortune for a man in the middle of the journey of life to retire upon , even in those days .

		It now seems barely enough to begin life with .

		To me , however , it promised all that wealth could give me .

		The Golden Age , in my imagination then , was the age when gold did not reign . ''


John Bigelow	PERSON	's association with
Tilden	PERSON	was one of the most important things in his life , for it made him a trustee of the
Tilden	PERSON	bequest , and for many years president of the library board .

		His acceptance of the new library building in
May , 1911	DATE	, marked his last appearance before the public .

		An equally impressive public appear - ance was that of the preceding
December	DATE	, when he made the address opening the joint session of the
American Academy	ORGANIZATION	and the
National Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tute upon the stage of the New Theatre .

		As ex - ecutor of
Tilden	PERSON	's will , he also became his official biographer , publishing in several volumes the life , speeches , letters , and literary memorials of his old friend .

		A second literary task of major importance was the work done in connection with
Franklin	PERSON	, which included the three-volume biography , the ten-volume edition of the writ - ings , and the authentic version of the autobiog - raphy , which had previously been published in a form sadly garbled as a result of the mistaken piety of
Franklin	PERSON	's descendants .

		Among his other works may be mentioned a book on Jam - aica , a life of
Fremont	LOCATION	, a monograph on Glad - stone in his relations to our Civil War , Lrs Etats-Unis d'Ame ` rique en
1863	DATE	, '' a study of Molinos the Quietist , ''
France	LOCATION	and the Confed - erate
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, '' a life of
Bryant	PERSON	, and a number of quaintly styled opusculu .

		stu-h as `` Peace Given as the World Giveth , '' and `` The Propriuiu , or What of Man Is Not His Own . '

		* It is a cata - logue of varied interest , extending to upwards of twenty titles , and nearly twice that number of volumes , certainly a sufficient reason for ac - cording the author an honorable place among our men of letters .

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's religious affiliations were with the Swedenborgians , illustrating once more the curious appeal which the Swedish mystic made to many American minds of the finer type in the forties and fifties .

		In this ra > - .

		it was a chance acquaintance made in the
West Indies	LOCATION	that was the cause of the '' conversion . '' ''

		He lent me one of
Swedenborg	ORGANIZATION	's books .

		I became so interested in ^ it that I read it without ceasing from ten o'clock in the
morning until six o'clock that night	TIME	.

		For twenty years thereafter I read Swedenborgian books many hours a day . ''

		In his political faith , Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	was a democrat of the old school , to which democracy meant con - servatism , and public economy , and financial integrity , and a rooted belief in free-trade .

		The protective policy was to him the sum of all iniqui - ties , and he punctured its fallacies in many a pungent phrase .

		The protective creed was for him a dogma in a republic only fit for a high - wayman , a fool , or a drunkard . ''

		His motto was Hamlet 's `` Reform it altogether , '' and the '' revision downward '' of the opportunist politi - cian was '' an idle dream , as idle as baying the moon for rain .

		To expect a reduction of the tariff in this country is to expect a dipsomaniac to clamor for water instead of whiskey . ''

		It was only a year or two ago that he penned this tart reply to an appeal from the
Reform Club	ORGANIZATION	that he should cooperate in their work : When your
Reform Committee	ORGANIZATION	is prepared to take a firm stand against any tariff upon imports , ` to make every harbor on our sea coast as free to the commerce of the world as those of
New York	LOCATION	are to those of
New Jersey	LOCATION	, or those of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	are to those of
Virginia	LOCATION	, I shall be happy to join you and do what I can to promote the success of your labors .

		In such a work 1 should have the satisfaction of knowing that I was not even indirectly countenancing a vicious system of taxation , also that I was helping to put our statesmen upon an in - quiry for sources of revenue that were not tainted with every cnme save murder , of which hi ^ iiwavuicn have ever been condemned by the laws of God or man . ''

		He could be tart upon other subjects also , as in the case of his letter to the committee in charge of the Hudson-Fulton celebration .

		He repre -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL sented the indignant spirits of the men who were to be commemorated as thus speaking : '' If you wish to honor us for what we have done to render this magnificent waterway useful , restore it to the condition in which we left it and when it was ready to appease the hunger and thirst of millions of people .

		Instead of that you have not given a thought or appro - priated a penny for the discharge of the first duty which our names should have prompted you to discharge .

		Your homage to our memory is a mockery , an insult , a subter - fuge for a Roman holiday , for panem et circenses .

		Take our names from your escutcheons and replace them with the names of the candidates whose political fortunes you are striving to promote .

		We have no longer anything in common with a city in which politics and prostitution are convertible terms . ''

		And he closed his epistle in this strain : '' What a dance of death will be the procession up the Hudson of the
Half Moon	PERSON	, not the original , but the counterfeit Half Moon , ' built in the eclipse and rigged with curses dark , ' Mayor
McClellan	PERSON	at its prow and the chairman of the
Republican State Committee	ORGANIZATION	at the helm , and the aldermen who devised the Building Code in the steerage . '

		Angels and ministers of grace defend us ! '

		And so will the subscriber ever pray . ''

		The appearance of Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's autobiog - raphy , about two years ago , was the publishing event of the season .

		It carried the narrative only part way , and the author was busy with its continuation up to his closing days .

		It is understood that a considerable addition to the original three volumes has been left practically ready for publication .

		For this , as for his other literary labors , his country will ever be grate - ful , but even more for the example of his life .

		Happy indeed is the man who can earn a mod - est competence , and then deliberately devote the rest of his years to objects which take no account of money , saying with our author : '' I have com - plete independence and liberty now because I did that .

		I have done work for nothing without thinking about money for a long time . ''

		One could set himself no higher aim than this , coupling with it the cherishing of those graces of courtesy and simple dignity which made of
John Bigelow	PERSON	so very fine a gentleman .

		SOME EIGHTEENTH CENTURY TRA VELLERS IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		I. '' For a generation past , '' writes Professor Mc - Master in his '' History of the People of the
United States	LOCATION	'' referring to the year
1812	DATE	`` it had been the fashion for English travellers in
America	LOCATION	on their return home to write books narrating their ad - ventures in the New World , and describing the man - ners , customs , usages , languages , peculiarities , and forms of government of the people . ''

		Fortunately , most of these writings are forgotten . ''

		Whoever has travelled in foreign parts knows , '' as our his - torian observes , '' that such descriptions are of little value '' ; and these particular volumes are no less ill-tempered than ignorant .

		And yet contemporary readers came to believe that , behind these attacks by travellers who had received a most generous re - ception , stood the British ministry , whose policy it was to belittle and abuse us .

		Writers seriously affirmed that the seeming travellers were subsidized lampooners , out of
Grub Street	ORGANIZATION	.

		After the second of our wars with the mother country , the criticism of
America	LOCATION	took on an even more serious form .

		Critics of
Southey	ORGANIZATION	's repute , wits as modish as
Sydney Smith	PERSON	, all the quarterly reviewers , joined in the hue and cry , in order to discourage immigration , said some ; as an inexpensive manner of revenge , thought others .

		For ten years waged an inkpot-battle that was none the less bitter for being futile ; criticisms bred rejoinders , strictures , recriminations .

		Mean - time there was engendered in this country `` a hearty detestation of
Great Britain	LOCATION	which strongly affected international relations for many years to come . ''

		In - cidentally , though many `` Travels '' and `` Journeys '' and `` Journals '' were inscribed , no worthy contribu - tion was made to the literature of travel .

		However , before the kind of works I speak of came into fashion a certain number of worthier books were written in our honor by foreigners or citizens of alien birth .

		It seems strange that we who make so much of foreign travels should make so very little of these excellent hors d'oeuvres from our own garden-plot .

		The earlier voyagers high-spirited explorers , or Jesuits carrying the cross through an unmapped wil - derness make thrilling reading .

		Then there are also the eighteenth-century travellers good com - panions , albeit less heroic .

		True as it is that the Vicomte de Chateaubriand almost founded the genre of literary travels at least he may certainly be given the credit of dignifying it , as
Scott	PERSON	dignified the novel that supreme rhetorician is not the only European who found in his American experiences a literary inspiration .

		It is hardly surprising that
Lafayette	LOCATION	, who proved himself so good a friend of the Colonies , was an enthusiastic historian of their novelty and simplicity .

		He wrote home , indeed , of their patriotism and delightful equality : `` the wor - thiest and the poorest were on a level , '' and , though there there were some large fortunes , he discovered no distinction in the manners of different classes toward each other .

		Lafayette considered
Charleston	LOCATION	one of the handsomest and best-built cities he had ever seen , and its inhabitants the most agreeable people ; he found even the inns delightful .

		But
Lafayette	LOCATION	is only one traveller , and not the most illuminating .

		In the last few years , at least , American pub - lishers seem to have discovered the attractiveness of some of the less known narratives of early travel , and we have from their presses several THE DIAL , -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, handsome reprints .

		* The writers whose fame is thus refreshed are , chiefly , CrevecuMir ,
Latrobe	LOCATION	, and
John Davis	PERSON	.

		At a somewhat earlier date was issued a fragment of
Thomas Twining	PERSON	's diary recording that honest Englishman 's impressions of the States in
1796	DATE	.

		In
Virginia	LOCATION	, this observer notes , hammer and trowel were everywhere in evidence : '' a cheering sight , and a remarkable contrast with the dilapidation of cities which I had seen in my former -LSB- t. .

		, East Indian -RSB- travels .

		Although the latter , ''
Twining	PERSON	adds , '' were calcu - lated to afford a deeper interest in some respects , the scene of new and active life , the foundations of future prosperity which
Alexandria	LOCATION	presented , made me feel how much more gratifying it is to ob - serve the rise of a new state than the decline of an old one . ''

		Needless to add that the ''
Alexandria	LOCATION	'' referred to is the
Alexandria	LOCATION	of
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		Such was the mood of
America	LOCATION	's earlier visitors ; and their jottings are to be cherished by all good Americans .

		For it was only a great while later that the cosmopolitan Philarete Charles wrote : '' While
Europe	LOCATION	is breaking up ,
America	LOCATION	is forming herself .

		...
America	LOCATION	waxes great ;
Europe	LOCATION	wanes away . ''

		Charles 's antithesis was only for the future ; and it is , meanwhile , a pleasant coincidence that
Twining	ORGANIZATION	's remarks on
Alexandria	LOCATION	are pretty closely parallelled by the Franco-American Farmer ,
St. John de Creve	ORGANIZATION	- coeur .

		He declares : '' We are all apt to love and admire exotica , even though they may be inferior to our own possessions .

		And that is the reason , I imagine , why so many persons are continually going to visit
Italy	LOCATION	... Methinks there would be much more solid satisfaction in observing among us , the humble rudiments and embryos of societies spreading every where , the recent foundation of our towns , and the settlement of so many rural districts .

		I am sure that the rapidity of their growth would be more pleasing to behold , than the ruins of old towers , useless acqueducts , or impending battlements . ''

		If the general category of books written by early travellers in
America	LOCATION	has thus far wanted popularity , perhaps one reason has been the old bitterness engen - dered by a very different class of visitors .

		Twining and
Cre	ORGANIZATION	vecoeur were eclipsed , alas !

		by their virulent successors .

		Now , however , the time is ripe for us to learn , first , that not all our visitors , even at this stage , were Englishmen ; second , that of the English , not all , by any means , were cads .

AMERICA	LOCATION	100 YEARS Aoo .

		By

New York	LOCATION	:
Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		the unspeakable -LRB- albeit vivacious -RRB- Mrs.Trollope were long since banishi-d from the bookshelf .

		Let us forget their very existence in making the acquaintance of
John Davis	PERSON	, poet and novelist , peripatetic tutor and indefatigable journalist II .


Davis	PERSON	's book , if its taste is not always irreproach - able , is one of the most imaginative devoted to our then unlettered land .

		From it we learn , besides some - thing of
Brockden Brown	PERSON	, `` Father of the American Novel , '' and of the `` American Addison , ''
Joseph Dennie	PERSON	, editor of `` The Portfolio , '' much of the writer 's personality .

		And that is well ; for to know the traveller as well as the travels is one of the great desiderata in this kind of writing .

		One is sure that this
John Davis	PERSON	was a fetching compound of > mii - mentalism and self-confidence , with the latter quality reinforced by a strongly practical sense that always carried the day .

		He was a
Salisbury	ORGANIZATION	lad , we know , and , in his own words , `` reared in the lap of opulence . ''

		Also , he ran away from home to become a sailor .

		One may rest assured that , in character as in experience , he was not like most of his conservative compatriots .

		In the first place , he travelled through these States of ours by horse and sloop and on foot : and I am always prejudiced , as a fellow-pedestrian , in favor of any traveller proceeding under his own power .

		Born vagabond that he was ,
Davis	PERSON	was something of a book-worm , too .

		He writes : '' When the boatswain 's mate piped Starbowlines , I walked up the main rigging into the top .

		I always put Le Sage in ray pocket ; and in the maintop of an
East Indiaroan	LOCATION	, under a cloudless tropical sky , when the breeze waa so steady that for days we had no occasion to start either tack or sheet , I began to cultivate the language of the Court of
Lewis	PERSON	the Fourteenth . ''

		It was in
1798	DATE	that he embarked at
Bristol	LOCATION	for the
United States	LOCATION	; in other words , he was twenty-two .

		He modestly confesses : '' I had before made some progress in
Greek	LOCATION	, and began the study of the language of harmony , with the Father of Poetry , and the Bible of the Ancients .

		In Latin , I had looked into every writer of the
Julian	PERSON	and Augustan ages ; the study of French has always been to me like the cracking of nuts ; and in my vernacular idiom , I had neglected no author from
Bnnyan	LOCATION	to
Bolingbroke	LOCATION	. ''

		Thus he was , if we may take his word for it , a finished linguist .

		We read , indeed , all in one sentence , that he `` translated at
New York Bonaparte	LOCATION	's ` Campaign in
Italy	LOCATION	, ' a considerable octavo , and proceeded to the South . ''

		At one juncture , he reproduces in his book of travels a considerable `` French Essay '' of his own composition : accounting for his proficiency \ > \ the fact that he was never in
France	LOCATION	. ''

		I therefore enjoy a particular advantage , '' he explains ; '' for my style , formed only upon writers , can be infected with no col - loquial barbarisms . ''

		There spoke an Englishman !

		If his humor is sometimes delightfully uncon - scious ,
Davis	PERSON	is not wanting in calculated humor scarcely less refreshing .

		Both his humor and his amazing modernity of temper declare themselves in the preface to his substantial Travels , where he promises us that , in comparing this volume with
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL those of his precedessors , one '' will find himself exempt from various persecutions , '' to wit : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- I make no mention of my dinner , whether it was fish or flesh , boiled or roasted , hot or cold .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- I never complain of my bed .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- I make no drawings of old castles , old churches , old pent-houses , and old walls , which , undeserving of repair , have been abandoned by their possessors . ''

		These are negative merits and some of them doubt - ful at that .

		It is more to the point that he delin - eates , in high relief , more than one '' original '' now and again an American type , still recognizable ; now such a figure as `` Mr.
George	PERSON	, '' the conceited Irish schoolmaster , his friend ; not to forget the ad - mirable De Bow , a physician with more than a touch of the charlatan , who might have stepped out from a chapter of
Smollett	ORGANIZATION	or Fielding .

		He says : '' I landed at
Charleston	LOCATION	with Doctor De Bow , who had clad himself in his black suit , and though a young man , wore a monstrous pair of spectacles on his nose .

		Adieu jollity !

		adieu laughter !

		the Doctor was without an acquaintance on a strange shore , and he had no other friend but his solemnity to recommend him .

		... In a few days he contrived to hire part of a house in Union-Street ; obtained credit for a con - siderable quantity of drugs ; and only wanted a chariot to equal the best Physician in
Charleston	LOCATION	. ''

		De Bow avoided Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's error , and it was to no purpose that
Davis	PERSON	'' endeavoured to provoke him to laughter . ''

		Instead , he got his friend the traveller to furnish him with `` a few Latin phrases , which he dealt out to his hearers with an air of profound learning .

		He generally concluded his speeches with Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri . ''

		Well might Sir
George Trevelyan	PERSON	write in his '' American Revolution '' that these Travels of
John Davis	PERSON	's make '' an exquisitely absurd book , which the world , to the dimunition of its gayety , has for - gotten ! ''

		III .

		The editor of these Travels takes pains to state that here is a work unique in its period , being written by one who , professedly a man of letters , '' cared little for the political aspects of what he saw , and asked no place among statisticians . ''

		-LRB- It seems to be the editor 's chief affair , nowadays , to prove his book `` unique . '' -RRB-

		And Mr.
Morrison	PERSON	goes on to say that '' Crevecceur and Chateaubriand were sentimentalists '' which is true enough ; but that Chateaubriand `` might have written his book in his tower '' whatever that means and that Crevecoeur '' is very disquisitional . ''

		Clever oppo - sitions , no doubt ; although what has deeply im - pressed me about
Davis	PERSON	and Chateaubriand is , precisely , their common aloofness from mere mat - ters of fact ; while both
Davis	PERSON	and
Crevecceur	PERSON	, like Chateaubriand himself , are saturated with
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		Davis was , frankly , a reader and ad - mirer of '' Emile '' ; as for Crevecceur , he does not need to name
Rousseau	PERSON	, penetrated as he is by some of his theories and all of his sympathies .

		Creve - cceur is , at bottom , a far more Utopian personage than either Chateaubriand or
Davis	PERSON	; he delights in spinning out little idylls and anecdotes , such as Bernardin might have inscribed .

		Davis , on the other hand , writes that '' his study was Latin , his recreation the Confessions of the eloquent Citizen of
Geneva	LOCATION	. ''

		Just as the author of the Memoires d' Outre - Tombe lived out , in
England	LOCATION	, that episode of the
Nouvelle Heloise	PERSON	, so did
Davis	PERSON	, in
America	LOCATION	, indulge himself -LRB- he , too , a tutor -RRB- in adventures mildly h la St.-Preux .

		He even read the novel of
Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	's disciple
Bernardin	PERSON	with one of his fair pupils herself a
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		If one could accept
John Davis	PERSON	's writings as strictly documentary , one would be almost justified in defending
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's paradox that Life copies Literature not
Litera	PERSON	- ture mere Life .

		But
Davis	PERSON	's narrative is itself largely `` literary . ''

		It is , let us say , as imagina - tive as
Rostand	PERSON	's '' Romanesques '' : where Percinet reads Sylvette '' Romeo and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' and where these youngsters proceed thereupon to interpret for them - selves the beaux vers du grand Will ; their fathers helped by Straforel complacently performing for an act or two the
Montagu	PERSON	and Capulet .

		In
Davis	PERSON	, one never forgets the novelist in the traveller .

		Crevecoeur 's `` Letters from an American Farmer , '' like
Davis	PERSON	's book , has an unmistakably literary mo - tive and flavor .

		This time , however , the book is not merely `` literary '' : it is literature .

		According to
Hazlitt	PERSON	, '' the power to sympathize with nature , with - out thinking of ourselves or others , if it is not a defi - nition of genius , comes near to it '' ; and he wrote these lines with Crevecceur in mind as one who pos - sessed that magic power .

		He who thinks the praise too great for a writer so unfamiliar is recommended to read of a certain battle between two snakes of '' the dazzling , almost invisible flutter of the hum - ming-bird 's wing '' of the planting of the sassafras tree .

		But '' enough of this illustrious obscure , '' to quote
Hazlitt	PERSON	once more ; '' for it is the rule of criti - cism to praise none but the overpraised , and to offer fresh incense to the idol of the day . ''

		Others , at least , have followed that '' rule of criti - cism '' : the American Farmer born a French gen - tleman , be it said in passing has long enjoyed an undisturbed seclusion .

		Lamb , to be sure , recom - mended his book to friends and correspondents ; the dreamers about a Pantisocracy read it ;
Lowell	PERSON	called it '' that dear book . ''

		But Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	has preferred to include
Woolman	PERSON	's dull Journal in his recent col - lection a book no more informing , certainly , and much less graceful in spirit and in phrasing .

		Though here stands a writer who uses the tone of an ideal - istic philosopher and the powers of observation of a woodsman , there is only this clumsy reprint to remind readers of his adventurous life and gentle spirit ; to remind them , also , how he tangibly expressed the Rousseauian ideal .

		Though we have in
St.-John	DATE	de Crevecceur a contemporary a correspondent , even of
Franklin	PERSON	, yet , while he shared many of Poor
Richard	PERSON	's enthusiasms , one may travel far without finding a more complete antithesis to the common - sense philosopher .

		In a prose age ,
Crevecceur	PERSON	lived a kind of pastoral poetry ; in an age largely blind , he saw the beauties of nature , not through readings in B THE DIAL , -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, the French , bat with his own keen eyes .

		His powers of observation are in marked contract with Chateau - briand 's generalizing tendency , exhibited in his '' American Travels '' as in all his writings .

		And t lie man 's optimism , his grateful personality , his sunVr - ings , are all endearments .

		This poet-naturalist might have used Cotton 's '' Retirement '' for a motto on his title-page : '' Farewell , thou busy world , and may We never meet again ; Here I can eat and sleep and pray ... '' but that he found time to turn the clods withal , and eyes to watch the earth blackening behind the plough . ''

		Our necessities , '' wrote
Poe	PERSON	-LRB- who contended , in a half-hearted manner , that Americans were as poet - ical a people as any other -RRB- , '' have been mistaken for our propensities .

		Having been forced to make railroads , it has been deemed impossible that we should make verse . ''

		But here was St.-John de Crevecoeur writing , in the eighteenth century , his idyllic Letters ; while , if he did not build railroads , he interested himself in the experiments of
Fitch	LOCATION	and
Rumsey	PERSON	and
Parmentier	PERSON	, and he organized a packet - line between
New York	LOCATION	and a French port .

		Creve - coeur should have appealed to the American imagina - tion from the first , combining as he did the faculty of the ideal and the achievement of the actual .

		IV . ''

		A letter is only conversation in black and white , '' he writes .

		Our Farmer emphasizes his plainness , and promises only a matter-of-fact account of his pursuits .

		Yet he has his full share of eighteenth century '' sensibility . ''

		Since he is , however , at many removes from the sophistications of
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	, he is stirred , not by the fond behavior of a lap - dog -LRB- like
Mackenzie	PERSON	-RRB- , or `` the little arrangement '' a carter makes with the bridle of his departed ass -LRB- driven to death , likely enough ; see the `` Sentimen - tal Journey '' -RRB- , but by such matters as he finds at home . ''

		When I contemplate my wife , by my fire - side , while she either spins , knits , darns , or suckles our child , I can not describe the various emotions of love , of gratitude , of conscious pride which thrill in my heart and often overflow in voluntary tears . ''

		He never returns home `` without feeling some pleas - ant emotion , '' often suppressed `` as useless and fool - ish . ''

		He has his reveries , too but they are pure and generous ; their subject is the future of his child - ren .

		One is reminded of a page in
Twining	LOCATION	's diary , already cited ; writing of the farms that he passed in travelling from
Philadelphia	LOCATION	to
Baltimore	LOCATION	, and the farmhouses '' formed of bars or logs of wood , covered with laths and plaster , '' the situation of their proprietors seems to him little enviable ; but com - pensated by the fact that '' every first settler in a new country labors less for the present than for the future , for himself than for his posterity , and it is this honorable consciousness that invigorates his toil , cheers his solitude , and alleviates his privations . ''

		Here Twining renders , as
Hazlitt	PERSON	justly says Creve - cceur succeeds in doing , in his vividly characteristic manner , '' not only the objects , but the feelings , of a new country . ''

		Nor is that all .

		For Creveoceur at least is , when all is said and done , the eighteenth-century Thoreau : a
Thoreau	ORGANIZATION	more urbane -LRB- if urbanity is at all compatible with the thought of that naturalist -RRB- a French-Amer - ican
Thoreau	LOCATION	.

		Other journalists of the eighteenth century were gifted a * naturalist ^ : this even among the American travellers .

		The architect
Latrobe	LOCATION	, for example , was more highly gifted in this respect than was good Crevecceur .

		He aptly enough describes -LRB-
Petersburg	LOCATION	,
June 17	DATE	, 1796 -RRB- how a Mr.
Anderson	PERSON	, with what he considered '' a most desperate intrepid - ity , stripped himself , and , furnished only with a pipe of tobacco , knocked off the head of two beehives and robbed them of their contents without being once stung by the thousand bees that were buzzing about him . ''

		But Crevecoaur describes how , in midwinter , instead of trapping and '' murthering '' the quail . ''

		often in the angles of fences where the motion of the wind prevents the snow from settling , I carry them both chaff and grain : the one to feed them , the other to prevent their tender feet from freezing fast to the earth , as I have frequently observed them to do . ''

		This is an indication of his love for the birds of field and forest ; he was no less observ - ing than affectionate .

		A German traveller wrote that '' in the thrush kind
America	LOCATION	is poor ; there is only the red-breasted robin ... Very few birds nest in the woods ; a solemn stillness prevails through them , interrupted only by the screaming of the crows . ''

		It is well to set beside this passage Creve - cceur 's statement that in the
spring	DATE	he generally rose from bed `` about the indistinct interval , which , properly speaking , is neither night nor day , '' to enjoy '' the universal vocal choir . ''

		He continues -LRB- more and more lyrically -RRB- : '' Who can listen unmoved to the sweet love-tales of our robins , told from tree to tree ?

		or to the shrill cat birds ?

		The sublime accents of the thrush from on high , always re - tard ray steps , that I may listen to the delicious music . ''

		And the Farmer is no less interested in '' the aston - ishing art which all birds display in the construction of their nests , ill provided as we may suppose them with proper tools . ''

		At one time during his long American residence , he gathered the materials for an unpublished study of ant-life ; and his bees were ever a great interest for him : '' their government , their industry , their quarrels , their passions . ''

		In hours of rest he was most often to be found , he tells us , under the locust tree where his bee-hive stood . ''

		By their movements , '' he wrote , '' I can predict the weather , and can tell the day of their swarming . ''

		When other men go hunting game , he goes bee - hunting .

		Such are the matters he tells of in his Letters .

		And he gains in comparison with
Latrobe	LOCATION	that other naturalist so long as our principal ob - jects of comparison are style and quickness of senti - ment and liveliness of interest To neither writer was nature a mere bundle of poetic stage-properties , soiled by much handling .

		And for Creveoffiur , at least , nature was something fresh and inviting and
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL full of inner as well as superficial meaning .

		He took more pleasure in hunting bees than in expedi - tions with his dog and gun ; the king-birds destroy his bees ; but , he adds , they drive the crows away .

		To this extent does he anticipate
Emerson	PERSON	's doctrine of compensations .

		As for the king-birds , he ordi - narily could not persuade himself to shoot them .

		On one occasion , when he fired at a more than commonly impertinent specimen , '' and immediately opened his maw , '' he took from it 175 bees . ''

		I laid them all on a blanket in the sun , and to ray great surprise 54 returned to life , licked themselves clean , and joy - fully went back to the hive ; where they probably informed their companions of such an adventure and escape as I be - lieve had never happened before to American bees . ''

		Must one regard this as a fable ?

		It is by no means so remarkable a yarn as one may find told by other naturalists of the same century .

		There is , for ex - ample , that undated letter of
John Bartram	PERSON	's in which he makes inquiries of his brother William concerning '' Ye Wonderful Flower '' ; there is , too ,
Kalm	PERSON	's re - port of
Bartram	PERSON	's bear : '' When a bear catches a bear , he kills her in the following manner : he bites a hole into the hide & blows with all his power into it , till the animal swells excessively & dies ; for the air expands greatly between flesh and the hide . ''

		After fancies like these , where is the improbability of
Crevecoeur	PERSON	's modest adaptation of the Jonah allegory , that he refreshes in applying to the king - bird and the bees ?

		The episode suggests , for that matter , a chapter in Ik Marvel 's '' Farm at Edge - wood . ''

		That later '' American Farmer '' describes the same birds , the same bees ; he has , too , the same supremely gentle spirit . ''

		I have not the heart to shoot the king-birds , nor do I enter very actively into the battles of the bees , '' he confesses . ''

		I give them fair play , good lodging , limitless flowers , wil - lows bending -LRB- as Virgil advises -RRB- into the quiet waters of a near pool . ''

		Crevecoeur himself might have written thus ; it is the essential modernity of the earlier writer that most impresses one , after the quiet charm of his pictures .

		Yet his was the age of
William Livingston	PERSON	later governor of
New Jersey	LOCATION	.

		In the very year when a
London	LOCATION	publisher issued the first edition of the Farmer 's Letters ,
Livingston	PERSON	-LRB- described on his title - page as a `` young gentleman educated at Yale Col - lege '' -RRB- brought out his '' Philosophic Solitude , '' at
Trenton	LOCATION	, in his native State .

		It is worth our while to quote '' Philosophic Solitude '' : for '' one can not write in white chalk except on a blackboard , '' and here is offered the chance to compare
Crevecoeur	PERSON	's prose with contemporary verse : '' Let ardent heroes seek renown in arms , Pant after fame , and rush to war 's alarms , ... Mine be the pleasures of a rural life . ''

		The thought is one phrased with much directness by
Crevecoeur	PERSON	.

		But let us quote the lines that fol - low the exordium : '' Me to sequestred scenes , ye muses guide , Where nature wantons in her virgin-pride ; To mossy banks edg 'd round with op ` ning flow ` rs , Elysian fields , and araaranthin bow ` rs ... Welcome ye shades !

		all hail , ye vernal blooms !

		Ye bow ` ry thickets , and prophetic glooms !

		Ye forests hail !

		ye solitary woods , '' but since the `` young gentleman educated at
Yale College	ORGANIZATION	'' is on the verge of rhyming '' woods '' and '' floods , '' it is more kind to leave him here .

		He has been quoted , not to qualify for a place on Dr.
Crothers	PERSON	's '' Bookshelf of the Hundred Worst Books , '' but as a poet of his time and place .

		He had a fine eye for nature seen through library windows .

		He echoed a whole line of British poets most of them second-rate poets ; echoed them atrociously .

		It is precisely because one finds no such '' echoes '' in Creveco3ur that one may praise his spontaneity and vigor .

		He did not im - port nightingales into his
America	LOCATION	, as some of his contemporaries among the poets did .

		He blazed the way , rather , toward our present-day appreciation of surrounding nature which was not banal then .

		It is the youthfulness of these Letters , after their century and a third of dust-gathering , that is least likely to escape us .

		They are , in their joy of living in a new land in the future , as it were fresher even than are
Davis 's Travels	ORGANIZATION	in their irrepressible humor .

		They '' smell of the woods , '' as their author himself did not fail to observe .

		V. For the collector of mere facts ,
Crevecoaur	PERSON	's work is of scarcely more consequence than
Davis	PERSON	's and
Davis	PERSON	was a born romancer .

		Neither of these writers compares in '' documentary '' worth with
Latrobe	LOCATION	or Twining curt as the latter is .

		For that reason I say nothing of these men 's attacks upon slavery .

		I do not even discuss
Crevecosur	PERSON	's idealistic account of
Nantucket	LOCATION	, '' with the manners , customs , policy , and trade of the Inhabitants . ''

		These chapters in their works are , after all , less instructive than
Twining	PERSON	's charitable notes upon American inns and roads and bridges , or
Latrobe	LOCATION	's upon
New Orleans	LOCATION	, the con struction of the Capitol at
Washington	LOCATION	-LRB- which he completed -RRB- , and so on .

		All these are matters for the historian .

		Is there not room on our reading - table for the more imaginative narrative of Davis the more '' exalted '' book of the Cultivateur ?

		Early American literature is not so rich that we can afford to miss
Crevecoaur	PERSON	's chief performance , any more than
Franklin	PERSON	's Autobiography .

		These are almost the only interesting books written in our land during the eighteenth century , and deserve good treatment .

		Nor is the literature of American travel rich enough to justify the neglect of the sev - eral nomads whom I have named notably
John Davis	PERSON	.

		Fortunately for the reader who means to go further in this matter , I have not presented here more than a few chance crumbs from the table that stands ready spread .


Latrobe	LOCATION	, architect and naturalist ; Crevecceur , farmer-philosopher ;
Davis	PERSON	, man of let - ters ;
Twining	LOCATION	,
East India	LOCATION	bureaucrat : even in the list of their varied names and trades there is a piquancy not often suggested by the backs of books .

		Their content is ten times better yet !

		Ian .

		1 , CASUAL COMMENT .

		A NOTABLE TRIUMVIRATE OF DI8TIN < .1 I-ll 1 I AMERICANS is that which includes the names of
John Higelow	PERSON	-LRB- who has just left us -RRB- ,
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	, and
Samuel J. Tilden	PERSON	.

		Both of the latter men were objects of Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's especial admira - tion , and to both he rendered invaluable services in writing their lives and editing their works .

		With - out question his most valuable contribution to litera - ture is his masterly achievement in biography , or rather in autobiography , `` The Life of Benjamin Franklin Written by Himself . ''

		This triumph of editorial skill was the natural fruit of Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's term as consul and afterward minister at
Paris	LOCATION	, where the trial of his distinguished predecessor in diplomacy seems from the first to have lured him to those studies of Franklin that continued thereafter one of his chief interests .

		It was his discovery in
Paris	LOCATION	of the original manuscript of
Franklin	PERSON	's auto - biography that mainly prompted the literary labors which were given to the world in
1874	DATE	in those three familiar volumes of the '' Life of Franklin . ''

		Unpublished manuscripts , letters , printed corres - pondence , in fact all available sources of information , were made tributary to this authoritative account of one with whom the editor found himself so largely in sympathy , and some of whose distinguishing traits he himself has been said to possess .

		A certain genial largeness of nature belonged to both ; both were philosophers , and both were humorists in their way , with insight into human nature and a power of apt and striking oral and written expression .

		Eminent public service , too , must be credited to both , and the active life of each was of unusual length and useful - ness , though the eighty-four years of Franklin were exceeded by ten in Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's record of longevity .

		The
Paris	LOCATION	studies which produced so noteworthy results in making the world better acquainted with
Franklin	PERSON	led also to the editing of the latter 's com - plete works in ten volumes the now recognized standard edition of those works .

		Hardly second to the admiring tribute rendered by Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	to
Franklin	PERSON	the statesman of the past , was his whole - souled devotion to
Samuel J. Tilden	PERSON	, his friend and contemporary in public life , whose biography he wrote and whose speeches and other writings he edited .

		But a still greater service was rendered to the cause of letters when
Tilden	PERSON	's literary executor undertook also the duties of trustee of his estate , and thus became instrumental in establishing the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	on its triple foundation ,
Astor	LOCATION	,
Lenox	LOCATION	, and
Tilden	PERSON	.

		Elected the first president of this library board , he held that high office until his death ... THE OUTLOOK FOR POKTRY IN
AMERICA	LOCATION	appears to Mr.
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	, in his seventh annual survey of magazine verse , encouragingly good .

		Writing in the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' he says : `` That poetry is swinging back , not only artistically and ideally , but commercially , is indicated , and it ix a good sign , by the experience of one
New York	LOCATION	publisher at le : i-t , who has issued a great many l > ooks of poetry , not one of which was at the author 's ex - pense , and all of which have been successful com - mercially . ''

		Other signs in plenty .

		Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	finds to confirm his belief that poetry is looking up , and that better times for the poets lie ahead .

		He cites the publication of numerous noteworthy articles on poetry and poets in the year 's magazines , besides giving the result of his examination < > f the poems appearing in six prominent periodicals of the same period .

		Also , '' the
Poetry Society of America	ORGANIZATION	has weathered through a useful first year of its existence , and is now planning for a second year of practical endeavor in throwing its influence and labors towards the circulation of poetry among the people through - out the country . ''

		A cheering indication of popular interest in poetry not noted by Mr.
Braithwaite	PERSON	is the increasingly frequent inquiry , in the notes and queries '' department of many papers , as to the author - ship of favorite old poems , the reprinting of which is also often requested .

		WHAT THEY ARE READING IN
ATHENS	LOCATION	in these very post-classical days seems to be partly indicated by an advertisement just now making itself conspic - uous in the Greek capital , calling attention to a new series of translations from the ancient authors .

		A complete set of these modern Greek versions of the Greek classics may be had for the remarkably mod - erate sum of one hundred and twenty drachme , or somewhat less than twenty -
four dollars	MONEY	of our money .

		Doubtless the volumes will not compare in elaborate - ness of detail with the prospective
Loeb	PERSON	set of an - cient classics , but it may be that they will be more read by the people .

		A correspondent writes of noting a young mechanical engineer reading the '' CEdipus at Colonus '' in a street-car even under the discomfort of strap-hanging with one hand while he held his book with the other .

		OBSERVATIONS OF AN UNREFORMEO SI-KLI .

		KR catch our eye in an open letter to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' from Mr.
Albert J. R. Schumaker	PERSON	, who , apparently in facetious allusion to a recent leaflet from No. 1 Madison Avenue , gives his ad - dress as '' Upland Lawn ,
Pa.	LOCATION	, '' whither he had pre - sumably gone to '' observe how gently the sunlight -LSB- of reformed spelling -RSB- comes in the place of the re - ceding darkness '' of conventional orthography .

		This correspondent suggests that perhaps the present de - plored discrepancy between English spelling and English pronunciation may be as much the fault of the latter as of the former , and he asks , `` Why may it not best be removed by modifying that element which admittedly is least resistant to change ' : This uniformity in pronunciation , he holds , '' is for many reasons a primary desideratum , and , when attained , little will be heard about phonetic spelling . ''

		Any - thing like fixity , however , either in pronunciation or in spelling , is not to be expected in a living
Ian	PERSON	-
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 11 guage , though we might well give heed to Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	's admonition of a few years ago and pay greater attention to orthoepy .

		Just at present it may afford entertainment to quote a news paragraph of the day : '' In
North Carolina	LOCATION	an enraged citizen shot a neighbor through the breast , inflicting a wound which resulted in the latter 's death and his own ar - rest for murder .

		A short time later , however , he was released from custody .

		In the indictment , the clerk had spelled breast as ' b-r-e-s-t . '

		The court held that the misspelled indictment was not legal , and freed the prisoner '' there being no such part as '' brest '' known to human anatomy .

		Probably a shot in the '' hed '' or '' nek '' would likewise have fallen outside judicial cognizance in this ortho - graphically unreformed court .

		A pathetic New Year 's card now before us exhorts to '' let every noble thot have expression '' ; an appeal likely to come with lessened force to those who were not `` cot '' young enough to be `` tot '' to profit by or to be '' wrot '' upon by counsels couched in that peculiar form .

		... CULTURE FOB A WHOLE COMMONWEALTH , and that commonwealth
Minnesota	LOCATION	, is the ideal cherished by the new head of the
State University	ORGANIZATION	at
Minne	LOCATION	- apolis . ''

		I want to see the entire
University	ORGANIZATION	merged into one great extension department , '' says Dr.
Vin	PERSON	- cent , '' to teach the principles of agriculture , engi - neering , political science , economics , history , and languages ... Why should we not take our Uni - versity into the country districts and maintain a Chautauqua at various points in the State ?

		We could call them university weeks ... We could have an extension circuit ` of six towns in one com - munity and travel between them in motor cars ... These lectures could be given in the day .

		In the evening we could give our dramatic clubs , our glee clubs and orchestra to supply the music , and give Shakespearian plays .

		We would take demonstration tents , as is the custom at the county fairs , to show various agricultural and industrial exhibits .

		We would take with us a model house its rooms fur - nished by home economic experts .

		With this there would be demonstrations in cooking . ''

		Truly , the educational world moves .

		There was a time , within the memory of men still living , when the most promis - ing son of a well-ordered family was sent , with prayers and tears and hopes , to the college of his father and grandfather , to fit himself for a learned profession , while those at home watched his progress in breathless interest .

		Now it is proposed that the university shall come to the whole family , and to every family , and turn the whole commonwealth into an aristocracy of culture or should we say a democracy of culture ?

		... MRS.
KATE GANNETT WELLS	PERSON	, great-granddaughter of President
Ezra Stiles	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and daughter of the Rev.
Ezra Stiles Gannett	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	-LRB- long minister of the
Arlington Street Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	, where he succeeded
William Ellery Channing	PERSON	-RRB- , died suddenly , at the age of seventy-three , at her
Boston	LOCATION	home on the thirteenth of
December	DATE	.

		Though known in periodical and book literature as
Kate Gannett Wells	PERSON	-LRB- author of '' In the Clearings , '' ''
Miss Curtis	PERSON	, '' `` Two Modern Women , '' `` Little
Dick	PERSON	's Son , '' and a collection of essays entitled `` About People '' -RRB- , the full name of this veteran worker in many worthy causes , educational and religious , was
Catherine Boott Gannett Wells	PERSON	.

		In
1863	DATE	she married
Samuel Wells	PERSON	, a prominent
Boston	LOCATION	lawyer whose name is associated with many scientific and philanthropic societies , but her own work in the world was carried on with the vigor and independence of one unfet - tered by matrimonial ties .

		For almost a quarter of a century she served on the
State Board of Educa	ORGANIZATION	- tion , interesting herself especially in art education , and being instrumental in starting the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Normal Art School .

		Her pen was a busy one amid her other activities ; and she wrote especially on subjects connected with those activities , though , as her list of books shows , she was not unendowed with creative imagination .

		A familiar figure on the platform and a leader in numerous good causes , she leaves many to lament her death .

		A FRENCH TRIBUTE TO
DICKENS	LOCATION	, at this time when all the English-speaking world is preparing to celebrate his centennial , has a certain special signifi - cance .

		A new dramatization , or stage adaptation , of ``
David Copperfield	PERSON	, '' from the hand of
M. Max Maurey	PERSON	, has been playing at the Ode'on in
Paris	LOCATION	, and has met with popular favor even without having to resort to the familiar French device of caricaturing
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	.

		The play , while taking certain liberties with the letter of its original , seems to have caught a good deal of the spirit of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	even in its foreign dress .

		It produced a
Micawber	LOCATION	, at any rate , that gave great satisfaction though whether
Dickens	PERSON	himself would have recognized him maybe somewhat doubtful .

		At the same time with this more ambitious undertaking at the Ode'on there has been given at a humbler playhouse a moving-picture representation of various comical scenes from '' Pickwick , '' which one may safely infer to have vastly delighted the groundlings .

		There is no denying the universality and the immortality of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's human appeal .

		THE RATING OP FIRST EDITIONS OF `` R. L. S. '' has notably risen since the time when Mr.
Charles Harrison	PERSON	, a
London	LOCATION	publisher who now retires after fourteen years of service with
Messrs. Kegan Paul & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and twenty-one with
Messrs. Newnes	PERSON	, disposed of some of
Stevenson	PERSON	's early works as `` remainders '' his '' Virginibus Puerisque , '' '' Travels with a Donkey , '' and '' An Inland Voyage '' going for
ten pence	MONEY	apiece in the original editions that to-day command five and six pounds each .

		What form of investment , if one but had the requisite foresight in book values , could be more profitable than the pur - chase of about-to-be-valuable first editions of current works ?

		But we have to admit , after the manner of
Duncan	PERSON	, there 's no art to find the book 's ultimate commercial value in its contents .

		i HE LEGACY OF WILLIAM JAMKS .

		* Two volumes by
William James	PERSON	have ap - peared since the remarkable man who bore the name has passed away .

		`` Some Problems < > f Philosophy '' is printed from an unfinished manuscript as `` a beginning of an introduction to philosophy , '' and is addressed to the student and the general reader the latter in respect to the writings of James neither an inconsiderable nor a perfunctory public . ''

		Memories and
Stu	PERSON	dies '' collects the addresses , essays , and occa - sional papers of recent years , for the most part addressed to a larger circle responsive to the vigor of his thought , the charm of his words .

		Together they constitute a legacy valuable in its own right , enhanced in value by a sense of mo - mentous loss .

		Professor
Royce	PERSON	places
William James	PERSON	along with
Jonathan Edwards	PERSON	and
Ralph Waldo Emerson	PERSON	as the three , '' and only three , '' representative American philosophers , and ac - cords to
James	PERSON	`` a more extended range of present influence than
Emerson	PERSON	has ever possessed . ''

		The Americanism of James combined a pioneering freshness of view , a command of self-made power , with a democratic sympathy of insight that won the respect of foreign scholarship of whatever persuasion , and gained him a loyal following at home .

		And yet he sowed and reaped in pastures old which he made to appear new with the promise of an added richness of harvest .

		W r hatever the final value of his constructive contributions may prove to be , his reconstruction of problems to meet the needs and guide the interests of his generation give him the place of a distinguished leader of the thoughts of thoughtful men .

		James the philosopher and James the human - ist appear effectively in the present volumes ; and there is nothing more characteristically Jamesian than the determination and the power to make philosophy human , to divest it of '' dry dogmatic ways . ''

		No teacher of philosophy can spend the first hour of his course more profitably than by reading to his students the opening chapter of the '' Problems , '' entitled '' Philosophy and its Critics '' : '' At a technical school a man may grow into a first-rate instrument for doing a cer - tain job , and he may miss all the graciousness of mind suggested by the term liberal culture .

		The mind of philosophy '' is full of air that plays round every subject . ''

		It rouses from '' native dogmatic slumber , '' and breaks up caked prej - udices . ''

		It has always been `` a sort of feeun - dation of four different human interests , science , poetry , religion , andlo ^ ic , I. y one another . ''

		`` A man with no philosophy in him is the most inau - spicious and unprofitable of all possible social mates . ''

		The questioning of the value of the dis - cipline is familiar ; it twits the philosopher with being like a `` blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat that is not there . ''

		Though per - tinent as a warning , the taunt is beside the mark as a criticism ; for the problems are insistent , and leave the alternative of a shallow satisfaction or a deeper one . ''

		Philosophy in the full sense is only man thinking , '' and projects and reflects the nature and history of humanity as does no other occupation .

		It has its dramatic aspects , and makes the step from the primitive medicine - man working a charm upon the hair of an enemy , to the spirit and equipment of the modern labor - atory , a triumph of sound thinking sustained by insight nurtured in philosophy .

		The modern world is even more a way of thinking than a way of living .

		The real issue has come to divide men according as they hold the cumulative philosophic impulse of the past to be adequate for immediate and future needs , or hold the fresh philosophic interpretation to be an indispensable support of intellectual progress .

		Among the philosophers , the equally significant choice extends to the treat - ment of the problems that are held to be decisive and vital ; and if we follow
James	PERSON	, in this domain temperament as well as logical perspective asserts itself , and there emerges the classic academic rationalist striving for a closed system with ab - stract thought enthroned and its mandates re - alized in the world conceptually conceived , or the romantic empiricist emphasizing the vastness and richness of perceptual experience , and build - ing of it and upon it a clue map of the mind 's domain .

		As the '' beginning of an introduction to phil - osophy , '' this overture may suffice to suggest the approach to the theme and the treatment of its problems .

		The problem of '' the percept and the concept , '' together with the resulting > roblem of the `` one and the many '' as the pat - rn of the world 's reality , prone as it is to in - vite dialectic subtlety and a confusion of solids with shadows , is far more than a teething-ring ` or students or a sophistic puzzle for raaturer wits .

		Its solution , however provisional , sets the - rend of the pursuit , determines the position from which the world will be posed .

		For
James	PERSON	, tin -

		THE DIAL 13 solvent application is the pragmatic criterion the test of all our perplex considerations as meaning and functional workability ; and in his architectural scheme , which incomplete '' is too much like an arch built only on one side , '' it is this feature that shapes the design , the
spring	DATE	, and the form of the arch .

		Hardly secondary to these problems is the problem of novelty , the issue of determinism , the struggle for a rational view of causation .

		World-old questions these , but yet differently significant to the modern situ - ation rendered in a revised version ; fortunate the age whose students may take their excursion into these fields , personally conducted by the quality of leadership possessed by
William James	PERSON	.

		Among the notable qualities of
James	PERSON	's writ - ings was his ability to state the other side of the case .

		He never set up men of straw ; con - troversy was a means of clarification .

		He had large intellectual sympathies , and free ones , un - restrained by convention .

		It is natural to find him an adept in psychological portraiture .

		In this there is a touch of the Rembrandtesque , re - vealing in a pragmatic way not a faithful assem - blage of features , but in a contrasted flash of high light and deep background what the man or the occasion meant .

		As is true of
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	, the acknowledged great and the significant in humbler types of humanity received like treat - ment at his hands .

		In the '' Memories and Studies , '' along with studies of
Emerson	PERSON	and
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	and
Spencer	PERSON	, appear names which , like the more obscure of
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	's sitters , will carry a vivid impression to later generations , be - cause they were set down in the pen - strokes of James .

		James summed up the purpose of a col - lege education as that of helping you '' to know a good man when you see him . ''

		He practiced what he preached ; but of those who might fol - low him modestly in detection of significance , few could hope to share his remarkable gift of rendering , which was not a trick of technique but a quality of inner enlightenment a con - tradictory esoteric revelation , in that once articulate it seemed familiar , intelligible , and commendable .

		This emphasis of significance was deliberate .

		In speaking of
Emerson	LOCATION	, he called him '' a fas - tidious lover of significance and distinction , '' whose optimism was not `` an indiscriminate hur - rahing for the universe . ''

		In no less loyal a vein he speaks of his friend
Francis Boot	PERSON	, a character healthy and definite , and true to itself . ''

		When a carpenter has a surface to measure , he slides his rule along it , and over all its pecul - iarities .

		I sometimes think of Boot as such a standard rule against which the changing fash - ions of humanity of the last century might come to measurement . ''

		The mood is at its happiest in doing honor to the memory of '' a knight - errant of the intellectual life , '' `` a leveller upward of men ' '
Thomas Davidson	PERSON	.

		It is pre - sumably of
Davidson	PERSON	that he is thinking when he deplores the blighting conventionality of the academic life , and reminds the men of Harvard that '' our undisciplinables are our proudest pro- duct . '' ''

		The memory of
Davidson	PERSON	will always strengthen my faith in personal freedom and its spontaneities , and make me less unqualifiedly respectful than ever of ' Civilization ' with its herding and branding , licensing and degree - giving , authorizing and appointing , and in gen - eral regulating and administering by system the lives of human beings . '' ''

		The best common - wealth will always be the one that most cherishes the men who represent the residual interests , the one that leaves the largest scope to their pecul - iarities . ''

		It is this romantic admiration of the romantic that gave the zest to the sincere ad - miration for the work of
Frederic Myers	PERSON	in the obscure mazes of '' psychical research . ''

		The classic-academic psychologist insists on neatly assembled facts , which he can safely '' tuck in '' under his system ; he disports himself on '' a sun-lit terrace , '' and declines an excursion into the shrubbery beyond .

		It is when '' the nobler simplicities '' pale , that the jungle invites .

		Even the critics , he contends , those who find the thought of
Myers	PERSON	extravagant and his lead false , no less than the subject of their criticism , `` obey the dramatic possibilities '' of their tempera - ment , express their personal equation in terms of '' the will to believe . ''

		In the didactic vein rarer in James the thesis becomes a plea for the recognition of superiority , as the sense for superiority should be the hall-mark of the cul - tivated college-bred .

		If that fails , all is failure . ''

		To have spent one 's youth at college , in con - tact with the choice and rare and precious , and yet still to be a blind prig or vulgarian , unable to scent out human excellence or to divine it amid its accidents , to know it only when ticketed and labelled and forced on us by others , this indeed should be accounted the very calamity and shipwreck of a higher education . ''

		The col - lege will come to its own only when the college tone will have `` the highest spreading power '' ; its mission , so inadequately served , is to raise the tone of democracy .

		By this test of the quality which it furthers and cherishes will democracy be judged .

		The wealth of nations consists '' in the number of superior men that it harbors . ''

		14 THE DIAL -LRB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, ** Where quality is the thing sought after , the thing of supreme quality is cheap , whatever the price one has to pay for it . ''

		There is no uncertainty in the tone of
James	PERSON	's protagonism or of his protest .

		Perhaps to one of his temperament , the most trying assignment was the handling of an unsympathetic subject .

		He had such in his review of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, which is merciless in its fairness . ''

		Greatness and smallness never lived so closely in one skin together . '' ''

		Rarely has
Nature	ORGANIZATION	performed an odder or more Dickens-like feat than when she deliberately designed , or accidentally stumbled into , the personality of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	. ''

		Con - sider the reach and spread of his works , his wide curiosities , his erudition , his devotion to lofty purpose , and we conjure up a '' rich and exu - berant human being '' ; what we find is `` an old - maidish personage , inhabiting boarding-houses , equable and lukewarm in all his tastes and pas - sions * ' ; '' a stickler for trifles , devoid in youth of any wide designs on life '' ; giving one '' a queer sense of having no emotional perspective '' ; in contrast to other minds , minds of comparable achievement , lacking wholly '' a background of overflowing mental temptations . ''

		Apparently he sought a Held where '' remorseless explicit - ness , '' '' pedantic rectitude , '' the treating of the smallest thing by abstract law , a '' sleuth-hound scent for what he was after , '' `` untiring pertinac - ity , '' would all be merits , and by good fortune he found it .

		Despite
James	PERSON	's conclusion that the '' First Principles '' is '' almost a museum of blundering reason , '' the verdict maintains the quality of justice , and the picture of the great - ness finds no less convincing delineation than that of the smallness of the man .

		A like catholicity pervades
James	PERSON	's treatment of occasions .

		He spoke as naturally , as con - vincingly , in dedicating the ''
Shaw Memorial	ORGANIZATION	'' to valiant soldiers as in proclaiming the higher obligations of peace .

		He could characterize war as absurd and impossible from its own monstrosity , '' and as '' the final banquet of life 's fireworks . ''

		`` War is human nature at its uttermost .

		We are here to do our utter - most .

		It is a sacrament .

		Society would rot without the mystical blood payment . ''

		But the balance of judgment is definite , and the direc - tion of effort pragmatic .

		Demonstrate more largely , more prudently , more reasonably , the equal bigness of peace .

		Whether the '' moral equivalent for war '' proposed by James the enlistment of young men in the war against nature proves itself practicable or not , the advocacy of war can no longer ignore the chal - lenge of its inevitability .

		Hut
James	PERSON	was not a publicist , though interested in large causes pre - senting issues of principle .

		He was a philoso - pher .

		As Professor
Royce	PERSON	observes , it is the business of a philosopher to know us better than we know ourselves ; and he was able to bring that knowledge of us bat ' k to us , profitably and acceptably .

		As .

		lames says of
Davidson	PERSON	, so it may be said of him , that he taught , but never lectured .

		James the humanist and .

		James the philoso - pher are of a nature all compact .

		To him in life and in philosophy the individual was the affair of moment ; life was manifold and criss - cross ; problems were of like texture and were made simple only by divesting them of their vital fringes .

		Organization was a device , an in - strument ; the value lay in the organism and its expression .

		What society may do for life , the philosophic ordering of thought may accomplish for the mental striving . ''

		Surely the individ - ual , the person in the singular number , is the more fundamental phenomenon , and the social institution , of whatever grade , is but secondary and ministerial . ''

		Likewise , abstractions , the logical reconstruction of the universe in the interests of intelligibility , are '' secondary and ministerial . ''

		And such ministry harks back to human needs as alike a source and issue .

		Philosophy has '' sought by hard reasoning for results emotionally valuable . ''

		The humanist persists in the philosopher .

		Edited for the
Concordance Society	ORGANIZATION	by
Lane Cooper	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Ihitton A Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 present volume owes its publication in part to the generosity of the mother and brothers of the editor .

		Can not some patron of learning be found who will at one stroke make it possible to round out our collection with concordances , let us say , to
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Bacon	LOCATION	,
Jonson	PERSON	,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	?

		This latest addition is an ample quarto of
1136	DATE	double-column pages , a hundred lines to the column , comprising about 211,000 quotations .

		It is pleasingly printed , and very similar in gen - eral appearance to the
Bartlett Concordance	ORGANIZATION	to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		It differs somewhat from the lib - eral plan of the latter in quoting , not rhetoric - ally complete clauses , but simply the line of verse in which each word occurs .

		The result is some - times unsatisfactory ; but when one considers the initial ease of mechanically excerpting such lines for the printer , making transcription unnec - essary , and the very great difficulty of abridging
Wordsworth	PERSON	's involved periods , the plan will probably be approved .

		Moreover , reference to the poems themselves is much facilitated by giv - ing not only the title and line-number of each , but also the page-number of the
Oxford Words	ORGANIZATION	- worth , the basic text .

		All unlisted and partly listed words are entered in their places , duly labelled .

		One is pleased to note , too , a sign of scholarly thoroughness in the presence of cross - references , as from stone to corner-stone , mile - stone ^ etc. .

		The absence of these is a serious de - fect in the
Bartlett Shakespeare Concordance	ORGANIZATION	, where , for example , one gets no clue from knot - ted to curiously - knotted , nor ivova flouting to vlouting-stoff .

		Unfortunately there is a defect of another kind in
Bartlett	LOCATION	that reappears here .

		Homographs are seldom separated .

		The rose that is merely a preterit of rise , and the rose that by no other name may smell as sweet , are almost inextricably intertwined quite so when the line of verse does not positively tell which rose it is .

		One must scan scores of quotations to discover whether the poet has ever used keep as a noun or brook as a verb .

		Uncertainty is added to vexation when sacred Art is found elbowed at intervals by a little copulative verb and the whole labelled `` partial list . ''

		The edi - tor pleads that his function is not a lexical one .

		But to have made these obvious distinctions in a few homographs of frequent occurrence , as
Reid	PERSON	did in his concordance to
Burns	LOCATION	, would have been no trespass upon lexicography .

		In some instances there appears to have been an undue concern for completeness .

		Is anything gained by citing , from such a poem as '' The Idiot Boy , '' every line containing the frequently recurring names of
Susan Gale	PERSON	and
Betty Foy	PERSON	?

		The monotonous iteration of the name of
Peter Bell	PERSON	occupies fully a column , much to the dis - paragement of both
Peter	PERSON	the saint and
Adam Bell	PERSON	the archer .

		The first personal pronoun being made an exception to the general omission of pronouns , / , with a '' partial list , '' occupies six pages -LRB- 1200 quotations -RRB- , while me , my , and mine take six more .

		The reason assigned for the inclusion is that these pronouns `` are of un - usual interest in a subjective poet . ''

		On the contrary , these inevitable pronouns are in them - selves of no interest in a subjective poet of no more interest than the name of
Peter Bell	PERSON	in the poem of ''
Peter Bell	PERSON	'' though in an es - sentially narrative or dramatic poet they might nave great interest .

		But this is not a vital mat - ter .

		Apart from the treatment of homographs , it is impossible to find serious fault with the vol - ume , and Professor
Cooper	PERSON	and his collaborators deserve the warmest praise .

		Such a compilation naturally invites calcula - tions and comparisons .

		A rough estimate of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's poetical vocabulary , omitting proper names and inflectional forms , shows it to comprise upwards of 10,000 words .

		The fol - lowing comparative table , of root-words only , may be instructive .

Wordsworth	PERSON	can not approach it .

		If we take
Wordsworth	PERSON	's words in the order of their fre - quency , we find love leading with some 1200 in - stances ; but the word chances to be both noun 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, and verb , and the plan of the concordance does not enable us to separate the two functions .

		See and sight together yield 1400 : think and thought 1000 .

		Of substantives , heart stands first , with about 1150 occurrences ; man -LRB- with men -RRB- gives about
1100	DATE	; day , 900 ; life , 700 ; eye , 700 -LRB- there is but one none , and that belongs to a hound -RRB- ; heaven , 650 ; nature , 600 .

		All of which , perhaps , is sufficiently obvious .

		A poet , like other men , is most indebted to his eyes , and still more than other men speaks from and to the heart .

		And the most superficial acquaintance with
Wordsworth	PERSON	suffices to show that intense delight in all that meets the eye , sympathy with nature , and love in the heart of man , are the axes upon which his poetry revolves .

		It is not easy to classify natural objects in the order of his interest , but the earth appears to come first , with its hills and valleys ; next , the sky , with its varying phenomena ; while flowers , trees , and birds follow .

		Perhaps this placing before animate nature that which is ordinarily regarded as inanimate is not without significance .

		In particular ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	's eye for the larger features of landscape is well attested by some of the finest passages in `` The Prelude '' and '' The Excursion . ''

		Herein he differs considerably from
Keats	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, who took delight in detail and are rich in '' botanical circumstance . ''

		Tennyson 's flora contains 220 names from the plant-world -LRB-
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has 150 -RRB- .

		Words - worth can not have more than half this number .

		For example , while both have barley , bay , beech , etc. ,
Tennyson	PERSON	alone has bamboo , bean , black - thorn , bluebell , bluebottle , bracken , briony , bulrush , burdock .

		The only plant found in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	from a to d which is not in
Tenny	LOCATION	- son is the buttercup .

		He has no anemone , no clematis , no mistletoe ; even the daffodil , so memorably associated with his name , occurs but three times -LRB- in two poems -RRB- , as against seven times in the later poet .

		There are no rose-leaves , no unnietaphorical rose-buds , and but a single glimpse of petals .

		For gleanings of this sort , his sister
Dorothy	PERSON	's journal affords a much richer field .

		Books , we know , held but a secondary place in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	's scheme of human education .

		Yet he read much , and it would be difficult to find a more generous tribute to the '' consecrated works of
Bard	ORGANIZATION	and Sage '' than the benediction pronounced upon them in the fifth book of `` The Prelude . ''

		Enshrined in his poems are the names of Homer ,
Plato	ORGANIZATION	,
Horace	PERSON	,
Virgil	PERSON	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	,
Tasso	LOCATION	,
Camoens	LOCATION	, and
Cervantes	PERSON	.

		Ex - -LRB- * pt
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, there seems to be no French or Ger - man name .

		He was familiar with the doctrines of
Rousseau	PERSON	, but much further from agreeing with them than might be supposed ; with
Goethe	PERSON	he was quite out of sympathy .

		He had early come to the conviction that he should keep the four major English poets continually before him as examples , and we find them all mentioned , with a frequency in the inverse order of their time Milton fifteen , Shakespeare ten , Spenser six ,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	four times .

		Hums , whom he placed second to Chaucer in '' the natural and sensual school , '' is found five times .

		Pope is not iiim - tioned , though Gray ,
Goldsmith	PERSON	, and
Chatterton	PERSON	are .

		His own name occurs twice , and
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's three times , but the latter was very often ad - dressed simply as '' Friend . ''

		Scott ,
Southey	LOCATION	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, and
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	are also named .

		Byron , who ridiculed him ,
Shelley	PERSON	, who burlesqued his poetry and reproached him for his social apostasy , and
Keats	PERSON	, who paid him a youthful but sincere tri - bute , are passed over in silence .

		Naturally , the vocabulary of one who held a pronounced theory of poetic diction is invested with exceptional interest .

		We have come now to a better understanding of that theory than when we accepted
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's too narrow view of it .

		We know that when
Wordsworth	PERSON	con - tended for `` language really used by men '' he was only revolting from poetic artificiality , and had no intention of descending always to the level of rustic speech .

		That might be done , or it might not be done ; only let the language re - main the natural expression of the thought be - hind it .

		This view is fully borne out by the concordance .

		From merely glancing through it , one gains the general impression that , for the particular -LRB- undramatic -RRB- range of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's verse , his vocabulary is extremely apt natural .

		rational , broadly eclectic , and satisfying .

		Ex - clusive of specialized activities , and of some of the more comic or vulgar aspects of life , he covered pretty much the whole human field .

		We are too prone to think of him as exclusively the poet of his rustic environment .

		His youth was rich in human experience ; and never , even in his retirement , did he cease to survey man - kind from
China	LOCATION	to
Peru	LOCATION	, or to draw into his world of nature the world of books and men .

		On the same pages that glow with hosts of clouds or of golden daffodils , are echoes of the tramp - ling hosts of the French Revolution .

		Empires and republics , lawyers and judges , arguments and appeals , churches , theatres , factories , mer - chants , mountebanks , `` chattering monkeys dangling from their poles , and children whirling in their roundabouts , '' enter with freedom into
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 the verse .

		And each of these things is unob - trusively designated by its rightful name .

		The language never descends quite as low as
Burns	PERSON	's , nor rises quite as high as
Shelley	LOCATION	's ; but it ap - proaches both , and its range is greater than that of either .

		We may look in vain for ''
Auld Clootie	PERSON	'' and the '' whisky gills '' and '' swag - gering blades '' that belonged to what
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	characterized as the '' sordid world of Scotch drink , Scotch religion , and Scotch man - ners . ''

		But , what witn horn tobacco-boxes , and flannels , and cloaks of duffle grey , we are intro - duced into a world as humble , if not as coarse .

		Indeed , we narrowly escape the coarseness . ''

		But I will bang your bones ! ''

		says
Peter Bell	PERSON	to the Ass , in the first edition of that poem -LRB- compare Burns : '' An ' I shall bang your hide , guidman '' -RRB- ; but the phrase was , however re - luctantly , excised , and this concordance is inno - cent of it , as it is likewise innocent of that ghastly punch-sipping , tea-sipping '' party in a parlour , Crammed just as they on earth were crammed . ''

		On the other hand , the full radi - ance and resonance of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's vocabulary are beyond
Wordsworth	PERSON	's reach .

		This should go without saying : shepherded , legioned , hyaline , enanguished , rose-ensanguined , star-inwoven , whirlwind-peopled , lightning-braided , these are native to but one poet in the language .

		But though this diction was not native to Words - worth 's genius , and though he would never have deliberately sought for intrinsically '' poetic '' words , as
Rossetti	PERSON	for instance is known to have done , he was manifestly neither insen - sible nor hostile to them .

		He would not go out of his way for such words as argent , aureate , damask , madrigal , nectar , and , as a matter of fact , he has none of these ; yet he has words of the same class orient , aerial , diadem , amaranthine , sylvan together with now and then such arresting vocables as diaphanous , prelibations , lacrymals , barricadoed .

		The presence of these , in however small numbers , proves the point for his eclectic vocabulary , and confirms , moreover , his statement that he had from a very early age found words '' sweet for their own sakes , a passion , and a power . ''

		It is true , the eighteenth century diction still lingered with him , contributing some stiffness to the general texture .

		The century itself he quite left behind , and one who desires an object - lesson need but place the concordances to Pope and
Wordsworth	PERSON	side by side .

		Pope 's two col - umns of '' wit '' shrink to only a fifth of a column in the four times more bulky volume , while his single '' cottage '' is multiplied by a hundred .

		Critics , courtiers , and Cupids almost disappear .

		Doris and
Chloe	PERSON	give way to
Mary	PERSON	and
Lucy	PERSON	.

		Sympathy finds a place among human affections , and tranquillity among human blessings .

		At the same time , old traces persist , and not alto - gether in the early poems .

		We still hear much of Fancy , and more of Poesy than poetry .

		The air is still sometimes the aether , and the ocean the brine .

		There are occasional ambient streams and glassy floods , scaly tribes and feathered kinds , and the sportsman 's gun has only partly displaced the thundering tube .

		Yet in the main this element is negligible , or abundantly com - pensated for by such happier reminiscences as Spenser 's '' budded brooms '' and

		More often still ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	is entirely true to himself ; and when the spirit at its divinest descends upon him , he is unexcelled by any poet in his power to blend words , thought , and imagery into one perfect music : '' A thought is with me sometimes , and I say , Should the whole frame of earth by inward throes Be wrenched , or fire come down from far to scorch Her pleasant habitations , and dry up Old Ocean , in his bed left singed and bare , Yet would the living Presence still subsist Victorious , and composure would ensue , And kindlings like the morning presage sure Of day returning and of life revived . ''

		The quotation brings with it a kind of rebuke for the triviality of the divagations into which we have been led a rebuke that seems to go back to the concordance itself , prompting the old question ,
Cui	PERSON	bono ?

		Was it really worth the labor to tear asunder this living tissue , and reassemble , in alphabetical unreason , the dead re - mains ?

		`` A subterraneous magazine of bones '' !

		With what emotions would
Wordsworth	PERSON	himself have contemplated these disjecta membra of what is perhaps the most indissolubly organic body of verse the language possesses ?

		We can not answer .

		But there is reassurance in the thought that the very organic quality of his work gives the concordance one of its best excuses for being .

		Now , thanks to the unselfish zeal of the compilers , we shall be able to read more clearly than heretofore the message which that great and `` dedicated Spirit '' labored so unremittingly to leave .

Jan. 1	DATE	, I HE AUTHOR OF `` CUAM . ''

		A little more than a year ago occurred the centenary of the author of ''
Cranford	LOCATION	'' for it is inevitable that as the author of '' Cranford ''
Elizabeth Gaskell	PERSON	will be remembered , notwith - standing her other substantial contributions to literature in the way of novels , tales , and biog - raphy .

		A handsome volume , richly illustrated and cleverly planned , comes to us now as one of the after-fruits of the anniversary .

		No formal biography of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	has ever been pro- duced ; and although one or two biographies have been promised , it is hardly probable that such a work will soon appear .

		It was Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's earnest wish that her life should not be written or her letters published ; and her daughters , who were her literary executors , have sacredly regarded their mother 's wish .

		But Mrs.
Chadwick	PERSON	, the author of this very interesting book , has utilized material unconsciously sup - plied by the novelist herself .

		Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	, it seems , made constant use of facts that , at one time or another , had occurred in her own experience , and in portraying the characters that figure in her stories she drew frequently from real personalities around her .

		Many of her relatives were more or less eccen - tric , or , as we say , 4 * original , '' and the novelist , who was a keen observer of persons , delight - ing in the discovery of idiosyncracies and amusing twists of temperament , reflected these quite innocently in her narratives .

		She was , in fact , usually surprised when the similitude was pointed out . ''

		My mother never meant to put real people into her stories , '' writes one of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's daughters , '' but even her children would some - times recognize the characters and say , ' Oh !

		So-and-so is just like Mr.
Blank	PERSON	/ and she would reply , * So he is , but I never meant it for him . ''

		This tendency to reproduce actual facts and real personalities in her novels , and also the habit of describing under fictitious names the places with which she was associated , make her narra - tives an interesting field of study in the search for further knowledge concerning their author ; and this field has been carefully gleaned by Mrs.
Chadwick	PERSON	.

		Thus , we are told that in '' Cousin ' Phillis '' we have the love-story of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's parents ; the heroine , in essential features , por - traying the mother whom she knew only by an - .

		THE DIAL 19 warmed by the genial glow of those early years , as he has found it reflected in the graceful sketches of ''
Cranford	LOCATION	. '' ''

		My dear adopted native town , '' she calls it many years later ; and it was that indeed to
Elizabeth Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Her mother was born on a near-by farm , and this mother 's sister , kindly Mrs.
Lumb	PERSON	, now became the only mother that
Elizabeth	PERSON	ever knew .

		In six of her stories , Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	introduces
Knutsford	PERSON	as the scene of the narrative disguising , of course , the name .

		It is , however , the classic ''
Cranford	LOCATION	'' that con - stitutes the epic of this famous little town .

		Here we feel the atmosphere of peaceful , leisurely quiet that brooded over this typical English village a hundred years ago ; here we meet the simple - minded characters that composed its society , absorbed in their small round of commonplace events : their formal calls , their card-parties , and their teas a round of trivialities amid which the announcement of an engagement is as start - ling as the explosion of a bomb . '' '

		Marry ! '

		said
Miss Matty	ORGANIZATION	once again . '

		Well !

		I never thought of it .

		Two people that we know going to be married .

		It 's coming very near . ' '

		Here too we see them bravely practicing their '' ele - gaut economies '' ; very strict in their reverence for etiquette , innocently greedy of gossip , and withal thoroughly human in their joys and griefs .

		In 1832
Elizabeth Stevenson	PERSON	was married to the Rev.
William Gaskell	PERSON	, a young Unitarian minister in
Manchester	LOCATION	, the neighboring city
Drumble	PERSON	, as it is called in ''
Cranford	LOCATION	. ''

		The marriage was solemnized in Knutsford Church ; and the dwellers in the town united to make this a gala occasion .

		The married life of the Gas - kells was ideally happy .

		The husband 's tastes were those of his wife ; deeply interested in her literary success , he stimulated and encouraged her every effort .

		It was , however , a very busy life on which the young bride entered , and it was ten years or more before her career as a writer began .

		Both husband and wife were sincerely interested in the welfare of the people about them .

		Quick and tender in her sympathies , Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	at once assumed her share of the obligations that fall to the lot of a devoted minister and his wife .

		She organized a sewing class among the working girls who met every
Saturday	DATE	evening in the minister 's house .

		When they were ill she visited and nursed them ; more than once she received such patients into her own home that they might have proper food and care .

		With gentle man - ner and kindly tact she constantly tried to lead them into ways of improvement morally and mentally .

		The first novel , ''
Mary Barton	PERSON	, '' grew out of the life that surrounded the Gaskells .

		It was a realistic study of the industrial situation in
Manchester	LOCATION	, and portrayed the condition of the operatives in the mills during that disastrous pe - riod known in
England	LOCATION	as `` the hungry forties . ''

		The story brought a plea for patience with the poor .

		This novel provoked not a little criticism , but the power of the narrative was quickly recognized and praised by many readers , among whom were
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	and
Charles Dick	PERSON	- ens. In
1850	DATE	Dickens invited the author of ''
Mary Barton	PERSON	* ' to become a contributor to the magazine `` Household Words , '' which he was then projecting ; and to the first number of that publication Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	contributed the short story ``
Lizzie Leigh	PERSON	. ''

		The first instalment of ''
Cranford	LOCATION	'' appeared in the same magazine in
December , 1851	DATE	.

		This work was not planned as a novel , and owed its continuance to the pop - ularity of the opening sketch .

		In this manner the successive sketches appeared under titles like '' Our Society at
Cranford	LOCATION	, '' '' A Love Af - fair at
Cranford	LOCATION	, '' '' The Great Panic at
Cran	PERSON	- ford , '' etc. .

		This fact explains the rather loose connection of the narratives and the lack of or - ganic structure that is demanded in a novel ; but the peculiarity in composition has taken nothing from the charm of the work .

		Who ever read ''
Cranford	LOCATION	'' without delight ?

		and who that reads at all has not read this little masterpiece of humor and pathos ?

		The earlier writings of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	, with the exception of `` Cranford , '' deal mainly with the simple and often tragic annals of the poor .

		The moral trials of her lowly characters , accentuated and intensified by the severe conditions of their life , stirred her heart profoundly .

		There is of necessity a large measure of sadness and shadow in these tales .

		In her later stories , notably in '' Cousin Phillis '' and `` Wives and Daughters , '' the novelist enters a sunnier field of fiction ; the atmosphere is bright and cheerful .

		Overshad - owed by the genius of more famous novelists , the talents and achievements of the author of '' Cranford '' have possibly been underestimated in the past ; but the interest shown in the recent anniversary of her birth , and the appearance of the notable volume here reviewed , are evidence of
Elizabeth Gaskell	PERSON	's enduring hold upon the affection of readers of to-day .

		In one town of about thirty thousand t-iti/eus during the lifetime of a man and his father these things occurred : A world-conquering power was shattered forever , a naval empire was built up , the drama was developed to full stature , sculpture grew from crude infancy to a height it has never yet surpassed , painting became a fine art , architecture rose from clumsiness to the limit of its possibilities in one direction , history was consum - mated as a scientific art , the most influential of philoso - phies was begotten .

		If the true test of a

Athens	LOCATION	, with her little citi - zenship of a score and a half of thousands , was a far more significant factor in human progress than any capital of modern times .

		Before con - cluding that the importance of Hellenic culture has been exaggerated , the practically educated -LRB- or uneducated -RRB- metropolitan boaster should stop and count up the men of his own city 's his - tory who are likely to be remembered for twenty - five hundred years ; or he should take some pains to ascertain what would be left of the fabric of modern civilization if the Greek strands were drawn out of it .

		Mr.
Stobart	PERSON	's work may be further described as one of the products of mitigated specialization for which the world has of late been crying out .

		It has its faults , to be sure , but they are neither numerous nor serious .

		The reader should not be left with the impression that the second stra - tum of the
Schliemann	PERSON	excavation was the Troy of Homer ; someone blundered by inserting a second picture of the Theseum in the place of the fine old temple at
Psestum	LOCATION	, which we should enjoy much more ; the binding of the volume is hardly dignified enough to be in keeping with the contents ; and the author is almost too fond of emphasizing his disagreements with other scholars .

		But these matters are hardly worth mention .

		The reader will enjoy Mr.
Stobart	PERSON	' > independence and his flashes of vivacity , and will admire him for his gift of judgment in the ex - clusion of irrelevant matter , and for his sympa - thetic setting forth of what is really significant .

		He makes no pretense of recording all the facts , nor indeed of knowing them all , though every page indicates easy command of the subject .

		His work is not of the sort which the
Gentle Reader	ORGANIZATION	describes , in which `` There are exhaustive argu - ments now on the one side and now on the other , which exactly balance one another .

		There are references to bulky volumes , where at the foot of every page the notes run along , like little angry dogs barking at the text . ''

		His purpose is to make his presentation popular in the best sense by reciting the essential facts regarding Hellenic culture and helping the reader to form an opinion , and he has succeeded admirably , so far as success is possible with a subject which is by nature intellectually aristocratic .

		In one respect , not all of the lovers of Hel - lenism will agree with Mr.

		We are , in fact , living on the legacy of

		No doubt we shall not soon lose the taste of Greek culture , and no doubt we shall do fairly well without first - hand contact with it in our educational system ; but the real question is not whether we are to do fairly well , but whether we are to do our best .

		THE IjIFE-STORY OF A COTTOX-MLLL , OPERATIVE .

		* Mr.
Priddy	PERSON	's `` Life of a Mill-Boy '' is a vivid story of personal experience in cotton mills , amid industrial and domestic conditions which tend to destroy vitality of body , mind , and soul .

		Much has been written during the last quarter-century regarding mill operatives , from the point of view of the legislator , the researcher in economics , and the social worker .

		Here is a narrative of actual life , bald and frank in its realism , drama - tic in its action , and forceful in appeal to the reader 's imagination and sympathy .

		It is a sad life-story of a youth , doomed from boyhood for seven years to endure the physical strain , the mental atrophy , and the moral deterioration which impure air , and hard , vulgar environment , would produce in a boy of delicate and sensitive nature .

		The book is not alone a picture of industrial evils , which were more widespread a decade ago than they are to-day under improved legislation and inspection , but it is also a contribution to the literature of adolescence .

		It might be used as a treatise on child - welfare , or as a tract upon the results of alcoholism .

		With intimate details , the author has unfolded his life from ten to twenty years , from his departure from
Hadfield	PERSON	in

		There are pic - torial scenes , the memory of his last Christmas eve in
England	LOCATION	, with carol-singing and festivity without and gloom and hunger within ; the first day in
America	LOCATION	, with its alternate hopes and disappointments ; the revels and brawls of '' the gang , '' led by `` Peter One Leg-and-a-Half '' ; the fleeting yet recurrent ambitions to improve his mind and shake off the thralldom of the machine .

		The fearful strain of ten and a half hours daily in the mill upon the boy who was only thirteen years of age , but had been admitted to work through his uncle 's perjury , is revealed in direct statement : '' I gulped in the fresh air when out of the mill , and walked with my chest thrown out , a stiff , self-conscious , growing lad , fighting ever against the impending tragedy of a deformed body . ''

		Again , at sixteen , after three years in a mill-room , he reached a climax of de - spair : '' My body had been beaten into a terrify - ing weakness and lassitude by the rigors of the mill .

		My aesthetic sense of things had been rudely , violently assaulted by profanity , immor - ality , and vile indecencies .

		I had come to that fatalistic belief , which animates so many in the mill , that the social bars are set up , and are set up forever .

		I should always have to be in the mill . ''

		Gradually , through the influences of evening schools , second-hand books bought at
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	salvage rooms , and acquaint - ance with two educated foremen , his dormant manhood and ambitions were stirred to activity and emancipation .

		One of the most interesting and dispassionate chapters is that which relates to the strike of forty thousand employees in
New Bedford	LOCATION	, a struggle for four months which ended in de - feat for the strikers .

		Although allied with the strikers at the time , the author says : '' The con - duct of the strike , as I looked on it from behind the scenes , was simply a political enterprise .

		Our leader kept urging us to resist .

		He himself was not working in the mill but was getting his money from our dues .

		Several of our meetings were no more than drinking bouts .

		The strike man - ager , who conducted our part in it , elected his closest friends to important offices which offered good remuneration . ''

		In the background of this Autobiography is another romantic tragedy , grim and sad , a picture of the curse which falls upon a home where the demon of inebriety is allowed to enter and abide .

		The struggles of
Uncle Stanwood	LOCATION	, whose manhood had become weak and flaccid through drink ; and his pathetic efforts to reform and to remove temptation from his dissipated 22 THE DIAL -LSB-

		* There has been of recent years a noticeable decline in the vitality of Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's fiction .

		Her themes have seemed to become more forced and artificial , and her workmanship to become dulled .

		While her conscientiousness has compelled admira - tion , and the intellectual quality of her work has been maintained upon a high plane of excellence , we have somehow lost the sense of eager anticipation with which we awaited a new book from her pen a score of years ago .

		`` The Case of

		It is , frankly , nothing more than a revised version of

		The contrast between the two , in the matter of outcome , is striking .


Robert Elsmere	PERSON	was too far in advance of his time to hope for anything but failure , and the dead weight of tradition was too heavy for him to move .

		But
Richard	PERSON	MeynelTs outlook , twenty years later , is very different .

		The leaven of liberalism has been working all the while , quietly but effectively , and the time is ripe for a spiritual revolution .

		The modernist move - ment of which he becomes the leader has gathered such momentum that buoyancy rather than despair is the keynote of his activities , and he is fully per - suaded that the stars in their courses are on the side of his cause .

		parish enlists under the new banner of spiritual freedom the final triumph of modernism becomes more and more certain .

		Meynell and 1m fellow - protestants may upon technical grounds be dispos - MMed of their livings , but their ideas are marching irresistibly onward toward the goal of a church that shall embody the spiritual life of the whole nation .

		These men no longer plead for toleration : they boldly demand their rights as representatives of the new religious conscience .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	is not , we think , unfair in her presentation of the reactionary side of the argument .

		The figure of the Bishop is no less sympathetically presented than that of the clergyman who opposes him , and equally compels our adiuintt ion for his steadfastness and devotion .

		But it is clem that the type of ecclesiasticism for which he .

		stands has well-nigh had its day .

		It must not be supposed that Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's novel is wholly one of religious controversy , although this provides its central motive .

		There is much interest of the more human and even dramatic sort , provided in part by
Meynell	PERSON	's love for the daughter of
Robert Elsmere	LOCATION	, and by the network of suspicion and calumny that entangles him when he maintains his pledge of secrecy to a friend long since dead .

		To reveal that secret would bring shame upon a woman whose subsequent conduct has more than atoned for a youthful lapse , and brand with illegitimacy a girl whose high-strung nature could not survive such a blow .

		So
Meynell	PERSON	suffers the evil-minded to think of him as the sinner , and to forge of the calumny a weapon for use against him in the religious crusade .

		Of course , the truth come * out , as it usually does , clearing
Meynell	PERSON	's character , but with tragic consequences for the girl .

		The whole complication is rather difficult to follow , because it takes for granted a somewhat more vivid recollection of certain earlier novels than most readers are likely to have preserved .

		We close the book with a feeling that the author has cast her old spell upon us , and with a sense of vigorous intellectual and spiritual exercise that few others have a comparable power to impart .

		Mrs.
Harrison	PERSON	-LRB- `` Lucas Malet '' -RRB- is a serious artist , and her work is entitled to the highest respect .

		With her , character is always the main considera - tion in which respect she is more French than English in method and such things as plot , inci - dent , and situation are only of value as they help u - to understand motive and temperament .

		Hence the mere story of '

		Adrian is an Englishman turned French , a graceful figure in Parisian intellectual society , and the editor of a review .

		He loves an elusive French lady with restrained passion and in the mo-t deco - rous way imaginable .

		The duty is unwel - come , but he accepts it gracefully , and finds him - self spending some time in the English country place , which is to him the most depressing environ - ment imaginable .

		Of the two sisters , one is good - looking and stolid ; the other is distressingly plain but endowed with the intensity of nature that is usually the warrant of unhappiness .

		This young woman ,
Joanna	PERSON	by name , keeps a journal , and in its pages she reveals herself as never by word of mouth to any human being .

		And the tragedy of it all is that
Joanna	PERSON	, mistaking her cousin 's courtly bearing and polished manner for signs of a deep personal in - terest , persuades herself that she has become the ob - ject of his affections .

		When he realizes this dread - ful misunderstanding , he is naturally uncomfortable , although no act or thought has given him cause for self-reproach .

		And when the young woman , after confidently revealing to him her fatuous self-delusion , learns how utterly without foundation are all her hopes , there is nothing left for her but suicide .

		The situation is not agreeable to read about , but the power of its portrayal is insistent , and as a study in mor - bid introspection , the character of
Joanna	PERSON	must be recognized as a masterpiece .

		There is endless psychologizing in the book ; the people concerned all analyze themselves and each other , and the writer analyzes them again on her own account .

		This process makes them all surprisingly real , and there is much vivid incident to heighten the effect .

		The style , whether in description , illumination , self - revelation , or dialogue , has the mark of a distinc - tion which is anything but common in our latter-day fiction , and which makes `` Lucas Malet '' a writer always to be reckoned with .

		We can not quite place this work upon the plane of '' Sir
Richard Calmady	PERSON	, '' but it does not need to stand as high as that to be considered a remarkable novel .

		Mr. and Mrs. Castle , in '' The Composer , '' have taken a leaf from the Wagnerian legend , and en - deavored to create a super-musician whose genius holds the world in awe .

		His came is
Lothnar	LOCATION	, the temple of his worship is Frankheim , and he writes amazing music-dramas based upon the Greek myths .

		A young singer ,
Fraulein Sarolta	PERSON	, comes under his spell , and is chosen to interpret his heroines
Iphigenia	LOCATION	,
Phaedra	PERSON	, and the rest .

		He becomes the god of her idolatry , not only as genius but as man , and the fact that she is not contented to worship him as a genius alone is her undoing .

		The situa - tion is a little difficult to take in , for Lothnar is per - sonally anything but prepossessing , and the girl 's mad infatuation makes a heavy demand upon our credulity .

		By the time she realizes that he lives only for his art , and that he has played upon her emotions solely with the aim of making her a better singer , she has run the whole gamut of exaltation and agony , and is ready to accept the dog-like de - votion of the stolid young Englishman who has all the time been hovering in the background .

		Some - thing is broken within her , but the mechanism of life somehow keeps on running , and she must make the best of it .

		The Castles are particularly good at this sort of temperamental melodrama , and we may not deny that the present tale , although any - thing but convincing , successfully maintains its arti - ficial interest .

		When
George Bellew	PERSON	, American millionaire , crosses the
Atlantic	LOCATION	in his yacht in pursuit of a young woman , and then learns that she has bestowed her affections elsewhere , he thinks he is broken - hearted .

		Whereupon he slings a pack over his shoulders , and takes to the road in Kent .

		After sundry adventures by the wayside , he encounters a small boy , becomes chummy with him , and learns that he has set out in quest of a fortune to retrieve the distress of his Aunt
Anthea	PERSON	, whose farm is mort - gaged , and who can not make both ends meet .

		George persuades his new friend to take him to the farm , and discovers that it is
Arcadia	LOCATION	, in very fact , and that its mistress is a dream of loveliness .

		He persuades her to take him in as a boarder , and makes himself very much at home .

		Presently he saves the family furniture from going at auction , and puts a spoke in the wheel of the squire , who is taking a mean advantage of
Anthea	LOCATION	, profiting by her distress to force her into a loveless marriage .

		With the small boy as a fellow-conspirator , he arranges to have a buried fortune discovered on the grounds just in time to pay the mortgage that its skinflint holder is about to foreclose .

		It seems that this marvel is pos - sible only under certain conditions at the full of the moon , in other words , when there is '' a money moon . ''

		Hence this pretty tale by Mr.
Jeffery Farnol	PERSON	is called '' The Money
Moon	PERSON	, '' and is fairly drenched with romantic sentiment .

		The happy day does not go until the maiden yields , but it re - quires both strategy and masterful action to bring about this consummation .

		This is the merest trifle of a book in comparison with the author 's `` Broad Highway , '' and consequently disappoints us not a little , but it has enough grace and tender idyllic charm to make it measurably worth while .

		The romantic story of the Austrian archduke who separated himself from civilization some twenty years ago , his subsequent history and fate to re - main a mystery , has been taken by Mr.
Lloyd Osbourne	PERSON	for the groundwork of the tale which he entitles '' A Person of Some Importance . ''

		Last year , it will be remembered , the missing man was declared to be legally dead , and his estate settled .

		Mr.
Osbourne	PERSON	's invention -LRB- for which there is some shadow of historical support -RRB- represents the arch - duke as having concealed himself , in company with the lady for whom he thought the world well lost , upon a remote island in the
South Pacific	LOCATION	, and as having died there after his twenty years of self - imposed exile .

		The name ``
John Orth	PERSON	, '' which he is known to have taken , here becomes `` John Mort . ''

		The story is primarily concerned with one
Matthew Broughton	PERSON	, in training for the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, but dismissed in disgrace from the
Annapolis Academy	LOCATION	for participation in a hazing outrage .

		He ships before the mast , knocks about the seas for a 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, while , and finally comes upon ''
John Mort	PERSON	, '' 1 > \ whom he is made a sort of confidential agent After some years of this life , he wearies of it , and returns to his home in
New England	LOCATION	, pledged to the pro- foundest secrecy by his late royal employer .

		This is where the real story begins , for agents of the Aus - trian court get upon
Broughton	PERSON	's track , and seek to extort from him the secret which they are persuaded is in his possession .

		They resort in vain to cajolery , bribery , and personal violence .

		They thwart his every attempt to make a living , and when he elopes with the daughter of the local magnate , they track him to
California	LOCATION	, lure him on board a ship under their control , and carry him to the
South Pacific	LOCATION	.

		Here , it seems , an Austrian battle-ship , carrying no less
august	DATE	a passenger than the Emperor , is await - ing their arrival ; and here , moved by the Emperor 's own plea ,
Broughton	PERSON	discloses his well-kept secret .

		But when the mysterious island is reached it trans - pires that ''
John Mort	PERSON	'' has died a few weeks be - fore , and the hopes of his imperial father are crushed .

		Here is obviously the material for a good yarn , and as far as invention is concerned , the author has put it to fairly good use .

		But his style is so raw , and his characterization so wooden , that our chief feeling is one of disappointment that the theme has not fallen into hands capable of doing it more justice and of more fully realizing its romantic possibilities .

		The latest of Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	's ladies is called `` My Lady of Doubt , '' and it follows the pattern of its predecessors so closely that we always know what to expect .

		It offers a variant only in being a Revolutionary romance instead of a tale of the Civil War .

		Its scene is in and about
Philadel	LOCATION	- phia during the last weeks of the British occupation , and it culminates in the battle of
Monmouth	LOCATION	.

		The hero is a
Continental	ORGANIZATION	spy who has many hairbreadth escapes , and the heroine is a young woman who alternately aids and thwarts him a procedure which keeps him guessing , and accounts for the phrase by which she is styled .

		No wonder the girl is perplexed , for her father is in one camp and her brother in the other , while she is desperately wooed both by the
Continental	ORGANIZATION	hero and the royalist offi - cer who has been her lover from childhood .

		The latter , however , turns out to be so black a villain that we waste no sympathy over his discomfiture .

		Sev - eral famous historical figures flit across the pages from time to time .

		Another tale of rural
Georgia	LOCATION	, with most of the familiar features of shrewd portraiture and homely observation that are found in Mr.
Harben	PERSON	's earlier books , is now offered us in ''
Jane Dawson	PERSON	. ''

		Jane is a hard old woman who has been betrayed in her youth and made an outcast .

		To add to her offend - ing , she has become a '' free thinker , '' and her son has taken the same course .

		The latter is a man of strong character and clear intelligence , in striking contrast to the simple-minded and zealous preacher with whom he is at odds .

		There is a young woman who can not easily choose between the two men , both of whom love her ; at last , however , she learns to know her own heart , and ^ iv - lin-elf to tin - one who ban found .

		shelu-r out > ide the orthodox fold .

		There is a great deal of theological di > cu.s.sioii in the course of the story , which makes it rather tire - some , because the issues concerned are such as no longer exist for thinking people , however much they may still affect the ru.-tic mind .

		The figure of
Jane	PERSON	is drawn with a good deal of grim power and en - dowed with at least a spark of vitality .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		T .

		he political control of the
Philip	LOCATION	- izon in the pine Islands by the
United States	LOCATION	has Fartheit Eatt .

		brought the Farthest East somewhat nearer us , and has given a wide basis of interest in the Malay peoples , and in the industrial , economic , sanitary , political , educational , and religious prob - lems that arise in connection with the control of nature in the tropics , the development of the rich resources of equatorial lands , the exploitation of sub - ject peoples , and the preservation and growth of an indigenous civilization .

		No nation has had a wider experience in this field than
Holland	LOCATION	, whose immense possessions in the
East Indies	LOCATION	have been an unfailing source of wealth to the ruling power for centuries .

		Dutch colonies the
East Indies	LOCATION	have never really become , for the ruling race has never peopled these dependencies further than to provide temporary staffs for political control , commercial exploitation .

		or scientific exploration .

		During these centuries of Dutch conquest -LRB- still in bloody progress in
Acheen	LOCATION	-RRB- , and of occupation , the relations of the ruling and subject peoples have passed through an evolution in which the ethical standards of the Dutch nation have steadily displaced the lower ones established by commercial greed .

		Policies of extermination of resisting tribes and ruthless suppression of rivals in trade , which characterized the period of the control by trading companies , gave way to forced labor and extortionate taxation by agents of the government , and this in turn to a more intelligent policy of agri - cultural and industrial development of native people - and to the initial steps in a system of education .

		M. Cabaton holds no brief for the Malay in his ``
Java	LOCATION	,
Sumatra	LOCATION	, and the Other Islands of the Dutch East Indies '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , but his ably written volume gives a clear insight into the nature of the exceed - ingly complex and difficult problem which confronts
the Netherlands	LOCATION	of to-day , as it faces the increas - ingly insistent demands of the subject peoples for wider educational opportunities and greater indus - trial and commercial freedom .


Java	LOCATION	, as well as the
United States	LOCATION	, has its Oriental problem .

		The recent influx of Japanese , following the Russo-Japanese war , with their demand for and freely granted equal - ity with Europeans , has stimulated the Chinese of the Malay ports , who are a large element in inter - native commercial life , to obtain Japanese citizenship in

		THE DIAL 25 for enlarged opportunities .

		When the
New China	LOCATION	knocks at the doors of
Malaysia	LOCATION	, a new readjustment of political and commercial relations in the
Far East	LOCATION	impends .

		An introduction to the work , by the trans - lator , Mr.
Bernard Miall	PERSON	, affords a suitable historical background for the reader .

		The book is well illus - trated , and gives a detailed , methodical , comprehen - sive and exceptionally complete account of the history , government , resources , industries , commerce , cus - toms , religions of the Dutch East Indies , as well as a candid and illuminating statement of the complex and pressing problems resulting from contact of the Occident and Orient in the land of spices .

		In `` Bypaths in Dixie '' -LRB-
Dutton	LOCATION	-RRB- Mrs.
Sarah J	PERSON	-
Cocke	PERSON	has s iven us .

		a .

		series of negro fables as entertaining as the classic tales of
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	.

		Not only does Mist ' r Race
Hoss	PERSON	run for the office of king of beasts against
Jack Donkey	PERSON	who covers himself head and ears to hide his asinine unfitness for that exalted office and yet is betrayed by his voice and not only does Mis ' Race
Hoss	PERSON	give a party for her husband 's benefit , where Sis ' Sow and her children display their gluttonous propensities ; but also Ned Dog and
Billy Goat	PERSON	fill one story , conducting them - selves in quite human fashion , and even Shoo Fly and
Hoss	PERSON	Fly enact a drama of their own , which fly-paper and screen windows and modern sanitation all but bring to a tragic close .

		Indeed , we are taken out into the woods , and learn the life-history of Mist ' r Bad ` Simmon Tree , and of
Big Eye Buzzard	ORGANIZATION	, who aspired to be accepted in the society of the royal eagles and made love to
Tishy Peafowel	ORGANIZATION	till that charming young lady 's father exposed the false gal - lant 's unspeakable leaning to certain improper foods .

		Even Mist ' r
Rattlesnake	ORGANIZATION	plays a part quite scriptural and instructive , and Mist ' r Grab-all Spider is all by himself a monopoly in restraint of trade .

		The stories are delightfully fresh , and , in spite of inevit - able similarities , are really unlike the negro fables best known .

		Indeed , they suggest the query whether Mrs.
Cocke	PERSON	is the inventor , or only the narrator with literary privileges of the deeds ascribed by
Phyllis	PERSON	to the animals .

		This , however , brings us to another phase of the book : it is not simply a volume of fables .

		The whole composition takes higher rank in literature than a mere collection of stories , by reason of its artistic unity .

		This unity is achieved through the personality of
Phyllis	PERSON	, the negro mammy who tells the instructive tales , and of the little boy
Willis	PERSON	, her charge and her audience , supplemented at times by his neighbor , little Ma ' y Van .

		As the tales follow one after another , the face , figure , tones , and gestures of
Phyllis	PERSON	become vivid and familiar to us , and the two little auditors grow more and more lifelike , till we have a Southern nursery complete .

		Even the father and mother , though they discreetly refrain from breaking the compact unity of the nursery life by actual appear - ance on the scene , do now and then pass the door , as it were , and cast on the floor characteristic shadows of themselves .

		Phyllis 's freedom from interference makes her self-revelation the more unconstrained , and Mrs.
Cocke	PERSON	has succeeded in conveying com - pletely into her book the wise , wily , humorous , and inventive mammy .

		She stands apart from the purely comic negro and the sentimental negro of much dialect fiction , and represents wholesome realism in that branch of Southern literature .

		So excellent is Mrs.
Cocke	PERSON	's depicting of the character that one feels bold to predict for
Phyllis	PERSON	a niche beside Uncle Remus .


Willis	PERSON	and Ma ' y Van , too , are creations , and the interest of the stories depends largely upon our vivid consciousness all the while of the child listeners who share them with us ; but the ebony - skinned narrator is the heroine of the book .

		The attempt to give any adequate Portrayal of twenty leading univer - sities of the world within the com - pass of a single octavo volume of 275 pages would seem a desperate one from the start .

		Yet if it could be successfully done , President Thwing would seem to be one of the most promising entries for the contest .

		But a perusal of his recent book must prove disappointing to this high expectation .

		The rough-and-ready classification of all universities into four groups learning-laboratories , character - builders , culture-studies , and efficiency-mills is a seductive but perilous snare .

		It does not prevent a sound and appreciative estimate of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
London	LOCATION	, though the limited space is a bar to ade - quacy .

		But when it denies , or tends to deny , to
Berlin	LOCATION	and Harvard the predicate of efficient , and applies it preeminently to
Tokyo	LOCATION	and
Calcutta	LOCATION	, the danger becomes evident .

		In the value of the charac - terizations and estimates of various institutions there is great difference .

		Many of the observations on the
University of Madrid	ORGANIZATION	seem guarded and just .

		Such epigrams as `` Universities are at once the cause and the result of the Zeit-Geist , '' and `` The pride , not of life , but of living , dominates , '' and `` For lack of knowledge the people perish , but never for lack of art , '' are what might be expected from the author of `` A
History of Higher Education	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		So much the more striking is the onesidedness of the treatment of
Vienna	LOCATION	,
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	, and
Budapest	LOCATION	.

		And so much the more startling the carelessness and absolute obscurity of many passages in the chapters on these institutions .

		The treatment as well as the language almost compels the conclusion that por - tions of these articles were prepared by an ill - trained translator .

		What is to be made , for instance , of such expressions as these : '' The worthiest men which humanity or
Austria	LOCATION	has given to itself '' -LRB- p. 142 -RRB- . ''

		But , despite this condition , .

		the
Univer	ORGANIZATION	- sity of
Vienna	LOCATION	is still -LSB- meaning ' nevertheless ' -RSB- a commanding force of the entire world ... But in respect to students , its six thousand are larger than are found in any American institution '' -LRB- p. 149 -RRB- . ''

		Above most great universities of the world
Vienna	LOCATION	does not attract foreign students '' -LRB- p. 151 -RRB- .

		`` For the Hungarian people embody Slavic traditions , 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 1	DATE	, unlike those of the wide-spreading , conquering Aryan . ''

		-LRB- Are not , then , the Slavs Aryan * ?

		i Th < - teachings offered in Hungarian language are espe - cially numerous '' -LRB- p. 160 -RRB- . '

		The chief building of the
University	ORGANIZATION	... lengthens itself out to about one thousand feet '' -LRB- p. 170 -RRB- .

		Such passages might be cited by the score .

		Despite these defects of style , and some judgments from which many well - informed persons would dissent , President Th wing 's book , with its handsome half-tones , will be a welcome survey of a great field not often presented to one glance of the eye .

		`` The true missionary , '' said Gen - eral
Butler	PERSON	, '' is the finest soldier now Canadian print .

		... , , .

		, ... T , left in the world .

		And Sir
John Macdonald	PERSON	told a
London	LOCATION	audience that '' The finest moral police in the world is to be found in the priest - hood of French
Canada	LOCATION	. ''

		Add to these general statements the estimate of
Archbishop Ireland	LOCATION	, that old Father
Lacombe	PERSON	of the Oblate Order , now spend - ing his last days in his Home for the Poor at Mid - napore , is `` the most remarkable priest
Western America	LOCATION	has seen , '' and the life of that noble and pic - turesque character , compiled by
Katherine Hughes	PERSON	and published by
Moffat , Yard & Company	ORGANIZATION	, would seem labor spent on a worthy object .

		The story , told in the simplest chronological fashion , with no generalizations , no ecstacies , and no cant , is more than an interesting biography : it fulfils its relig - ions and ethical purpose more effectively than any amount of pointing of morals could do .

		Born near
Quebec	LOCATION	, with a strain of Indian blood to add ro - mance and restlessness to his vivacious French tem - perament , active for more than sixty years in the stirring affairs of frontier
Canada	LOCATION	, spirited enough to thunder '' Thou art the man ! ''

		in the face of the all-powerful
Hudson Bay Company	ORGANIZATION	manager , and to camp in the private office of the
Canadian Min	ORGANIZATION	- ister of the Interior until he signs the document assuring the Western priesthood financial indepen - dence , devoted enough to risk his life again and again fighting infectious diseases among his squalid parishioners , and again and again in more exciting if no more dangerous surroundings , and bubbling over from first to last with soul-thrilling eloquence and pigeon-English mots , famous over two conti - nents and carrying a battered wood and brass cru - cifix as `` my only decoration , '' he is at the same time one of the most amusing and one of the most touching figures of his generation .

		The book is en - titled '' Father
Lacombe	PERSON	, the Black - Robe Voyageur , '' and is profusely illustrated with photographs and charts .

		One needs a somewhat wide general knowledge of astronomy , meteor - ology , geology , and also biology , to handle successfully such a subject as '' The Growth of a Planet , '' when the treatment is as thorough as that given by
Professor Edwin Sharp Grew	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nearly ten years have now elapsed since the publication of Sir
Robert S. Ball	PERSON	's fascinating work on `` The Earth 's Beginning , '' and so great has been the pro- gress made during that time that a new book setting forth the latest researches and speculations is very welcome .

		Mr.
Grew	PERSON	's work covers a greater rarge than Sir
Robert Ball	PERSON	's ; for the latter contents him - self with a brilliant exposition of the origin of tin * earth according to the nebular hypothesis , while the former discusses not only the origin but the later hi * - tory of our earth , as its face lias been wrinkled and furrowed by various agencies , while life , myste - riously originating , has developed prodigiously .

		In - stead of following the old nebular hypothesis of
Laplace	LOCATION	, our author expounds the new and distinct - ively American theory known as the '' planetisimal theory , '' which originated from the labors of Pro- fessors
Chamberlin	PERSON	and
Moulton	PERSON	of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and is making its way throughout the world of science .

		Mr.
Grew	PERSON	, or his printers , how - ever , take the liberty of calling it the `` planetismal '' theory ; but the
Century Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	does not recog - nize the word .

		Having started the planets and their satellites upon their career , the author wisely limits his discussion of their further development chiefly to the single case of the earth , where we have some solid facts to build upon .

		Beginning at the very foundation , the probable structure of the core of the earth is discussed at considerable length ; this is followed by a luminous exposition of the causes of the present shape of the earth 's surface , a subject to which certain well-known British scien - tists , especially
Darwin	PERSON	, Jeans , and Love , have given much ingenious study .

		The modifications of the sur - face by volcanoes , earthquakes , and the agencies of air and water , are next treated .

		Finally , the origin and development of life , both vegetable and animal , have about a fourth of the book allotted to them , the whole matter being closed by some brief considera - tions as to the future of life on our planet .

		The reader will be convinced of the wide range of the author 's study , his excellent understanding of the various subjects involved , and his power of adequate and interesting presentation .

Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Harry A. Franck	PERSON	, a teacher of modern languages , spent four months recently in pedestrian travel in the land of
Don Quixote	PERSON	, and the record of his expe - riences is published by the
Century Company	ORGANIZATION	, with the title '' Four Months Afoot in
Spain	LOCATION	. ''

		The title is a trifle misleading , since occasional resort to the rail - road was necessary in order to enable the traveller to complete a zigzag itinerary between
Gibraltar	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	during the time at his disposal .

		The preface claims a utilitarian motive , and the author is careful to keep us in touch with bin expenses , which totalled
$ 172	MONEY	from
New York	LOCATION	to

		The modesty of the figure is due in some degree to the generosity j of the Gallicians in the northwest , who magnani - mously contributed to Mr.

		In one respect the book is al - most absolutely unique : written by a foreigner , it nevertheless vigorously defends the institution of the bull-fight .

		The reader who knows
Spain	LOCATION	and Spanish will suspect that the author has sometimes fallen a prey to his instinct for literary effect , and will re - gret that the proof of the frequently-recurring bits of Spanish , inserted to give local color , was not more carefully read ; but for popular reading the story is a distinct success .

		Hardy annuals we can scarcely call them , since most of these publications , carefully compiled though they be , fail to reach a second edition .

		Is it because hybrids are not infrequently sterile ?

		At any rate , the travel books that live are few , and usually of two sorts : works of pure originality like
Gautier	PERSON	's or
Howells	PERSON	's ; and the humbler but more useful guide , such as the perennial
Baedeker	PERSON	.

		Ap - proaching this type in its objectivity and wealth of information , but naturally far more complete on the artistic aspect of its subject , is Mr.
Herbert Vaughan	PERSON	's '' Florence and Her Treasures '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a book which the average traveller will find a real guide , philosopher , and friend .

		The history and descrip - tion of
Florence	LOCATION	, with her churches , palaces , galleries , and museums , would furnish the material for many volumes , and any attempt to condense it into 375 duodecimo pages will provoke criticism from some quarter ; but in the main Mr.
Vaughan	PERSON	's selection will please the traveller who is not himself a spe - cialist .

		An interesting account of the Festivals at
Florence	LOCATION	is given , and the notes on the paintings and statues are supplemented by brief index-lists of artists and a somewhat summary but useful chapter on Saints and their Symbols .

		The illustrations , which are clearly printed in beautiful half-tone , are a special feature of this little guide book , which , although a trifle corpulent , is small enough for the masculine coat-pocket .

		Psychology and business efficiency .

		Professor
Walter Dill Scott	PERSON	, in his volume on '' Increasing Efficiency in Business '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , makes a direct appeal in plain language to the plain man .

		It brings psychology to the street in the conceptions and interests of the street .

		In so doing there is danger of assigning dominance to the motives , pur - poses , and methods of the street , and forsaking the principles of a larger psychology in an eagerness to serve the narrower clientele .

		The reactions of theory and practice are legitimately reciprocal ; but the dominance belongs to principle , and the eking out of principle to suit the shifting demands of a practice bringing with it the provincialisms of its own environ - ment is in the long run neither profitable nor justifi - able .

		Despite transgression in this particular , the chapters of this book show a creditable success in carrying the message of psychological economy into business .

		They set forth the utilization of such varied procedures as imitation , competition , loyalty , concen - tration , rewards , pleasures , relaxations , the sporting instinct , in advancing the cause of efficiency as tested and gauged by market values .

		The spirit of the application is pointed if not profound , compromis - ing rather than directive .

		Yet if the implication be avoided that the mission and even the plain lesson of psychology begins and ends here , the book will be beneficial within its chosen limitations . ''

		A contri - bution to the psychology of business '' is open to the serious danger of having the shadow of business obscure the illumination of psychology .

		Logically , from its title , one would 8U PPp se '' The Man Who Likes Mexico '' -LRB-

Rostand	PERSON	,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, and
Sudermann	ORGANIZATION	.

		The composers are
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	,
Puccini	ORGANIZATION	, and
Richard Strauss	PERSON	.

		Under the head of each author are given lists of his works , summaries of each play , and references to the best criticism of the plays .

		A special section deals with the general literature on dramatic technique , theory , and criticism .

		Three new volumes have just been issued by the
Penn Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their series of '' Popular Hand - books . ''

		Mr.
C. T. Davies	PERSON	contributes a small volume , '' The Horse and How to Care For Him '' whose scope is indicated by its sub-title , How to choose a horse , tell his age , feed , stable , harness and train him , and keep him in good health . ''

		A number of diagrams aid this exposition .

		Mr.
John H. Bechtel	PERSON	gives a short diction - ary of '' Biblical Quotations '' arranged under the heads of the human experiences to which they severally apply .

		The party hostess or harassed parent will welcome the third volume , Home Games '' by Mr.
George Hapgood	PERSON	, in which games of bodily and mental skill , chance , and observation are simply explained . ''

		The Position of Women in Indian Life , '' by
Her Highness the Maharani of Baroda	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
S. M. Mitra	PERSON	, offers a most striking example of an unfortunate title ; for it treats of the activities of women in every land ex - cept
India	LOCATION	.

		The purpose of the book is to aid in the reasonable emancipation and elevation of Indian women by giving an account of '' Western feminine institutions '' which might be adopted to meet
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	requirements .

		From this point of view , the authors write upon such themes as '' Agriculture , '' Professions for Women , '' '' Philanthropic Work , '' '' Domestic Science , '' '' Co - operation , '' `` Rescue Work , '' and `` Women in
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		The work is thoroughly well done , whether one con - siders the results of investigation or the manner of pre - sentation ; and the book will take its place among the laudable efforts made by the enlightened and progres - sive rulers of
Baroda	LOCATION	to promote the well-being of their subjects .

		For the Western reader , it will be interesting mainly as an indication of this important activity , and as offering a number of incidental references to condi - tions in
India	LOCATION	.

		-LRB-
Longmans	LOCATION	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- To the '' History of the Sciences '' series , published in
London	LOCATION	by the
Rationalist Press Association	ORGANIZATION	and in this country by the
Putnams	LOCATION	, a History of Biology '' is con - tributed by
L. C. Miall	PERSON	, F.K.S. .

		The limitation of space imposed in the general editorial plan of the series makes impossible anything like an adequate treatment of the development of biology .

		Only the most salient points of fact can be brought out .

		So much is well done ; but a history which is obliged to delete almost completely the personal element can not be said to afford particularly entertaining reading .

		Statistics of crime and criminals thus far compiled in this country by the state and federal governments are of very uneven value and are generally useless .

		The well-trained statistician is rare , and few of the best type are in local and state service .

		According to Mr.
Louis N. Robinson	PERSON	, author of a '' History of Criminal Statistics in the
United States	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	ton -RRB- , the most hopeful way to reach sound results lies in the direction of federal leadership in registration areas upon a uniform plan .

		This study represents much labor , and will help explor - ers , but does not add much to expert knowledge of the subject .

		It will be useful in concentrating public atten - tion upon the need of improvement in methods in this important field .

		Since Mr.
George Wharton James	PERSON	first issued his book , '' In and Around the Grand Canyon of the
Colorado	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- many changes have been made in the mapping and naming of different parts of the Canyon , in the available trails through its explorable parts , and in the hotel and other accommodations for the tourist , That he might include the latest results of work on the Canyon by the
United States Geological Survey	ORGANIZATION	, as well as the other changes just mentioned , Mr.
James	PERSON	has issued a new edition of his book with the necessary re - writing to bring it to date .

		He has included in the vol - ume a new map of the Canyon , containing many names , suggested by himself , now adopted for newly charted or rechristened points of interest .

		In an appendix are given a number of newly determined heights and other dimensions of peaks , towers , buttes , etc. , which hitherto have been estimated only .

		The geographical availability of
Colorado	LOCATION	to the aver - age American , and especially to the dweller in the Mis - sissippi Valley , makes it inevitable that the '' colored '' State should become more and more the
summer	DATE	resort of those who seek pure air , while its possibilities for permanent homes have but begun to be appreciated .

		In view of these facts , a handy book of information , neatly printed and supplied with tables and a map , must meet a growing demand .

		Mr.
Eugene Parsons	PERSON	had already written the history of
Colorado	LOCATION	, and seems to be a fit person to supply the Guidebook to that
State wlm-h Messrs. Little	ORGANIZATION	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just issued .

		The body of the book is arranged by counties in alphabetical order , while a good index renders the carefully compiled in - formation accessible from any point of view .

		The book is illustrated with over seventy fine half-tones .

		An - other good feature is the table of distances and rail - road rates .

		The
Baker & Taylor Co.	ORGANIZATION	issued the first three volumes of these reminiscences two years ago , and it is understood that Mr.

F. E. Pierce	PERSON	and
Samuel Thurber	PERSON	, Jr. .

		Freytag 's '' Die Journalisten '' -LRB-
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is once more edited for school use , this time by Mr.
H. A. Potter	PERSON	, who supplies the usual apparatus for student use .

		Another excellent text is
Fontane	LOCATION	's `` Grete Minds '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , edited by Mr.
H. W. Thayer	PERSON	.

		The reading-book of `` Ger - man Epics Retold '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , compiled by Mr.

Lohengrin	LOCATION	, and Tristan stories , the '' Heliard , '' the '' Nibelungenlied , '' the '' Woltarilied , '' and the Song of
Gudrun	PERSON	.

		The modern
Historic Records Association	ORGANIZATION	, lately in - corporated at
New York	LOCATION	, has for its object the handing - down to posterity of the completest possible records of the life we are now living .

		The photograph , the phonograph , the moving-picture films , the written and the printed word every means known to science is to be employed to enable our descendants to make the irrevocable past in some sense not wholly irrevocable .

		Fire - proof build - ings are to be erected for the safe keeping of these pre - cious memorials .

		The incorporators include many men well known in their various professions and occupations .

		Mrs.
Arthur Stannard	PERSON	, a novelist better known through her pseudonym of
John Strange Winter	ORGANIZATION	, died in
London	LOCATION	on the
14th of December	DATE	.

		She was a most prolific fic - tion writer , her total output being nearly 100 volumes .

		Her stories were chiefly about army life , and
John Ruskin	PERSON	referred to her as '' the author to whom we owe the most finished and faithful rendering ever yet given of the character of the British soldier . ''

		Among her works that became popular both in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	are '' Booties ' Baby , '' The Soul of the Bishop , '' '' Only Human , '' Houpla , '' and '' The Truth Tellers . ''

		She was fifty-six years of age .

		Early in the present month Mr.
William T. Price	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	will begin publication of a monthly review , '' The American Playwright , '' devoted to the technical discussion of plays and playwriting .

		It will aim to give such full information as is desired and needed by students of the drama ; and will contain a complete record of plays produced in
New York	LOCATION	and of all credit - able published plays and books and articles relating to the technical side of the stage .

		Its reviews of current plays will be analytical , directed at their causes of fail - ure or success .

		Its various departments will be designed to help , in a practical way , those who accept playwrit - ing as an art .

		The list of private collectors of books and literaria in the
United States	LOCATION	, which was printed in '' The Annual Library Index ,
1910	DATE	, '' published by the Office of `` The Publishers ' Weekly , '' is undergoing a thorough revision for insertion in the Annual covering
1911	DATE	, to be published early in
March	DATE	.

		The original list contains about
1100	DATE	names and addresses of bookbuyers , with mention of the specialties each collector is interested in .

		It was the first attempt to gather together such a directory since
G. Hedeler	PERSON	, of
Leipzig	LOCATION	, printed his list of buyers in the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	fourteen years ago .

		It has been helpful in promoting fraternal interests among collectors and in putting them in touch with others of similar tastes .

		The revision will include additional names , making the total number about
1500	DATE	, arranged geographically by states as before .

		Data for the forth - coming revision will be welcomed if supplied before

Benjamin Wells	PERSON	, Ph.D. , and
John B. Henneman	PERSON	, Ph.D. , who have revised , sup - plemented , and annotated this edition .

Paris	LOCATION	, and supplemented by sixty-nine addi - tional plates , comprising pictures of well-known actors and actresses in Shakespearean roles .

		There will also be facsimiles of title-pages of the original quartos and of the four folios .

		We are going to write about it all , '' says Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	in his recent remarks about the contemporary novel . ''

		We are going to write about business and finance and politics , and precedence and pretentiousness and de - corum and indecorum , until a thousand pre - tences and ten thousand impostures shrivel in the cold clear air of our elucidations . ''

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, having qualified himself by both obser - vation and experience , has written about a good deal of it already , and his industry is such that he seems quite capable of completing the job before he lays down his pen or perhaps we should say , before his fingers cease from thump - ing the keys of his writing-machine .

		He and his fellow-workers have certainly set about the business in thoroughgoing fashion , having not only written about pretty nearly everything , but having also contrived to jar the pedestal upon which many an old-fashioned notion of justice and morality has seemed to stand secure .

		We do not think that these associated iconoclasts have really smashed many images , but they have stirred up a great intellectual rumpus , and they have found a half - educated public ready to ap - plaud their efforts .

		This is all very well in a way , because activity is always better than sluggishness in matters of the intellect , and no one will claim that the whole of social truth has been sorted out and packed and labelled .

		But it is rather amusing to note the sort of following that gathers about our preachers of new gospels .

		The young men and women , unbalanced for lack of reflection and uninformed for lack of serious educational ap - plication , who rally around the new standard bearers , do not greatly impress the judicious observer , because they are so evidently without poise or background .

		They have not in their hands the touchstones of criticism , whether for ideas or the expression of ideas ; and one may shrewdly suspect that they would not know how to use them if they had .

		They get into a state of great excitement about some modern writer who deals with a vital subject in a third - class way , whereas if they were really acquainted with literature they would know that the same subject had been dealt with in a first-class way long before .

		the while accompanying their discoveries with gleeful shouts and the deliverance of cocksure judgments .

		And their most fervent applause goes to the writer whose defiance is expressed in the spirit of the naughty youngster whose 44 1 disbelieve wholly in everything .

		There ! ''

		broke up a certain '' session of the poets . ''

		These young disciples of a new dispensation seem to believe that their popular prophets are for the first time bringing literature into its own .

		This is being done by letting down the bars of reticence on all sides , and by noisily disputing the validity of all hitherto accepted beliefs .

		Now reticence may possibly go too far , but no sane person can deny that there are ugly things in life that had better be kept in the dark corners of consciousness .

		If they are to be given light and air at all , it must be under the control of a severe artistic discipline , and not under the impulse of a desire for sensational exploitation .

		An ugly subject is involved in the stories of -LRB- Edipus , and
Beatrice Cenci	PERSON	, and
Siegmund	PERSON	and
Sieglinde	PERSON	; but it becomes beautiful without offence in the glorious art of Sophocles and
Shelley	PERSON	and
Wagner	PERSON	.

		It is the manner and not the matter that counts , and the world has taken a long stride toward decency and fitness in its repudiation of the grosser manner of treat - ment which found popular favor not so many generations ago .

		Again , it may be that some of the moral judgments of the world need revising , but it must not be forgotten that there is an immense presumption in favor of the conclusions to which accumulated experience has led , and that the wisdom of the ages is not lightly to be upset .

		The case for conservatism is not based upon unreasoning prejudice , but partly upon this presumption , and partly upon the instinct which warns the wise that , however strong may appear the argument for some radical innova - tion , there are sure to come in its train unfore - seen and incalculable consequences which may put its advocates to confusion after the mischief is done .

		We published not long ago an essay by one of our most valued contributors upon the fight for free raw materials in literature .

		It was a sober statement of the rightful claim of litera - ture to deal with all subjects of vital human concern , implying , of course , that the treat - ment should be informed and responsible .

		As far as it found fault with existing conditions , it did so because prudery and hypocrisy seem to impede the free motion of the creative spirit , and the rule of '' pedants and pedagogues '' to be too much in evidence .

		Among other consequences , it impelled one novelist to wonder why a recent book of his a singularly revolting performance which he asserted to contain more `` raw ma - terial '' than any other book written in
America	LOCATION	, had received no attention in this journal .

		Tin - assertion is fully lx > rne out by the contents of the book in question , and it is precisely because its material was still `` raw '' when offered to the public that we did not deem it deserving of notice .

		The last thing our essayist would have claimed would be that because literature < !

		mands a free supply of '' raw materials '' it should dump them upon the market in that form , et that it is absolved from all artistic responsibility for their shaping .

		The essay was not a plea for license , or for slackness of workmanship , or for anything but freedom from the limitations upon choice of theme which , it may freely be admitted , hemmed in somewhat t closely the Knglish writers of the Victorian period .

		It is one thing to take this position , and quite another to con - done the course which in the case of continental literature has of recent years borne such evil fruits .

		The fight for free raw material will go on , if it be not already won ; but with it will go on the fight for restraint , and decency , and artistic form in literature , and in the life which literature at once reflects and moulds , the fight for the principle that hot individual desire does not provide the sole test of conduct , and has no claims that are paramount to those of the social body whereof each individual is a member .

		THE SPLENDID YEARS OF MODERN LITERATURE .

		Criticism is in the main a discovery of the known , an exploration of the familiar .

		The contours , the comparative heights , the water-sheds of literary crea - tion and thought are in a state of apparent change .

		Each generation fixes them to suit itself ; but new geodetic surveys are always needed .

		But every sur - veyor 's report swarms with errors .

		Literary work , once done , is certain enough in itself , but opinion about it varies .

		It is like a cloud trying to form a judgment in regard to the solid earth .

		Nevertheless , the attempt to fix the true relations of the eminences and valleys of human creation must go on .

		Hardly anything is more important for us than to know what in the literature of the past we ought most to admire and emulate .

		What is the most important body of literature produced in modern times ?

		National prejudices , class feelings , the interests and passions of mankind .

		becloud such an inquiry .

		One can only offer an opinion and an argument .

		To me it seems that setting aside
Goethe	PERSON	, who was a world in himself
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 the work done by the generation which gave the Romantic revival to
England	LOCATION	surpasses anything that has been done anywhere else during the last two hundred years .

		The English eighteenth - century literature , won - derful as it is in variety and human compass , is dis - tinctly on a lower plane .

		In effectiveness , the work of the Encyclopaedists in
France	LOCATION	was perhaps as great ; but the torches of
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	, and Diderot were blown out by the blaze they kindled .

		Few of their books have intrinsic permanent value .

		The great French outburst of
1830	DATE	was measurably a replica of the preceding English one , to which it was inferior in splendor and genetic power .

		Chateau - briand and Lamartine inherit from
Byron	LOCATION	.

		Hugo and
Dumas	PERSON	hold from
Scott	LOCATION	.

		Swinburne called
Musset Byron	ORGANIZATION	's attendant dwarf : perhaps it would be fairer to say that he is
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's page .

		Russian literature , built up during the last century , is wanting in light and distinction ; it is a literature without fresh air .

		To an outsider , at least , it seems like a confused and dreary struggle in the dark the tumult of men in a prison from which they can not escape .

		The literature of the Scandinavian peoples sounds a good deal like the shrieks of men undergoing torture .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	,
Manzoni	PERSON	was of the blood of
Scott	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	; and while
Leopardi	LOCATION	is unique , he is not large enough to weigh down the scales against the Englishmen .

		Our American lit - erature , except for the work of one or two poets , is too tame and secondary to come into comparison .

		And recent English literature seems to see life as through a telescope reversed ; everything is small or blurred .

		Tennyson is the idyllist , a maker of small though perfect things .

		Carlyle in the com - pany of the great Georgians would almost show like Thersites in the Grecian camp , or like the lame
Vulcan	ORGANIZATION	on
Olympus	ORGANIZATION	.

		Altogether it is hard to see anywhere such a company of proud and peculiar presences , such a senate of intellect , as appeared in
England	LOCATION	about the beginning of the nineteenth century .

		It really began with
Burns	PERSON	: for though he belongs to the eighteenth century by his satire and didactic turn , he sounded pretty nearly all the notes of the new era its rebellion , its romance , its personal passion .

		He is more like Goethe than any other modern , and as far as he goes he is quite as great .

		Goethe 's most characteristic qualities intense nat - uralness and undeviating truth are more than matched by the author of the Scotch songs , ''
Tarn O'Shanter	PERSON	'' and `` The Jolly Beggars . ''

		Wordsworth is surely the modern king of the spir - itual world .

		He dwelt in a region beyond the ken of most poets a place of high tranquillity where the bird of peace sits brooding on the calmed wave .

		The poet of nature yes , but his nature is not the catalogue of outward things which even great poets give ; it is the verity to which man is only an inci - dent ; it is the melting-pot of generations ; it is the very body of the Eternal himself .

		Coleridge , though he gave a good part of his mind to the making of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	, is not spiritual .

		He is the lord of the supersensuous , of that unreal world of glamor and dream image which is the most real thing in existence for the liner sort of minds .

		It was his poetry and criticism that really broke the eighteenth century 's cast-iron system of common sense , made explicable the great poetry of the past , and gave the new men the keys to that domain .

		There are two great divisions among writers those who speak for themselves , and those through whom others speak , in other words , the lyric and the dramatic types .

		Largely this era was a lyric one , an era of great personalities who swept the world with their passion or their grief .

		But it had its supreme creative artist in
Scott	LOCATION	, who was ob - jective even in his poetry .

		It is an Arab supersti - tion that he who draws or paints the picture of a human being must on the
Last Day	DATE	furnish it with a soul to be condemned or rewarded .

		What an expense
Scott	PERSON	would be in that case !

		And amid the cohorts of the man-created , what a vast and predominant array would owe allegiance to him !

		Byron was the dynamo of his generation the most splendid figure , the greatest force , English literature has produced .

		Like Tamburlane holloa - ing to the harnessed Kings of
Asia	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	could boast of driving the intellect of
Europe	LOCATION	in leash .

		His influence extended everywhere , from
Russia	LOCATION	to the two Americas .

		His world was the world of passion and politics and affairs , but in this world his books were events comparable with the French Revolution or the campaigns of
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		And his track is not yet a faded one .

		The richness and splendor of his literary gifts will keep his works alive when those of Voltaire and
Rousseau	PERSON	are comparatively forgotten .


Shelley	PERSON	was the prophet of his time , a Memnon of to-morrow .

		It only needs a glance at contempo - rary literature and life to see how much his spirit is awake .

		The seed ideas that he flung about have taken root , are growing on every side .

		In a literary way , he brought into the world a haunting strain of music , new and perfect , which must live on even if his ideas and policies wither away .

		All these men were something more than writers , but
Keats	PERSON	was literature incarnate the pure artist living for image and expression .

		Borrowing from the best of his predecessors , he attained such mastery of language that he set his s , & mp upon two generations of his followers , as Pope did on two generations of his .

		Perhaps such richly floriated work has been overdone : there is need to recur to the granite foundation-stuff of thought and feeling .

		But in
Keats	PERSON	's mature work there is no weakness .

		Large - ness and loveliness were never more perfectly welded together .

		These were the stars of first magnitude in that English constellation .

		It speaks volumes for their brilliancy when an orb like Landor could roll by un - attached , unnoticed ; when the novel world of Miss
Austen	PERSON	could spring into being in their midst with - out attracting attention .

		There is enough good read - TILE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, ing in Landor to give us measureless content ;
Miss Austen	PERSON	is surely the equal of any English novelist , excepting
Dickens	PERSON	, since her day ; yet when we think of them in connection with the Georgian group , neither of them looms large .

		And the satellites of this system were mighty and self-shining lights .

		There was
Moore	PERSON	, a true and tender lyrist who knew better than most of them how to make a song .

		There was
Campbell	ORGANIZATION	, whose resonant verse expressed a nation 's exultation as it has never been done before or since .

		There were
Hazlitt	PERSON	,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, DeQuincey , and
Wilson	PERSON	, essayists who as a group can hardly be matched in literature .

		There were writers of single remark - able books
Godwin	PERSON	,
Beckford	PERSON	, Mrs.
Shelley	PERSON	.

		All told , the display was dazzling .

		It was preeminently an age of poets .

		Prose has been winning on poetry in every language in mod - ern times .

		The greatest triumphs of the men of
1830	DATE	in
France	LOCATION	were prose triumphs ; and the same may fairly be said of the Victorian writers .

		But in the English Romantic revival , poetry made its last great stand for supremacy .

		The verse of
Burns	PERSON	and
Scott	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	swept the world .

		For a time , prose was in eclipse .

		Now , putting aside any other element of superiority , the concentration of verse gives it a far greater chance of immortality than prose possesses .

		Verse is to prose as diamonds are to dust .

		It lasts longer , and value is more easily portable in it .

		As books accumulate in incredible numbers , it looks as if the race would have to throw away all but the most concentrated and quintessen - tial records of its experience .

		Time will do what the
Caliph Omar	PERSON	did to winnow our libraries .

		But poetry takes up comparatively little space , and it is easily remembered .

		The Georgian era was an era of youth .

		Nearly all its writers did their great work early , and the majority of them died young .

		The personalities and actions of the young are certainly more attract - ive to mankind than those that pertain to mature humanity .

		Balzac may discover the middle-aged heroine , but she will never displace the Juliets and
Gretchens	PERSON	in the affection of the world .

		Again , the Georgians were a race of divine ama - teurs .

		Among the chiefs ,
Scott	PERSON	was the only pro- fessional author the only one who deliberately wrote for money .


Schopenhauer	PERSON	said that the ruin of literature came about when men found that they could make money by books .

		A great part of mod - ern literature reads as if it was written to provide frocks for the authors ' wives .

		Those who work with such ulterior motive must keep a wary eye on the market ; they must cog and flatter and palter .

		The Georgians wrote in scorn of consequence .

		They could play at pitch-and-toss with the universe .

		They could dare everything .

		All in all , then , I think it is tolerably certain that the Georgian outburst was the most important ap - parition of literary genius that the world has seen in modern times .

		No single figure of its group is equal to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	or
Milton	LOCATION	or Moliere or Goethe .

		But in the mats they surpass any but the greatest of those .

		Vast and various a * the world 's literature has become - inn - .

		I doubt if taken to - gether it is equal in value to the work of those few yean in one country .

		For one thing , recent litera - ture ha < i taken a turn downward .

		It IKIS largely exchanged verse for prose ; it has mingled with the crowd on the levels , instead of staying with the shining ones on the hills ; it has dealt very exclu - sively with the passive peculiarities of women , rather than with the active energies of men .

		If we are going to have a great literature again , it seems to me that we must think a great deal on the Georgian epoch .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE SUDDEN DEATH OF
ALFRED TENNYSON DICKENS	PERSON	, senior surviving member of the great nov - elist 's family , and godson of the late poet-laureate , adds one more to the list of unfortunate occurrences in connection with the celebration , already begun , of the
Dickens	PERSON	centenary year .

		Mr.
Snowden Ward	PERSON	, who was to have lectured on the novelist , has been removed by death ; the much-advertised
Dickens	PERSON	stamp failed to make itself a - popular as had been hoped ; and now he who was to have played a lead - ing part in the centennial festivities has been ab - ruptly stricken down while lecturing in this country on his father 's life and works .

		The sad event is the more to be regretted because , had Mr.
Dickens	PERSON	lived even a little longer , he would have learned with satisfaction of the action now being taken by a num - ber of wealthy Americans , headed by Mr.
Henry Clews	PERSON	, the banker , to raise a fund in honor of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	and for the aid of those of his descendants to whom such aid is likely to be welcome .

		Mr.
Dickens	PERSON	had been in
America	LOCATION	since
last September	DATE	, visiting different cities and addressing interested audiences on the unfailingly popular subject ,
Charles Dickens	PERSON	the man and the writer .

		THE INTERESTING OUTCOME OF A PUBLISHING DISPUTE reaches us from
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Some time ago comment was made in these columns on
M. Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	's very natural objection to the publication of a French history which he had written twenty - seven years before as a piece of hack-work , and which had apparently not seemed to the publisher worth printing until its author 's increasing fame gave it a factitious value .

		Unwilling to have his name at - tached to a crude and immature performance , the writer invoked the aid of the law to prevent it .

		His counsel ,
M. Raymond Poincare	PERSON	* , consulted the his - torian Lavisse in the matter , and Professor
Lavisse	PERSON	expressed himself in no uncertain terms . ''

		It is not to be permitted , '' he said , '' that a historian should be forced to publish a history written by liim twenty -
seven years ago	DATE	.

		In so long a period the world has changed , the historian likewise . ''

		After dwelling

		THE DIAL 43 on the ripening effect of time and experience on any author , he cited the instance of Duruy , the historian of
Rome	LOCATION	, whose first two volumes , written before his ministry of state , are markedly inferior in richness and power to the subsequent volumes that were writ - ten after those years of public life and of history - making in his own person .

		The compromise finally proposed by the publisher of the work now under dis - cussion was that , the date of writing should appear on the first page of the book , to which the party of the other part consented on condition that the cover should bear the further inscription , `` Published against the will of
M. Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The pub - lisher not relishing this undesirable form of advertis - ing , the matter was left to the court 's decision , which was given in favor of the author , the publisher being ordered to return the MS. and cancel the contract .

		LAST YEAR 'S LIST OF DEAD AUTHORS includes the names of
Antonio Fogazzaro	PERSON	, a novelist of world - wide fame ;
William S. Gilbert	PERSON	, known to every lover of the mirthful in printed verse and in acted opera of the lighter sort ;
Thomas Wentworth Higginson	PERSON	, one of the last survivors of that honored company of authors who made
New England	LOCATION	cele - brated in letters ;
Charles Battell Loomis	PERSON	, master of a wholesome humor that many right-minded readers enjoyed ;
David Graham Phillips	PERSON	, who achieved much popularity and some distinction as a novelist ;
Francis A. March	PERSON	, one of the most learned of philol - ogists , who wrote in a way to interest even the unlearned ;
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward	PERSON	, who knew how to point a moral and at the same time tell a love-story ;
Eugene F. Ware	PERSON	, who achieved na - tional fame as '' Ironquill '' ;
Katherine C. Thurston	PERSON	, who wrote at least one novel that was widely read and discussed on two continents ;
Myrtle Reed	LOCATION	, whose books gained many thousands of appreciative readers ; and , last in date of decease ,
John Bigelow	PERSON	, the earliest born and among the foremost in influ - ence and power ... SCHOOLS OF PRINTING IN THE UNITED STATES are a rapidly developing feature of industrial edu - cation .

		A few weeks ago Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	, in an address introducing the second course of lec - tures at the
Harvard Graduate School of Business Administration	ORGANIZATION	, ran over the list of such schools , so far as he had been able to gather the necessary information .

		He enumerated , in addition to the
Harvard School	ORGANIZATION	, the

		... THE COONSKIN LIBRARY , which came into being one hundred and
eight years ago	DATE	, in
Ames Township	LOCATION	,
Athens County	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, claims no relationship with the
Pigskin Library	ORGANIZATION	of a century later .

		Miss
Mary E. Downey	PERSON	, library-organizer of
Ohio	LOCATION	, in her late address before the
Federation of Women	ORGANIZATION	's Clubs of that state , an address now issued in pamphlet form by the
Ohio Board of Library Commissioners	ORGANIZATION	, re - lates the history of the
Coonskin Library	ORGANIZATION	.


Athens County	LOCATION	saw but little ready money in the early nine * teenth century ; but the woods were full of animals clothed in valuable furs , and when one
Samuel Brown	PERSON	made a business trip to
Boston	LOCATION	he took a wagon - load of skins and traded them for books , obtaining fifty-one volumes for the peltry .

		When
the Western Library Association of Ames Township	ORGANIZATION	was organ - ized , in
1804	DATE	, a certain
Thomas Ewing	PERSON	, apparently inspired by this experience of
Samuel Brown	PERSON	's , con - tributed ten coonskins , his entire wealth ; whence the name 4 < Coonskin Library . ''

		He says of it later : '' It was well selected ; the library of the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	was nothing to it , and there never was a library better read . ''

		In
1816	DATE	the collection suffered some disintegration , a part of it going to
Dover	LOCATION	upon the formation of the
Dover Library Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of the books were given to the
Athens	LOCATION	Pioneer Asso - ciation , others were sold to
William P. Cutler	PERSON	of
Washington County	LOCATION	, and still others , in
1876	DATE	, were sent to the Centennial at
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and were never returned .

		... A DICKENS CENTENARY FUND is being raised by the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Telegraph , '' the much - discussed
Dickens	PERSON	stamp having failed to yield the revenue hoped for by the would-be benefactors of the novelist 's five grandchildren who are said to be in not exactly opulent circumstances .

		The first week 's subscriptions to the fund are reported as amounting to a little more than two thousand pounds .

		Those publishers who have enriched themselves from the sales of the immortal novels are said to be conspicuous by their absence from the company of subscribers .

		Authors , on the other hand , and especially novelists , have generously responded , the considerable givers including Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	, Mr.
Rudyard Kipling	PERSON	, and Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	.

		`` Next to Shakespeare and
Keats	PERSON	, '' says
Miss Corelli	PERSON	, ''

		... STUDYING ENGLISH AUTHORS IN THEIR NATIVE HABITAT is to be the agreeable occupation of a class now forming at
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	under the direction of Professor
William D. MacClintock	PERSON	of 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, the English literature department .

		It is hoped to enlist about thirty students , and preparation for the
summer	DATE	's work will go on during the winter , and will consist of study of English topography and of English literary history , with attention to the prob - lems of literary technique .

		The special study to he taken up by these vacationists abroad will be '' The Background and Environment , Physical and Human , of Modern English Literature . ''

		Similar courses of styudy have already been engaged in by university classes in
Greece	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, and
Palestine	LOCATION	; and the field work is to be modelled after the excursions conducted by the departments of geology and botany .

		Some - thing unobtainable in the library and the study will doubtlessly be gained by these field-workers .

		Whether it will bring a richer enjoyment and a fuller understanding of English literature than the stay-at-home can acquire in his arm-chair will of course depend largely on the individual student .

		AERONAUTIC FICTION FOR YOUNG READERS is already considerable in quantity , and likely to in - crease rapidly , though the airship novel for adults has not yet made itself conspicuous .

		Among juve - nile books in this class may be noted Mr.
Harry Collingwood	PERSON	's '' With Airship and Submarine , '' Captain
F. S. Brereton	PERSON	's `` The Great Aeroplane , '' Mr.
W. J. Hopkins	PERSON	's '' The Airship Dragon-fly , '' Mr.
Herbert Strang	PERSON	's '' King of the Air : To
Morocco	LOCATION	in an Airship , '' and Mr.
H. L. Sayler	PERSON	's series , '' The Airship Boys , '' `` The Airship Boys Adrift , '' `` The Airship Boys Due North , '' and '' The Airship Boys in the Barren Lands . ''

		As soon as the staying powers of this wonderful chariot of the skies are somewhat further developed , we shall probably have '' Around the World in an Airship '' and '' To the
North Pole	LOCATION	in an Airship . ''

		Gloriously unfettered by physical laws is the - scientific imagination '' of the story-writer .

		THE POST-OFFICE SALE OF MISDIRECTED BOOKS , which formed no inconsiderable part of the ten thou - sand dollars ' worth of miscellaneous articles disposed of by auction in last year 's clearance sale of postal matter of unaacertainable ownership , amounted to one thousand two hundred and twenty-two pack - ages .

		Nearly every language spoken in our broad land was represented in the collection , which in - cluded , as a special curiosity , a Choctaw version of the Book of Psalms .

		In the entire lot Bibles and books on religious topics predominated .

		If more than a thousand books were misdirected , how many thousands , or perhaps hundreds of thousands , must have been carried by the mails !

		And how many times that number would be thus carried every year if we had , what many another country has , a thorough-going parcels-post system !

General Miles	ORGANIZATION	's book , `` Serving the Repub - lic , '' though covering much of the ground gone over in his '' Personal Recollections and

		Joining

spring of 1864	DATE	, when he was not yet twenty-five , and of major-general of vol - unteers in

		Par - ticipating in many of the bloodiest battles of the war , General Miles was several times wounded , once so severely as to incapacitate him for active service just when he was most eager to act in the
summer	DATE	of the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	fight .

		A short passage from the writer 's account of
Antietam	ORGANIZATION	will serve to show of what stuff the young officer was made . ''

		Our brigade moved on to the field in the second line .

		After the first brigade had become engaged we were called into action and succeeded in turning the right flank of the corps opposed to us , breaking the line and then wheeling to the right and enfilading what is known as the
Bloody Lane	ORGANIZATION	.

		Our regiment charged the enemy occupying that position , and succeeded in captur - ing it with over two hundred prisoners and a stand of colors .

		After the engagement , this sunken road pre - sented one of the most horrible scenes of the war .

		It was practically filled with dead and wounded , while the ground in front and rear was strewn with bodies of men engaged on both sides .

		It was here that
Colonel Francis C. Barlow	PERSON	, a fearless and accomplished officer , was severely wounded and carried from the field , leav - ing me in command of the regiment , my first experience as a field officer under fire .

		However , my first order was to advance , and from the Bloody Lane we drove the enemy through the cornfield and orchard , and remained there , with nothing on our right or left , until ordered back to a line occupied by the other troops . ''

		The author 's campaigns against the Indians of the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	fill several chapters of his book , and are followed by observations on '' Indian Life and Problems , '' with a reprint of his '' North American Review '' article entitled `` The Indian Problem . ' '

		From the account of operations lead - ing up to the capture of the redoubtable Chief
Joseph	PERSON	, of the
Nez Perces	LOCATION	, we quote a stirring passage . ''

		We were early on the march ,
September 30th	DATE	, and soon one of our Indians came dashing back , reporting 46 THE DIAL -LSB- .

		Without a halt < > nr troops formed line of battle , each trooper st-ruml his cartridge belt , and , with carbine or riHe in hand , galloped forward prepared for action .

		A more spirited , resolute body of men I have never Been go into battle .

		Every nerve and fiber seemed to be animated , and every eye sparkled with fire .

		The transformation of our Indian allies was spectacular and almost instantaneous .

		The old horses and mules they were riding were rushed into a ravine ; their old hats , clothing , and useless parapher - nalia were cached ; their strong , fresh war ponies , with a rawhide lariat around the necks and under jaws , but without saddles or bridles , were quickly mounted .

		In full war paint , with gorgeously feathered and beaded war bonnets , buckskin girdles about the loins , moccasins , and rifles and cartridge belts , the warriors were fully equipped for the fray , as gamy a looking body of sav - ages as could be imagined . ''

		Three pithy chapters , `` The War with
Spain	LOCATION	, '' 44 Campaigning in
Cuba	LOCATION	/ ' and `` The Capture of Porto Rico , '' give the significant facts of our late inglorious conflict , which , even in the opinion of this military author , so far as it can be inferred from his discreetly reticent pages , might easily have been avoided and its ultimate objects at - tained by peaceable means .

		But , as he remarks , 44 the advocacy of certain of the press journals , as well as the clamor of a portion of our people , continued until the war frenzy predominated . ''

		The retention of the commanding general in this country while his subordinates were sent forth to win glory at
San Juan	LOCATION	and elsewhere , we find recorded with characteristic brevity by the author ; but in closing his narrative of those final movements of his in person which resulted in the Spanish surrender at
Santiago	LOCATION	and in the bloodless capture of
Porto Rico	LOCATION	, he does venture on something like criticism , implied rather than direct , of our government 's policy .

		He says : '' I shall always regret that I did not go immediately to the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	, as I have always believed that from my experience in other campaigns , and with other people under similar conditions I could have prevented any serious controversy and certainly hostilities between the military forces of the
United States	LOCATION	and the millions of people of the archipelago .

		The people of the
Philip	LOCATION	- pine Islands had suffered the oppression of foreign rule for three hundred years , and were entitled to the sym - pathy of the world .

		With heroic efforts they had con - tended against their oppressors ; they had produced statesmen and patriots of the highest order .

		Such men as Jose '' Rizal and
Mabine	PERSON	will ever render the history of their race immortal .

		They had formed a government and framed a constitution copied after our own . ''

		The author ends his book with the close of his active service in
1903	DATE	.

		It is the narrative of a man of action , passing rapidly from event to event , and written in a manner so unostenta - tiously effective that one is hardly conscious of its excellence until occasionally the writer pauses to indulge in some reflection or general - i/ation less happily suited to his genius than the straightforward record of campaigns and battles .

		To the attainment of accuracy in this record he has , as he says in his preface , devotee !

		his earn - est efforts , in order that what he writes may be at least authentic .

		And so his book is not only very readable and confidence - inspiring history in itself , but also a source from which future writers will draw in compiling the history of our time .

Howard Chandler Christy	PERSON	and Mr.

		So he escaped from the trip to Assouan , even as from the shadow of death , and returned to
Cairo	LOCATION	, where we found him two weeks later .

		He was perfectly happy .

		The mixed throngs , the bustle and stir , the very exactions of the 44 swell '' hotels , made him thrill with joy .

		THE DIAL 47 he kept repeating . ''

		You get the real
Egypt	LOCATION	here ! ''

		All he had seen was the Street of the
Camel	ORGANIZATION	, and the notorious quarters not far away .

		He had confused tinsel and bright dyes with genuine oriental color , and had managed to transform a shifting , picturesque , mongrel mob into the embodiment of cosmopolitanism .

		But the old
Egypt	LOCATION	of the Pharaohs and their succes - sors had only bored him ;
Arabic Egypt	LOCATION	, still to be found in a few villages or in some parts of
Cairo	LOCATION	away from the tourist-crowded thorough - fares , had never been revealed to him ; and modern
Egypt	LOCATION	escaped him altogether , for he had no preliminary knowledge either of the eco - nomic , industrial , and administrative problems of the country , or of the aspirations and activities of the
Nationalist	ORGANIZATION	party .

		The earliest of the three Egypts our tourist might have enjoyed is represented by the first volume in our present list , which is a translation of six articles appearing originally in the Revue de
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It gives `` a popular account of the interesting but complicated problems raised by the discoveries of the last ten or fifteen years , '' and inasmuch as it is written by a competent specialist , it represents the only sort of popu - larizing that should be tolerated on a subject within the field of serious scholarship .

		Through - out three hundred pages the reader follows a delightful guide who has a right to speak , and each chapter proves much richer than is promised by its modest caption .

		For instance , in connec - tion with the '' Restoration of the Egyptian Tem - ples '' we are told not only how the structures are restored but how they were built and how they were destroyed .

		Indeed , the writer 's simple explanation of the use of the inclined plane , of terraced embankments , and of primitive machin - ery , carries much more enlightenment than is to be gained from many more ambitious essays .

		Similarly , '' Pharaonic Diplomacy '' broadens out into administrative methods and interna - tional relations .

		So that by the time we finish ``
Egypt	LOCATION	before the Pyramids , '' `` The Book of the Dead , '' `` Around the Pyramids , '' and `` Magic in
Ancient Egypt	LOCATION	, '' we have been neatly intro - duced to many fields of Egyptology .

		Of the disputable views advanced by
M. Moret	PERSON	, the most interesting is that the Pharaohs were not essentially tyrants exercising a ruthless rule over their subjects .

		Only a Frenchman could have put his theory in such attractive form as this : '' In the eyes of their contemporaries , the Pharaohs were rather benefactors , who put great ideas into tangi - ble form and enabled a whole nation to conquer Para - dise .

		They could not have carried on their labours during several centuries and achieved such colossal re - sults had they not been supported by popular enthusiasm similar to that which , less than nine centuries ago , pro- moted the construction of the European cathedrals .

		The beautiful lines of Sully Prudhomme describe a mason who died , despised , while building the pyramid and crying out in vain : ' II monte , il va , cherchant les dieux et la justice ... ' -LSB- He climbs , he mounts , seeking gods and justice ... -RSB- Yet , this is not the complaint of a victim , it is the clamour of a whole primitive nation , a cry of hope , of fear , of will , rejoicing that a way to heaven has been forced open by the triangular apex of the pyramid . ''

		The theory is really too beautiful ; and at the risk of seeming presumptuous we must state that the evidence seems inadequate , and confess our adherence to a modified form of the ti'adi - tional theory that found expression in
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	and has been held in some form or other ever since .

		But even our moments of occasional disagreement are pleasurable ; and we are glad to praise a modest and successful presentation .

		The book is clearly printed , neatly bound , and helpfully illustrated .

		To our second volume , '' Oriental
Cairo	LOCATION	, '' we must apply the adjective '' popular '' in a radi - cally different sense .

		Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	found that
Cairo	LOCATION	included a glorious mediaeval city of the Arabian Nights , with innumerable monuments of medi - aeval Arab architecture and unspoiled native life in short , the second of our three Egypts .

		To this he strives to call attention in a book that he hopes to make `` chatty and interesting . ''

		And he unquestionably succeeds ; but it seems that he pays rather a ghastly price for his suc - cess .

		Obviously , his modest aims forbid criti - cism on questions of scholarship , or even of accuracy ; so we omit any such considerations .

		But why will a clever man be driven by his enthusiasm to perpetrate enormities like the fol - lowing : `` The desert is well named .

		It is very deserted . '' ''

		The head of the Sphinx the most subtle pieces of sculpture the world ever pro- duced . '' ''

		The statue of
Chephren	LOCATION	, who built the second
Pyramid of Gizeh	ORGANIZATION	, and has an ex - pression as subtle as that of Leonardo da
Vinci	PERSON	's
Monna Lisa	PERSON	. ''

		If such absurdities , together with countless impertinent reflections , were eliminated , the material reorganized with a view to orderly presentation , the superlatives brought under reasonable control , and the whole worked over with patient care , we should have had a really welcome book , such as Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	at his best is easily capable of writing .

		Even as it is , we have enjoyed much of it ; and the prospec - tive leisurely tourist ought to enjoy more .

		By reading the book he will not only become theo -

		a > well as how to enjoy the `` Humors of the Esbekiya '' and countless other entertaining features of this variegated modern capital .

		lie will even know the '' Artist 's Bits in
Cairo	LOCATION	, '' and will receive explicit directions how to find them .

		In other words , he need no longer be a '' tame tourist '' in the hands of a masterful dragoman .

		The book itself has a plump , prosperous , and pleasing air , eminently befitting the readable contents .

		In bis preliminary note Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	claimed for his volume `` the saving grace of making no political comment upon Egyptians '' ; but by the time of the fourth appendix he quotes with evident glee the text of M r. Roosevelt 's '' great speech on
Egypt	LOCATION	at the Guildhall . ''

		With this he brings us to our third
Egypt	LOCATION	, which is the real theme of Mr.
Duse Mohamed	PERSON	's mili - tant volume .

		The author is the son of an Egyp - tian officer and a Nubian mother , and '' since
1884	DATE	has practically resided in
England	LOCATION	, where he began his education in
1876	DATE	. ''

		He takes up his work in the present volume with '' Ismail the Magnificent , '' and gives a history of
Egypt	LOCATION	, with a running comment , from that period to the present .

		He is a thoroughgoing Nationalist , and his book may be strongly recommended to all readers who wish to examine that side of a very difficult problem .

		Some will believe that Mr.
Mohamed	PERSON	frequently weakens his own case by over-straining or by irrelevance .

		For in - stance , he evidently wishes to suggest that the murderer of
Boutros Pasha	PERSON	was unfairly con - victed , because the Egyptian doctors differed from the English in holding that the victim died from the operation rather than from the wound ; and the much-discussed Guildhall speech of Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, `` a globe-trotting and scribbling in - terloper , '' goads him into a virulent attack on the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This onslaught may or may not be deserved ; but it can scarcely be said to bear on the question of Egyptian Nationalism , nor is it likely to make friends for the cause either in
America	LOCATION	or
England	LOCATION	.

		A leading Na - tionalist , to whom the reviewer became deeply indebted while in
Egypt	LOCATION	, once stated that their prominent writers generally injured their cause before they reached the end of a book ; and he seems to have been right .

		It would really be an easy task to write plausibly in favor of Na - tionalism by appealing to the general sympathy felt by mankind toward the aspirations of any people , and by dwelling upon certain undeniable mistakes of the
Kn	ORGANIZATION	^ lish Controlling body , as in the Denshawai affair .

		But invariably the pub - lishing partisans allow their emotions to carry tin-in into argument * that are invalid and po.i - tions that are untenable .

		However , our author errs no more seriously than the majority of his co-workers ; and his arraignment of Great
Bri	PERSON	- tain is well worth reading .

		One of his most entertaining chapters treats of '' The People of
Egypt	LOCATION	, '' butev.-n In - re his opportunity to make converts is lost by the tendencies to which \ \ - have referred .

		In writing for prejudiced
Kn	ORGANIZATION	- glish or Americans , and we are hopeles-ly prejudiced on the marriage question , an ad - vocate does not strengthen his case by going out of his way to insist that `` a religious system which equalizes the status of several wivep , and which specially insists on the hushand treating each wife with the same kindness and consid - eration , by placing each wife on a basis of equality , makes for a higher standard of morality than the evidently galling monogamy of the West . ''

		Similarly , we are hard to convince that '' Science is the Life of Islam , '' at least in our comprehension of the word science .

		The reviewer is not only a lover of the Orient , but a strong advocate of peaceful national develop - ment the world over , wherever it is possible ; yet he can not feel that the supporters of Egyp - tian self-government make a strong showing at present .

		However , it is to be hoped that both in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	a patient and careful hear - ing will be given to all such genuine enthusiasts as the author of * In the Land of the Pharaohs . ''

		As a closing word , it should be urged that
Egypt	LOCATION	is well worth seeing and knowing .

		If the American traveller would give even a single intelligent month to the
Nile Valley	ORGANIZATION	, he would be not less delighted than surprised at the rich - ness of his gleanings .

		In the presence of
Karnak	LOCATION	or
Philae	LOCATION	, or the Tombs of the Kings , he must not expect the rhapsodic raptures felt , or at any rate described , by such veteran thrillers as Loti or I lichens : but he may experience a gen - uine tugging at the heartstrings that will leave its effect forever .

		He must not look for the never-ending variety and brooding charm of the real East as found in
India	LOCATION	; but at any rate he will discover enough of the Orient to afford a vivid contrast to his own western world .

		And if one may not demand that thirty days shall shed final light on the vexed problem of British control or national self-government , one may see many significant indications to help toward an intelligent conclusion .

		But the implied ad - vice that one should read widely and studiously before his visit , would obviously not be needed here .

		The work reveals a keen observer and skilful recorder of the animal life of the northern wilderness whose facile pen enlivens the narrative of camp routine or oft-repeated story of successful chase or stalk of the moun - tain sheep , caribou , moose , or grizzly bear , amid crags and snowfields above timber-line or in forest fastnesses .

		Photographs of his trophies magnificent bighorn rams , taken as they lay victims of his cunning and marksmanship abound in the book .

		The author is primarily a sportsman , and defends the bloody and ruth - less extermination of these superb animals on the ground of his love of nature ! ''

		The hunter-sportsman is a strange combination , possessed by the fascination of hunting and killing the animals that he loves .

		... I never knew a true hunter , be he the rough pioneer or the cultured man , who did not have an intense fondness for the wild animals , a strong interest in studying them and protecting them , and also a desire to alleviate and prevent their suffering ; yet there still persists his paradoxical love of hunting and killing them ... The time may come when most of us will undertake to work , endure , and suffer the hardships of the wilderness , prompted only for love of it for its own sake .

		But to many of us , in our present state , hunting prevents the mere contemplative indul - gence in the beautiful from producing effeminateness . ''

		later generations .

		The plea that the sports - man 's bloody business is a necessary panacea for effeminateness in lovers of the wilderness and mountain heights , seems inconclusive if not indeed immoral .

		Some very illuminating observations are recorded in this book concern - ing the keenness of the power of scent and its dominance over vision in the controlling be - havior of these wild and timid creatures of the crags , as well as some practical and seemingly well-founded criticisms of
Thayer	PERSON	's theory of concealing coloration as applied to these ani - mals in their native environment .

		The book has good maps , scientific appendixes , colored plates after paintings by the artist
Rungius	PERSON	made in the field , and abundant and generally admirable illustrations -LRB- barring those of the carcasses -RRB- picturing the scenery of mountain and stream , the trophies of the hunt , and the features of camp-life in the wilderness .

		The havoc which man plays with the animal life of the land is exceeded , if possible , by his exploitation of the mammals of the sea .

		A very clear idea of the nature and extent of this whole - sale slaughter can be gained from Mr.
David Moore Lindsay	PERSON	's '' Voyage to the Arctic in the
Whaler Aurora	LOCATION	, '' which recounts the experiences of a surgeon-naturalist on a trip from
Dundee	ORGANIZATION	to the seal fisheries of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	and a whaling cruise in
Greenland	LOCATION	waters .

		The
Aurora	LOCATION	took 28,150 seals on this cruise , and the annual yield of these fisheries is from 300,000 to 600,000 seals .

		Improved methods in capture and more rigorous search for the booty have led to a grad - ual falling off in the catch , as in the case of the whale fisheries , though petroleum and the elec - tric light are in part responsible for the decline of the latter .

		The author gives a very interest - ing and extremely vivid account of the daily routine on a whaler , and relates many an ex - citing tale of adventure and disaster amid the storms , the darkness , and the drifting ice , in the midst of which the hardy race of fisher-folk ply their venturesome trade and win a meagre and fluctuating reward for their labors .

		Additional interest attaches to this work because of the fact that the ``
Aurora	LOCATION	'' in the cruise here narrated took part in the search for the ill-fated Greely Expedition .

		The book is handsomely illustrated with over sixty reproductions from photographs .

		It is replete with information pertaining to actual operations in the whaling and sealing industries , and abounds in whaler 's lore .

		The portrayal of the natural history of the tiger , king of the Indian jungle , is the aim of Mr.
S. Eardley-Wilmofs	PERSON	'' The Life of a Tiger . ''

		50 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, It takes the form of a biographical sketch , into which fanciful outline has been woven the ex - periences and observations of one evidently familiar at first hand with the sport of tiger hunting and the varied and interesting life of the Indian jungle .

		The work is exceptionally well written , and is free from those exaggera - tions , sentimentalities , and forced anthropo - morphisms , which not infrequently niar the efforts of those who seek to reveal the life of the wilds or to stimulate the reader 's interest in natural history .

		One feels that it is a real tiger in an actual jungle whose vicissitudinous life and sad end the author relates .

		The numerous artis - tic pen-sketches and photographs illustrative of the life of the jungle are worthy of the text .

		A somewhat matter-of-fact and circumstan - tial account of the mammals to be seen in most well-stocked zoological gardens is to be found in Mr.
W. P. Westell	PERSON	's '' The Animals and their Story . ''

		He assorts his menagerie , accord - ing to the nature of the habitats of the animals composing it , into denizens of the forest and jungle , of the plains and deserts , of the hills and mountains , and the prowlers of the
night	TIME	.

		This division leads to some incongruity , for we find the American timber-wolf treated as a part of the fauna of the plains and deserts , the wa - piti as belonging to the hills and mountains , and the beaver as a prowler of the
night	TIME	.

		The work is descriptive in character , and is supplemented by apt quotations from authorities on matters of interest or mooted questions such , for ex - ample , as the non-protective character of the striping of the zebra .

		A very valuable feature of the work lies in the hundred or more excellent photographs , by Mr.
W. S. Berridge	PERSON	, of ani - mals from life , some of which are indeed most happy poses quite free from straining bars or paddocks which detract from the aesthetic value of certain otherwise effective pictures .

		The eight colored plates are happy in design but in - effectively executed .

		The book will be a valu - able addition to the reference libraries of our schools whose pupils have access to a zoological garden .

New York	LOCATION	:
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Archer arrived in that city , commissioned by `` Scribner 's Magazine '' to collect all available data for determining , if possible , not whether
Ferrer	PERSON	's views were reasonable , not whether
Ferrer	PERSON	's life was a useful one , not whether
Ferrer	PERSON	had in the course of his life been guilty of crime , but simply and solely whether In - was proved guilty of the offense for which he lost his life .

		It is true that all of the points sug - gested are touched on incidentally ; but as to the main purpose of the investigation , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	arrives at the unhesitating conclusion that tin - judgment was absolutely unwarranted by the evidence .

		Born in
1859	DATE	, within a few miles of the scene of his death , beginning life as a railway clerk .

		Ferrer removed to
Paris	LOCATION	in
1885	DATE	, and gained a livelihood by acting as translator , copyist , and teacher of Spanish , until he succeeded in per - suading an elderly maiden lady to leave him her fortune .

		The legitimacy of the means used to accomplish this end have nothing to do with the case , although Mr.
Archer	PERSON	is of the opinion that there was nothing so reprehensible in them as has sometimes been assumed .

		He had quar - relled with his wife -LRB- his daughters agree that the fault was principally if not entirely hers -RRB- , had separated from her , and , not being able to secure a divorce , had nevertheless lived succes - sively with three other women .

		Such conduct is unquestionably open to criticism , especially from the point of view of Anglo-Saxon morality ; but it seems very distantly related to the question of his death , his Clerical critics to the contrary notwithstanding .

		Somewhat more to the point , however , is the fact that he had early become an anarchist , that he was a very active propagandist of subversive doctrines , that he maintained a school in
Barcelona	LOCATION	where anti-religious and an ti - governmental doctrines were taught , and , more than all this , that he had actually cham - pioned violent means of resisting existing insti - tutions .

		But all evidence of a belief in the efficacy of violence comes from writings which appeared at least seventeen years before his death , while proof is abundant that during the lastyears of his life he placed his relianceentirely in education as a means to the enlightenment which will eventuate in a peaceful revolution , and deprecated all attempts at abbreviating the process .

		The assertion of his enemies that he had decided that the Spani-h nation had been sufficiently educated by
July , 1909	DATE	, is too puerile to deserve an answer .

		It is curious to note that Mr.
Archer	PERSON	has not found evidence of the complicity of a single one of
Ferrer	PERSON	's pupils
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 51 in the excesses of the '' Red Week '' at
Barce	LOCATION	- lona .

		But our theme is the trial itself .

		During the
last week of July	DATE	the population of
Barcelona	LOCATION	rose in open revolt because of the calling out of reservists for the unpopular Moroccan war .

		Thirty churches were burned , and the city was in a state of absolute anarchy for sixty hours .

		Troops were called in from other parts of the country , and the revolution put down with consid - erable bloodshed , most of it lost by the inhabit - ants -LRB- so that if the rioters were , as the prosecutor represented in his plea , `` drunk with blood , '' ' it must have been their own that intoxicated them -RRB- .

		Then
Francisco Ferrer	PERSON	, who lived near
Barcelona	LOCATION	and had for some years been carrying on in the city itself somewhat sporadically , it is true , -LRB- not because of any lack of consecutive energy on his part , but because the authorities had fits of nervousness -RRB- a radical school and publish - ing business , and who was generally regarded by his peasant neighbors in the country and his Clerical enemies in the city as a heretic of Satanic impulses and almost Satanic powers , was arrested and tried for inciting and leading a rebellion whose leaders seem really to have been almost as completely out of sympathy with him as his prosecutors were .

		Of numerous strange circum - stances attending his arrest , perhaps the strangest is that before the case was tried , and consequently before anyone had data for deciding whether the arrest had any justification , his captors were rewarded by the government , one with `` the Order of Isabella the Catholic '' a very appro - priate testimonial fortheapprehenderof a heretic the others with medals and sums of money .

		And now comes the hearing , which is given in great detail in Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's volume , with translations of all testimony and all documents which came up for discussion .

		In his presenta - tion of the evidence , Mr.
Archer	PERSON	makes a great show of impartiality , but of course finds it utterly impossible to remain unmoved in the face of so sickening a record of judicial murder .

		That he at least came , in the course of his investigation , to have another purpose than the merely objective statement of fact , is shown by such admissions as that '' I have refrained from inquiring too closely into details , because ... the whole truth ... must not yet be published '' -LRB- p. 151 -RRB- .

		But his caution presumably does not affect the accuracy or completeness of his version of the proceedings at the trial .

		Ferrer was convicted by a military tribunal , because under the Spanish law an offense against the
Army	ORGANIZATION	must be tried by the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, by a colonel , that is , who is only a temporary and im - provised judge , hence an incompetent one , with counsel who suffer the same disabilities , and in a ridiculously short time .

		Ferrer 's trial lasted five hours .

		His attorney had had twenty-four hours to study the case and was allowed one hour for his plea .

		The prisoner was dead in ninety - six hours from the time his hearing began a record of promptness which it would be hard to duplicate in modern criminal annals .

		It is sometimes a disadvantage to be cele - brated and to have all eyes upon one .

		Thus ,
Ferrer	PERSON	, who had decided during
this year of 1909	DATE	to publish a Spanish edition of Prince
Kropot	PERSON	- kin 's last book , sent 900 francs to
Barcelona	LOCATION	for '' La Grande Revolution , '' which was inter - preted by the police to mean that he had financed the riots .

		An article of his publication entitled '' Le Dynamisme Atomique '' was assumed by the authorities to be a treatise on dynamite ; and a translation of
Poe	PERSON	's '' Raven '' was seen to be clearly anarchistic , since the author had set a '' bust of Pallas '' just above his '' chamber door . ''

		-LRB-
Pallas	PERSON	was the anarchist who threw a bomb at
Marshal Martinez y Campos	ORGANIZATION	in
1893	DATE	-RRB- .

		The evidence presented falls under four heads .

		There are , first , expressions of unsupported opinion and hearsay .

		Thus ,
Colonel Ponte of the Guardia Civil	ORGANIZATION	asserts that
Ferrer	PERSON	was active in riots which occurred in the villages of Masnou and Premia , basing his assertion on confidences whose author or authors he is not at liberty to reveal .


Jimenez Moya	PERSON	states that in his opinion the rebellion started with
Ferrer	PERSON	.

		Verdaquer
Callis	PERSON	makes a similar statement on the strength of intelligence which he has no means of verify - ing .


Emiliano Iglesias	PERSON	believes , as does
Baldo	PERSON	- mero
Bonet	PERSON	.


Garcia Magalon	PERSON	was told by a jour - nalist named
Pierre	PERSON	that he had heard it said .

		Second is a mass of irrelevant accusation .

		Lorenzo Ardid states that
Ferrer	PERSON	left a cafe sud - denly on the afternoon of the first day of the rioting , because certain apologists of authority were present .

		Two soldiers saw a man in a blue suit and a straw hat in a group of people on a public square .

		Francisco
Domenech	PERSON	says that
Ferrer	PERSON	told him that he had prepared an address to the government demanding the cessation of embarkation for
Africa	LOCATION	; and so on .

		Third is matter which if substantiated would have a certain weight .

		Most important under this head is the testimony of the journalist Colldefons , who saw Ferrer '' leading a group '' during the rioting .

		But
Colldefons	PERSON	had never seen Ferrer before , and identified him only from a photograph he had seen of him .

		He saw him 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, `` between seven-thirty and eight-thirty in the evening , '' hence l > y the tive light of the street-lamps .

		If we take this statement in con - nection with
Domenech	PERSON	's evidence that Fem-r walked home with him the night before , eleven miles out from
Barcelona	LOCATION	, reaching home at five o'clock in the
morning	TIME	, and if we remember that there were no trains running that day , it would seem very unlikely that
Ferrer	PERSON	was leading a group '' in
Barcelona	LOCATION	at seven-thirty that even - ing .

		But a group of Republicans from the vil - lages of Masnou and Premia de Mar agree that
Ferrer	PERSON	urged the proclamation of the Republic , and tried to incite to convent-burning in those villages during the Red Week .

		The evidence of these gentlemen is perhaps rendered a little dubious by the fact that they had all themselves been imprisoned for sedition and were testifying to save their own skins .

		Lastly , we have the documentary evidence the manuscript proclamation of
1892	DATE	which we have already hinted at , and which has no nec - essary bearing on conditions in
1909	DATE	, and a dilapidated type-written manifesto which the police claim to have found in
Ferrer	PERSON	's house a month after the riots , a paper containing three letters inserted in ink -LRB- a '' t '' and a '' ba '' -RRB- which the handwriting experts say '' might have been written by
Ferrer	PERSON	. ''

		Ferrer 's own evidence was not flawless .

		He coutradicts himself on several minor points , and fails to tell what later investigation has shown to be the whole truth with regard to several others .

		But this reticence and uncertainty can be adequately explained by his anxiety not to implicate others .

		And thus a narrow and fanatical mediocrity , of excellent intentions , who had perhaps done some good in the world , for his school , with all its faults , was better than the inexpressible State schools , was persecuted and done to death for insufficient cause , and thus a second-rate intelli - gence who would scarcely have been known out - side his own city was crowned with martyrdom ; thus the
Spanish Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, which it is no disparagement of the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	in gen - eral to qualify as one of the rottenest institutions in existence , dealt itself such a blow as its clev - erest enemy could scarcely have given it ; thus a ministry fell and an uncertain monarchy tilted a degree further from stable equilibrium .

		It is not only Christian martyrs whose blood bears fruit .

		Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's book is a conscientiously accu - mulated mass of evidence rather than a narra - tive .

		It might have IM-CII considerably smaller .

		and it might have been > ' .

		I > \ > T to follow with a somewhat different arrangement : but such as it is , it will probably remain for English - speaking readers the best and completest source of information on a subject which has consider - able interest and a certain historical importance .

		THE DIAL 53 Who had knelt in the Holy Place And had drunk the incense-air , Till her soul to seek God 's face Leapt like fire . ''

		There are many such personal tributes in the collec - tion , but none more heartfelt and tender than that inscribed to
Sophie Jewett	PERSON	, of which one of the stanzas may be given : '' Thou art not of the shadows , ah , not thou , Our Dryad soul , the soul of
April	DATE	woods Where flames of color , caught from bough to bough , And winds of fragrance blend beatitudes .

		Not in the withered groves whose phantoms follow Like drifted leaves the feet of Proserpine , Not in the whispering midnights dim and hollow , Shall love re-capture that lost grace of thine ; Beauty and light are with thee where thou art ; We grope thy pathway by the haunted heart . ''

		These bits , which are all that we may quote , give but a faint idea of the wealth of the volume as a whole .

		Thus brought together , the work of Miss
Bates	PERSON	may be clearly seen to entitle her to a place in the front rank of our American women who are also poets .

		The high rank of another of these women Miss
Josephine Preston Peabody	PERSON	hardly needs to be asserted since the success of '' The
Piper	ORGANIZATION	, '' and there is no surprise for us , no need for revaluation , in her new book , `` The Singing Man . ''

		The deep - est of social sympathy is felt in the titular poem , whose thought is that of '' those unnumbered who pay all the heavier cost of life , to live and die without knowledge that there is any Joy of Living . ''

		The toiler sings no more , for the skies are dark above him , and his eyes must be fixed upon the task which gains for him his bread .

		It is the poet who must voice his inarticulate cry . ''

		Oh , in the wakening thunders of the heart , The small lost
Eden	ORGANIZATION	, troubled through the
night	TIME	, Sounds there not now , forboded and apart , Some voice and sword of light : Some voice and portent of a dawn to break ?

		Searching like God , the ruinous human shard Of that lost
Brother-man Himself	PERSON	did make , And Man himself hath marred ? ''

		It sounds !

		And may the anguish of that birth Seize on the world ; and may all shelters fail , Till we behold new Heaven and new Earth Through the rent Temple-vail !

		When the high-tides that threaten near and far To sweep away our guilt before the sky , Flooding the waste of this dishonored Star , Cleanse , and o'erwhelm , and cry ! ''

		Cry , from the deep of world-accusing wars , With longing more than all since Light began , Above the nations , underneath the graves , ' Give back the Singing Man ! ' ''

		This sense of the human tragedy , thrilled with the note of hopefulness , is found in many of the remain - ing pieces .

		We turn for relief to the sonnet called '' Noon at Psestum , '' which we are minded to take for a second quotation because it recalls the solemn joy of a
summer	DATE	noon of our own long years ago , spent in solitary communion with the temples and the hills and the sea . ''

		Lord of the Sea , we sun-filled creatures raise Our hands among the clamorous weeds , we too .

		Lord of the Sun , and of the upper blue , Of all To-morrow , and all yesterdays , Here , where the thousand broken names and ways Of worship are but shards we wandered through , There is no gift to offer , or undo ; There is no prayer left in us , only praise . ''

		Only to glory in this glory here , Through the dead smoke of myriad sacrifice ; To look through these blue spaces , blind and clear , Even as the seaward gaze of Homer 's eyes ; And from uplifted heart , and cup , to pour Wine to the Unknown God .

		We ask no more . '' ''

		The Overture , and Other Poems '' is a volume of verse by Mr.
Jefferson Butler Fletcher	PERSON	. ''

		The Overture '' is a dramatic sketch in which
Richard	PERSON	,
Cosima	LOCATION	, and
Hans	PERSON	play the parts of Tristan ,
Iseult	LOCATION	, and
Mark	PERSON	, accompanied by Wagnerian music on the piano .

		When
Mark	PERSON	discovers the intrigue , he dashes cold water upon the guilty wife 's heroics .

		To the latter shrieking , '' Kill me ! ''

		he replies : '' Tut , tut !

		you have mistaken your stage-cue : I am no more King Mark than Iseult yon , Or Tristan he .

		I am a plain trousered man Whose wife fancies another trousered man . ''

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	also writes about other frail ladies , Lilith in particular , and usually in lines sawn into a semblance of blank verse .

		He can be quite sar - donic at times , as in '' The Children 's Hour . '' ''

		As we staid elders at the children 's hour Give out some riddle stale long , long ago , And listen amused , as down the eager row In turn each tries his -LRB- Edipean power ; So sit the indulgent gods ; before them our Most sapient masters of all those who know .

		Just now one
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	guesses .

		La Rochefoucauld Applauds ; and
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	nudges
Schopenhauer	PERSON	.

		Again the Delphian drawls his question ; ages To ages echo each response ; and men Painfully hearken .

		Meanwhile old
Vulcan	ORGANIZATION	nods ; The Cyprian plays
Minerva	LOCATION	, souls for gages ; Jove kisses Psyche ; Cupid pouts and then Peals the low belling laughter of the Gods . ''

		Sometimes the author is simple and natural , as in '' The Daisy Field , '' and then we like him best . ''

		Man looked upon the sky by night , And loved its tender azure , bright With many a softly beaming light ; And sang his Maker 's praises . '' '

		The sun declares Thee in Thy dread ; But from the stars Thy peace is shed ; Would that by day they comforted ! '

		God heard ; and made the daisies . ''

		All in a firmament of green Their golden orbs now float , serene , Twinkling with rays of silvery sheen , To comfort him who gazes . ''

		Mr.
Butler	PERSON	also makes beautiful translations from
Petrarch	LOCATION	and other Italian poets .

		Sonnets and lyrics upon the ancient theme of love , varied with an occasional ballad , make up the con - tents of Mr.
Joyce Kilmer	PERSON	's '' Summer of Love . ''

		We give a sonnet called '' Love 's Thoroughfare . ''

		54 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, '' As down the primrose path of Love I trod The golden
Sowers	PERSON	kissed my eager feet , The wayisde trees with singing birds were sweet , The
summer	DATE	air was like the smile of God .

		* Turn back ! '

		said one , ' escape the avenging rod .

		Soon thou the deathless flames of Hell shall meet . '

		Bnt I pressed on and thought of no retreat , Till soon with fire I was clothed and shod . ''

		But through the burning vales of Hell where flow The molten streams of bitterest despair , Made blind by pain I stumbled on , and lo !

		I stood at last in Love 's own perfumed air .

		So , having reached ray journey 's end , I know That God made Hell to be Love 's thoroughfare . ''

		The same thought is expressed , and with even more effectiveness , in `` The Morning Meditations of Frere Hyacinthus , '' which is too long for quotation .

		It is , of course , the familiar Paolo and
Francesca	PERSON	situa - tion , which has appealed to many a passionate poet since
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Benjamin	PERSON	Low sings of '' The Sailor Who Has Sailed , '' and brought back the freightage of experience , in the following strain : '' There is treasure-trove in my hands , but gold I bring not back with me ; There are songs on deck and in the hold , Bnt no wild minstrelsy . '

		I have dreamed the dream of the unknown sea ; I have sailed from the sightless shore ; I have looked in the eyes of reality , And I am young ... no more . '' ''

		The Vigil-at-Arms '' is a fine poem of some length , revealing the inmost soul of the
night	TIME	- watcher , its alternating moods of doubt and hopefulness , as the darkness wanes and the dawn draws near .

		These are the closing stanzas : I am afraid , Lord , is it thither thou Would ` st have me go ?

		I am afraid , and would wend backward now Where violets grow : My heart is fickle for the fields , I yearn Once more at eve to see my windows burn ; Once more , ah , let me , down old paths to turn , I love them so . ''

		Nay ! '

		t is the morrow , yonder leaded panes No more are dim With dark-browed infidels , but are the fanes Of seraphim ; And holy saints and warriors are dight With jewelled colors flaming in their flight , And out of heaven , wrapt in lovely light , The rafters swim . ''

		It is the morrow , Lord , the sweet airs blow Up the long nave , And plight the day 's full troth , yet ... ere I go , One thing I crave : Thou that art death , and ridest on a sword ; Thou that art love , upon a cross adored ; Thou that art life , and life eternal , Lord ... Let me be brave ! ''

		The high spirituality of these verses is found in many other pages of the volume , and is perhaps the most distinctive note of the whole collection .

		Mr.
John Vance Cheney	PERSON	, who has become once more a poet of
California	LOCATION	, bringing back to his old - time haunts a store of rich reflection and ripe experi - ence , makes us realize anew the wealth of poetical material offered by the natural beauty , the Indian legendry , and the romantic history of the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		His lines Before the Portrait of Padre Junipero '' may be taken to exemplify this offering of
California	LOCATION	verse . ''

		Faithful the nameless radiance still Upon these features ; never dies The light that did his spirit till .

		The halt priest with the heavenly eyes . ''

		It lamped his feet through the long night .

		He walked where now the ruins are , 111 - ' one unbroken mother-light Running from roses to the star . ''

		His heart-beat was the
Mission	ORGANIZATION	chime ; The lowly leader keeps his place .

		The stars will wear it while they climb , The light upon this friar 's face . ''

		Mr.
Cheney	PERSON	's volume is called '' At the Silver Gate , '' and is beautifully illustrated by many photographs .

		Simple sentiments and thoughts , embodied in unpretending verse , are offered us by the '' New Poems '' of Mr.
Stephen Coleridge	PERSON	.

		We choose ''
Laus Amori	PERSON	'' for our quotation . ''

		Love wisely if you have the wit Nor suffer it beyond control , Love as the angels if you can Let passion sanctify the soul . ''

		Love while the blood throbs in the veins , Love while the rosy lips are pure , Love while the breath of life is strong While love 's long ecstasies endure . ''

		Love in the morning 's pageantry , In the fierce sun 's creative light ; Love in the
evening	TIME	's yielding hour , And in the sacramental night . ''

		Love while the earth lasts underneath And the great firmament above .

		Love to the deeps of time and space , For love is God , if God be love ! ''

		Mr.
Coleridge	PERSON	has a prefatory note in which he tells us how his verses came to be first published in this country , and , incidentally , that our heart is in the right place in spite of the fact that we countenance the antics of the spelling deformers .

		It may divert a youthful and irreverent press to play fantastic tricks before high heaven with tin - spelling of our
august	DATE	and glorious speech , but the consecrated phrases that well up from the beating heart of our race telling of freedom , honour , love , mercy , and peace appeal instantly to something common to us all . ''

		Mr.
John Drinkwater	PERSON	's '' Poems of Men and Hours '' are grave and decorous compositions , cun - ningly fashioned , and appealing to the reflective mind .

		`` The Soldier '' is a favorable example . ''

		The large report of fame I lack , And shining clasps and crimson scars , For I have held my bivouac Alone amid the untroubled stars .

		THE DIAL 55 '' My battlefield lias known no dawn Beclouded by a thousand spears ; I 've been no mounting tyrant 's pawn To buy his glory with my tears . ''

		It never seemed a noble thing Some little leagues of land to gain From broken men , nor yet to fling Abroad the thunderbolts of pain . ''

		Yet I have felt the quickening breath As peril heavy peril kissed My weapon was a little faith , And fear was my antagonist . ''

		Not a brief hour of cannonade , But many days of bitter strife , Till God of his great pity laid Across my brow the leaves of life . ''

		A group of tributes to the poets
Swinburne	PERSON	,
Meredith	PERSON	,
Watson	PERSON	, and
Hardy	PERSON	is one of the most pleasing features of this modest volume . ''

		The Wanderer , and Other Poems , '' by Mr.
Henry Bryan Binns	PERSON	, is graciously heralded by a frontispiece photogravure of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	's '' Birth of Venus . ''

		This provides the titular poem a dialogue between the
Earth Spirit	ORGANIZATION	and the Winds with its theme .

		It is the Earth Spirit who asks , '' What car is this ye blow ?

		And what is this white Blossom of the cool grey Sea That worshipping ye hasten Her , and throw Flowers after Her in glee ?

		And wherefore is she inwardly so bright That , all and every whit , Her body with delight Illumined is , and like a pearl is it ? ''

		And tell me , tell me , wherefore are Her eyes Purposeful , infinite , Transcending any thought , As though unto the Sea the streams had brought , From the mountains where they rise , High ultimate passion Of tempest and of stress , Out of its wonder , in the deeps , to fashion This loveliness ? ''

		Mr.
Binns	PERSON	is not solely preoccupied with the world of fancy ; the world of men also engages his atten - tion , particularly in '' The Building of the City , '' a longish poem from which we make this excerpt : '' To every citadel of wrong Her stones cry out a battle-song ; She is so wrought of manly stuff The nations have not power enough To silence her : her heart is free From any fear of any : She Can take the world 's assaulting shock Builded so on the Living Rock . ''

		I see the city being wrought Upon the rock of Living Thought ; Upon her rising walls I look , And every stone is like a book Of many milk-white pages , fair Imprinted , with a loving care ; While on each lovely page is set Word of a wisdom lovelier yet . ''

		Mr.
Binns	PERSON	's pages are few , but they are like the pages to which the stones of his city are likened touched with distinction and the gleam of the ideal .

		Sir
Arthur Doyle	PERSON	has picked up the Kipling banjo , and twangs it to much the same effect as its original possessor .

		Sometimes the tune is serious : '' God guard our Indian brothers , The Children of the Sun , Guide us and walk beside us , Until Thy will be done .

		To all be equal measure , Whate'er his blood or birth , Till we shall build as Thou hast willed O'er all Thy fruitful Earth . ''

		Sometimes the tune is jocular : ''
Eighty Tommies	ORGANIZATION	, big and small , Grumbling hard as is their habit . '

		Say , mate , what 's a Bunerwal ? ' '

		Somethin' like a bloomin ' rabbit . ' '

		Got to hoof it to
Chitral	LOCATION	! ' '

		Blarst ye , did ye think to cab it ! '

		Eighty Tommies , big and small , Grumbling hard as is their habit . ''

		We are particularly taken with the story of ''
Bendy	ORGANIZATION	's Sermon . ''

		Bendy was a '' converted '' prize-fighter , who took to preaching at revival meetings .

		On one occasion , his hearers chaffed him beyond endurance , and this is what followed : '' Then
Bendy	ORGANIZATION	said , ' Good Lord , since first I left my sinful Thou knowest that to Thee alone I 've given up my days , But now , dear Lord ' and here he laid his Bible on the shelf ` I 'll take , with your permission , just five minutes for myself . ' ''

		He vaulted from the pulpit like a tiger from a den , They say it was a lovely sight to see him floor his men ; Right and left , and left and right , straight and true and hard , Till the Ebenezer Chapel looked more like a knacker 's yard . ''

		A '' lovely sight '' it must have been indeed !

		Sir
Arthur	PERSON	gives us much variety in this volume , albeit its compass is small .

		We commend `` Shakespeare 's Expostulation '' to readers in whose bonnet the Baconian bee has buzzed .

		The little pieces that Lady
Alfred Douglas	PERSON	has called '' The Inn of Dreams '' are butterflies or hum - ming-birds of verse flitting from one flower of fancy to another to extract from each a drop of honeyed thought .

		This drop is called '' Daffodil Dawn '' : '' While I slept , and dreamed of you ,
Morning	ORGANIZATION	, like a princess , came , All in robe of palest blue ; Stooped and gathered in that hour From the east a golden flower , Great and shining flower of flame ... Then she hastened on her way Singing over plain and hill While I slept and dreamed of you Dreams that never can come true ... Morning at the gates of Day , Gathered Dawn , the daffodil . ''

		Such verse is charming , but futile just good enough to occupy an idle moment or a nook in some magazine .

		The lady who signs herself ''
Dolf Wyllarde	PERSON	'' has a pretty talent in verse-making , as readers of the 56 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, songs in her novels have long since discovered .

		Her '' Verses '' now published have a fairly wide range , from songs of passion to impressions of travel .

		They are a little hectic at times , and exhibit a soul that seems to be still seeking for anchorage .

		These stanzas on '' Lower
London	LOCATION	'' are good enough to be almost impressive : '' Beneath His quiet skies His quiet skies !

		We shriek and die , And watch the morning and the ere go by , And shudder to this God , who does not heed our cries . ''

		We could bear all things were He less divine He does not care !

		He set us in this toil of our despair , And straight withdrew Himself , and gave no hint of His design . ''

		Grey pall of sullen cloud and sapphire dim Are all we meet , Until His sunset breaks along the street And turns our sordid City to a fleeting proof of Him . ''

		But then the cloud returns , the glory dies Then shriek and curse In gaslit hells that show them nothing worse Than open night beneath His quiet skies ... His quiet skies ! ''

		Chicago by Mr.
Kenyon Cox	PERSON	, have been published under the title `` The Classic Point of View '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Classicism in the art of painting may seem anachronistic in these days of impressionists , post-impressionists , '' cubistes , '' and that other school which aims to represent the hu - man figure , not by cubes , but '' as a series of tri - angles . ''

		None the less , when we find critics writing to prove that this art of the present is real and vital , that it will become the art of the future , the need of striking some note of reaction in the direction of old-fashioned sanity is sufficiently obvious .

		This is what Mr.
Cox	PERSON	has set himself to do ; and in general he has done it admirably .

		He has given us a definite credo a detailed and explicit confession of artistic faith , '' which occasionally lapses into polemic as might be expected from the neces - sities of the case .

		After all , as
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	said , only an auctioneer can admire impartially all the schools of art ; and it must be confessed that our author dis - plays a surprising amount of self-control .

		In the face of great temptations to indulge in destructive irony , he keeps in the main to constructive criti - cism .

		He shows us how the classic tradition was lost , and what we must do to regain it ; for it is here in
America	LOCATION	, unhampered 1-y traditions of her own and not yet satiated by that classic beauty which has become an old story abroad it is line , our painter-critic believes , that the world 's chance of a successful classical revival lies .

		THE 57 classic tradition .

		Chapters on Drawing , Light and Shade and Color , and a final discussion of tech - nique in general , complete the volume , which is rich in historical detail and presents an interesting if somewhat discursive picture of the evolution of painting under the old masters .

		The book should be widely read , not only by the young artists for whom it was primarily intended , but by every art - lover who aspires to a deeper insight , and by every critic who has learned the vividness of the artist 's view-point when discussing his art .

		The volume is generously and aptly illustrated , although the plates are not inserted at the proper places in the text , and a worse fault the book has no index of proper names to facilitate reference .

		The '' Life and Memoirs of
John Churton Collins	PERSON	'' -LRB- Lane -RRB- leaves the reader here and there with a sense of inadequacy , though it is written frankly and in good taste by his son , Mr.
L. C. Collins	PERSON	.

		The subject of the memoir ap - pears not only as critic and essayist , but as inde - fatigable
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	lecturer , curious student of criminology , member of the
Murder Club	ORGANIZATION	and the
Ghost Club	ORGANIZATION	, and in many other activities .

		One bit of self-analysis deserves to be quoted : '' I can not call to mind a single human being who has had the slightest influence on me .

		My intense love of literature was inspired by no one , encouraged by no one , influenced by no one .

		It awoke suddenly and spontaneously my life , my deeper life , has been essentially and permanently solitary . ''

		This seems strange from a man who was so genial , and who had so many close personal and literary friends .

		Perhaps the most readable parts of the memoirs are those which record
Collins	PERSON	's acquaintance with more or less distinguished English authors .

		Readers who know the personalities of both men will be interested in his impressions of
Browning	PERSON	in
1881	DATE	: '' With
Browning	PERSON	I was miserably disappointed ; there was a marked vulgarity about him , particularly in his accent and in the tone of his voice , and a certain in - describable savour of sycophancy of a man eager to be of a grade to which he did not belong ; but the poet was there the poet 's keen eye the poet 's heart obvious in his remarks and descriptions : a sad , very thoughtful face , a great weight of thought over the eyes for the rest a commonplace face and a very commonplace manner , in the brow and the eye only sat genius : his conversation except when he was speaking of his reminiscences about Carlyle studiously commonplace . ''

		A story of the rupture between
Collins	PERSON	and
Swinburne	PERSON	deserves notice by the future historian of literary amenities .

		Collins , replying in the '' Athenaeum '' to some author who took a review of his works as a personal matter , re - marked that he had attacked
Swinburne	PERSON	's prose with the greatest severity , and that he and Swin - burne were still , as they had been for years , the closest of friends .

		Swinburne , it appeared , had never seen the attack .

		When he read it to ascer - tain the extent of his magnanimity , he was so in - censed that he broke off the intimacy , and appar - ently never really became reconciled .

		The critic who puts out a volume ofour ` fime ?

		dealing with contemporary writers deserves more thanks than he is likely to receive .

		Such a book is an invaluable source of information regarding men who are not yet enshrined or entombed in more formal works ; but from the first , every reader is sure to dissent from some of its judgments , and in time it is cited only as an illustration of the absurdities which all contemporary criticism is sure to commit .

		In `` Some American Story Tellers '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , Mr.
Frederic Taber Cooper	PERSON	presents essays on
Francis Marion Crawford	PERSON	,
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	,
Winston Churchill	ORGANIZATION	,

Gertrude Atherton	PERSON	,
Owen Wister	PERSON	,
Frank Norris	PERSON	, and
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	.

		This list must be given in full , since Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	nowhere tells his principle of selection , and it is hard to see why some of these authors were taken and others left .

		Many of the sketches originally appeared in magazine form , and this may account for a slightly unfortunate lack of uniformity in plan .

		A few give the essential facts of an author 's life , while others must be supple - mented by reference to '' Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	, '' or some other manual of contemporary biography .

		In some cases the plots of novels and tales are briefly summarized , in others the criticism implies that the reader already knows the author 's works .

		These , however , are minor defects .

		Mr.
Cooper	PERSON	has resisted the temptation , which besets a writer for a popular magazine , to reverse the old proverb and say only good of the living ; and he has made no attempt at smartness of treatment , or at the ex - ploitation of striking theories .

		His criticisms are the dignified application to each writer 's works of his own fairly definite idea of what modern fiction should be .

		His views will not find general accept - ance ; but his book is interesting to read , and not - withstanding its omissions it will occupy a place for the next ten years on the reference shelves of the student of American literature .

		To every reader who has any inter - SSfJKSS ?

		est \ n the Jiving stream of events that is passing so rapidly into
East	LOCATION	- ern history , we hasten to recommend Mr.
Lovat Eraser	PERSON	's ``
India	LOCATION	under
Curzon	PERSON	and After '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The well-known editor of '' The Times of
India	LOCATION	'' covers five hundred large pages in treating his theme ; but the subject matter is so important , the presentation so straightforward , and most of the conclusions so authoritative , that one is likely to bring in a charge of undue brevity rather than of pro- lixity .

		If the reader will remember that Mr.
Fraser	PERSON	58 THE DIAL -LSB-
Jan. 16	DATE	, frankly avows his admiration of Lord
Curzon	PERSON	's policy in general , there will be little need of further caution .

		Moreover , our individual admiration < > r dislike for Lord
Curzon	PERSON	should not interfere with our enjoyment or profit ; for the volume still offers a most valuable and entertaining survey of recent history and present conditions , and prepares us for an intelligent consideration of British rule under the reforms of Lord
Morley	PERSON	and the changes just an - nounced at the
Durbar	ORGANIZATION	.

		In pleasing contrast to ninety per cent of the current books on
India	LOCATION	, it em - bodies the thoughts and observations of an author deserving an audience .

		As a newspaper editor , Mr.
Eraser	PERSON	has had unusual opportunities for acquiring knowledge , and as a man of trained intelligence he has been able to profit by his information .

		He is a loyal Briton ; but , like the best of his countrymen , he is fully alive to defects in administration as well as to errors in general policy .

		It inspires confidence to read his strictures on '' the pernicious practice of government from hill-stations , '' or on the sacrifice of Indian interests to
Lancashire	ORGANIZATION	manufactures , just as it is a pleasure to note his genuine sympathy for Indian aspirations and his joy '' in great deeds worthily done '' by his compatriots .

		We can not even give the captions of the various chapters , much less criticise minor slips of presentation or adduce differences of opinion .

		But this matters very little ; for we should conclude by renewing our warm re - commendation of this timely and readable book by a thoroughly competent author .

		Development of There is much in Mr.Tucker
Brooke	PERSON	's our dramatic '' The Tudor Drama '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- to commend it to more than the special student of our literature .

		In the first place , the plan is excellent .

		Instead of carrying the drama through to its decay and death in the closing of the theatres in
1642	DATE	, when by a curious fiction the Elizabethan drama is said to end ; Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	ends the
Tudor	PERSON	drama with the last of the Tudors , or he does so with as much exactness as is possible in a work of this character .

		New conditions , especially those due to Puritan opposition , make really a new chapter of the
Caroline	PERSON	drama , so that the
Tudor	PERSON	drama has an independent unity .

		We have therefore in the work before us a treatment of the rise and consummate development of the greatest literature of the race .

		The drama is treated chronologically till adherence to chronology ceases to be a virtue , and then influ - ences and types form the headings of the chap - ters .

		If one wishes to follow the work of any one author through this period , it calls for considerable agility to jump from pastoral and romantic comedy to history play and to the drama of contemporary incident But in a book of this kind one is more interested in a study of types and the progress of dramatic expression .

		In the second place , Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	treats his subject with fine critical discrim - ination .

		He does not rehash worn-out opinions or long-accepted judgments , but he treats each theme with a freshness and an originality that make even a history of literature interesting .

		\ \ Y might just mention hi * plausible theory that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` purge '' -LRB- mentioned in `` The Return from Par - nassus '' -RRB- refers to a passage ` hat originally appeared in the version of '' Hamlet '' a * acted in Canihridge in 1601-2 , and was later omitted by
Heming	PERSON	and
Condell	PERSON	from the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	in order not to offend
Jonson	PERSON	.

		The theory has the merit of not being at present capable of direct refutation .

		Neither can it be at present proved .

		The bibliographieH at tin - close of every chapter are well chosen .

		A itudv of Recent discussions of standards of waget in the living and the amount of economic United stain .

		goods necessary to maintain a stand - ard of efficiency have led Professor
Scott Near	PERSON	ing of
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	to a consideration of '' Wages in the United States '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , from statistics covering the years from
1908	DATE	to
1910	DATE	.

		The lack of uniformity in gathering and tabulating wage reports , and in many cases the entire absence of any statistics at all , is recognized , and the conclusions are set down as by no means final although based on statistical proof which must stand until overthrown by additional studies .

		The statistics are taken from reports of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	-LRB- which are especially commended -RRB- ,
New Jersey	LOCATION	and
Kansas	LOCATION	, special wage reports of the telephone indus - try , of wages of women in
Illinois	LOCATION	department stores , of the
Bethlehem Steel Works	ORGANIZATION	investigation , of the
Bureau of Labor	ORGANIZATION	, and of the
Interstate Commerce Commission	ORGANIZATION	.

		The reports concerning average wages are shown to be incomplete , and in a measure inac - curate ; but they are alike in various States , and so approximately correct in showing that the average of wages is about the same in all sections of the country .

		The conclusion is given that in the terri - tory east of the Rockies and north of
Mason	ORGANIZATION	and
Dixon	PERSON	's line '' three-quarters of the adult males and nineteen-twentieths of the adult females actually earn less than
$ 600	MONEY	a year . ''

		Actual wages and proposed standards of living are not commensurate ; and while one may say that the statistics are not definite enough to afford very certain conclusions , the fact remains that such statistics as are available show a low average .

		While the book is perhaps not conclusive , it represents an honest effort to get at the actual facts .

		The book has the advantage of singleness of purpose and unity of subject .

		It attempts to explain , largely by means of hypothetical diagrams , the presumptive processes that go on within the nervous system and outwardly influence human behavior .

		THE DIAL 59 and theoretically .

		It is less clear to what extent this method may be carried and still remain profitable .

		To the hypothetical diagrams no exception can be taken , but only to their complexity and their detailed elaboration .

		One may naturally ask whether the resulting benefit is not dubious or even specious .

		This applies more particularly to the more quantita - tive and diagrammatic argument , and the mechanical analogies of resistance , power , energy , flux , and the like .

		Apart from this query , the volume serves to cover the ground .

		It may be that the interest in be - havior from this point of view is limited to students and professors of psychology .

		It is well that so acceptable a compendium of this cross-section of the fundamentals of behavior should be available .

		It is growing to be a commonplace 1 '' that n man is entitled to write of the Orient who has not lived under its brilliant sun for at least a quarter of a century .

		This exacting requirement is filled , with eleven years to the good , by
M. Pierre Ponafidine	PERSON	, Im - perial Russian Consul General in
Constantinople	LOCATION	, formerly occupying similar positions in various parts of
Persia	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	.

		To the average reader ,
M. Ponafidine	PERSON	's account of '' Life in the Moslem East '' a laudably descriptive title will afford constant instruction and lively entertainment .

		Every reviewer will especially commend the chapters that deal with the position of women , the Arab horse in its native land , and law proceedings in
Persia	LOCATION	.

		On the other hand , the student will note various annoy - ing inaccuracies , especially in the details of early
Mohammedan	DATE	history ; while the punctilious advo - cate of pure English and scrupulous proof-reading must pencil many regrettable slips , which may be explained in part by the distance separating the translator ,
Madame Emma Cochran Ponafidine	PERSON	, from the publishers .

		The book contains over four hundred generous pages of clear type , and more than forty excellent illustrations .

		THE DIAL 67
The Unpublished Works of Count Leo Tolstoy Publication	ORGANIZATION	in the
United States Authorized	ORGANIZATION	by Arrangement with His Heirs IT is said that in his later years
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	convinced himself that it was wrong to write fiction , and his duty to devote his whole energy to the expression of social , political , and moral ideas .

		Nevertheless , there were times when the instincts , the habits , and the genius of this master story-teller were too strong for his scruples , and he surrendered himself with unspeakable delight to the telling of tales .

		Wonderful stories , they are , too , founded , some of them , upon a great crisis of his life ; others upon his own intimate family experiences ; and they are told as only this giant among the novelists of the last century can tell them .

		But , although written , they were never published , the author resolutely sup - pressing all temptation to give them to the world .

		With his death , however , the ban was lifted , and in ''
HADJI MURAD	PERSON	, '' the latest novel by the author of ''
Anna Kare	PERSON	` nina , '' '' Resurrection , '' etc. , and in the other volumes there is presented to the American public for the first time the fruit of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's ripe old age .

		HADJI MURAD A Novel This remarkable novel centres around an intrepid Tartar chief , one
Hadji Murad	PERSON	, a character whom
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	knew personally , and who made a great impression upon him .

		The grim old warrior is wonderfully portrayed . ''

		Hadji Murad '' will occupy an important place in the world 's recent fiction as the first novel by
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	to be published since `` Resurrection , '' and the last written by this master hand .

		96 THE FUTURE OF LIBRARY SCIENCE .

		Has library management attained , in theory if not yet in practice , something like perfection , so that in the future little can be expected in the way of further development ?

		To the regu - lar attendant at library conferences , with their unavoidable discussions and rediscussions of old questions , and with their increasingly minute subdividing of the larger themes of interest in order to find some few details that have not yet been talked about and written about to the point of exhaustion , it may occasionally seem as if there were henceforth nothing to be done but to go back to one 's , post and stay there , doggedly keeping at the daily task of giving out books , answering questions , guiding the seeker for knowledge , and in general making the library under one 's care as useful as possible to the greatest possible number of persons .

		In any such moment of weariness , when library parliaments are inclined to appear flat , stale , and unprofitable , there is refreshment and stimulus in a backward glance at the progress of inven - tion and discovery , and in a brief contemplation of the curious and unexpected twists and turns that progress has taken .

		What soon arrests one 's attention is that the most important discoveries have commonly been made in fields every square inch of which had seemed at the time to be per - fectly familiar to mankind .

		To take a well - known example , the ordinary lock used on doors had been in use , with no radical modification , from the time of the early Egyptians up to the middle of the
last century before	DATE	it had occurred to anyone that the key of conventional pattern , with its cumbrous shank and other points of awkwardness , was quite unnecessarily clumsy .

		Then
Linus Yale	ORGANIZATION	gave to the world a lock that could be operated with a tiny strip of notched metal , and even a lock that needed no key at all , but onlya memory for a simple combination of numbers .

		Again , it was thought in
England	LOCATION	that the limit of rapid transit had been reached when the
London	LOCATION	and
Edinburgh	LOCATION	mail-coach service of
Johnson	PERSON	's time was so perfected that serious apprehensions were entertained lest such a rate of speed should prove injurious to the traveller 's health .

		But in little more than a century the world was to regard even the steam locomotive as a comparatively slow , old-fash - 76 THE DIAL |
Feb. 1	DATE	, ioned , uneconomical , and altogether faulty piece of mechanism , sure to be superseded in the near future .

		A cursory review of the history of mathe - matics a science which Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	has so brilliantly applied in one important branch of library work shows strikingly how the most epoch-making discoveries have a way of occur - ring where there had before seemed the least possibility of them .

		To the mathematicians of the third century B. c. , and indeed to subsequent mathematicians down to the seventeenth cen - tury A. i -RRB- .

		, Euclid probably seemed to have said the last word on the subject of geometry ; and then , one fortunate morning , as the philosopher
Descartes	PERSON	was lying awake in bed , there flashed upon him the idea of determining the position of a point by its linear coordinates , and the new field of coordinate geometry was opened , with its beautiful revelation of an unsuspected blood-relationship , so to speak , between the properties of number and those of space .

		Before that time , not the faintest con - ception of the modern science of higher mathe - matics could have been had even by expert mathematicians .

		Another instance suggests it - self : Menaechmus , a pupil of Plato and a tutor to Alexander the Great , had invented and elabo - rated the study of conic sections nineteen cen - turies before the birth of Kepler .

		The study had been pursued as a fascinating intellectual exer - cise , but without any thought of a possible ap - plication to concrete things .

		Also the science of astronomy had been brought by
Ptolomy	ORGANIZATION	, and fourteen hundred years later by
Copernicus	PERSON	, to a stage of considerable advancement , but with no understanding of the mathematical laws gov - erning the movements of the heavenly bodies .

		To
Kepler	PERSON	, who was both a mathematician and an astronomer , it was given to fit the two sciences together by applying the principles of conic sections , more especially of the ellipse , to the celestial phenomena , and to announce the famous three laws of planetary motion which every schoolboy now commits to memory .

		Following the history of mathematics down to the time of modern library science , we come upon a marriage of the two sciences that re - minds us of
Kepler	PERSON	's happy application of conies to astronomy .


Simon Stevinus	PERSON	of Bruges published his system of decimal notation in
1585	DATE	, the use of decimal fractions having been up to that time all but unknown , and probably not even faintly imagined by many mathematicians .

		Stevinus 's system was modified and reduced to the now current form by the English mathe - matician
Henry Briggs	PERSON	in
1617	DATE	.

		But more than two centuries and a half were still to elapse before anyone thought of applying this indefi - nitely expansible system of notation to the classi - fication of books , or indeed to the classification of any collection of objects .

		Whether the happy thought came to Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	one morning in bed , in the days of his
Amherst	LOCATION	librarianship , or whether he caught the idea among the book - shelves and while fretting over the inconven - iences and stupidities of a '' fixed location '' sys - tem , can not here be determined , and does not much matter , except that it would be pleasant to complete the parallel between him and
Descartes	LOCATION	.

		Suffice it for us that he did grasp the idea and applied it , so that some years later , at the con - vention of librarians in
London	LOCATION	at the time of the Queen 's Jubilee , the librarian of
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	felt himself justified in asserting that Mr.
Dewey	PERSON	's services to his profession had been greater than those of all previous librarians put together .

		To the mediseval reader of chained books in monastic libraries , what faintest notion could there ever have come of the modern Dewey-deci - malized library , with its Cutter author-marks , its highly-evolved and yet simplechargingsystem , its children 's room and story-hour , its branches and deposit stations , and , above all , its open shelves !

		Who knows but that we of the twen - tieth century may be living in a blindness equally complete as to the condition of public libraries of the year twenty-nine hundred and twelve ?

		If it be true , as it undoubtedly is , that each im - portant invention or discovery of the past has made possible an indefinite number of fresh ones in the future , why may it not be argued that the signal achievements in library science of the last half-century have advanced that science , not to the faultily faultless state of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's
Maud	PERSON	, but to a high plane of excellence whence far loftier flights now first become possible ?

		One circumstance at least counts strongly in favor of such a view .

		The great achievements in discovery and invention have been due to men of no narrow specialism .

		Newton ,
Descartes	LOCATION	,
Leibniz	PERSON	,
Kepler	PERSON	,
Copernicus	LOCATION	,
Galileo	ORGANIZATION	these were all men of far wider interests than might be indicated by the special services to science that have made their names household words .

		The '' scientific imagination '' so essential to pro- gress in discovery and invention flourishes best in the scientist who is least strictly routined to his one chosen department of study .

		What learned profession is there that calls for and develops a broader sweep of intellectual and practical interests than that of the librarian ?

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 Almost in a literal sense , he is obliged to know something of everything , and he is not likely to rest content until he knows everything of some - thing .

		Bristling thus with points of affinity , reacting to so countless a number of external stimuli , the modern librarian should have the alertness , the receptiveness , the responsiveness , necessary to him who would break new roads , lay open new kingdoms , and make fresh discoveries .

		The history of library science , therefore , is not a closed book ; there remain an indefinite num - ber of interesting chapters still to be written , which are not unlikely to prove even more sig - nificant and attention-compelling than any that have gone before .

		DICKENS AND THA CKERA YTHA CKERA Y AND DICKENS .

		It is a time of the centenaries of giants .

		Scarcely has the world ceased paying commemorative honors to
Lincoln	LOCATION	and
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Liszt	ORGANIZATION	,
Gladstone	PERSON	and
Greeley	PERSON	and de Musset , when it begins planning how most fitly to recall
Browning	PERSON	and
Rousseau	PERSON	and
Wagner	PERSON	.

		Between these groups stand two names forever coupled in the thoughts of the lover of En - glish fiction
William Makepeace Thackeray	PERSON	and
Charles Dickens	PERSON	.

		Last
July	DATE	brought with it the date which marked the even hundred years since he who was to create
Henry Esmond	PERSON	and Colonel
Newcome	PERSON	first made his appearance in oriental
Calcutta	LOCATION	.

		The present month brings a like anniver - sary of the advent of the literary parent of Oliver Twist and
Sidney Carton	PERSON	, in a dingy suburb of occi - dental
Portsmouth	LOCATION	.

		Each great in achievement , each close to our hearts , it is natural that the men - tion of either should call up the image of the other .

		Side by side they ran the race of life , with fame their common goal .

		Each '' arrived '' while yet young
Dickens	PERSON	with `` Pickwick '' at twenty-four ,
Thackeray	PERSON	at thirty-five with that most wonderful example of urban literature , `` Vanity Fair . ''

		Each died in his prime , untimely : Dickens at fifty-eight ,
Thackeray	PERSON	at fifty-two .

		They were alike in soundness , in sanity , in sweet - ness .

		They were about equal in powers of obser - vation , and nearly so in imagination .

		Both told absorbing stories in inimitable ways .

		Yet , as soon as one leaves such generalizations as these , the two are scarcely more to be compared than are Tour - guenie ` ff and Cervantes , or
Henry James	PERSON	and
Mark Twain	PERSON	. ''

		It is like comparing the ^ neid with the binomial theorem , '' says Prof essor
Peck	PERSON	; while Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's characteristically clever half-truth `` The world imposed on
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	imposed on the world '' suggests that `` contrast '' is a more accurate word to use in looking back across the years at these '' so truly loved , so long remembered , so sorely missed . ''

		Marked differences showed in their outward lives .

		Thackeray was of gentle birth and breeding , edu - cated at the
Charterhouse	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	; DickenSj lowly born , found such schooling as was to fit him for his future in the hurly-burly of the city streets and the over-hard tasks of grimy factories .

		Young
Thackeray	PERSON	, dabbling in art and letters , let a mod - erate fortune slip through his fingers ;
Dickens	PERSON	, when most other lads of his age were yet busied over childish things , was seriously at work to keep the family together a
David Copperfield	PERSON	trying to get a Micawber father out of the debtor 's jail .

		Thack - eray knew
France	LOCATION	and half the continent when scarce of man 's estate , and all his life travelled often and far ;
Dickens	PERSON	in his later years lectured and read in this country , but that is about all of his experiences of this sort .

		By nature and habit the one was a true cosmopolitan , the other a Londoner of Londoners .

		As
Emerson	PERSON	said of him in his `` English Traits , ''
Dickens	PERSON	wrote ''
London	LOCATION	tracts ... local and tem - porary in his tints and style , and local in his aims . ''

		Diversities such as these in the careers and traits of the two men naturally were evidenced in their literary work .

		Primarily ,
Thackeray	PERSON	was receptive ,
Dickens	PERSON	creative .

		The one , looking out on the world through club windows , drew the classes ; the other , studying human nature at close range and in the open , drew the masses .

		It was the characteristic difference between the shy , retiring aristocrat , and the self-confident , even pushing , democrat : the dif - ference to suggest the same thing in another way between Du Maurier and
Hogarth	PERSON	.

		From this , however , it is not to be implied that the
Thackeray	PERSON	canvasses were done at second-hand ; only
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	among his contemporaries surpassed him in realism , and Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	has just borne telling testi - mony to the tragic power which was his .

		Dickens 's tragedy , on the other hand , was melodrama , although among the best melodrama ever written .

		There was , indeed , more than a little of the `` yellow journalist '' in the man who had served his time with the imma - ture press of that day .

		It shows again in his pathos , which was wont to degenerate into sentimentalism : '' There is something of an alien salt in the fountain of his tears , '' writes Mr.
Lang	PERSON	.

		Thackeray 's pathos was effortless and inevitable , one packed phrase , and the lump was in your throat .

		At the opposite end of the thermometer of the emotions , one finds Dickens differing from
Thack	PERSON	- eray as a laugh differs from a smile .

		One is a mas - ter of humor ; the other , past - master of wit even if , at times , it is '' a most bitter sweeting , a most sharp sauce . ''

		Dean Hole once remarked of `` Wil - liam
Makepeace	PERSON	Goliah '' -LRB- to give him the name of Mr.
Quiller-Couch	PERSON	's bestowing -RRB- , '' He said so many good things that they trod down and suffocated each other '' ; and scores of instances suggest themselves .

		Walking with a friend , one day , in a street off the
Strand	LOCATION	, the sign '' Mutual Loan Fund Association '' appeared in a window . ''

		What do you suppose it means ? ''

		asked his companion ; and he who was really Titmarsh replied , `` Why , that they have no money , and lend it to each other . ''

		At another time , 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb.	DATE	.

		I ,
Thackeray	PERSON	chanced to leave the
Garrick Club	PERSON	with a man who was standing as his political opponent in an election to be held on the morrow , and who said , '' Good night , Mr.
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		May the best man win . '' ''

		I hope not , '' came the instant response .

		All of which is ; i.s unlike the Dickensian humor as a rapier is unlike a cutlass .

		Not that a sunshiny humor does not brighten many pages of those inim - itable works that began with the '' Boz '' sketches and closed with `` Our Mutual Friend , '' but it is more often the whimsical humor arising from oddity of sit - uation or individual action than the ready and unex - pected turn of thought ; more often the broad humor of exaggeration than the keen wit of suggestion .

		There can be little question that of the two men
Thackeray	PERSON	was the finer literary artist ; his style is well-nigh faultless .

		It was by cruder methods that
Dickens	PERSON	held his readers .

		On the other hand ,
Dickens	PERSON	was clearly the more sympathetic .

		His philosophy was all compact of kindliness , benevo - lence , joyousness ; while throughout the novels of his fellow-craftsman runs a more serious note , a more didactic strain , with reproof and warning heard more often than any promise of reward .

		Those who know the man , and thus never misunderstand the satire or the rarer cynicism which sharpen his pen , realize the genuinely sensitive humanity which lies so close beneath the surface , they feel strongly , as has been said by another , that Thackeray '' could not have painted ' Vanity Fair ' as he has unless Eden had been shining brightly in his inner eye . ''

		Yet even these must admit that
Dickens	PERSON	more nearly fulfilled the complete truth of
Thackeray	PERSON	's own dictum : '' If fun is good , truth is better , and love best of all . ''

		Though at first sight it may seem a contradiction of what has just been said , it is none the less true that
Dickens	PERSON	was almost wholly lacking in those in - definite but very real '' feminine '' traits which are to be recognized in
Thackeray	DATE	's mental make-up , essentially manly as he was .

		Dickens is the very type of the masculine , strong in resource , virile always .

		His creative capacity seems unlimited , so crowded is his stage with a long succession of figures , distinct , salient , memorable .

		It is often said that the majority of his portraits border on caricature , and that many are plainly such ; that he was con - tent to catch a striking likeness by exclusively select - ing and exaggerating a peculiarity which might mark a man but surely could not wholly represent him .

		Granting much truth in this -LRB- for
Boffin	PERSON	passes the limits of possibility , and
Sapsea	PERSON	goes beyond the bounds of even burlesque -RRB- , it remains simple truth that only the unapproachable
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in the whole range of English letters , has given the world more '' living '' characters .

		One is seldom misun - derstood when he refers to a
Portia	LOCATION	, a Shylock .

		; i
Regan	PERSON	, or an lago ; and in quite the same way we recognize a
Pecksniff	PERSON	in every hypocrite , and a Micawber in every procrastinator , every irrespon - sible optimist ;
Quilp	PERSON	is the personification of meanness and cruelty , Chuzzlewit of avarice and selfishness .

		Despite the number of his charming creations ,
Thackeray	PERSON	gave us but one name such as these , in
Becky Sharp	LOCATION	.

		In the matter of enduring vitality , one can not profitably pick and choose between
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	.

		Were proof of this needed , it would be forthcoming in the common delight of nine readers out of every ten in championing one against the other , though in this same debate
Dickens	PERSON	passes
Thackeray	PERSON	in what the critics call '' universality . ''

		His is by far the wider audience , even though it be less cultured than that which sits delighted at the feet of him who gave us
Barry Lyndon	PERSON	and Pen - dennis .

		However , such weighing and arraying of claims amounts to little more than intellectual diver - sion .

		The pros balance off with the cons at last , and leave us mindful chiefly of the store of pleas - ure and profit which we owe to both these greatest of our modern English story-tellers .

		So rich and splendid is their combined output that , if all other fiction and history and portraiture of their period were suddenly to be lost , they alone could measure - ably replace all with their wonderful composite picture of the early Victorian days .

		Lately it was
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	; just now it is
Dickens	PERSON	and
Thackeray	PERSON	.

		But we continue to read them both , and each continues to surpass the best of the '' best sellers . ''

		We are grateful that two such should have lived and written .

		We apply to both what
Carlyle	PERSON	once said of Boz : `` The good , the gentle , high-minded , ever - friendly , noble
Dickens	PERSON	every inch of him an Honest Man . ''

		WARWICK JAMES PRICE .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE LIMITATIONS OF A LARGE L1HKAKV for even the biggest institutions , like the biggest men , have their acutely-felt limitations are made appar - ent in a sentence or two of the annual '' Report of the Librarian of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		After referring to the inadequacy of the book-fund for anything but the most indispensable purchases , Dr.
Putnam	PERSON	speaks of the
Library	ORGANIZATION	's inability to compete for the owner - ship of such rarities as from time to time pass under the auctioneer 's hammer .

		And yet .

		he says , '' such material also would be appropriate here ; it would render a service both notable and wide-reaching ; it is the customary distinction of other national libra - ries ; and its absence from the
National Library	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	must be held a sort of reproach .

		Yet with prices as they are , and competition keen , we can not apply our funds to it without neglect of the obligations which seem primary and imperative .

		The sale at auction , in
May last	DATE	, of the first section of the
Robert Hoe	ORGANIZATION	collection , afforded a signal illus - tration of our inabilities .

		There was not a single item offered , not already here , which would not have been an appropriate and in its way a useful addition to our collections ; there was not , however , a single one upon which we felt that we could justifiably bid . ''

		Therefore it is to gift and bequest that the Library
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 79 looks for most of its valuable accessions of this na - ture ; and two such recent donations from abroad are mentioned .

		The Report contains , as usual , a great amount of interesting information concerning the
Library	ORGANIZATION	's various activities .

		It may be noted here that the year 's accessions of 98,571 books bring the total number up to 1,891,729 .

		In another twelve - month or so the two-million mark will be passed .

		Noteworthy among the details of equipment , in the '' Report of the Superintendent of Building and Grounds , '' are the two new bookstacks , for bound newspapers and for music scores , and the connection of the building with the central heating and lighting and power station on Capital Hill .

		A REVIVAL OF THE CHAUCERIAN EPOS , the genre of the `` Canterbury Tales , '' is perhaps what might least be expected in modern verse .

		Our lyrical turn , and the conquest of this field by the novel , are against it .

		In the last generation ,
Clough	PERSON	and
Morris	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	, and
Whittier	LOCATION	in
America	LOCATION	, did something of the kind .

		Mr.
Isaac Pennypacker	PERSON	, the biographer of
General Meade	ORGANIZATION	, in a poem en - titled '' Bridle-Paths '' has , in limited scope it is true , essayed the Chaucerian method and achieved something of the Chaucerian atmosphere .

		The plan of the piece is this : A party of eight friends , denomi - nated respectively the Sage , Historian , Preacher , Doctor , Farmer , Student , and so forth , take horse for a month 's ride .

		Their course leads them through the borderland between the North and the South the dark and bloody ground , now smiling in the
May	DATE	sunshine , where giant armies contended in the past .

		The daily incidents of the ride are recorded the keen zest of life in the saddle , the changing aspects of the scenery , the midday rest for lunch , the stir and bustle in out-of-the-world villages at the coming of such a cavalcade , the evening arrival at the wayside inns .

		And through all , alike on the march as at the fireside , there runs a stream of talk about the historic scenes they are visiting , the heroic personages of the past , or the grave social problems of to-day and the future .

		These pilgrims , unlike
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's , do not tell tales to while away the time , but they exchange quip and jest and bright thoughts , and they read each other brief poems lyrics of race , of battle , of love or tragedy .

		Some of these songs `` The Jersey Blues '' and ''
Kruger	PERSON	'' are known , and one of them , `` The Dutch on the
Delaware	LOCATION	, '' has been set to music and is widely sung in this country when the sons of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	are gathered together .

		The composition recalls in a way
Clough	PERSON	's '' Bothie of Tober-na-Vuo - lich . ''

		Time and place and manners and methods are of course different ; but there is the same mak - ing of poetry out of the common events and scenes of the present , the same disturbed and heretical attitude toward current opinion and thought , the same revulsion toward a simpler and more heroic ideal of life than obtains in our money-grabbing , motor-rushing age .

		The poem winds up with a dramatic episode in the
Tennessee	LOCATION	mountains .

		It seems worth while to call attention to a book of verse which , against a background of the vast shad - ows of the Civil War , projects figures so vivid and real as Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	's summer pilgrims , and gives utterance to so much stern and lofty idealism .

		DR. VINCENT ON PUBLIC LIBRARIES said some things worth hearing at the late annual meeting of the
Minnesota Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Minnetonka	LOCATION	.

		The new president of
the State University	ORGANIZATION	bad been asked to address the meeting , and he genially re - sponded .

		From the `` Library Notes and News '' of the
Minnesota Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	we re - print a few of his winged words on `` The Library and the Social Memory . ''

		After a witty review of the topics already discussed , he proceeded to show how the library stands for the continuity of human thought , and said : '' These are psychological days .

		There is a psychology of childhood , a psychology of adolescence , a psychology of advertising , a psychol - ogy of salesmanship and there is
Henry James	PERSON	. ''

		And later : '' About the goodness of books there may be endless discussion .

		It is the fashion in certain quarters to speak slightingly of fiction , and to regard the large percentage it attains in library circulation as a negligible quantity so far as educational influ - ences go .

		This is manifestly absurd .

		Good fiction is the vehicle of science , history , literature , philoso - phy , and ethics .

		It gives a background for life ; it affords material for personal growth .

		It confers a sense of human continuity and makes for social solidarity .

		The very wave of imitation which sets a million people reading the same novel ... is of vast importance in the fusing of persons into a peo - ple . ''

		What a work , then , in people-fusing , in nation - solidifying , in strengthening the sense of human continuity , have Mr.
Farnol	PERSON	and Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	and Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	been accomplishing of late probably all unwittingly .

		... THE MOST WIDELY CIRCULATED BUT LEAST READ BOOK IN THE WORLD , to judge from the combined reports of the Bible societies and the college exam - iners in English , appears to be the book that
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	once peddled in
Spain	LOCATION	, to the sub - sequent delight of his readers .

		He may not have found it a best-seller ; but taken the world over , the
Bible	LOCATION	finds hundreds of thousands of purchasers every year .

		Nevertheless , when a class of college students was subjected to a simple examination on its character and contents by Professor
Rankin	PERSON	of
Michigan University	ORGANIZATION	, some of the answers to the easiest questions revealed an astonishing ignorance .

		The language in which the
Bible	LOCATION	was originally written was variously asserted to be Sanskrit , Arabic , French , German , and early English .

		As to what the name `` Jordan '' designates , one student replied : '' The man who took
Moses	PERSON	's place as the head of the Israelites . ''

		The difference between
Levi	PERSON	and Leviathan was explained thus : ''
Levi	PERSON	was the name of a man ; Leviathan might be applied to his doings . ''

		The Isle of
Patmos	LOCATION	was described as '' the place where the children of
Israel	LOCATION	were fed 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb.	DATE	.

		in the wilderness , '' and the '' mess of pottage '' was confounded with the Lord 's
Supper	DATE	.

		That most of the answers to such questions as these were correct , one can safely assume ; but that even a few should have been so wide of the mark shows at least how little familiar in some families are the scriptures that formerly were read aloud daily in all rightly - ordered American households .

		THE PAY COLLECTION OK PUBLIC LIBRARY FICTION has long since demonstrated its ability to support itself , even at a very low charge to the borrower .

		At
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, where
one cent	MONEY	a day is paid on each volume circulated , the receipts for the last fiscal year , as appears from the current report of the librarian , amounted to
$ 1,336,68	MONEY	, while the ex - penditures for books in the same department came within
sixty-four cents	MONEY	of exactly balancing the account .

		It is further stated that , with all the facilities offered so generously to the novel-reader , the proportion of more serious works circulated showed a notable increase , the fiction circulation falling to less than
fifty-nine per cent	MONEY	, which is the lowest on record at this library .

		Sociology gained twenty-two per cent , foreign literature twenty-one per cent , and useful arts twenty-three per cent , while the total circulation advanced five per cent over that of any previous year .

		No wonder there was need of a new and larger building , which is now taken possession of , with every prospect of still greater activity in the future .

		It is cheering to note that the final
twenty-five hundred dollars	MONEY	needed to pay for this new and handsome structure was a few days ago generously subscribed by a former bene - factor of the library .

		The total cost of the building and equipment , incredible as it may seem , falls about twenty thousand dollars below the original estimate of
$ 375,000	MONEY	... THE HERMAPHRODITE PRONOUN , or pronoun of common gender , still remains a desideratum in spite of the attempt to introduce '' thon '' into the language .

		At least one dictionary , the `` Standard , '' recognizes the word .

		On page
1877	DATE	, first column , we read :
Thon	PERSON	, pronoun , singular and plural .

		That one ; he , she , or it : a pronoun of the third person , com - mon gender , a contracted and solidified form of that one '' The report that
Chicago	LOCATION	's estimable superin - tendent of schools , Mrs.
Ella Flagg Young	PERSON	, has sug - gested '' himer '' and '' hiser '' as pronouns of the common gender prompts the query whether , if a word invented in cold blood must he adopted , the one already proposed and to some extent approved should not receive general sanction rather than the newer and less prepossessing candidate .

		Mrs.
Young	PERSON	's `` hiser '' recalls the rather uneuphonious ` his ` n , '' which with `` hern '' and `` theirn '' used to be commonly heard in rural
New England	LOCATION	, and probably is still occasionally heard there .

		It may be of interest to note further that , according to the '' Standard Dictionary , '' thon was first proposed as a common-gender pronoun by Mr.
Charles Cro/at Converse	PERSON	, the music-composer , as long ago as
1858	DATE	.

		That the strange word , in spite of its formidable th sound foriniiUMe to foreigners , at least did not offend the musician ' * ear , is at any rate so much in its favor ... Till : RIGORS OK BIBLIOGRAPHY , like thus .

Committee on Survey of Bib	ORGANIZATION	- liographical Literature.published in the current '' Bul - letin of the Bibliographical Society of
America	LOCATION	, '' we read : '' Referring once more to the term ' scientific bibliography , ' it may be said that most of the bibli - ographies prepared two or three decades ago or earlier do not fill present requirements .

		To-day something more is demanded than mere lists of authors , titles , and dates .

		Works must be carefully described and distinctions between different edi - tions and issues of the same date set forth in such a manner as to readily permit of verification .

		The description of books is more and more becoming an exact science , and I presume it is to this modern method of bibliographical description that your com - mittee alludes in using the term scientific bibliog - raphy . ' ''

		Further light on the difficulties of the science is thrown by Dr.
Ronald Ross	PERSON	, of .

		he
Liv	PERSON	- erpool
School of Tropical Medicine	ORGANIZATION	.

		He writes to the above-named committee : `` The literature on tropical medicine has become quite enormous , and as it is written in about thirteen different languages , the scientific workers can not keep in touch with it unless a special official is appointed to study the bibliography and bring out regular lists every month and furnish abstracts if called upon to do so . ''

		Accordingly the
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine	ORGANIZATION	has its own linguistically and medically learned bibliographer , and '' it appears , '' as Dr.
Ross	PERSON	concludes , that the time has now come when every scientific institution must have such an official .

		It saves much waste of money and labor in repeat - ing work which may often happen to have been done elsewhere already . ''

		A BANNER YEAR IN BOOK-PRODUCTION with English publishers was the year just closed .

		From tables printed in '' The Publishers ' Circular '' it appears that a total of 10,914 books were put on the market , of which number 8,530 were new books , and 2,384 new editions of old ones .

		This is one hundred and ten more books than were issued the preceding year , which in turn showed a slight gain over the year before .

		In fact , for the past decade at least there had been a nearly continuous and very considerable annual increase , from a total of 4,955 in
the first year of the century	DATE	to the above - named number of last year .

		It is further to be noted that the publishing activity of
1911	DATE	was greatest in
October	DATE	and least in
June	DATE	, with
August , July	DATE	,
April	DATE	, and
December	DATE	next in order of slack - ness .

		Philosophy and religion showed the greatest increase , with science and technology , history and biography , poetry and drama next .

		The fiction of the year sums up 2,215 works , including forty trans -

		THE DIAL 81 lations , 933 new editions of previously-published novels , and four pamphlets .

		A nation that pub - lishes yearly one book for every three thousand of its inhabitants is certainly doing its part , quanti - tatively , toward providing the world with reading matter .

		THE WORST-HOUSED LIBRARY OF ITS CLASS IN THE WORLD must be acknowledged to be the library of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, the best scholar 's library in
America	LOCATION	, and one of the oldest and most famous .

		Not unnaturally the recent `` Report of the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	to Visit the Library '' dwells with emphasis on the need of a new building , a need painfully felt years ago , and now nothing short of excruciating .

		The institution that gave to the American Library Asso - ciation its first president , and , as long as he lived , its most honored member ,
Justin Winsor	PERSON	, and that has contributed to the development of library econ - omy as hardly another in the country has done , awaits the uprising of some wealthy and generous alumnus , or other friend , to endow it with a library building worthy of its unequalled collection of lit - erary treasures .

		Two and a
half million dollars	MONEY	is the amount called for by the visiting committee , and the multimillionaire who hears the call and responds to it will have his name written but little lower than that of
John Harvard	PERSON	himself as a benefactor of the oldest university in
America	LOCATION	.

		THE DEATH OF THE EDITOR OF '' TRUTH , '' On the sixteenth of
January	DATE	, removes from the journalistic world a brilliant and picturesque figure .


Henry Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	was born in
London	LOCATION	, of French extrac - tion , in
1831	DATE	, and after completing his formal edu - cation at
Eton	ORGANIZATION	he entered upon an erratic and adventurous course of life which brought him twice at least to our shores , his early connection with the diplomatic service causing him to take up his resi - dence for a while in
Washington	LOCATION	in an official capa - city .

		But the tedious flummery of diplomacy soon disgusted the young man , and he adopted journalism instead , founding the paper now long associated with his name , in
1877	DATE	, after various other experiences in newspaper work and newspaper-founding .

		His par - liamentary activities date back to
1866	DATE	, though his election from
Northampton	LOCATION	, a strong radical borough which he represented for twenty -
six years , occurred fourteen years later	DATE	.

		Of course it is as the fearless and cynical and witty `` Labby '' of `` Truth '' that the world has best known him and will continue for some time to remember him .

		TRIALS OF THE REFERENCE LIBRARIAN might be cited in abundance to supplement Mr.
Calvin Winter	PERSON	's recent readable article in `` The Bookman '' on `` How to Use a Library . ''

		Not only are there , as he intimates , many bunglers and blunderers among those who visit the public library for information to be derived from books , but there are also not a few visitors who are disposed to make a skilful but not quite legitimate use of the library 's resources .

		Of course thefts and mutilations are now an old story , but less has been said of the thrifty persons who in various ways not in the least criminal seek to win a profit not exactly intellectual from the library .

		We recall an impecunious student of genealogy who , after making large levies on the time and patience of the reference librarian , blandly asked him for a postage stamp , to be affixed to a letter addressed to a multimillionaire , and filled with such details of family history as would , the writer believed , establish a kinship between the said man of millions and the one of depleted purse , and so produce results pleas - ing to the latter .

		The stamp , moreover , was to be regarded as an investment which would yield some thousands per cent profit to the investor .

		Obviously , the time and attention bestowed upon such `` literary '' workers are time and attention unwisely bestowed , though the unwisdom commonly appears only in the sequel ...
PRINCETON	LOCATION	'S NEW PRESIDENT AS A MAN OF LETTERS has won many appreciative readers by his recent `` Defence of Prejudice , and Other Essays , '' one of the best of last year 's collections of essays ; and he has long been known to the scholarly world as the author of '' Inductive Logic . '' ''

		Problems of Philosophy , '' and ''
Hegel	PERSON	's Logic , '' the latter work having received such world-wide recognition as to be deemed worthy of republication in Japanese , not to mention the Italian version of the book .

		Chosen by the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	as editor of the '' Epochs of Philos - ophy '' series , he has enlisted the cooperation of the leading philosophers of this country and
Great Britain	LOCATION	in making its twelve volumes authoritative and noteworthy .

		His own work , '' The Philosophy of the Enlightenment , '' was selected by the pub - lishers to head the series .

		The geniality and vitality of Dr.
Hibben	PERSON	, who is said to be the best liked and most admired member of the Princeton faculty , re - veal themselves in his books , which are far from being the lucubrations of a Dryasdust .

		THE COWPER HOUSE AT
OLNEY	LOCATION	, the scene of the poet 's happiest years , was bought twelve years ago by some of his admirers and presented to the town as a memorial and museum .

		This fitting observance of the centenary of his death is now followed by a movement for the adequate endowment of the house in order that its preservation may be assured .

		No loud trumpetings accompany this praiseworthy enter - prise ; any such ear-splitting note would shock the lovers of the gentle author of '' The Task . ''

		But there may be some in this country who will be glad to be told , in a quiet way , that any contribution to the proposed endowment fund will be gratefully re - ceived .

		No name of treasurer or chairman has come to our notice , but probably an inquiry ad - dressed to the custodian of the

		Without entering upon the vexed question of tainted money , one can safely assert that a commu - nity which pays for its own library out of its own pocket is likely to take more genuine satisfaction in it , and to enjoy a less impaired self-respect , than the community which goes begging for outside assist - ance ... AN ODDITY IN AUTHORS ' NAMES , which may have attracted attention , is found in the chiasmus -LRB- if we may use an uncommon but expressive word of Greek parentage -RRB- , ''

		THE CLASSICAL DEGREE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		All along until recent years the degree of Bachelor of Arts has described a college graduate who has had several years of study in both Latin and Greek litera - ture .

		This is the proper seal upon a distinctly classical course , and upon no otlirr .

		It should differentiate that training which lui-s at least well introduced the student to the trra-m .

		> nt -LRB- irccian and -LRB- suliordi - nately -RRB- of Latin thought and c \ | irciun .

		\ \ ith the poetic acuteness of the one and the formal strength of the other .

		These two disciplines have proved thrm - selves of incomparable value to regulate , furnish , and uplift the mind .

		The obstinate and astigmatic neglect of Greek is now reflected in the '' conveyance '' of its characteristic degree to a use which avails tin - ancient and irreparable honor of that tongue and which annuls its power .

		We do not here urge the immrnsr mrut.il nourish - ment of the Attic language and literature fout and arsenal of intellectual keenness and verbal skill ; nor do we discuss the inferior methods which arro - gantly bid to displace these great assets of wisdom and culture : but we do aver that the old
A.B.	ORGANIZATION	is corroded , and the question begged , by transferring the word to cover the refusal of the thing .

		Gladly we note that
Amherst	LOCATION	has led the way in its decision no longer to confer the
B.A.	ORGANIZATION	for courses which include but a portion of those studies properly pertain - ing to a thorough technical school , she declaring that to such schools this degree should be reserved without invasion or imitation .

		A true and typical college , being distinctly cultural rather than technical , vocational , or professional , should use the Ph.B .

		as the appropriate general sign for the completion of courses which do not reckon with Greek and are mainly occupied with modern languages and with English subjects .

		This would then honestly indi - cate an avowedly '' modernized '' procedure , and would ultimately aid the appraisal of its claims .

		There truly is -LRB- as
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	has well said -RRB- `` a hier - archy of values in education . ''

		To eliminate roiifu > iou , a degree itself should denote substantially that which a giveu college course has sought and exalted .

		To rou - fer the
A.B.	LOCATION	upon one who has ignored all the wealths of Greek is , to use no sterner term , anihiguous ; the nomenclature assumes a classical training which has been denied .

		This not only is untruthful to the historical meaning of the '' Course in Arts , '' but also it works by indirection to
Philistinize	LOCATION	higher education .

		Choosing nonchalantly to assert that its neological scheme is `` more practical , '' or `` good enough , '' let such a college frankly apply a hall-mark appropriate to its theory ; hut let it not abuse terms by borrowing the title of another set of ideas .

		Doubtless a curriculum may eliminate Greek , and yet have merit ; but such is not a classical curriculum in any fair sense of that word .

		There still are colleges where the light of Hellas has not failed , and which have the right to be recognized as still walking in that light .

		Their imprimatur does not mean scorn of antiquity .

		Even under the pressures of a mercantilist era , they have not retired their ideals .

		Their precept honors them .

		They are in minority , but they are not shaken of the wind .

		May they hold the pass against all Persian odds .

		If a sincerely classical education is not to be numbered among the `` lost arts , '' then as one step even the analogies of the Pure Food Law '' exact that under no specious plea shall the dis - tinguishing label of such an education be perverted or counterfeited .

		Let not the declension from time-tested standards add falsehood to injury .

Peleg Gudger	PERSON	, Dr.
Simon Bagley	PERSON	, and Master
Enoch Sneed	PERSON	all librarians of the old school Mr.
Edmund Lester Pearson	PERSON	, a libra - rian of the modern type , is endowed with a very lively sense of humor .

		In this he is by no means peculiar among those of his calling in the present day , and therefore his clever and sprightly sketches in `` The Librarian at Play '' will elicit not a few chuckles of amusement and delight on the part of learned bibliothecaries as well as on that of unlearned readers in general .

		In his literary and journalistic role as '' The Librarian '' of the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript , '' Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	has attracted wide attention by the weekly exercise of his nimble wit and frolic fancy in the delineation of the eccentricities and perversities and comicalities to be met with in the library world .

		From these care-dispelling compositions of his playful pen the present selec - tion of sketches has been made , with the ex - ception of two articles `` Mulch '' and `` The Crowded Hour '' which now appear for the first time .

		Better than further description of Mr.
Pear	PERSON	- son 's book will be a few samples from its pages .

		A chapter entitled `` The Conversation Room '' amusingly presents the difficulties and distrac - tions encountered by two scholars engaged in learned research at the Blankville Public Li - brary .

		In despair at the impossibility of secur - ing quiet for their philological studies within the library 's precincts , these two savants address their complaints to the board of directors .

		Dr.
Obadiah Wurzberger	PERSON	begins his letter thus : '' My name is doubtless familiar to you , but perhaps you are not aware that I am engaged in an important piece of research in your library .

		When I state that my work is an inquiry into the Indo-Iranian origins of the noun ' Fuddy-dud ' and its possible derivation from the Semitic , you will understand that it requires the closest possible application and an entire freedom from interruptions and distractions ... The library , and particularly the remote part of it in which my alcove is situated , has been little frequented during this hot weather .

		Yesterday , however , an invasion began .

		The alcove next to mine was visited by a succession of incon - gruous , inconsequent persons whose conversation made it utterly impossible for me to work .

		A complaint to
Miss Mayhew	PERSON	, the assistant in charge of the library , elicited the fact that conversation is allowed in this alcove . ''

		No other part of the building being found suit - ably lighted for the complainant , he attempted to continue his work where he was , but was forced to desist ; and then , to fill in the time and to obtain an impressive exhibit to lay before the board of directors , he took down in shorthand the conversation of the frivolous disturbers of his peace .

		The record is highly amusing .

		A similar complaint , similarly reinforced , is trans - mitted to the board by Dr.
Nicholas Jasper	PERSON	, who is engaged in the preparation of the first volume of his Arabic dictionary -LRB- on which he has been continuously occupied since
1867	DATE	-RRB- in the alcove on the other side of the one where the talking occurs .

		No reader of the conversation reported by these two indignant scholars can refuse them his sympathy .

		A personally conducted tour of the infernal regions brings the writer face to face with the edifying spectacle of the peculiar penalties in - flicted on the various sorts of library-abusers .

		For example , of one group of sufferers he is told by his guide : '' These are the annotators , the people who work off their idiotic opinions on the margins and fly-leaves of books .

		They dispute the author 's statements , call him a liar and abuse him generally .

		The one on the end used to get all the biographies of Shakespeare he could find and cover every bit of blank paper in them with pencil - writing signed ' A Baconian . '

		He usually began with the statement : ' The author of this book is a pig - headed fool . '

		The man next to him believed that the earth is flat , and he aired that theory so extensively with a fountain-pen that he ruined about two hundred dollars ' worth of books .

		They caught him and put him in jail for six months , but he will have to take his medicine here just the same . ''

		The '' medicine '' for each of these malefactors was a certain number of years ' exercise in climb - ing barbed - wire fences , the number of years vary - ing with the gravity of the offense .

		A glimpse also was obtained of the tortures to which '' re - formed spellers '' are subjected in the kingdom of
Pluto	LOCATION	.

		`` They were busily engaged in clipping one another 's ears off with large scissors .

		There was a sign on the hill beside them .

		It read : EARS ARE UNNECESSARY .

		WHY NOT GET RID OF THEM ?

		LEAVE ENUF TO HEAR WITH .

		DO N'T STOP TIL YOU ARE THRU . ''

		Not a few old acquaintances , familiar to readers of '' The Library and the Librarian '' and of the `` Transcript '' articles , figure more or less conspicuously in the pages of `` The Librarian at Play . ''

		The
Ezra Beesly Free Public Library of Baxter	ORGANIZATION	is the scene of some amusing incidents in the book .

Seen Between Temple Place	ORGANIZATION	and Boyl - ston Street , '' labors at the identification of a feathered biped which she has rau ^ ht a glimpse of in the shrubbery of her lawn and which finally turns out to be the gallina domestica .

		Some bits of verse , both quoted and original , give variety to the book 's contents .

		From Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	's own pen we quote the beginning and the end of a two-page ode `` To a Small Library Patron . '' ''

		Uncombed , a bit unwashed , with freckled face , And slowly moving jaws implying gum ; A decade 's meager dignity of years Upon your head your only passports these , All unconcerned you enter Fairyland ! ''

		For here dwell monstrous Jinn , and great birds fly Through haunted valleys sown with diamonds .

		Here Rumpelstiltskin hides his secret name , The talking Flounder comes at beck and call , The King of

		But you with towsled head and stockings torn , Irreverent and calm and unabashed , Intent on swiping
Billy Johnson	PERSON	's cap You pass the magic portal unaware , And , careless , saunter into lands of gold . ''

		Most heartily is Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	's book to be com - mended as a cure for that malady not so very uncommon among librarians , and not wholly un - known outside of libraries , taking oneself too seriously .

		of no doubt that as long as the world exists some perverse souls will invent perpetual-motion ma - chines , while others will square the circle .

		In biology it is `` spontaneous generation '' which will engage the attention of unappreciated genius down through the ages .

		In common with all problems of this class , spontaneous generation appeals by its beauti - fully irrefragable logic .

		The most orthodox and conservative of biologists will admit that at some time in the history of this planet living substance must have been synthesized from non-living in - organic matter .

		But if it happened so once , why not again ?

		Who can say that somewhere in the inconceivable manifoldness of environmental conditions which exists upon this earth there may not be going on to-day and every day this change from the lifeless to the living , without the intermediation of already living sultancr ' Obviously nobody can make such an affirmation ; and the spontaneous generationist is logically triumphant , as indeed he must always be .

		In this thought lies the ignis fatuus which lures him on and on to never-ceasing labor , done with all the painstaking care and vigorous scientific precautions against error which the most exact - ing critic could demand .

		Just here is one of the most curious paradoxes in this whole subject of the abnormal psychology of science .

		For while our friend the independ - ent is invariably successful in his researches if we accept his valuation of the results , such an outcome never satisfies him , but on the con - trary he is impelled to do the same thing over and over again .

		Who ever heard of a circle - squarer stopping after he had once , by his own token , reached his goal ?

		Or who , having once brewed an homunculus in a beaker , was ever known to rest upon the laurels of so glorious -LRB- if true -RRB- an achievement ?

		This ceaseless and feverish pursuit of the same object , which is so characteristic of the scientific odd fellow , is in marked contrast to the methods of his more ordinary colleague .

		When the latter makes a discovery , and convinces himself that his conclu - sions are correct , he publishes the results and stops working on that part ` x-ulor thing .

		In the sure conviction that he is right , he is satisfied to leave it to other men , even to posterity , to repeat and test his observations ; for him a new goal has come in sight .

		Not so the paradox .

		i : he trots gaily and ever more briskly around the same old logical circle .

		Is it because of this circularity of occupation that an unfeeling world has come to call him a `` crank '' ?

		A belief in the occurrence , either regularly
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85 or occasionally , of a spontaneous generation of living material from non-living was quite gen - eral down to the time of
Louis Pasteur	LOCATION	.

		He showed , by a series of brilliantly conceived and rigorously executed experiments , which laid the foundation of the science of bacteriology , that whenever such measures were taken as to insure absolutely that no living organism re - mained in a particular spot and that no living organism could get to that spot from the outside world , then nothing living ever appeared there , regardless of the nature of the place itself or of the surrounding conditions .

		About ten years after these results were announced a young English physician , Dr.
H. Charlton Bastian	PERSON	, in
1870	DATE	, published his first work in support of the doctrine of the de novo origin of living things in infusions .

		We have now before us for re - view his latest -LRB- one certainly hopes not his last -RRB- contribution to the subject .

		During all this long period he has not devoted himself exclu - sively to this matter , but has made for himself a distinguished name and place as a physician .

		In
1898	DATE	, however , he retired from active pro- fessional work , and began once more the pur - suit of his beloved will-o ' - the-wisp making life .

		Since that date his output of books on the subject has been steady .

		Each one when it appears falls quite flat as far as the professional biologists are concerned : it is not discussed any more than is the latest perpetual-motion machine amongst physicists .

		But with the utmost patience and good humor , Dr.
Bastian	PERSON	proceeds to write another book , setting forth the results of some further experiments still more decisively proving -LRB- to his mind -RRB- the same old conclusion .

		The present volume , '' The Origin of Life , '' is a memoir originally offered to the
Royal Society	ORGANIZATION	for publication in its Philosophical Transactions .

		That body promptly and une - quivocally refused to print it .

		By so doing they furnished Dr.
Bastian	PERSON	an opportunity to write a lengthy and most entertaining preface .

		The memoir itself sets forth with great wealth of detail and the greatest attention to scientific ex - actitude , the following charming little mediaeval fairy story .

		Suppose you put in a glass tube of a particu - lar shape and kind an ounce of distilled water ; then add two , three , or four drops of sodium silicate , six grains of ammonium phosphate , and six drops of dilute phosphoric acid , or eight drops of liquor ferri pernitratis ; boil for ten minutes -LRB- I suppose it will do no harm to say abracadabra rapidly forward and backward in the meantime -RRB- ; seal the tube ; place it on a protected balcony facing the east ; leave it for six months and then open it .

		If the weather has been favorable and other conditions pro- pitious , you may find in a sediment at the bottom what Dr.
Bastian	PERSON	says are living organisms .

		All this is put forth with the utmost serious - ness and exactly as I have copied it .

		In that most expressive phrase of the street , '' Can you beat it ? ''

		THE LEGALIZED EXPLOITATION OF THE PEOPLE .

		* Under the title '' Social Forces in American History , '' Mr.
A. M. Simons	PERSON	presents a brief history of the
United States	LOCATION	designed to show how the wealthier classes have usually exploited the poorer , and how our constitution and laws have represented from time to time the legal - ized forms which this exploitation should take .

		The Colonial charters or other agreements were intended to serve the interests of British , French , or Dutch traders or companies , though at times the colonists themselves were allowed certain '' ground floor '' privileges .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	and Confederate constitutions of
1776	DATE	were the results of a break between the European capital - ists and the rising commercialists of
America	LOCATION	, which break brought on the Revolution .

		Here again the men who were to benefit from the new regime were not the great mass of plain people who fought in or sustained
Washington	LOCATION	's army , but the privileged groups of merchants , fisher - men , and plantation lords , and their allies the clergy and the lawyers few of whom actually bore arms in behalf of their own cause .

		The democratic tone of the Declaration of Indepen - dence and other documents of
1776	DATE	, was only a sop thrown to the people in order to arouse their enthusiasm , their fighting blood .

		But the masters , the leaders
Washington	LOCATION	, the Adamses , and the rest saw that too much had been conceded ; and in
1787	DATE	they entered into a wide-extended conspiracy to deprive the people of the dangerous powers which they '' usurped '' to the detriment of the wealthier classes .

		When the national
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the presidency , and the supreme court were organized , these offices and institutions were seized upon by the commercial and planting interests , the manu - facturing and the navigating interests , and finally , at the close of the Reconstruction period , by the great capitalists the railway , industrial , mining , and banking lords , who have maintained their power almost unimpaired to the present hour .

		This is the outline .

		The author has read widely , both in the sources and in the secondary literature ; he has seized upon certain important incidents and events and made them prove what they do in fact seem to show .

		The story is in - teresting , fascinating in some of its chapters ; but it is not likely to increase the reader 's faith in the leaders of the people in the past , or in the sacrosanct character of our
Federal Constitution	ORGANIZATION	.

		Notwithstanding this radical tendency of the author , the reviewer has read every chapter of the book with real pleasure and sometimes with absorbing interest .

		And with most of the group - ing of facts , as well as the resulting inferences and conclusions , he is in entire accord .

		It is a well-told story of selfish greed and over-reaching cupidity working through laws and constitu - tions in order the better to appropriate the goods and the values created by the toiling masses of the people who have never yet been fairly rep - resented in the conventions and the law-making bodies .

Fed	ORGANIZATION	- eral Convention was undoubtedly the result of a reactionary movement , but it was hardly a conspiracy ; the adoption of the Constitution was certainly due to sharp practices , and the noto - riously unjust system of representation in the several adopting conventions was cheerfully used or abused .

		But if the Constitution had been the product of a conspiracy , it may well be doubted whether even these advantages of the '' Fathers '' would have sufficed .

		During the long controversies over the tariff , internal improvements , and the national bank , there were again the same conflicts of the in - terests , and the usual victories of organized wealth against the plainer and simpler people ; and the author makes good use of the facts to prove that class rapacity never failed to raise its ugly head on these occasions .

		Yet he fails , some - times , to show the real significance of the con - flicts he dest ` ribeH : for example , in his account of the bank in chapter fifteen .

		The national bank was , as he claims , a powerful agency aim - ing at the exercise of some of the sovereign powers of the people for the benefit of a small coterie of capitalists ; but the state banks were not so bad and so entirely inefficient as a prac - tical check upon '' the monster '' as we are left to infer from the treatment here given .

		The chapters on `` The Rise of North .

		- ru Capitalism , '' '' The Armed Conflict , '' and '' Re - construction '' are very interesting if depressing .

		The conclusion , `` The Decadence of Capitalism , which carries with it the strong sugi : e > tion that the laborers the '' fourth estate , '' I was about to say are now ready to come to power , is far from convincing .

		Why is it not more likely now than ever before that the great lords of industry will continue to control governmental action and gradually reduce society to a new feudal organ - ization in form , as it already is in fact , and make `` labor `` permanently subservient through their absolute power of the purse and by means I of their elaborate pension system , designed espe - cially to break down the influence of organ i/rd labor ?

		Are there not already railway com - panies , industrial organizations , which exercise the essential functions of sovereign powers and send more senators to
Washington	LOCATION	than any single State ?

		Are they not really states within states ?

		And why may they not combine , as in fact they have already done , to appropriate the powers of the Federal government and to use them to their own aggrandizement ?

		Instead of a future Nation in which the proletariat shall rule , are we not much more likely to enter upon a state in which our present masters shall have become supreme ?

		It seems that peoples pass through cycles of evolution , just as Mr.
Simons	PERSON	insists ; but it is nowhere on record that the masses have actually governed , unless perchance in some of our frontier states of a hundred VIMI ^ ago .

		But it is not the business of the reviewer to argue , much as he may lament with the author the tendency of history .

		This book has already caused considerable discussion ; may its circle of readers continue to widen .

		If the older historians of the country would ponder the contentions and the facts which the author so well presents , it might be of much service to them and tin - country .

		THE DIAL 87 AX ENGLISHWOMAN 'S BOOK ON
GERMANY	LOCATION	.

		* One rarely meets with a more agreeable book than that by
Miss I. A. R. Wylie	PERSON	upon `` The Germans . ''

		It is the faithful work of a first-rate Englishwoman -LRB- than which '' this planet never produced a more splendid creature '' -RRB- , sprightly , open-minded , observant ; it is based on six years ' intimate association with the Germans them - selves , chiefly in the region of
Baden	LOCATION	.

		Best of all , this labor was done in the spirit of sincere love for its subject , using just enough shadows to make the picture a true one .

		Along with an unfeigned admiration for almost everything German , there are frequent and sounding whacks at British -LRB- and we must regretfully supply '' American '' -RRB- social pretence , happy-go-lucky disorganization , slackness in education , and bar - barism in the things which belong to Art .

		The volume deals with all sorts and conditions of Germans , in their days of toil and hours of ease ; it shows their inner social groupings , their daily occupations , their recreations , their relation to larger economic problems .

		The native tem - perament here shown forth holds many fine ele - ments : honor , genuineness , order , cleanliness , self-respect , progressiveness , thrift ; a wholesome balance between
Sense and Sensibility	ORGANIZATION	.

		The supreme wealth of the country , according to this exhibit , lies in Character :
Germany	LOCATION	appears as the veriest refuge of plain living and high thinking .

		Touching upon almost every other matter within the range of the higher human interests , it is unfortunate that the book has no chap - ter on German Religion -LRB- compare , for instance , the prevailing highly un-Christian conception of '' military honor , '' so well presented by the author -RRB- .

		Let us hope that she may give us , some day , a full treatment which might well make a volume by itself of this important subject .

		The aim of this work was not mere entertain - ment ; it has a high constructive purpose : it is a noble plea for heartfelt friendship between
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, in which generosity and not envy shall predominate .

		Its appeal is high and searching .

		We condemn all attempts to cripple a rival in sport , firstly , because it is un - fair ; secondly , because it is rarely successful .

		We know that the fittest wins , and as good sportsmen we prefer to stand aside , cheering the winner , even though he does not carry our * THE GERMANS .

		colors .

		In the greater struggle between the na - tions the same principle holds good .

		The fittest wins .

		Therefore it is above all things neces - sary that we should steel ourselves in national virtues , in self-sacrifice , in unsparing endeavor , believing that if we are worthy , if we have re - tained our old high standard , we shall also retain our place in the world .

		Wealth , Dread - noughts , spasmodic bursts of activity , defensive alliances , and so on , will not save us from the future our own fitness is our one salvation , and our fitness lies in our national character , not in our national pocket .

		At the bottom it is not the Germans we are afraid of but of our - selves , and when we have once recovered our self-confidence , our justified belief in our own strength and virtue , we shall be able to greet the growing nation as an ally and a friend .

		The only question is whether that justified belief and self-confidence is still possible .

		The pictures are brought together from a wide area , and are of good size and contemporary ; the whole make-up of the book is ample and gener - ous .

		The writing is distinctly good , the phrasing fresh and agreeable .

		There is a cheery and most liberal inaccuracy in the mere matter of correct - ness in the use of German words , which com - ports , belike , with the general breezy freedom of the book as a whole .

		For our own part , would that we might never again see the word
Stein	PERSON	-LRB- unknown in this sense in
Germany	LOCATION	-RRB- assumed as a native term for '' beer-mug '' !

		columns , and from them all the reviewer has gained information of many kinds , but all helpful in the present crisis .

		Largely , but not solely , concerned with
China	LOCATION	is the notable volume of Professor
Paul S. Reinsch	PERSON	, of
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	.

		His `` Intellectual and Political Currents in the Far East '' is a product of American scholarship of which his countrymen may well be proud .

		For while others have written of actions , he has studied the springs of action , and the essays which make up this volume offer the Western reader an insight into the present thought and life of the Orient not to be found elsewhere .

		Three of the essays are concerned with
China	LOCATION	.

		In Intellectual Tendencies in the Chinese Reform Movement '' we have a penetrating study of the mingling of Chinese traditions and Western thought which lie at the bottom of the present revolution .

		The precepts of the classics and of the later philo - sophers are noted , the influence of the modern press and drama is made clear , and the relative import - ance of the Western radical writers is shown .

		We learn that , '' Departing for some length from the traditional classic standards , although retaining the methods of the Chinese stage , dramatic authors and actors of the present try to in - fluence thought by portraying scenes that have a distinct political or social significance , teaching by example and holding up the mirror to the life of the present .

		Liang Chi-chao attempted to familiarize the popular mind with ideas of political change by dramatizing the reconstruction of
Italy	LOCATION	, bringing forward
Mazzini	PERSON	,
Garibaldi	PERSON	, and
Cavour	PERSON	as characters on the stage . ''

		And again : '' It is interesting to see how books , which with us had done their work a hundred years ago , and which are now resting as pensioned veterans on our library shelves , assume gain in these distant regions the character of potent revo - lutionary forces .

		Their thoughts , which we coolly study and analyze as historical data , inflame the youth of
China	LOCATION	to heroic sacrifice and rash action in behalf of ideals which to them are blushing with the glory of the morning ' .

		So our now rather sedate friends ,
Rousseau	PERSON	and
Tom Paine	PERSON	, experience a new birth and enter again upon a state of militancy . ''

		A chapter on '' The New Education in
China	LOCATION	'' out - lines the development of the present system and points out the difficulties , financial , political , and technical , which hinder its sound advance .

		And a third chapter gives the best account we have seen of the movement for a parliament , describing each step down to the formation of a cabinet last
May	DATE	.

		The remaining chapters evidence the same extensive knowledge , keen insight , and sympathetic considera - tion and they should prove of invaluable service in furthering a better understanding of the important movements now active in the
Far East	LOCATION	.

		It would be extremely difficult , perhaps impossible , for an inves - tigator so far from his field to study so difficult a subject were he not assisted by men on the ground .

		It is a striking tribute to the extent and strength of Professor
Reinsch	PERSON	's influence that throughout the entire Orient former students , trained in his class - room , have been of service in the gathering of the material which he has used so effectively .

		l.y Mr. .


Joseph King < Joodrieh	PERSON	.

		This book is concerned largely with the relations between
China	LOCATION	and the powers , notably the I ` nited States and
Japan	LOCATION	, past , present , and future .

		Long before the reader has finished the volume he will have found many instances of erroneous and careless statements , of frequent repetitions , and of arguments without conclusions .

		Of the many errors in state - ments of fact and chronology , enumeration is need - less .

		Persons familiar with the recent literatim concerning
China	LOCATION	will be surprised to find , at this date , the '' Letters of a Chinese Official '' frequently referred to as the work of a Chinese statesman .

		Far different from Professor
Reinsch	PERSON	's cosmopolitanism is the bitter antipathy of Mr.
Goodrich	PERSON	for
Japan	LOCATION	.

		It seems to be difficult for Westerners to see the good points of both the Chinese and the Japanese , but Mr.
Goodrich	PERSON	carries his prejudices to an ex - treme .

		A discussion of the opium evil covers almost an entire chapter .

		We are told that `` The assistance that the
United States	LOCATION	can and ought to render to
China	LOCATION	in religious instruction , general education , manufacturing and industrial development , railways , and all other branches , is as nothing compared with what is an absolute obligation in the matter of opium , if we are to uphold our reputation for civilization '' ; but nowhere is it explained what the
United States	LOCATION	should do or can do to meet this '' obligation . ''

		The volume contains thirty-two illustrations .

		Two rather exceptional travel books merit more attention than can be given in a review of this na - ture .

		Not content with ascending the Yangtze and with following the Great Wall from the desert to the sea .

		Dr.
William Edgar Geil	PERSON	set for himself a third feat , the visiting of each of `` The Eighteen Capitals of
China	LOCATION	. ''

		The difficult task was performed a year ago , apparently for the first time by a
Wes	PERSON	- terner , and a large volume contains some of the in - formation gathered during its execution .

		Each of the capitals is described with varying completeness , considerable information is offered concerning mis - sionary enterprise and the many signs of progress , and many extracts from the local annals or literature are given .

		In addition to seventeen of the provincial capitals there is an account of
Nanking	LOCATION	, the capital of the
Liang-Kiang Viceroyalty	ORGANIZATION	, and of Peking , the '' Capital of Capitals , '' which is treated as the real capital of
Chihli	LOCATION	, rather than Paoting or Tientsin .

		Typical of the general treatment is the chapter de - voted to
Wuchang	LOCATION	, which figures so prominently in the recent dispatches .

		The Chinese ideograph for Wuchang , which signifies '' Military Splendor , '' is given .

		Then follows a brief description of the city , and of
Hanyang	LOCATION	and Hankow , across the Yan .

		in which are incorporated several local incidents ,
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 89 and an account of the rise of
Chang Chih Tung	PERSON	, the great Viceroy of Hu-Kwang .

		And , finally , several pages are devoted to the educational work of the local missionaries .

		The volume contains 139 illus - trations and maps of several of the cities , while at the top of many of the pages are Chinese proverbs in the ideograph and in translation .

		Dr.
Geil	PERSON	has again supplied a mass of information which should prove very useful now that the whole world is tak - ing a course in Chinese geography .

		Different in every way was the expedition plan - ned by Mr.
Edwin J. Dingle	PERSON	one evening in
Singa	LOCATION	- pore .

		A trained journalist in need of a holiday , Mr.
Dingle	PERSON	determined to see
China	LOCATION	from the inside '' ere modernity had robbed her and her wonderful people of their isolation and antediluvianism . ''

		His book , '' Across
China	LOCATION	on Foot , '' shows how well he succeeded .

		Up the Yangtze he proceeded by steamer to
Ichang	LOCATION	, and then through the famous gorges and rapids in a small river-boat to Chung-king .

		There he outfitted for his tramp across Szechwan and Yunnan to
Bhamo	LOCATION	, in upper
Burma	LOCATION	, a stretch of some 1600 miles .

		With the exception of a few miles when he rode in order to have the company of a well-informed missionary , this entire journey was made on foot .

		At times , for appearance 's sake , it was necessary to hire a chair to accompany him , though never used ; and later he secured a pony to be available in ease of need , which , on the second day , broke his arm with a too well-directed kick .

		The narrative , written from day to day on a type - writer which caused endless amazement to the in - quisitive Chinese , gains in vividness over any loss of style .

		It tells of hard marches toward the end of the journey through a wonderful mountain country with constant climbings and descents , of poverty-stricken people , of squalid lodgings and wretched food , of unexpected signs of progress even in the remote regions , and of the splendid work of the scattered missionaries .

		To the latter frequent reference is made .

		`` In all my journeyings in Yun - nan I was increasingly impressed with the value of the missionary , that man who of all men in the
Far East	LOCATION	is the most subject to malicious criticism , and generally , be it said , from those persons who know little or nothing about his work . ''

		And speaking of opium , the journalist who had formerly defended the drug now acknowledges his error . ''

		No language of mine now can exaggerate the evil , and if I would be honest , I can not describe it as anything but
China	LOCATION	's most awful curse . ''

		The very fact that a stranger , entirely unfamiliar with the language , could make such a journey through the interior of
China	LOCATION	speaks well for the innate kindliness of the people .

		Were he a linguist or an explorer , better equipped with instruments and other facilities , Mr.
Dingle	PERSON	might have given a more substantial contribution to our knowledge of little-known lands and peoples ; but this was not his intention , and he has succeeded admirably in giving us an interesting account of a difficult feat , as well as the observations of a trained journalist upon present conditions in western
China	LOCATION	.

		The volume contains 107 excellent illustrations , and a map .

		Within a year , three volumes have been devoted to the life of the great Empress Dowager of
China	LOCATION	.

		From the earlier accounts of Mrs.
Headland	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Conger	PERSON	,
Miss Carl	PERSON	, and a few other favored West - erners , some knowledge had been gained of the more intimate life of
Tzu Hsi	ORGANIZATION	; but now we have an account written by her favorite lady-in-waiting who served during
1903	DATE	and
1904	DATE	.

		The Princess Der Ling is the daughter of Lord
Yu Keng	PERSON	, a promi - nent Manchu official , who had served as Minister to
Japan	LOCATION	, President of the Tsung-li-yamen , and Min - ister to
France	LOCATION	.

		His daughters were mainly edu - cated in
Paris	LOCATION	during their residence of four years , and on their return to
China	LOCATION	, the
Empress Dowager	ORGANIZATION	was so pleased with their talents that she invited mother and daughters to become members of her court .

		Thus this western-trained Manchu young woman gained a personal knowledge of the Dowager and of the court far superior to any available to us at the present time .

		The story is well told , and the life of the court , with its constant round of duties and pleasures , the kindliness and at times the sever - ity of the Empress , and the pathetic situation of the Emperor , are charmingly described .

		It is interest - ing to read the palace version of the interviews with the foreign ministers ' wives , and of the painting of the
Dowager	ORGANIZATION	's portrait by Miss
Carl	PERSON	.

		An incident illustrative of the very human qualities of the old ruler may be cited here .

		During the
Dragon Boat Festival	ORGANIZATION	, when all the high officials and members of the court made presents to the Empress Dowager , '' Her Majesty was very angry with one of the wives of a certain Prince because her presents were the poorest ... She told us to measure the silks and ribbons in that tray , and leave it in the hall .

		The ribbons were all of different lengths , all too short to trim a gown , and the dress materials were not of good quality .

		Her
Majesty	PERSON	said to me : ' Now you look for yourself .

		Are these good presents ?

		I know very well all these things were given to them by other peo - ple , and they of course would select the best for themselves , and give me what was left .

		They know they are obliged to send me something .

		I am surprised to see how careless they are .

		Probably they thought I receive so many presents I would not notice .

		They are mistaken , for I notice the poor - est the first ; in fact , I can remember everything .

		I can see those who gave me things in order to please me , and those who gave them because they were obliged to .

		I will return them the same way . ' ''

		Twenty-two illustrations , principally from photo - graphs taken within the palaces , add to the value of this very interesting book .

		Timely indeed is Miss
Margaret E. Burton	PERSON	's care - ful study of `` The Education of Women in
China	LOCATION	, '' for the future of that land depends in no small degree upon the influence of the wives and mothers of the men of the coming generations .

		Such a study is , naturally , concerned mainly with the efforts of Western missionaries , although more recently gov - ernment and private schools for women have been established .

		The development of women 's educa - tion is described , from the days when , in the face of almost insurmountable difficulties , a few frightened children were tempted into the mission schools , to the 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, present time when the successors of those scholars are now in demand throughout the Empire as lead - era of the new movement .

		And , as Miss
Barton	PERSON	well points out , the opportunity is now presented for strengthening the Christian schools , which may serve as models for the government and gentry schools .

		The volume contains sixteen illustration from photo - graphs .

		ne

1900	DATE	, those who knew him have been awaiting the appearance of his life and letters .

		Professor
Tyler	PERSON	's daughter , Mrs.
Austen	PERSON	, has now partially fulfilled these expecta - tions with a volume entitled ''
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	, 1835-1900 : Selections from his Letters and Dia - ries '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In some respects the work is disappointing .

		Professor
Tyler	PERSON	was not a voluminous letter-writer , and many letters written to him are lacking in special significance .

		Some of the entries in the diary , too , are not of general in - terest ; and the volume would have been more valu - able had it been made smaller .

		The editorial work is very far from what we should expect of the daughter of a careful and brilliant scholar .

		Decid - edly poor taste has been shown in the selection of materials : some of the harsh opinions expressed will do no good to the reputation of their author , who prob - ably intended nothing more than to let off some in - dignation of the passing moment .

		For example , the unfavorable comments -LRB- p. 250 -RRB- on the late Presi - dent
C. K. Adams	PERSON	, who can no longer defend him - self , should have been omitted ; there may have been , moreover , something to say on his side .

		Some pass - ages which can not fail to give pain to living persons are likewise retained , while names of persons wholly unimportant or of whom only good is spoken are carefully suppressed .

		Not all of the letter or diary allusions are adequately introduced or explained ; e.g. ,
Dean Huff	PERSON	cut 's letter on page 305 .

		A good biography of Professor
Tyler	PERSON	has yet to be written .

		Typographically , too , the book is hardly creditable to those concerned .

		In spite of these serious defects , the volume will prove interesting reading , and will be welcomed by the many ad - mirers of Professor Tyler .

		It reveals the growth of his mind ; the problems that confronted him ; the trials that beset his literary life ; the determination with which he clung to his ideals of scholarly activity and authorship .

		It is interesting to note the differ - ent careers that tempted him at various times : the Christian ministry ; the editorship of `` The Even - ing Post , '' in
1874	DATE	; the presidency of
Cornell	LOCATION	, in
1880	DATE	; and professorial chairs at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	and
Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		One regrets that he did not bring to fruition more of the literary projects that he conceived ; yet as it was , in the influence he exerted over hundreds of students , and in his noble volumes of literary his - tory , he left a monument that will long endure .

		Art a an ^ T ' ^ ''
March-Phillips	PERSON	's `` Art and expreition of Environment '' is a distinctly sugges - environment .

		t j ve an j helpful book upon the inter - pretation of art as an expression of the collective human mind , working under the combined socialized force of a national consciousness .

		The author 's conception is not new ; but as a distinct thesis , consistently carried out , it has not received the explicit elaboration here accorded it .

		To most writers on art , the art product has appealed first as an aesthetic content , with secondary reference to art as the expression of the mind acted upon strongly by the environment .

		Architecture naturally car - ries the illustrative burden of the theme ; since it is the most national expression , the most collect - ively enduring record , in the language of art .

		Egypt furnishes the first example , and that largely negative .

		It is the tyranny of the Nile that made Egyptian culture and its art .

		Conventional ripid - ity of an untrained mind , not yet imbued with the aesthetic temper , forced into stone the `` mentally archaic '' immovable civilization .

		The Greek wax art-conscious through and through .

		Intellect was awakened , sensitive and responsive ; filled with an ideal of life that was essentially aesthetic , the classic purity of a Greek temple became and remained the expression of restrained lucidity of proportion .

		The Arab introduces an Oriental motive of mystic elab - oration , but fantastic , flimsy , transitory .

		Roman dominion appears in the widespread u.-e of the arch for all purposes , great as engineering , yet limited in originality , and unable quite to develop the arch to its possibilities because of the conservative allegiance to the lintel construction .

		By contrast , the -LRB-
Jnthic	ORGANIZATION	expresses the freedom of unrestraint , and the eml.ndi - ment of energy striving vertically in every
spring	DATE	of vault , every stress and strain of column and girder and buttress , a democratic pervasive movement .

		The Renaissance brings back with altered meaning
1912	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 91 the dominance of the intellect , and the assertion of spiritual breadth of meaning .

		The later French expressions of an aristocratic social class , glittering , idle , hollow , fatally negligent of reality , are all re - flected in the furniture and the art of the salon of the day .

		The thesis seems bare and crude thus reduced to a skeleton ; but as carried out by Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	, the story is full of life and vigor .

		It leaves the definite impression that for certain phases of life art is the most effective , the most significant , the most illuminating expression of that composite cul - tural movement that history aims to fix in an intel - ligible record .

		This seems less manifest to modern life , which has enthroned the reason with its prac - tical gifts , and drifted away from the larger cultural expressions in which the acquired skill of tools can - not compensate the loss of the inner sense of a crowd - ing purpose , an illuminating message .

		The value of this interpretation depends upon the skill of the interpreter ; in this Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	is successful , with occasional lapses due to an impatience of detail , a too hurried preparation of his material .

		The book will find its place as a clear exposition of the import - ant view that art is a language of the mind .

Scribner	PERSON	in a volume of two hundred pages , Dr.
Thomas R. Lounsbury	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	discusses `` The Early Literary Career of
Robert Browning	PERSON	. ''

		The primary purpose of the work is to assemble the facts bearing upon
Browning	PERSON	's reception by the public and by the press during the first thirteen years -LRB- 1833-1846 -RRB- of his practical production .

		The gen - eralization from these facts is , that
Browning	PERSON	's wel - come was a more cordial one than is commonly given to youthful poets ; that the indifference and neglect which soon followed were largely his own fault ; that the remarkable and peculiar revival of his reputation during the closing years of his life was due mainly to the formation of the
London	LOCATION
Browning Society	ORGANIZATION	in
1881	DATE	and the innumerable branches which sprang from it all over
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		Thus , in the concluding chapter , the author goes far beyond the '' early '' period , beyond any '' facts '' indeed , and enters into the realm of prophecy .

		Although rejoicing that
Browning	PERSON	died happy in the fulness of his fame , he asserts that this reputation was largely factitious , without the element of permanence , and not based primarily on his writings as literature .


Browning	PERSON	is supremely the poet of intellectually acute but unpoetical na - tures .

		Accordingly , with a body of young and promising students -LRB- and doubtless here the author speaks from personal experience -RRB- it would as a general rule be much easier to arouse interest in
Browning	LOCATION	than in almost any other great author of our speech .

		While they are doing little more than unraveling the meaning of linguistic puzzles , they honestly believe that the interest they take in what they are reading is due to their enjoyment of it as poetry pure and simple .

		As coming generations re - cede more and more from
Browning	PERSON	's day , they will tend more and more to revolt from the unwar - ranted and exaggerated praise that has been given to his poorest work .

		And while there are poems of his which will never cease to be cherished as long as English literature endures , poems that will carry his name down to remotest posterity , these are the very ones that are the least representative of him in the eyes of no small number of his pres - ent admirers .

		On the first page of the present book , however , Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	absolves the reader from acceptance of his critical opinions , since time alone can prove or disprove their correctness .

		What he does wish to accomplish is to oust the mythical from the authentic in the first eighteen years of
Browning	PERSON	's authorship , and to set in due order and proportion a body of incontrovertible facts .

		This he has done with such a fascinating and easy grace as to placate even those of us who would like to quarrel with his logic and his prophecy .

		a European Years : The Letters of an Idle Man , '' genially introduced , rather than edited , by Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	, and published in faultless style by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the front cover is the further inscription , `` Familiar Letters of a Bos - tonian Living Abroad . ''

		The letters range in time from
1876	DATE	to
1904	DATE	, and in space -LRB- or place of writ - ing -RRB- from
Dresden	LOCATION	all around the world to
Dresden	LOCATION	again , but are written chiefly in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Switzerland	LOCATION	, where the writer and his wife are on the continual move in quest of agreeable and salu - brious climatic conditions and a moderate degree of diversion , at a not too immoderate price .

		The `` humble loiterer , '' as the correspondent calls him - self , is a
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	graduate , unmistakably a gentle - man and a scholar , an Epicurean and an agnostic in his philosophy and religion , so far as he has any such , and a most engaging , pleasantly anecdotic , humorous-whimsical sort of person , frankly avowing his weariness of sight-seeing and his keen interest in the cuisine , the wines , and the beds of the suc - cessive hotels visited by him in his many years of genteel vagrancy .

		The book abounds in shrewd comments on men and events , and occasionally on literature too , as where he says , upon the appear - ance of `` Mr.
Isaacs	PERSON	, '' that the author `` is very clever ; but his style is not the style of a master ; he just misses being a genius . ''

		Sound sense , a keep - ing of both feet on the ground , a distrust of the higher altitudes , a sort of resolute content with the Horatian view of life , as indicated by frequent quo - tations from and allusions to
Horace	PERSON	these and other interesting and ingratiating qualities are found in the letters , which , by the way , are nearly all ad - dressed to a fellow-Bostonian at home .

		Good letters they are indeed , and worthy of Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's warm praise ; but his denying of high excellence to any earlier American letter-writers -LRB- he says , '' I do 92 THE DIAI .

		-LSB-
Feb. 1	DATE	, not recall any -LSB- good letters -RSB- by an American writer '' -RRB- seems rather unjust .

		depicted in trueeoiort .

		, '' The True
Daniel Webster	PERSON	, the latest addition to `` The True Biographies Series '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , is a readable and worthy life of the great orator and expounder of the Constitution .

		While it is not altogether free from the self-righteous assumption of superior candor and regard for truth implied in the title of the series , there is not much of this element .

		Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	has not written a formal biography in chronological order , but he has described the man and his achievements clearly and with suffi - cient fulness for the general reader .

		In five hundred closely-printed pages we have not only the important facts of
Webster	PERSON	's career but enough ef contemporary events and conditions to give the story vitality and to make clear the relations of the subject to the great developments of the country during his time .

		Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	is no hero-worshipper ; he does not present the `` godlike
Daniel	PERSON	'' so much as '' Black
Dan	PERSON	. ''

		But he sets the man before us in a very satisfactory manner , and a most attractive man he shows him to be .

		He repels the slanders heaped upon
Webster	PERSON	by his poli - tical enemies , making it clear that
Webster	PERSON	was not a habitual drunkard or a drunkard at all ; that he was not a loose liver ; that he was honest and honorable in all relations , though careless in the use of his money and willing to accept large gifts from his ad - mirers .

		But the author shows further that in doing this last
Webster	PERSON	was but following the example of many of the greatest of Englishmen ,
Burke	PERSON	and
Fox	ORGANIZATION	, for example ; and there have been other great American leaders who have not refused similar financial help from their supporters .

		We could wish that
Webster	PERSON	had spent more carefully the great sums his profession brought him , and had thus kept himself out of the difficulties from which his friends were glad to help him ; but that the acceptance of these large gifts changed his attitude toward public questions one can hardly believe who comes to know the real character of the man .

		Another error that Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	combats is that
Webster	PERSON	put ambition before duty and shaped his course with an eye to the presidency .

		He did desire the presidency , but he must have been very dull if he thought he could gain it by defying his own party in remaining in
Tyler	LOCATION	's cabinet when that party had repudiated
Tyler	PERSON	, or by taking a position in his `` Seventh of
March	DATE	speech '' that was sure to bring upon him the hostility of every radical anti-slavery man in the North while it could not win the support of the South .

		The charming pictures of
Webster	PERSON	's private life , of his love for his oxen and for the sea , of his hospitality and his friends , are most attractive , and of more worth to the reader than the accounts of his triumphs at the bar , in the senate , and in diplomacy .

		Incidentally the author indulges in many samixtir flings at present - day education , and at the alx > litionists who purHued
Webster	PERSON	relent !

		< .

		, ly lirfore and after his death be - cause he did not follow them to the limit of their theories .


Webster	PERSON	is one of the great figures of our history , and it is well to have this new biography to depict his greatness to a new generation of readers and to show clearly that he was free from many of the gross shortcomings which political opponents have laid to his charge .

		`` All men are interested in M. .

		n - toi & ne in P ^ P ^ on as all men find more of themselves in him , '' ob - served
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	.

		Are we finding more of ourselves in the skepticism of that great French - man , the forerunner of the skepticism of
Monsieur Anatole France ?	ORGANIZATION

		Or is it merely our interest in personal literature that has called forth the many recent biographies and critical studies ?

		It would be good to know whether the Essays are being called for more frequently in the bookstores ; whether we are really `` getting at '' the prince of skeptics .

		For any study of
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	, the many-sided , is after all no more than a study in the autobiography of the critic himself ; to express the whole of that varied personality would require all the matter of the Essays , even that which seems most irrelevant .

		How can we reduce to a synthesis a writer who after a life of introspection could not perform that task ?

		How can we abbreviate , when the very inconsequence of
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's pages is so expressive of Montaigne ?

		So it is that no abridgement of this material can give the fullest reflection of that undulant person - ality .

		Of course , we must have books on
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	, if in this age of hurry we are to win for him readers who will seek him out in all his discursiveness ; but let us by all means have in such books the very words of our subject : let the author give way to Montaigne wherever possible , without a care lest the smoothness of his paragraph - rhythm In - marred thereby .

		Such a book is Miss
Edith Sichel	PERSON	's `` Michel de Montaigne '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , an admirable introduction to its subject .

		It will give the general student a good idea of
Montaigne	LOCATION	, and a desire to know more of him .

		Packed with quotations , the narrative is almost reduced to a setting , the re - ferences to the Essays being given at the foot of the page .

		Apart from this , the work contains no apparatus for the student , excepting a bibliography which , as the author confesses , is mainly the work of Mr.
Thomas Seccombe	PERSON	.

		The literary and even the historical background is slighted rather more than one would like , even in an Introduction ; and the biography itself falls below Professor
Dowden	PERSON	> in wealth of detail and critical acumen .

		But how can one do justice to such a Protean figure , even by massing the material under such loose divisions as Montaigne the Man '' and '' Montaigne the Phi - losopher '' ?

		There is more than one man in that genius of second thoughts ; and , like every one of us , he had more than one rule philosophy .

		THE DIAL 93 Crime it *
American Institute of Criminal	ORGANIZATION	causes and Law is advancing the scientific study remedies .

		o f cr i me by publishing in English the more important contributions to the foreign liter - ature of the subject -LRB- `` Modern Criminal Science Series '' : Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is natural that they should include the work of
Lombroso	LOCATION	, an acknowledged leader in the subject .

		His last work , bearing the title '' Crime : Its Causes and Rem - edies , '' which represents his mature views and gives a comprehensive survey of the field , has been selected for inclusion .

		It is divided into three sections devoted to the causes and conditioning influences of crime , to the measures of treatment and prevention , and to the general conceptions and systems of penology which by their scientific worth must in the end shape practice .

		Lombroso is most popularly known as the defender of the theory of the criminal type as a recognizable and abnormal deviation of human variety .

		His first presentation of the subject has been modified by a due recog - nition of the many other factors which enter into the formation of the criminal and of the distinct varieties of criminal classes , some of them close to and some remote from the degenerate type .

		All this is well set forth in the present volume , and well balanced by the important sections devoted to the accounts of measures dealing with the criminal and the prevention of crime .

		In a measure crimi - nology has found a freer field in
America	LOCATION	; and our willingness to try innovations and to feel and reason our way to a humanitarian attitude towards the problem has made it easier to get away from the mere machinery of justice , as well as from prejudice , and to face the issues squarely on their merits .

		In this instance humanitarianism , like honesty , has proved to be the best and the cheap - est policy .

		Out of the many-sided presentation of facts often , it is true , too crudely stated and too much isolated from the environment that gives them meaning there emerges a clearer conception of the nature of the problem and of the standards of efficiency by which practical measures must be judged .

		The accessibility of
Lombroso	PERSON	's volume will prove a welcome aid to English and American students of crime in its many aspects .


Panama	LOCATION	.

		- its The impending opening of the canal and trans-isthmian canal as a result of its people .

		fae splendid work now in progress under government direction at
Panama	LOCATION	renders opportune Mr.
Albert Edwards	PERSON	's volume entitled ''
Panama	LOCATION	: The Canal , the Country , and the People '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The work contains a narrative of personal observations of the men at work and the methods in vogue in the canal zone , of the sluggish untrustworthy native , of the adjacent republic , and of the impenetrable and all-pervading jungle that possesses the land and reappropriates it over-night .

		The greater part of the book is of a historical na - ture , relating the early history of Spanish discovery , colonization , extermination of the natives , and gen - eral devastation and misrule ; of the days of Balboa sacrificed to the petty intrigue of his rivals on the eve of discovery of
Peru	LOCATION	, of
Pizarro	PERSON	and the days of the great trade during the spoliation of the Incas , of
Drake	PERSON	and
Morgan	PERSON	, and of lapse and decay with the decline of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The author draws freely on Irving and
Hubert Bancroft	PERSON	for the material ac - count of this period .

		The later period of French enterprise and failure and of the revolution and birth of the new republic of
Panama	LOCATION	are related from available sources .

		The author does his best to extricate the
United States	LOCATION	from the embarrass - ing position in which it was plunged by the vacil - lation and extortionate demand of
Colombia	LOCATION	, and its own precipitate shaping of a bargain with the mush - room republic .

		In breezy newspaper style he gives a very interesting and informing account of the su - perb work in sanitation in the canal zone which has made possible the effective construction of the canal , of the splendid esprit de corps prevalent on the big job , and of the unique experiment in collective en - terprise , in government control of railroad , of com - missary , and in fact of everything pertaining to the life of the forty thousand souls in the motley popu - lation of the canal zone .

Revell	PERSON	-RRB- is a collection of letters , originally published in the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Tribune . ''

		Mr.
Patterson	PERSON	was for many years a well-known news - paper correspondent in
Washington	LOCATION	, D. C .

		It was during one of his periodical tours through the coun - try that he wrote these letters from the heart of the lower South .

		They have been revised for publica - tion by Mrs.
Patterson	PERSON	and an introductory letter is contributed by President
Taft	PERSON	.

		Although based on actual observation , the studies included are not pre - tentious , but are simply readable accounts of condi - tions in the South as seen by a Northern man of liberal views .

		Mr.
Patterson	PERSON	arranges his studies into three divisions : first , the complexities of the problem are stated ; second , existing conditions are described ; and third , solutions are suggested and conclusions drawn .

		Much of the material included in the first division is not new to students of race problem literature , but the conventional facts in re - gard to numbers , morality , environment , and tem - perament are stated somewhat in a fresh way .

		The best part of the book is devoted to descriptions of conditions actually observed by the writer .

		Here , for example , he makes clear the very great differences which exist within the South itself : the differences , for example , between Tensas parish in
Louisiana	LOCATION	with a population almost wholly black and a hill county in
Georgia	LOCATION	with few negroes .

		These com - munities are as unlike as it is possible for two places to be , and yet each has its race problem , the condi - tions of which are very different and the attempted solutions of which must be very different .

		The author 's opinions are liberal and his statements of facts are accurate .

		The book as a whole shows a 94 THE DIAL -LSB- Fek 1 .

		With such almost appallingly ancient libraries and librarians does Dr.
Ernest Gushing Richardson	PERSON	of the
Princeton University Library	ORGANIZATION	concern himself in a small book of exceptional interest to all curious delvers into ancient bibliothecal history .

		`` Some Old Egyptian Librarians '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- contains the paper of that title read before the

September	DATE	, with an important supplementary paper which the exigencies of the occasion had excluded from the address , a useful account of the available sources for inquirers in this Held , and a full index to the book as a whole .

		It will add dignity to the profession to have it under - stood that , as the writer makes clear , the god Thoth , among his many other attributes , was the god of libraries , and
Seshait	PERSON	was the goddess of libraries , or '' Mistress of the Hall of Books , '' as she is de - scribed on the base of one door of the Ramesseum library , while Thoth of course is '' Lord of the Hall of Books , '' on the other .

Stevenson	PERSON	himself .

		Of course there are numerous other pictures of him , for he seems to have had his compatriot
Carlyle	PERSON	's readiness to pose for his portrait ; and there are also many striking views of
California	LOCATION	scenery .

		Considering that
Stev	PERSON	- enson 's

Osbourne	PERSON	has made the most of her theme .

Stevenson	PERSON	's death , and of the son 's final fare - well to

		Few men have been subject to greater trials , trials that rack the soul and body to the last notch .

		But such was the tenacity with which he clung to life that he succeeded in preserving himself and in saving the exposed photographic plates which serve to illustrate his story .

		Strand no THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 10	DATE	, A WORD WITH THE LIBRARIAN C One of the most marked characteristics of the intelligent public of to-day is its interest in the Theatre an interest that the librarian can easily guage by the current demand for literature having to do with the Stage .

		C .

		This tendency deserves fostering on every account .

		One obvious way to foster it is to place before your readers the most original and suggestive book about the Theatre published in years .

		C That book is
E. GORDON CRAIG	PERSON	'S '' ON THE ART OF THE THEATRE . ''

		C .

		This is not a treatise on scene-painting , or a manual of first aid to stage managers , or a textbook on the art of acting .

		It is , rather , a series of brilliant and fascinating papers embodying a revolutionary arraignment of the Theatre as it is , and a new and noble conception of the Theatre as it might be .

		Its appeal is not to the technician but to the layman to everyone who goes to the Theatre or takes an intelligent interest in it .

		C .

		The publishers of this book are naturally enthusiastic about it , but not more so than the reviewers and perhaps you will consider the latter more impartial .

		At any rate , it will be worth your while to read what some of them say about it . ''

		Here is a man of genius and his book ... Mr.
Craig	PERSON	is acknowledged all over
Europe	LOCATION	as a master-pioneer in the Theatre .

		... If anyone doubts his genius , they have only to read this book of his .

		It is instinct with genius .

		On every page are illuminating flashes of thought , vista-visions , tangential flights of fancy , that betray a mind entirely different from that of the ordinary pedestrian thinker . ''

		The Nation -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		`` The book is dynamic .

		Whether one follow Mr.
Craig	PERSON	or not to the end of the trail he blazes , this book is one of the timeliest chances that could befall the young playwrights of our own country , scattered and unsupported as they are , without a common watch-word .

		And whether this book stimulates to fellow-work or opposition matters little enough .

		It is bound to shake us all broad awake , with the shock and challenge of unquestionable genius . ''

		JOSEPHINE
PRESTON PEABODY	PERSON	-LRB- Author of `` The Piper '' , .

		`` Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's book is tingling with force and radiant with health .

		It is full of courage , not only in attack , but also in adventure .

		... It is a vital book ... invigorating and inspiring ... Every word leaps from the page with all the dynamic nobility of creative force ... He has analyzed the evil of the theatre and stated it with a fearlessness infinitely refreshing in these days of timid thought , speech , writing , and criticism stated it also with charm and disinterestedness . ''

		The Observer -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		44 If the stage were not soggy with inutile traditions , such a book as
Gordon Craig	PERSON	's volume would create a revolution ... Serious craftsmen of the theatre and hopeful lovers of the theatre will take it to heart as a momentous and stimulating volume . ''

THE CHICAGO OPERA SEASON	ORGANIZATION	.

		The public-spirited citizens whose faith and enterprise made possible the existence of the
Chicago Grand Opera Company	ORGANIZATION	have excellent reasons for congratulating themselves and all others concerned in the undertaking .

		The sec - ond season of the organization ended on the first of this month , and the receipts for the ten weeks have come close to meeting the expenses .

		Based upon the accounts of these ten weeks alone , a deficit of a few thousand dollars ap - pears , but the amount is trifling when considered in relation to the total budget of half a million .

		Even this deficit will probably disappear when reckoning is made of certain miscellaneous revenues , such as the receipts from occasional flights out of town , and from rentals for the Auditorium Theatre , which the company leases for the whole year .

		Last year 's balance-sheet showed a deficit of approximately twenty per cent , which came out of the pockets of the guar - antors ; this year they have had to pay practi - cally nothing for their disinterested endeavor to do the public an important artistic service .

		The reasons for this satisfactory measure of financial success in what seemed at the outset a precarious venture are numerous and varied .

		The competent direction of Mr.
Andreas Dippel	PERSON	accounts for much of it ; much also must be credited to the artists whom he enlisted in the enterprise .

		The superb musicianship of
Signor Cleofonte Campanini	PERSON	is responsible for a great deal , for in such matters as balance of tone and unity of effect the artistic results which he achieved were maintained at a high level of excellence , and , at their best , were almost beyond praise .

		A word should also be said for Mr.
Alfred Szendrei	PERSON	, who conducted a few German works , and whose readings were of exceptional beauty .

		Among the principals ,
Miss Mary Garden	ORGANIZATION	was the popular favorite , and her suc - cess , although based more upon histrionism than upon vocalization , was on the whole well de - served .

		In the chorus , we had a collection of fresh voices of a quality to which our operatic stage has not been accustomed , admirably trained to sing in the three languages which the stand - ard repertory demands .

		The cooperation of the newspaper press was unremitting and cordial , impressing the merits of the undertaking irre - 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Peb	ORGANIZATION	, 16 , sistibly upon the public mind .

		The reviewers , among whom those accomplished musicians , Messrs.
Gunn	PERSON	,
Hackett	PERSON	, and
Borowski	PERSON	, call in particular for honorable mention , had a free hand , and wrote about the performances with discriminating intelligence .

		Lastly , '' society '' smiled upon its new operatic toy , and was mar - shalled
night after night	TIME	in dazzling array , thus performing two useful functions that of filling the coffers of the company , and that of luring many thousands outside the fold to become witnesses of the spectacle .

		It now seems to be established beyond per - adventure that
Chicago	LOCATION	is willing to pay fifty thousand dollars a week for ten weeks if in re - turn for the payment it can get the right sort of opera .

		What the right sort is depends , first , upon the artistic features to which we have called attention , and , second , upon the list of the works produced .

		Mr.
Dippel	PERSON	has been highly successful in guessing what the public wants .

		He has given us twenty-four works in seventy - eight performances , `` Carmen , '' '' Cendrillon , '' and I -LRB- i ioj , 11 i della Madonna '' heading the list with six performances each .

		Eight other works have been given four or five times each .

		Thirty - six of the performances have been in French , twenty in Italian , and the others in either Ger - man or English .

		This preponderance of French opera is to be accounted for by the endeavor to provide the public with novelties , rather than upon the assumption that French composers count for more than those of other nations .

		An even half of the French evenings were devoted to four works of M. Massenet a pretty com - poser but not a great one .

		One novelty the '' Quo Vadis ? ''

		of
M. Nougue	ORGANIZATION	`` s produced at great cost , failed to attract audiences large enough to make it worth while , and was withdrawn after four attempts to make it go .

		Among the Italian productions , the most noteworthy were those that gave
Chicago	LOCATION	its first hearing of
Signor Wolf	PERSON	-
Ferrari	ORGANIZATION	's '' II Segreto di Susanna '' and I Giojelli della Madonna . ''

		The former , a de - lightful short work of almost Mozartian inspira - tion , won the hearts of all its hearers ; the latter , which was given its first American production , was distinguished by the presence of the com - poser , who had come to
America	LOCATION	for the occasion of this premiere performance .


Signor Wolf	PERSON	-
Ferrari	ORGANIZATION	certainly had his innings , for , besides hearing his two operas , his cantata , La
Vita Nuova	PERSON	, '' was also sung at a
Sunday	DATE	concert .

		The ill-judged propaganda which has been con - ducted of late by the zealous but mistaken per - sons who think that all opera should be sung in the English language for English-speaking audi - ences drove an entering wedge into the work of the
Chicago	LOCATION	season .

		Mr.
Herbert	PERSON	's '' Natoma '' was , as of course it should be , sung in English .

		that being the language for which t lie music was written .

		But `` Hansel und Gretel '' is a differ - ent matter , and the best that can be said of the artistic perversion to which it was subjected is that the audiences hardly realized that they were listening to English words , and could understand only a small fraction of them .

		It is difficult to have any patience with people who would ruin the artistic effect of a lyrical drama by fitting its notes to a set of vowel and consonantal sounds which they were never meant to accompany , and the arguments by which this malpractice is sought to be justified are too feeble to deserve serious refutation .

		The fact that in
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Italy	LOCATION	, operas are sung in the lan - guages of the respective countries means only that
Europe	LOCATION	can not afford the cost of properly equipped opera companies ; in the
United States	LOCATION	, we have the immense advantage of being able and willing to bear this heavy expense , which is the reason why the performances given in
New York	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	are in most respects the best to be heard anywhere in the world .

		It will be a sad day for opera in this country when this manifest advantage is given up to placate a chauvinistic sentiment .

		The one obvious weakness of the season just ended has been its failure to provide suitably for German opera .

		Last year , not a single German work was given during the ten weeks ; this year , we have had eleven performances of '' Lohengrin , '' '' Die Walkiire , '' and '' Tristan und Isolde , '' five of `` Hansel und
Gretel	PERSON	, '' and two of '' Le Nozze di Figaro . ''

		This is something , but not nearly enough .

		No season should pass without the entire '' Ring , '' or without '' Die Meistersinger , '' or without '' Par - sifal . ''

		And the most divinely beautiful of all operatic works , Beethoven 's '' Fidelio , '' should be restored to the matter-of-course repertory , in order that a generation which knows it not may partake of the wonder of its revelation .

		What we have always endeavored to empha - size in our discussion of opera is its cultural importance as an art - form .

		For the most part .

		the masterpieces of painting and sculpture and architecture are to be seen only at the cost of much time and money spent in travel .

		But music , like literature , need not be sought afar , but comes to our very doors .

		It should be pos - sible for a student of the history of music to hear all of the great masterpieces at some time

		THE DIAL or other in his life without going very far from home .

		This possibility is by no means realized for us in the case of opera because it involves too great a risk in the minds of managers , who are bent only upon making their enterprises pay .

		Perhaps it never will be realized until the
State	ORGANIZATION	recognizes its obligation to foster this form of art by assuming the risks .

		But we think that private management is more timid than it need be , and that many a neglected work of high importance either by virtue of inherent beauty or of historical significance might be found commercially available .

		The craze for the new thing is what at present thwarts the wishes of the best friends of opera .

		Suppose , for example , that instead of four new works by so mediocre a composer as M. Massenet we had been given this year four very old works by
Gluck	PERSON	a genius the latchet of whose shoes few moderns are worthy to unloose would not the same lavish expenditure upon them of all our rich resources have borne fruit of the sort which the box-office craves ?

		And if the experiment had been tried and carried to success , how great would have been the glory ' ' enough for all '' to be shared by those whose faith had been justi - fied !

		This is but a single example ; many others might be brought forward .

		In respect of variety of opportunity , we were operatically better off in the bad old days of the `` star , '' and the shabby support , and the small orchestra , and the ragged chorus , and all the other '' unhappy far-off things '' that opera meant for the generation before our own .

		SCENERY AND THE WEATHER IN
DICKENS	LOCATION	.

		Scenery , for its own sake ,
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	rarely cared to describe .

		But no novelist ever attained a more complete mastery of the art of handling scenery and weather in relation to his characters or their actions .

		Throughout his stories , the natural background and conditions serve mainly to typify or emphasize the mood of the persons projected against the back - ground , or the action in which they are engaged .

		When Mr.
Pickwick	PERSON	and his friends go down to spend a happy Christmas at
Dingley Dell	ORGANIZATION	, the weather is cold , but bright and bracing and conducive to high spirits and famous appetites .

		It is winter , also , when the disgraced Lady Dedlock in ''
Bleak House	ORGANIZATION	'' wanders to her death ; but then the scene is laid in the freezing mud and slush of
London	LOCATION	, at the dawn of a bleak
December	DATE	day .

		The English fog , chiefly known perhaps -LRB- at least to Americans -RRB- through
Dickens	PERSON	's accounts of it , plays a prominent part in many of the novels .

		That '' Lon - don particular '' as the little attorney in '' Bleak House '' calls it , half out of affectionate pride drifts through the opening pages of '' A
Christmas Carol	PERSON	, '' sharpening Old Scrooge 's temper and serv - ing to intensify the bitter cold , while at the same time emphasizing the snug indoor comforts of Christmas Eve .

		At the beginning of '' Bleak House '' we enter an exceedingly thick fog , which , as claiming acquaintance with a kindred spirit , eddies round and pervades the
Court of Chancery	ORGANIZATION	.

		Indeed , fog and mist and rain seem to hover perpetually over the landscape in this novel .

		When not visible in
Lon	LOCATION	- don , they are sure to be at
Lady Dedlock	ORGANIZATION	's place down in
Lincolnshire	LOCATION	.

		The
Kentish	LOCATION	country , with its foggy marshes , is the scene of Pip 's early adven - tures in `` Great Expectations . ''

		When the child meets the convict in the old churchyard , the rime lies like spiders ' webs on the hedges and the grass , and a thick mist comes rolling up from the river .

		The cattle grazing on the marshes , the gates and dikes , all come rushing through the fog at the conscience-smitten little Pip , with the stolen pork pie in his pocket .

		One of the most memorable instances of
Dickens	PERSON	's power of using natural phenomena to symbolize and vivify his human plots occurs in the early pages of '' A Tale of Two Cities . ''

		It is that scene , in Dr.
Manette	PERSON	's house in
Soho	LOCATION	, where the Doctor and his daughter , with
Sidney Carton	PERSON	and
Darnay	PERSON	, sit by an open window in the dusk , while a thunderstorm slowly gathers outside .

		The house stands in a cor - ner of the square , `` a quaint corner , wonderful for echoes , a peculiar ear of a place .

		There are not only echoes of approaching steps , which seem to stop ; but also echoes of other steps that never come , dying away for good when they seem close at hand . ''

		The sense of impending storm hangs oppressively upon the little group . ''

		They spoke low , as people watching and waiting mostly do ; as people in a dark room , watching and waiting for Lightning , always do .

		There was a great hurry in the streets , of people speeding away to get shelter before the storm broke ; the wonderful corner for echoes re - sounded with the echoes of footsteps coming and going , yet not a footstep was there . ''

		With the ris - ing wind the echoes come fast and faster , and
Lucie	PERSON	speaks of her fanciful interpretation of them as '' the echoes of all the footsteps that are coming by-and-by into our lives . '' '' '

		I take them into mine ! '

		said Carton . '

		I ask no ques - tions and make no stipulations .

		There is a great crowd bear - ing down upon us ,
Miss Manette	PERSON	, and I see them by the Lightning . '

		He added the last words , after there had been a vivid flash which had shown him lounging in the window . '

		And I hear them ! '

		he added again , after a peal of thunder . '

		Here they come , fast , fierce , and furious ! '

		It was the rush and roar of rain that he typified , and it stopped him , for no voice could be heard in it .

		A memorable storm of thunder and lightning broke with that sweep of water , and there was not a moment 's interval in crash and fire and rain , until after the moon rose at
midnight	TIME	. '' '

		`` Good-night , Mr.
Carton	PERSON	, ' said the man of business .

		` Good - night , Mr.
Darnay	PERSON	.

		Shall we ever see such a night again , 116 THE DIAL -LSB- Fel > .

		16 , together ? '

		Perhaps .

		Perhaps , Me the great crowd of people with its rush and roar , bearing down upon them , too . ''

		Here , in prophetic Rymbolization , are indicated all the later events of the novel , the storm of tin - Revolution , involving and imperilling every member of the little group , the loud surging mobs of Saint
Antoine	PERSON	, Carton 's noble self-sacrifice .

		In the journeys by stage coach described in tin - various novels , there is generally either entire har - mony between the traveller 's sentiments and the feelings engendered by his surroundings , or else we find a sharply drawn contrast .

		When
Nicholas Nickleby	PERSON	goes down with
Squeers	PERSON	and some uncom - fortable small boys to
Dotheboy	ORGANIZATION	's Hall , it is bitter weather , hard enough to bear even were the trav - ellers in a cheerful frame of mind .

		But
Nicholas	PERSON	's heart is already depressed on account of his long distance from home and the more than dubious prospect before him ; and so the journey is for him a dismal one indeed .

		But later , when he has won a fortune and a wife , he travels down into
York	LOCATION	- shire again .

		The coach and inns and landscape are all just as they were before ; but how differently are they made to appear to him !

		A characteristic scene is that where
Ralph Nick	PERSON	- leby , with all his schemes brought to naught , and he himself on the way to take his own life , observes a certain black cloud in the overshadowed sky .

		It seems to follow him , `` coming slowly and mourn - fully up , like a shadowy funeral train . ''

		From the garret of his dreary house , he looks out of the win - dow foi the hist time , and sees this same sullen , gloomy mass , whose baleful meaning he has now come to know . ''

		Martin Chuzzlewit '' and '' Our Mutual Friend '' are the novels which doubtless display
Dickens	PERSON	at his best in this correlation of scenery and weather with the thoughts and actions of his characters .

		Mr.
Pecksniff	PERSON	and
Jonas Chuzzlewit	PERSON	make an excursion into the country on a lovely
spring	DATE
evening	TIME	.

		As they walk along past the silent fields , the odor of newly-turned earth , with a thousand other pleasant scents , is in the air and the smoke is rising slowly from the cottage chimneys . ''

		It was a time when most men cherish good resolves , and sorrow for the wasted past ; when most men , looking on the shadows as they gather , think of that evening which must close on all , and that to-morrow which has none beyond . ''

		But the cringing knave ,
Jonas Chuzzle	PERSON	- wit , who views this scene , has no such thoughts .

		His characteristic comment is , Precious dull !

		Enough to make a man go melancholy mad . ''

		And when this same villain journeys down to
Salisbury	LOCATION	, plot - ing to murder his associate , the furious storm which overtakes him forms a fit accompaniment to his own black thoughts . ''

		Our Mutual Friend '' presents a series of sombre pictures , in each of which the central figure is the passion-wasted schoolmaster ,
Bradley Headstone	PERSON	.

		He meets
Lizzie Hexam	PERSON	in a churchyard , on a grey , dusty , withered , autumnal evening in
London	LOCATION	, and declares his passion for her .

		The dreariness of the scene is in perfect tune with his mood , which is one alouHy and despair .

		We find him again at I ` la-hwat .

		- r \ \ .

		- ii Mill Lock , the appropriate lair of Rogue Riderhood up tin - river .

		This place is shown in the rain ; at twilight on a du-ai y winter 's day ; in the comfortless dawn .

		Hi-ad .

		stom - , drawing steadily toward the commission of hi - crime , stands one after - noon at the brink of the lock in the driving rain .

		The hlack clouds , rolling heavily toward one quar - ter of the heavens , hang like a dark curtain ht-hind him ; and his face , as Rider hood remarks , is like a ghost 's .

		After Headstone has attacked his rival and left him for dead , he returns to tin - lock-limiM - .

		reaching it before dawn .

		`` Stars were yet vi ^ ii.h - .

		but there was a dull light in the east that was not the light of night .

		Seen through the mist along tin - river , the trees were the ghosts of trees and tin - water was the ghost of water .

		The earth and the pale stars looked spectral ; while the cold eastern glare , expressionless , with the eye of the firmament quenched , might have been likened to the stare of the dead . ''

		Every phrase of this description of the night is made to impress upon the reader the thoughts and feelings which the scene gives rise to in the murderer 's breast .

		In numberless other instances , nature is thus made an accessory to human passion .

		But however sombre or joyous the scene may be ,
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	shows us that its vital interest for him was as a background for the characters which his genius created to charm and instruct the world .

		AUTHORS AND PUBLISHERS .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is the pleasing habit of a certain literary club in
London	LOCATION	to invite , once a week during the season , some distinguished man to be the guest of the even - ing .

		A theme is suggested for discussion , and the embarrassed stranger , after listening to hal f a coin m 1 1 of panegyric from the chairman , subdues his blushes , fortifies himself hastily with one final glass of tin - club champagne , and rises to reply to the toast of the evening .

		He is expected , in short , to pay for his dinner by providing a dissertation on tin - topic of the day ; but it not unfrequently happens that in his eagerness to disclaim all the admirable qualities attributed to him by the chairman he makes but a perfunctory reference to the subject so carefully selected by the secretary , and it is left to some later speaker to step into the breach .

		Some of these
Monday	DATE	dinners at the
Authors ' Club	ORGANIZATION	are interest - ing ; others are profoundly dull .

		The general stand - ard of after-dinner speaking in this country is not , perhaps , particularly lofty ; and good writers are frequently men to whom oratory is difficult .

		But when an author can speak , he can generally speak very well indeed : there is a literary lini.-h al > .

		.

		ut his style , a cadence in his sentences , a careful choice of words .

		Two of the best after-dinner speakers I
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 117 know are also well-known novelists , Mr.
Anthony Hope Hawkins	PERSON	and Mr.
Horace Annesley Vachell	PERSON	.

		The literary fraternity is always ready to discuss the subject of publishing , and it was a happy thought that made Mr.
Reginald Smith	PERSON	, editor of the '' Corn - hill Magazine '' and head of the historic publishing house of
Smith , Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the honored guest of a recent
Monday	DATE	dinner at the
Authors ' Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		The topic for discussion was thus phrased : '' Does the Author Understand the Publisher , and Vice Versa ? ''

		It is a question that has agitated the world of letters ever since the days of
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	, when the bookseller began to replace the private patron as the real Maecenas of literature .

		The booksellers , in fact , were the original pub - -LRB- lishers : even at the present day there are a few houses in
London	LOCATION	which combine the two trades .

		But it is an age of specialization , and there are not many men who have the time or the talent to com - bine both callings .

		Mr.
Arthur L. Humphreys	PERSON	, of Hatchartls ' in
Piccadilly	LOCATION	, is one of the last sur - vivors of the double trade ; Mr.
Elkin Mathews	PERSON	, hard by in Vigo Street , is another ; the late Mr.
Elliot Stock	PERSON	was a third .

		I can not recall any others of importance .

		The conjunction of author and publisher is yet more rare , although several big publishing houses have been founded by men who had previously tried their hands at writing .

		Mr.
Methuen	PERSON	began by publishing his own schoolbooks ; he continues to write occasionally at the present time .

		The late Mr.
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	supplies the sole instance in my recollection of a prominent author setting up an office for the express purpose of publishing his own works : some two or three years before his death his name adorned for a short time the window of a shop in
Shaftesbury Avenue	LOCATION	.

		But the experiment failed .

		It is a sad fact that few authors of imagination have any talent for the sober routine of business , they are commonly gamblers by nature : they can not bring themselves to woo success by the prosaic method of cutting down expenses .

		It is the details that count in the modern business of publishing .

		I do not think the author recognizes sufficiently how the conditions of the trade have changed of late years .

		Thirty or forty years ago it was com - paratively easy to make money ; to-day there is a steady procession of publishers wending their melan - choly way to the
Court of Bankruptcy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Several causes have combined to produce this unfortunate result unfortunate alike to publisher and author .

		In the first place , it grows harder every year for the publisher to secure a good bargain .

		The author has been educated up to a sense perhaps in some in - stances an inflated sense of his own value .

		Thirty years ago it is possible that he erred in the other direction , and no doubt there was more than suffi - cient justification for the late Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	when , in
1883	DATE	, he founded the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many things called for alteration and improvement in the common methods of the publishers of that time ; and the Society has done , and continues to do , excellent work in the matter of revising agreements on behalf of its members and providing them with the best legal assistance when in difficulties .

		But in its zeal for the author 's welfare it has , naturally , made it harder for the publisher to secure a good bargain .

		It has sedulously preached the advantages of the royalty system , and warned the readers of its monthly organ against the practice of selling their copyrights for a lump sum .

		It points out strongly to its members the unwisdom of signing away any rights in future books .

		But the sensible publisher does not complain now of the Society of Authors : he reserves his bitterness for the Literary Agent .

		Within the last ten years or so this gentleman has assumed a position of re - markable importance in the world of letters .

		He came into being , I believe , nearly thirty years ago , and his mission was to take the burden of business matters off the incapable shoulders of the author .

		Paid by a commission on the sums he received , his own interests obviously lay in the same direction as his clients ' : the more he could extract from the pockets of the publisher the better for both the au - thor and himself .

		And he discovered , too , sources of profit that would never have occurred to a mere writer .

		Serial rights , English and American , we already knew ; he invented , after a decent lapse of time , second serial rights , and even , in cases of extreme popularity , third .

		The big men flocked to his doors : here was a man who could do their bar - gaining for them , relieve them of all the worry and trouble of business arrangements , and double their income at the cost of a small percentage .

		An age of delightful freedom dawned for the happy artist ; at length his craft was divorced from sordid details : all that he had to do now was to write his stuff and send it in to the agent , secure in the knowledge that no possible source of profit would be left untapped , and that no silly notions of friendship , loyalty , or gratitude for past favors would hamper him if it came to a question of deserting a former publisher for one who offered better terms .

		It is the business of the literary agent to screw publishers up to the proper pitch of generosity , and to this end he invites them to bid against each other for the works of the more popular favorites of the day .

		Some novelists scarcely ever bring out two consecutive books with the same house : they put their wares up to auction openly , unashamed ; and the highest bidder , no matter what his reputation , secures them if he can bring himself to offer a few pounds more than the last on account of royalties .

		He does not often make money over the transaction : it is rare indeed for the book to earn more than his advance , and in most cases the publisher 's ledger shows a loss on the deal .

		But new firms have to make a start : they want one or two well-known names on their list to give it an air of importance , and they are prepared to pay for the privilege .

		It is the new firms who put money into the agent 's pocket .

		Thus , between them , the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	and the literary agent have done a good deal to destroy 118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, the old feeling between author and publisher .

		I do not say that they have succeeded in destroying it entirely .

		There are still certain authors of emi - nence who , like Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle	PERSON	-LRB- chairman the other evening at the dinner I have mentioned above -RRB- , maintain a pleasant intimacy with their publishers and have come to the conclusion that it is the wiser policy to let the majority of their books issue from the same house .

		But their case is the exception rather than the rule .

		The commercial element has taken , I think , too strong a hold of the author of to-day : he is apt to regard the publisher as a rogue from whom he and his agent art * justi - fied in extracting the uttermost farthing .

		He will expatiate upon the enormous profits that some firms have made by a single happy hit , forgetful of the many losses that have to be set against a rare suc - cess .

		If a publisher loses money , it is clearly his own fault ; if he prospers , it must be through swindling his authors .

		Holding these views , the modern novelist is never satisfied unless he gets considerably the better of any bargain .

		It seems a short-sighted policy .

		The rise of cheap fiction has been another thorn in the side of the publisher .

		In the days of the three-volume novel , sold to the libraries at a price that left an ample margin of profit , there was little risk in the publication of a story even by a new writer , while the possibilities of gain were very large .

		In this form the selling powers of the book could be tested sufficiently to show whether it was worth while to issue a cheaper edition at six shillings , and , perhaps , another at two later on .

		But the libraries rebelled , and the single volume at six shillings came into vogue , to be threatened in its turn by seven - penny and sixpenny reprints , and by a determined effort on the part of some firms to swamp the mar - ket with new novels at two shillings net .

		For the last five or six years it has grown steadily mere diffi - cult to sell an edition of a novel at the old price .

		Cheap fiction the sixpenny and sevenpenny re - prints have possibly increased the sales of the writers who appear in that form , but they have cer - tainly made it far harder for the new man to obtain a hearing .

		The general public will not buy a six - shilling novel by an unknown author when they can get the best stories of Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, ''
Anthony Hope	PERSON	, '' and a dozen other good writers , in a cheap and attractive form .

		I find that this tells chiefly against those numerous novelists who used to have a sale of two or three thousand copies and under .

		The subscription list for their books has fallen off by about one-third during the last few years .

		In short , these recent developments in the English book market have tended all in one direction in favor of the author of established popularity as against his weaker brethren and his publisher .

		The big seller makes more money than he did , and the small seller is being surely but gradually squeezed out of existence .

		This would be a matter of small consequence were the less popular writers always the less deserving of popularity .

		But the names in which English literature takes most pride to-day are not commonly those of men who reaped an early and facile success .

		I have often found myself won - dering whether the late
George Meredith	PERSON	would have won his way to recognition if he had started his career in an age of cheap fiction .

		The three - volume form preserved him for posterity : it enabled him to get a hearing for his earlier work , to establish a position before the reduction in prices came into vogue .

		But this is to wander from the subject .

		The author and publisher should be allies , working together for their mutual advantage .

		Here at the present time they are too often enemies , and the change is good for neither party . ''

		Now Barabbas was a publisher , '' the gentleman who first pro- pounded that witty misquotation must be held re - sponsible for a great deal .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE MONEY VALUE OK CULTURE , although be - neath the serious consideration of the true lover of learning , is of some significance in answering the question whether higher education really pays , or whether the late Mr.
Crane	PERSON	was right in his condem - nation of the college course as a waste of time and money .

		Two years ago figures were published giving the average income of the members of
Dart	PERSON	- mouth 's class of
1899	DATE	, ten years after graduation .

		This average , something over two thousand dollars , made a very creditable showing , being neither pain - fully small nor immoderately large .

		Now we are favored by the `` Yale Alumni Weekly '' with even more interesting and more detailed figures concern - ing the worldly prosperity of a large college class five years after graduation .

		The
Yale	ORGANIZATION	class of 1 906 -LRB- with the exception of that silent third which , as at
Dartmouth	LOCATION	, has sent in no report , and so is presum - ably less prosperous than the other two-thirds -RRB- en - joyed an average income of seven hundred and forty dollars in its first year out of college , and this rose rapidly to nearly
nineteen hundred dollars	MONEY	for the fifth year .

		Government employment has proved the most remunerative of all the occupations reported , with finance and commerce next .

		Journalists have fared about the worst , with struggling lawyers only a little better off .

		Farmers , ranchmen , and foresters have done well , rising to an average income of nearly two thousand dollars at the end of the five-year period .

		We leave out of account the graduate stu - dents , whose scholarships or other emoluments are inconsiderable , but who are doubtless winning large and priceless rewards of a less material sort .

		On the whole , it is well demonstrated , if demonstration were necessary , that a college education does pay .

		On the first of
November	DATE	Mr.
Kennerley	PERSON	will issue `` The Lyric Year , '' a volume to contain one hundred poems by as many American writers , three of whom will receive collectively the tidy sum of one thousand dollars five hundred as first prize for the very best of the one hundred poems , and two hundred and fifty to each of the two second-prize winners .

		Mr.
Edward J. Wheeler	PERSON	and Mr.
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	will be the judges , and all contributions should be sent before
June 1	DATE	to the editor of `` The Lyric Year , '' in care of Mr.

		It is further required that contributions do not exceed two hundred and fifty lines in length , and that a stamped and addressed envelope be sent with each contribution .

		Any number of manuscripts may be submitted by one person , subject to the above conditions .

January , 1912	DATE	, may be submitted , but poems already printed in book form , or to be so printed before

		... THE FAVORITE BOOKS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS , not professed students of literature , but rather the young men who regard their college course as primarily a vocational training , are indicated to some extent by an inquiry conducted by the English department of
Tufts College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The freshman class of the Engineer - ing School was asked to contribute toward a fund with which to purchase books for its own reading , and each member was requested to name one book for the collection .

		The sixty-five men of the class named forty-five books , the titles written on more than one ballot being five only , `` The Light That Failed , '' ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	, '' '' Soldiers of Fortune , '' ''
David Copperfield	PERSON	, '' and `` The Day 's Work . ''

		The selections were made with such evident independence of the
English Department	ORGANIZATION	's own posted lists of rec - ommended reading as to show that the choice was in general spontaneous .

		Next a ballot was prepared of the forty-five nominated books , and each student was asked to designate fifteen on the list as especially desirable , and to hand in his ballot unsigned .

		Fifty - eight members of the class complied , and the result showed a leading preference for '' The Virginian , '' which won fifty votes , and a faint demand for `` The Guest of
John Chapman	PERSON	'' and `` The Trimmed Lamp , '' which each received one vote .

Thackeray	PERSON	's -LRB- `` Vanity Fair '' -RRB- , were voted for , with ''
Copperfield	ORGANIZATION	'' well in the lead .

		On the whole , the result of the inquiry was about what a scrutiny of an average public library 's fiction circulation might have led one to predict , with a large elimination of stories favored by women and girls .

		...
MR. HARDY	PERSON	'S HATRED OF `` SHAM OPTIMISM , '' his preference for what he seems to regard as a safe and sane pessimism , is illustrated in the report of an interview published recently in the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Tran - script . ''

		The great novelist , one of the most famous , one of the wealthiest , and one of the least familiarly known writers in
England	LOCATION	, is depicted as '' a little , timid-looking man , very pale , and with an embar - rassing look that might have been irritation on his seared face . ''

		Asked why he was so pessimistic a writer , why he wrote at once the most beautiful and the most dreadful of stories , he replied to his questioner : '' You are a young man .

		The cruelty of fate becomes apparent to people as they grow older .

		At first one may escape contact with it , but if one lives long enough one realizes that happiness is very ephemeral . '' ''

		But is not optimism a useful and sane philosophy ? ''

		was next asked him . ''

		There is too much sham optimism , '' he replied , '' humbug - ging and even cruel optimism .

		Sham optimism is really a more heartless doctrine to preach than even an exaggerated pessimism the latter leaves one at least on the safe side .

		There is too much senti - ment in most fiction .

		It is necessary for somebody to write a little mercilessly , although of course it is painful to have to do it . '' ''

		Love is tragic , '' was Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's further assertion , '' but it is very beau - tiful . ''

		The interviewer , who signs himself ''
Henry Deal	PERSON	, '' sums up the distinguished author 's outlook on life in four words , `` the pity of it . ''

		THE
NEWARK	LOCATION	LIBRARY 'S BELIEF IN PUBLICITY is strikingly attested by its issue of a handsome monthly publication , '' The Newarker : The
House Organ of the Newark Free Public Library	ORGANIZATION	,
J. C. Dana	PERSON	, Librarian . ''

		Of course , as Mr.
Dana	PERSON	's name will indi - cate , it is
Newark	LOCATION	in
New Jersey	LOCATION	, the most conspicuous
Newark	LOCATION	in the world , that is meant , and not
Newark	LOCATION	in
Missouri	LOCATION	or
Delaware	LOCATION	or
Illinois	LOCATION	or anywhere else .

		The
January	DATE	number of `` The Newarker '' being number three of the first volume contains a convincing statement of the reasons of the paper 's existence .

		The library 's stores of recreative and helpful material , especially the helpful part , are not duly appreciated , are in fact too little known about , by the people of
Newark	LOCATION	.

		Business men , in par - ticular , fail to recognize what an ever-present help in time of trouble they have in the local public library . ''

		In a word , '' says the writer -LRB- whom we suspect to be the editor himself -RRB- , '' the library found that having made itself modern it needed to advertise the fact !

		After much deliberation it was decided to publish , for a time at least , a journal which should , from month to month , try to call the attention of the workers and doers of the city to the practical every-day value of the material its library had gathered .

		Hence , The Newarker . ''

		It is a sixteen-page journal with an attractive array 120 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Alphabetically the list is headed by the veteran
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	and brought to completion by the considerably younger though hardly less deserving
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	.

		Mid - way in the list one notes , nut without a slight start of surprise , the self-expatriated
Henry James	PERSON	, more English in some respects than the English them - selves .

		With satisfaction one reads the names of
John Burroughs	PERSON	and

		Its present number , forty-seven , will , it is confidently promised , be reduced in the course of nature to the traditional forty .

		Until eight shall have been thus eliminated no aspirant to immortality need apply .

		THE ATTEMPT TO DEFINE HUMOR , prompted , or rather revived , by
M. Bergson	PERSON	's recent much-talked - of inquiry into the causes of laughter , is respon - sible for the array of definitions from noted pens in a late number of '' La Revue . ''

		Invited to take part in this definition bee , a considerable num - ber of literary men , including eight well-known English writers , have exercised their ingenuity in trying to define the indefinable .

		Indeed , one of the correspondents , no less a person than Mr.
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, frankly admits this indefinability . ''

		Humor can not be defined , '' he asserts . ''

		It is a primary substance which makes us laugh .

		You might as well try to prove a dogma . ''

		Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	pithily and picturesquely writes : `` Humor is the smile in the look of wisdom '' ; and ''
F. Anstey	PERSON	, '' with equal brevity , declares humor to be `` a delicious conception of the incongruous , '' but acknowledges the incompleteness of his definition .

		Mr.
Jerome K. Jerome	PERSON	, master of humor though he is , begs the question by defining humor as '' that which strikes us by its drollery . ''

		What then is drollery ?

		That which tickles our sense of humor , he might reply .

		Some of these expert utterances recall the old defi - nition of mind and matter : What is mind ?

		No matter .

		What is matter ?

		Never mind .

		Clearly , there is something ultimate and elemental in humor which has long been evident to the connnonsense of non-writing people .

		MORI ENGLISH STUDY FOB ENGINEERS is becom - ing the increasingly urgent recommendation of those who regretfully note the insufficient command of his own language , and the glaringly defective knowledge of the literature written in that language , on the part of the technical-school student .

		Professor
Samuel Earle	PERSON	, head of the English department of
Tufts Engineering School	ORGANIZATION	, recently commissioned to make a thorough investigation of the subject of English instruction in technical schools , finds a gen - erally acknowledged insufficiency of such instruction , and a rather encouraging disposition to supply the defect In fact , already a change for the better has been to some extent effected in certain quarters .

		But the fault is not altogether on the part of the technical school ; the preparatory course has been defective .

		The curriculum leading up to the higher institution has lacked backbone , or has consisted of an invertebrate conglomeration of pseudo-science , laboratory practice , and shopwork , much of which has had to be afterward unlearned .

		It is suggested by Professor
Earle	PERSON	that , just as the ancient classics formed the backbone of the old-time preparation for college , so English might be and ought to be made a stiffening element in the backbone of the technical student 's preparatory course .

		Schools of engineering are asked to unite in this important matter and require of the preparatory schools a more adequate training in English studies .

		ACTIVE AND PASSIVE READING differ from each other as much as do , for example , a brisk walk in the open in the present frigid temperature and a treatment from a masseur in a well-warmed room .

		This platitude is apropos of Mayor
Gaynor	PERSON	's recent advice to the members of the graduating class of Public School 160 ,
New York City	LOCATION	, that they should form the habit of reading , first because it provides an antidote for boredom , and secondly because the reader of serious books will come out ahead of his unread competitor in the race of life .

		The reader for mere diversion is obviously the passive reader ; the student of books demanding some exercise of the intellect , the active reader .

		We hear a great deal about the creative imagination and creative litera - ture , but not yet enough about creative reading the reading that is not simply thinking with other men 's brains , but a process of finding oneself and one 's proper bearings in the universe .

		Who shall say but it may be a higher art to become a creative reader than to be a creative writer ?

		The surviving members of the historian 's family have recently decided to part with the bulk of his library , which has been stored at the Lossing
summer	DATE	home at
Dover Plains	LOCATION	, N. Y .

		The correspondence , thought to number about thirty thou - sand pieces , includes letters from a large number of historic characters , most of the prominent officers of the Revolution being represented as well as the signers -LRB- or a great many of them -RRB- of the Declaration of Independence .

		Especially numerous are auto - graph papers of General
Philip Schuyler	PERSON	, acquired for the purpose of writing his '' Life and Times . ''

		Early pamphlets and books of rarity and value are of course conspicuous in such a collection as Lossing 's .

		THE INTELLIGENT LIBRARY ASSISTANT has it in his or her power to be of greater and more frequent immediate service to the visiting public than has , ordinarily , the less directly accessible head librarian .

		Many a library-user goes always for help to some one subordinate official whose kindness or whose timely bit of special knowledge on a certain occa - sion in the past has left a lasting impression on the grateful beneficiary .

		Consequently no pains taken to increase the assistant 's breadth of intelligence and readiness of resource will be pains thrown away .

		Feeling , as it appears , the truth of this , the head of the
Public Library of the District of Columbia	ORGANIZATION	has caused one hour each week to be allowed each assistant for reading reviews of current books ; and also the assistants are asked to spend some time in the doubtless congenial task of novel - reading for the purpose of obtaining additional subject-headings for catalogue purposes .

		Happy the worker whose calling becomes also his pastime .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Referring to the paragraph in your issue of
February 1	DATE	, in regard to an '' hermaphrodite pronoun , '' will you allow me to say that some years ago I made a sugges - tion which has always seemed to me worthy of more attention than it has received .

		My suggestion was : Nominative : Hi .

		Possessive :
Hes	ORGANIZATION	.

		Objective : Hem .

		Thus by a slight redistribution of the vowels the original forms are closely approximated , but there is ample dif - ferentiation from the masculine and feminine pronouns .

		As compared with the ridiculous Than and the un - speakable Hiser , do you not think my suggestion an improvement ?

		Certainly the need of a pronoun of common gender is a pressing one .

		A ROUGH APPRENTICESHIP .

		* Rarely has there been put between the covers of a book so much of the stern but zestful reality of life , so much of strenuous struggle against adversity , so much , in short , of varied and often thrilling personal experience , as is recorded by Mr.
J. E. Patterson	PERSON	in his '' intimate autobiog - raphy '' which he has entitled `` My Vagabond - age . ''

		It is a book to read with a perceptible quickening of the pulse , a chronicle of sturdy striving and high-hearted courage that can not fail to increase one 's satisfaction in our common humanity .

		In the fell clutch of circumstance the writer has not winced nor cried aloud ; be - neath the bludgeonings of chance his head is in a very literal sense bloody but unbowed .

		Yet it can not be said that there is in the book any vain parade of fortitude , or that the writing of it is a bare-faced bid for popular favor .

		The author has , after years of aspiration and by a rough and circuitous route , reached the longed - for land of literature and known the joy of seeing the creations of his imagination in print -LRB- after re - peated rejections -RRB- , and the present more frankly personal product of his pen is a legitimate and welcome addition to his published works .

		After a brief preface , which successfully strikes the keynote of the book , the author divides his narrative into two parts , headed respectively '' The Life Rebellious '' and '' The Life Adventurous , '' with about a dozen brisk and graphic chapters in each .

		Born in
Yorkshire	LOCATION	of poor parents , he was bereft of his mother in early childhood and lost track of his father be - fore he was well into his ` teens , the first thirteen years of his life being a tempestuous series of boy - ish rebellions and truancies , of runnings away from home and of brief and stormy experiences as unbidden guest at the homes of various kins - folk in the West Riding .

		Unfitted by natural endowment to lead the life of normal , respectable British boyhood , which seemed to him unbear - ably tame and slow , the lad took his destiny into his own hands and ran away to sea at thirteen , passed himself off as a youth of seventeen , and made voyages to all parts of the world , except to
America	LOCATION	, before the down of adolescence had stif - fened into the beard of manhood .

		And through it all a devouring passion for books kept pace with a consuming hunger for life and adventure .

Intimate Autobiography of a Nature	ORGANIZATION	's Nomad .

		With portrait .


New York	LOCATION	: The
George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, Without being able , from lack of space , to give either by description or illustrative quotation an adequate idea of the book 's remarkable variety and vigor , the reviewer can only say , in brief , that the first part is something like a very intensi - fied '' Story of a Bad Boy , '' and the last like one of Captain Marryat 's or
Clark Russell	PERSON	's most thrilling sea stories .

		In fact , Mr.
Patterson	PERSON	has already won for himself the distinction of being regarded by many as the successor to those two famous romancers of the sea .

		An extract from an early chapter will convey a notion of the boy
Patterson	ORGANIZATION	's outlook on life .

		Alternately regarded by his teachers as a hope - lessly unruly pupil and as a marvel of precocity , he never learned to endure the irksomeness of pedagogic restraint . ''

		What on earth did / want with any more schooling ?

		Could n't I read any other boy off his feet and gabble the newspapers over to my short-sighted elders !

		Could n't I , did n't I , read everything that came within reach !

		And what more could any boy be supposed to do ?

		Had n't I heard time and time again that reading and experience were the great turnpike-roads to knowledge ?

		And was n't I travelling that way ?

		with the one always in my pocket and the other harvested by a perversity to be ever on the move .

		For how could one gain experi - ence except by moving and doing things ?

		As for sums and that silly thing they call geography !

		what did it matter that I could n't do a sum in simple multiplication or division to save my head ?

		The world was n't made of sums , like it was of books .

		Other folks got on in life without sums ; and I should n't want sums to help me to make books ; and if I did n't do that I would go to sea , and there were no sums on ships ; or I would be a farmer and what had a farmer to do with sums ?

		... No , schools were for girls , for boys who wished to go to business , and for those who could n't read or would n't take to it properly .

		I was made for books and the open spaces in life . ''

		Hatred of restraint and love of adventure combined to lead the boy and afterward the young man into many places of danger , and he had countless hairbreadth escapes from sudden death .

		Pure recklessness induced him to at - tempt the smuggling of revolutionary literature into
Russia	LOCATION	, in the course of his sea-roving , and it waa little short of a miracle that he eluded the police and came away unharmed , even though without much success in his foolhardy under - taking .

		At another time a too curious interest in the form of worship observed in a Buddhist temple at
Bombay	LOCATION	resulted in a night 's impris - onment and a narrow escape from something much worse .

		And still another mad escapade , in which a company of Howling Dervishes howling this time with rage nearly put an end to his pursuit of knowledge , is to be cred - ited to him at about the same time .

		Through all these varied experiences the lover of open spaces seems never to have forgotten his final purpose of becoming a writer ; journals of his successive adventures were can-fully kept , and reams of verse were scribbled as the spirit moved .

		The journal-writing led a few years later , when a severe attack of rheumatism com - pelled the sailor to turn landsman , to a connec - tion with journals of another kind and to many efforts , at last successful , to get into the maga - zines ; and the versifying prepared the way for a volume of poems , `` The Mermaid and Other Pieces , '' published by subscription through the kind offices of the public librarian at
Cardiff	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this connection it may not come amiss to give a specimen of Mr.
Patterson	PERSON	's musical verse from the selections with which his present work is furnished .

		Here is a song that came to him in a dream : '' The sweetest song these lips e'er sang Was sung to mine own self in sleep ; So through this heart 's dead vaults it rang , That Memory bowed her head to weep .

		`` I know not whence or how it came ; It went and left but this refrain : ' A noble life * s the greatest fame , And no renown is free from pain . '

		a Awake I found these eyes in tears , My song ascending to the skies , Its lines the blood and toil of years , Their dust-strewn hopes , their crushing fears , Which come hard souls to humanize And lift the gaze of earthward eyes . ''

		Mr.
Patterson	PERSON	is already known , and becom - ing every day better known , as the author of '' Fishers of the Sea , '' '' Tillers of the Soil , '' and the just-published `` Love Like the Sea , '' narratives of the realistic and moving sort which his long apprenticeship to struggle and hard - ship has fitted him to write with decided effect .

		Concerning the first of these romances of hum - ble life , and the end of its four years ' quest of a publisher , the following is of interest , espe - cially to the tardily successful in literature : '' We would try again .

		There was Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	at one end of the scale , said I , the extreme west of the matter ; and there was So-and-so 's , down in
Norfolk	LOCATION	, who might be tempted because of the fishing nature of the thing .

		Here goes , heads for the west and tails for the east , twice out of three , and up went the ' lucky ' shil - ling that I had found just without the garden gate on the day we went to live there .

		This was the order : Head , tail , head .

		Then the MS. was packed off .

		I n ten days came ; in acccptaiu < .

		and I crifd : ` All glory be to God this day and all the days hereafter ! '

		Within a month the thing was bowing humbly to critics who hailed it , from
Aberdeen	LOCATION	to the south coast , as a piece of literature .

		The book was freely and favorably com - pared to the work of dead and living , Knglish and foreign masters !

		And twenty-five times refused !

		We could hardly believe what we read .

		Ye gods of igno -

		how many of you were doing beggars ' duty as publishers ' readers when that manu - script was on its four years ' journey ?

		when no pub - lisher 's Calypso would sing that siren-song : ' Stay , O Wanderer , stay with us ! '

		Poor , insignificant , heart - crushed , still-hopeful , gall-saturated , twice-crippled I to be lifted to the feet of my long-worshipped GODS on the high and sacred mount of literature what a heart-in-the-mouth feeling it gave !

		What humility , what chastened thought , what wondering of other neg - lected ones on the wayside it brought in its train ! ''

		Thus we leave the happily '' arrived '' author , his wander-years at an end , himself blissfully wedded to his art , and no less blissfully united to a faithful and helpful wife , and with many years , it is to be hoped , of fruitful activity and well-earned happiness before him .

		No book , however , that he may produce in those coming years will equal in its way the story he has told of his life , a narrative that combines the direct - ness and realism of
George Meek	PERSON	with the ro - mance and thrilling adventure of
Robinson Crusoe	ORGANIZATION	.

		In closing , a critic might be tempted to call the author 's attention to the profit he might have made out of that early schooling which he so scornfully spurned .

		A little more scholar - ship might not have hurt his pages .

		With that little more he probably would not have written `` quothed '' -LRB- p. 73 -RRB- or `` laid '' for `` lay '' -LRB- p. 172 -RRB- , or committed sundry other solecisms that could be pointed out .

		Still it is subject for congratu - lation that , as he did not let himself be spoiled by vagabondage , so he has resisted from the first the benumbing influence of formal education .

		Few indeed are the authors who could lay bare their lives as fearlessly and unreservedly as Mr.
Patterson	PERSON	has dared to lay bare his in '' My Vagabondage . ''

		THE THEATRE OF THE FUTURE .

		* The very great interest of the present genera - tion in the Theatre has manifested itself hi many ways .

		Whether these ways are different from those of a generation or two generations ago , whether there are more of them , whether they are more artistic or more commercial , and other such matters , I must leave to the historian of American culture when there shall ever be one .

		It will be enough here to note a few of the more obvious manifestations .

		Besides the ordinary productions of the theatre , then , everyone will think of such facts and eccentricities as the Celtic drama , the New Theatre , the acting in the col - * ON THE ART OF THE THEATRE .

		By
Edward Gordon Craig	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .

		Chicago :
Browne	PERSON	's Bookstore .

		leges of old plays , the development of out-door acting , certain especial performances like the
Peterborough Pageant	LOCATION	, the
MacDowell Fel	ORGANIZATION	- lowship in dramatic art , the increase of college courses on the drama , the immense realism of the stage -LRB- from ladies dancing with real bare feet to having real cut glass for the banquets of the stage -RRB- , the fact that
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's plays are still presented sometimes , the interest in the staging of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays and the study of how he used to stage them himself , the produc - tion of stage beauties in the more ordinary magazines , the immense popularity of motion - picture shows , the existence of pantomime plays where there are no words , and of printed plays where there are only words .

		These facts -LRB- and many others which would easily be collected by anyone whose view of the world was broader than the booklined walls of a college study -RRB- are most easily explained on the assumption of a very great interest in the
Thea	LOCATION	- tre .

		As I consider that interest myself it does not seem very intelligent .

		We need not mourn over the commercial character of the '' offerings '' at our theatres , for that is a matter that disturbs more intelligent civilizations than ours .

		But if one compare our commonplace and brilliant out - put of current dramatic criticism in papers and books with the astonishing flood of utterance on the contemporary drama which overflows
Paris	LOCATION	every week , meandering into every salon and in - undating every cq/e , one will see that ours , even if considerable in quality , is not so intelligent .

		It perceives and observes many facts , but it does not so often relate those observations and appre - ciations to any more or less general system of ideas , or , if it does , that system of ideas is likely to be a purely conventional one .

		Yet though not very intelligent , our interest is instinctive , and that perhaps furnishes as good a ground for the growth of a new idea as the other would , provided some one has the idea .

		Such views as these are not a mere stock intro - duction for a review ; they appear a necessary beginning to an inquiry as to what there is of interest in Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	's view of the Art of the Theatre .

		The first thing that struck me as I read the extraordinary book which conveys this view , was that it had nothing to do with any other mani - festations of interest in the drama that I had ever heard of .

		I had supposed in a general way that Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's work had had some relation to the cur - rent efforts towards presenting plays ; but how - ever it may be with his work in the past , this is not the case with the theory of the present book .

		124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, He is on a line of his own which is in a different direction from the lines of stage presentation to-day ; the further other people go on their own lines , and the further he goes on his line , the further are they apart .

		Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's '' Art of the Theatre '' does not supplement present the .

		with a fuller realistic , historic , technical , histori - cal , or antiquarian feeling ; it does not bring the painter , the composer , the architect , the dancer , the landscape-gardener into the theatre and use their work more effectively to present the work of the dramatist .

		Mr.
Craig	PERSON	does not even think of some synthesis of the arts such as
Wagner	PERSON	had in mind , in which the different arts did not supplement the art of the dramatist , but com - bined to make one composite impression .

		Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's idea is different from all those things : it is different in essence from the ideas that re - sult in the plays we are accustomed to see .

		It does not use the arts of painting , of music , of anything else to help the actor present a play .

		It does not , in fact , even want any actor -LRB- in the common meaning of the term -RRB- , nor , we might add , any play .

		All these negatives will perhaps give a false idea , and yet it is well to begin with them .

		Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	does not , of course , conceive a stage without pictorial scenery , without light - ing and effects , without costumes and dances , without people , without words and action .

		He wants all these things , and wants them to be a great deal better and more fitted to their pur - pose than they are now .

		But he does not want the picture-painter to make scenes , because the picture-painter , who may be very clever about atmosphere or landscape , knows nothing of conditions at the theatre .

		He does not want the composer to present music which shall have been made with the hope of according with a libretto , but without regard to the ensemble that is to be produced .

		He does not want an actor or singer who will present some part '' create '' they are apt to say in a manner which they devise and not the poet .

		He does not want a poet or dramatist to write a play and leave it to the well-intentioned but aimless efforts of managers , actors , composers , dancers , carpenters , costumers , lighters , and others .

		He thinks of the Theatre as a means of Art .

		And art in his mind means that a man shall carry out his own ideas by guidance of the knowledge he has of how to do what he wants to do .

		It is true that an artist need not do everything for himself .

		The mural painter will allow assistants to do much of his preparatory work , the sculptor will allow workmen to cast his statue and carve his pedestal , tin - .

		mj > o8er must allow many men to take part in his sym - phony , the arehitri-t must allow many mm to build the cathedral which he has designed .

		l'ut such assistants or workmen must do exactly what the artist tells them to do .

		They are not to do things as they think best , but as lie thinks best , or else it is not his work ,
Imt	ORGANIZATION	an accidental mixture and not a work of art at all .

		In the theatre the poet , for instance , if he originates the work , must have everything done as he con - ceives it and not as the actor or actress may chance to conceive it , nor as the sta ^ c - manager conceives it , any more than as the si
TIM	ORGANIZATION	painter or the costumer may conceive it .

		If those per - sons take part on their own account we shall have a composite phenomena , very interesting to the sociologist , to one who likes to see men and women working together to achieve some great purpose , but to the artist not interesting at all , at least not as a whole , not as one work of art .

		Such seems Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's general conception .

		The Theatre appears to him not merely an ele - ment in social life , but a means for an arti > t. I have thought of and begun to make my instrument , '' says he , `` and through this in - strument I intend soon to venture in my qm - > t for beauty . ''

		If Mr.
Craig	PERSON	has so far acted in other men 's plays or managed other men 's theatres , if he has produced the works of others , even of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, it has been to learn his art .

		He has no more created any work of art in so doing than if he had made a very beautiful drawing from an antique cast . ''

		It is impos - sible , '' he writes , '' for a work of art ever to be produced , where more than one brain is per - mitted to direct . ''

		This , in a very few words , is the idea pre - sented by Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	.

		It is not , it will be seen , an attempt to change or correct or improve the present way of giving plays or managing theatres .

		It is rather the conception of something new and different from what is now being done .

		The idea is presented , it iniuht be well to note , in a manner as individual as it is itself .

		Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	does not give us a definition , an analysis , a treatment in any systematic fashion ; he proceeds in a manner which is perhaps more artistic , in that it is cer - tainly more personal .

		Instead of some unified statement we have addresses , articles , letters , dialogues , some of which have Keen published already and others which seem to apjH-ar now for the first time .

		There are , for in > tance .

		This kind of presentation has its difficulties , but it has also its advantages , one of which is that it gives us various views of the same general idea .

		An idea like this is certainly most fascinating to the mind that loves the arts , so fascinating perhaps that it is not possible to view it clearly and sanely .

		To cut off at one blow all the annoying difficulties and troubles that bother the theorist and the practical man in dramatic matters the necessity of producing plays that many people will want to see , for instance , the harmonizing the conflicting interests and fancies of different kinds of people , such as actors , poets , proprietors , and other such , all that leaves one so free to think and to imagine that it can - not but be a pleasure .

		And though there is done away with so much that exists , there is yet left so much to fill its place ; the Artist of the Theatre -LRB- he has as yet no name -RRB- is possessed of some idea to which he must give form , and that form he will create in the theatre by means of color , movement , voice , rhythm , light , gesture .

		He will have in mind all the resources of the theatre to-day , scenes , costumes , properties , lights , action , dance , music , poetry ; and any or all of these materials he is to use in giving his idea form .

		He will design his scenes and his costumes and his properties , he will imagine his action and his grouping and his dances , he will write his poetry and his music .

		If he can not do these things he is not a complete Artist of the Theatre : one does not become an artist simply by wanting to be one , and ten years or so is none too long a time to spend in studying the means and materials of one 's art .

		The artist will not have to make or do all these things himself , at least not in every case , and for every play , but he must have done such things ; he will not have to paint the scenes him - self , nor to cut out the cloth for his costumes , nor to model his properties and paint them , any more than he would have to write with his own pen or typewrite the words of his poetry or the notes of his music .

		But he will wish them to be his own work , his own way of expressing the elements or nuances of thought and feeling that may develop from his conception .

		He will also make actors , singers , dancers do exactly what he wants them to do .

		-LRB- And here Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	thinks with pleasure of some superior development of the marionette . -RRB-

		In such a man - ner will a man be able to embody his idea in form in a truly artistic way ; everything will be as he thinks it should be , nothing will be the re - sult of chance , or of what is worse than chance the caprice or feeling of somebody else .

		Thea - trical production will no longer be like those pictures in which one artist does the landscape and another the animals , or in which one does the head and hands and another the background and the costume .

		It may be asked , perhaps , why the artist should not go a step further and design his own theatre .

		There would probably be no objection by Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	to his do - ing so , and doubtless everyone would have some particular ideas about construction that he would desire to see carried out .

		But the Theatre in its general idea would seem as fundamental an artistic means as the picture , the book , the orchestra ; and my own idea -LRB- if I were applied to for counsel -RRB- would be that an Artist of the Theatre should not feel called upon to devise a special form of theatre to embody his idea any more than a novelist should have to conceive some new form of novel or the sculptor some new medium for presenting form .

		He might do so , of course , if he wished , but it is no dero - gation of one 's artistic character to use means that other men have devised but which have become traditional through exercise .

		All this gives but a sketch of Mr.
Gordon Craig	PERSON	's main idea .

		There are other most inter - esting things in his book : ideas as to realism , for instance , to mention theoretical matters , comment on various theatrical circumstances , for practical affairs , and also , as has been said , the illustrations , especially the frontispiece , with its remark , '' I wanted to know for once what it felt like to be mounting up impossible ladders and beckoning people to come up after But the proposal is the main thing , me .

		everything else depends upon it .

		And though it will arouse astonishment , anger , despair , on the part of some people , it must also arouse exhilaration , a glow of life , a desire to create on the part of others .

		Few who love the Theatre will know what the book contains without want - ing to read it .

		When they do read it , different things will happen ; there will be all sorts of ideas that will conflict , oppose , combine .

		But out of such an apparent chaos it is , very often at least , that there arises finally something beautiful , harmonious , and perfect .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, REMINISCENCES OF FOUR WARS .

		* Measured by
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	's classic defi - nition , there need be no hesitation in applying the name '' war '' to the Indian Campaign of 1868-9 and to the Cuban Insurrection just JM - ceding the Spanish-American War , as well as to the Civil War in the
United States	LOCATION	and the Philippine Insurrection .

		Each of the two distin - guished Kansans who has recently published his memoirs was a participant in two wars .

		But aside from this and their state allegiance , there is a strong contrast between the two works .

		In his youth Governor
Crawford	PERSON	may have had as strong a love of adventure as
General Funston	LOCATION	; but looking back from the pinnacle of age , the last but one of the war governors now living , the former writes as a man of peace , regretting the violence of which he was a part , and com - mending the simple and rural life of his farm on
Spring River	LOCATION	; while
General Funston	LOCATION	, though one of the kindliest and most democratic of men , is in the best sense a soldier of fortune , writing of his career in the spirit of a Drake or a Fre -
mont.	LOCATION	.

		On the other hand , both of these officers saw much of irregular and guerilla warfare ,
Crawford	PERSON	on the
Missouri	LOCATION	border during the Civil War and in the Indian Campaign , Fun - ston both in
Cuba	LOCATION	and in
Luzon	LOCATION	.

		The portions of Governor
Crawford	PERSON	's memoirs which deal with the battles of
Wilson	PERSON	's
Creek	LOCATION	,
Prairie Grove	ORGANIZATION	, and
Jenkins	PERSON	' Ferry , the Price Raid , the Indian Campaign of 1868-9 , and with Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's work as attorney for the Indians in defending their treaty rights , con - tain most of his original contribution to history .

		With many details attempting to do justice to minor officers , and a surprisingly fair tone toward the deserving Confederate leaders , the author devotes considerable space to a castiga - tion of General Fred .


Steele	PERSON	, whose cowardice and incompetence led to the failure of
General Banks	ORGANIZATION	's movement against
Shreveport	LOCATION	.

		An equal severity is manifested toward General
S. R. Curtis	PERSON	, who was responsible for the failure to crush Price on his retreat from
Jefferson City	LOCATION	.

		Governor
Crawford	PERSON	was made Colonel of the 83d Colored Infantry in the
fall of 1863	DATE	, and some of his most interesting chapters tell of the bravery of this regiment .

		disliked to command colored troops , but he had learned the habit of doing his duty .

		He had heard of the so-called '' black flag '' order of President
Davis	PERSON	: that neither white officers nor the black rank and file were to receive any quar - ter , and that white officers of colored regiments had actually been hung ; but this only roused his fighting blood .

		He devoted the fall to drill - ing his regiment , and at
Poison Springs	LOCATION	and
Jenkins	PERSON	' Ferry , and in many another action , they proved their discipline and their mettle . ''

		The black flag order of the Confederacy was a god - send to the colored regiments .

		Every officer and every soldier knew that it meant the bayonet , with no quarter , whenever and wherever they met the enemy .

		At least that was the definite understanding among the officers and enlisted men of the Eighty-third
U. S.	PERSON	; and the regiment was drilled and disciplined and instructed accordingly . ''

		After the battle of
Poison Springs	LOCATION	, in which the colored regiment lost a hundred and eighty-two and the federal white regiment thirty-seven , thus clearly demonstrating that the Confederates were pursuing the policy of no quarter toward the colored troops , the Eighty-third held a coun - cil of war and decided That in the future the regiment would take no pris - oners , so long as the Rebels contiuued to murder our men ; but that no wounded Confederate should be harmed or injured in any way , but left where he fell .

		This agree - ment was carried out , so far as possible in the heat of battle . ''

		Governor
Crawford	PERSON	bears steadfast testimony to the valor and loyalty and good behavior of the colored troops .

		Governor
Crawford	PERSON	had much to do with establishing the financial footing of
Kansas	LOCATION	, visiting
New York	LOCATION	on more than one occasion to persuade the money market of the stability of Kansas state securities .

		But his most excit - ing experiences were in connection with the Indian depredations of
1867	DATE	and
1868	DATE	on the western border .

		Each
summer	DATE	it became neces - sary to call out state troops , and each time the division of responsibility for control of the In - dians between the War and the
Interior	ORGANIZATION	depart - ments made action slow and entailed upon the
Kansas	LOCATION	frontiersmen great loss of property and life .

		Finally , in
November , 1868	DATE	, after the ter - rible battle on the Arickaree , in which fifty volunteers under Colonel
Forsythe	PERSON	resisted for a week the attack of eight hundred Cheyennes , losing half their number , the Governor called out the
Nineteenth Kansas Cavalry	ORGANIZATION	and himself resigned to accept the colonelcy .

		After a severe winter campaign , when the hostile Indians had been driven back to the Indian Territory , Colonel
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 127
Crawford	PERSON	resigned the regiment to Colonel
H. L. Moore	PERSON	, whose graphic account of the campaign is quoted , and himself proceeded to
Washington	LOCATION	to work for the payment of his command .

		No one has shown more frankly than Governor
Crawford	PERSON	how the Indians were cheated and wronged under the vacillating policy of our government .

		But let those whose sympathy is entirely with the Indians read also Governor
Crawford	PERSON	's account of the frontier raids . ''

		Had the government at an early date adopted a just and firm Indian policy and adhered to it , the soil of every township of land west of the Appalachian Range would not have been saturated with human blood .

		But that was not done .

		The humanitarians , who knew Hothmg about the real character of the wild Indians , were going to manage them by moral suasion and with beautiful flowers , as some ladies reclaim murderers when on trial for their lives . ''

		Governor
Crawford	PERSON	's book is a contribution to national as well as to local history .

		While the modern and military slang into which the author often falls is to be pardoned the veteran , yet it is regrettable .

		The sentiment just quoted from Governor
Crawford	PERSON	regarding the unwisdom of the hu - manitarian non-combatant would constitute a sympathetic link with
General Funston	ORGANIZATION	, for he too had some of his warfare to wage with semi - barbarous peoples and suffered severe criticism at the hands of those who did not fully under - stand the conditions under which he had to operate .

		General
Funston	PERSON	does not profess to be writ - ing a history of the two wars in which he partici - pated , but only to give an account of what he saw , with enough of general conditions to enable the reader to understand the narrative . ''

		For this is nothing more than a contribution , such as it may be , to the literature of adventure . ''

		And as such , it must be admitted that it is very interesting reading .


General Funston	ORGANIZATION	has a style which , if not always classical , is crisp and clear and pointed .

		He , too , especially in the part of his reminiscences dealing with the
Philip	PERSON	- pines , indulges in more or less reportorial slang .

		He follows Kipling more than he does
Stev	PERSON	- enson .

		The boy
Funston	LOCATION	, after some exciting adven - tures alone on the
Yukon River	LOCATION	, which proved that he deserved his nickname of '' Fearless Fred , '' enlisted with the Cuban insurrectos as a result of the fiery eloquence of
General Sickles	ORGANIZATION	.

		Four chapters of his book are occupied with the account of his experiences in serving as artillery officer under
Gomez	PERSON	and
Garcia	PERSON	.

		The revelation of Cuban spirit and character has all the evi - dence of sincerity and truthfulness .

		Funston has many good words to say of the bravery , the devotion , the kindness , and consideration of his Cuban comrades .

		While admitting that he entered the Cuban service chiefly from love of adventure , he sympathized with their desire for independence , and still believes that '' Fairminded Americans , who will consider the tremen - dous sacrifices made by the people of the island , will want to see the young republic endure .

		That is the attitude of the few of their countrymen now surviving who shared with the patriots the dangers , the hunger , and other privations of the final struggle . ''

		But likewise of the Spanish soldier , both in
Cuba	LOCATION	and in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, the author has good to say . ''

		He was brave and patient , and by no means the inhuman brute that he has been made out to be , but he had little heart in the war , and was always getting yellow fever and other undesirable things . ''

		General
Funston	PERSON	also has a word of generous appreciation of a brave negro . ''

		Our first sergeant -LSB- at the siege of Victoria de las Tunas -RSB- was a negro as black as night .

		He was a brave and faithful fellow , and had long ago deserved promo - tion , but our chief had feared we Americans would re - sent such action .

		But
Las Tunas	ORGANIZATION	settled it with us , and we went to the general in a body and said we would be glad to have him as a fellow officer .

		He was glad to comply , and it was my pleasant task to surprise the gal - lant soldier by handing him his commission as second lieutenant . ''

		One may wonder whether
General Funston	ORGANIZATION	's democracy has so far survived ten years of regu - lar army life as to tolerate a colored messmate to-day !

		General Funston is quite unconventional in commenting frankly on army officers and con - ditions .

		He does not hesitate to say that `` the clamor of the yellow section of the press and the deliverances of politicians play ing to the galleries so inflamed public sentiment that the hand of the administration was forced and we were in for a short and sharp little war -LSB- with
Spain	LOCATION	-RSB- . ''

		He was ordered to
Tampa	LOCATION	to furnish informa - tion on Cuban conditions to
General Shafter	LOCATION	, but that gentleman '' seemed to regard him with suspicion , '' and that '' was the attitude of the higher officers generally . ''

		Of General
E. S. Otis	PERSON	he remarks that `` one would about as soon think of cracking a joke in his presence as of trying to pull his beard . ''

		In his Preface the author calls attention to the embarrassment of the inevitable resort to the first personal pronoun , and assures the reader that he is aware that he '' was by no means the only person present in
Cuba	LOCATION	or Luzon . ''

		On the whole , this apology is unnecessary ; for the THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, author is scrupulously generous in the merits and achievements of others , and at the same time is far from loath to report his own failures and humiliations .

		When
Gover	PERSON	- nor
Leedy	PERSON	sent for him to take command of the
Twentieth Kansas Infantry	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Funston	PERSON	offered some suggestions on the need of a good drill-master , the Governor `` told me bluntly that if I did not take the regiment he would give it to Mr. So and So .

		I knew that I could not be a worse colonel than the man named , and ac - cepted . ''

		At the muster-in of the regiment ,
Colonel Funston	ORGANIZATION	had not yet received his uni - form .

		He went out in citizen 's clothes , and was halted by a sentry who informed him that visitors were not allowed within the limits of the camp .

		- I replied , somewhat icily , that I was the colonel of the regiment .

		The sentry was a very tall man , and altitude has never been one of my charms ; so the man bent his head until his month was within a couple of inches of one of ray ears , and , as a most engaging grin overspread his features , whispered , ` Try the next sentry .

		He 's easy ! ' ''

		At
San Francisco Colonel Funston	LOCATION	became very well acquainted with
General Shafter	ORGANIZATION	, but '' never mustered up courage to ask him why I had made such a poor impression on him at
Tampa	LOCATION	.

		He was a blunt man , and might have told me . ''

		But decidedly the best of these jokes at the
Colonel	ORGANIZATION	's own expense is in his interview with General
Miller	PERSON	. ''

		When I entered , saluted rather stiffly , and announced the object of my visit ,
General Miller	ORGANIZATION	looked up , and , as a kindly smile overspread his features , said , Well , well ; so you are a colonel , are you ?

		Sit right down on this box and tell me how anybody came to make a young chap like you a colonel . ' ''

		However , the young chap convinced his supe - riors that those who appointed him had made no mistake .

		Opportunities for reckless daring were plentiful in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, and were seldom neglected by
Colonel Funston	ORGANIZATION	.

		His own account does not always make him the picturesque figure painted by the reporters of the Twentieth Kan - sas , but even
Funston	ORGANIZATION	's modesty can not conceal the fact that he was brave and resourceful and generous to his men .

		Generals
Wheaton	PERSON	and
MacArthur	ORGANIZATION	occupy a prominent place in the narrative , and are well characterized .

		It is not the part of this review to re - tell General Fun - ston 's story .

		If tales of war must be read ,
General Funston	ORGANIZATION	's are as vivid as any and as little gruesome as may be .

		And if professional soldiers there must be , those who know him well will be thankful that the fearful work can be in the hands of as human and humane a man as
Frederick Funston	PERSON	.


W. H. CARRUTH	PERSON	.

		A NOTABLE STUDY OF POET in .

		- Most readers of poetry who ask thciiis.-lv .

		- s what poetry is are in the position of St.
Augus	PERSON	- tiin ' , who , in another connection , said , `` If not asked , I know ; if you ask me , I know not . ''

		Poetry has been defined so often , in so many ways , and with so little success , tli.-it when a fresh attempt is made we are inclined to be so skeptical as not to examine it , on the assumption that here is another dreary eulogy of imagina - tion , of the sort that has flourished during the past hundred years .

		ProfessorNeilson 's lectures -LRB- '' Essentials of Poetry , '' not '' Tin - Kss.-ntials uf Poetry , '' one notes with approval -RRB- is a -RSB- > l.-a > ant disappointment to the skeptical reader .

		Unlike the studies by perfervid romantic - critics and '' Germanized '' scholars , it contains no pet eccentric theory of poetry , but seems to aim , in the good old Socratic sense , to discover the truth .

		With refreshing sobriety the author seeks the solution , not in a new term and not in a new interpretation of old terms , but in a new com - bination of old terms .

		Poetry is not to be regarded as a product with a single essential element , but '' as a com - posite of a limited number of elements , whose proportions are variable , '' these elements being the imagination , the reason , and the sense of fact .

		If one of these be lacking in a givm poetical product , the other two can not make good the deficiency ; if one be in excess , the poem must in some degree suffer ; if all three are present in balance , the poem has the chief traits of a masterpiece .

		In literary history the excess of each of the factors in turn has given rise to what we call Romanticism , Classicism , and Realism . ''

		Romanticism is the tendency characterized by the predominance of imagina - tion over reason and the sense of fact .

		Classicism is the tendency characterized by the predomi - nance of reason over imagination and the sense of fact .

		Realism is the tendency characterized by the predominance of the sense of fact over imagination and reason . ''

		This disposes so easily , one might almost say so prettily , of three treach - erous terms , that one is instinctively antago - nistic ; but simple as the definitions are , they will bear close scrutiny .

		The chapters following are devoted to a dis - cussion of the three conspicuous traits of poetry and the three terms associated with the domi - nance of one or other of these traits .

		The chapter on imagination is , perhaps of necessity .

		E * 8KNTIALB OF PoKTKY .

William Allan Neilson	PERSON	.


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houston Miftlin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 129 the least satisfactory ; for , as the author himself suggests , no chapter of sixteen pages could dis - cuss adequately so elusive a subject .

		The various definitions of romanticism are then attacked lustily , those stressing Medievalism and the `` return to nature '' yielding most readily ; after which the definition given in an earlier chapter is insisted on .

		In the next chapter , reason is made substantially equivalent to '' form , '' and the meaning of classical is clearly analyzed .

		Finally comes the sense of fact , '' lending steadi - ness to imagination and supplying material to reason , '' which , when it dominates , tends to produce realistic poetry .

		These are the ingredients of the magic cal - dron ; the fire that should melt and fuse them is Intensity , a term that , as Professor
Neilson	PERSON	says , has the advantage of being less dubious in meaning than emotion , or feeling , or passion .

		Incidentally , it is the element that
Arnold	LOCATION	sought when he seized on '' high seriousness . ''

		In this chapter is included the matter of rhythm , '' one of many aids to the expression of inten - sity . ''

		Intensity is , then , quite as essential as the three elements already discussed ; in
Landor	LOCATION	, for instance , who possessed the three elements in approximate balance , we find in his lack of in - tensity an explanation of his failure to produce poetry of the first order .

		The rest of the book is devoted to an ex - amination of certain minor qualities of poetry sentiment and sentimentalism , and humor in its various aspects .

		The distinction between senti - mentalism on the one hand and sentiment and passion on the other , together with the historic survey and the application of examples , forms a chapter of great interest and throws much light on the leading conceptions of the book .

		Of still more interest intrinsically , though of less im - portance as a part of the book , is '' Humor in Poetry , '' a theme that has hitherto had no ade - quate treatment .

		Such , in brief , are Professor
Neilson	PERSON	's
Lowell Lectures	ORGANIZATION	on poetry .

		Only one difficulty is likely to occur to the reader , a difficulty involved in the definition of romanticism as the predomi - nance of imagination over reason and the sense of fact .

		The author has in mind that recurring predominance of the imagination that enables us to call romantic two eras so unlike as the age of
Elizabeth	PERSON	and the Romantic Movement of the early nineteenth century .

		Most critics who have essayed a definition of romanticism have had in mind primarily the
Romantic Movement	ORGANIZATION	.

		From
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Heine	ORGANIZATION	to Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	and Professor Beers , critics have tried to lay hold of the essence of nineteenth century romanti - cism ; and in their conception of romanticism they have included , rightly or wrongly , what Professor
Neilson	PERSON	disposes of as sentimentalism .

		When Sainte-Beuve asserted that reverie is at the heart of romanticism , he was thinking , not of
Elizabethan England	LOCATION	and
Calderon	PERSON	and
Lope de Vega	PERSON	, but of those who exemplified in one way or another the traits of
Rousseau	PERSON	, high - priest of sentimentalism and father of latter-day romanticism .

		One can not quarrel with the con - clusion that Professor
Neilson	PERSON	reaches through regarding romanticism as a tendency that flares out at intervals in the history of poetry ; but one must remember that , from this point of view , the Romantic Movement was largely , per - haps mainly , sentimental , at least if one is thinking of the
Romantic Movement	ORGANIZATION	on the Continent as well as in
England	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Neilson	PERSON	does not endeavor to arrive at a final definition of poetry ; he seeks , rather , to limit the meaning of some of '' the hard - worked counters of the critical game , '' to relate these terms to the nature of poetry and to each other and to the perfect work of art .

		Second - arily he seeks to give the reader of poetry a point of view from which he may see more clearly what poetry is , what `` schools '' of poetry are , and by means of which he may derive a keener aesthetic enjoyment from the reading of poetry .

		And though for the most part distinctly popular in treatment , these lectures will not fail to engage the attention of the scholar .

		Aside from acute illustrative comments on
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	,
Burns	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	, and
Arnold	LOCATION	, Professor
Neilson	PERSON	presents a view of poetry that has un - usual clarifying properties .

		Whoever ventures into the misty and hungry lands of romantic criticism , is likely to come away -LRB- as one
Elizur Wright	PERSON	came away from
Carlyle	LOCATION	's works -RRB- '' with an unaccountable sense of emptiness . ''

		To
Shelley	PERSON	, poetry is '' the expression of the imag - ination , '' to
Hazlitt	PERSON	`` the language of the imag - ination and the passions , '' to
Ruskin	PERSON	`` the sug - gestion , by the imagination , of noble grounds for the noble passions , '' and so on till one is faint with `` imagination '' and the tenuous definitions of that word .

		In Professor
Neil	PERSON	- son 's discussion one finds , once more , fresh air and intellectual poise .

		As a piece of sound expository writing the book is notable ; and the sturdy manner of presentation is , happily , a token of sturdy thought and of avoidance of the metaphysical profundity that is after all not always profound .

		130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, SHATTERING THE SHAW MY i n Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	has written to the publish - ers of Dr.
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	's voluminous biography of himself , to say that in view of the biographer 's difficulties in making such a book he had done '' extraordinarily well . ''

		Those who know their
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	will understand what is meant ; for no living human being is harder to bring under the lens and see as he is , and few human beings have been more misrepresented , than the author of `` Man and Superman . ''

		In over five hundred pages , with an energy and carefulness and sympathy which deserve high commendation , Dr.
Henderson	PERSON	has pre - sented his subject from all conceivable angles ; has not been afraid to make himself a
Boswell	PERSON	of intimate revelation to this erratic
Johnson	PERSON	; and certainly has achieved the result of giving anyone willing to peruse so elaborate a biography a rounded impression of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, a sense of his many-sidedness , and a realization of his essential seriousness , which shall conspire to a truthful picture of a much-maligned man .

		The study is of the kind to make excuse for the laugh or the sneer of the scoffer .

		It assumes what the scoffer and there are still plenty of him will deny : that
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is a person to be taken as master , in the way Dr.
Henderson	PERSON	takes him ; that to give him so much space and attention is not ridiculous .

		But the biography itself will help to dispel this rather shallow attitude , just because it displays , to those who judge him exclusively by a play or two ,
Shaw	PERSON	the Fabian socialist , the effective platform speaker , the bril - liant critic of music and painting and literature , and the stimulating theorist in economics , sociol - ogy , and ethics .

		It can not fail to be seen from such an acquaintance that here is an intellectual leader , whatever you or I may happen to think , or think we think , of this or that drama of his .

		And as we read on , and come to get a clearer understanding of how he is rated in
Europe	LOCATION	, as one of the few British authors to-day constantly read , followed , and discussed , further light upon his true position will have been received .

		This service Professor
Henderson	PERSON	's book does perform ; and I incline to call it a great one .

		To it may be added the intimate off-hand picture given of the man , at the expense of conventional dignity , but on the whole without violating de - corum .

		Dr.
Henderson	PERSON	is not worried about this ; no more was
Boswell	PERSON	.

		The object of both was GKOBOB

		to show the man with the quiver of life to him .

		The Socratic dialogue , the newspaper interview style , ample quotation , a return to the theme for a re-definition , all serve ; for tin - mrthod is eclectic , and it matters not if only the result be attained : a sharper limning of a figure around which already the apochryphal clouds make mist .

		The volume has , too , the cardinal virtue of being intensely interesting , always readable ; this de - spite its length and the apparent meanderings of its subject-matter .

		Both as to the way it is done , and as an illustration of how the book smashes the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	myth , a single quotation will do more than the same amount of description . ''

		Confronted with the point-blank question , 4 To what do you owe your marvellous gift for public speaking ? '

		Shaw characteristically replied : ` My marvellous gift for public speaking is only part of the G. B. S. legend .

		I am no orator , and I have neither memory enough nor presence of mind enough to be a really good debater , though I often seem to be when I am on ground that is familiar to me and new to my opponents .

		I learned to speak as men learn to skate or to cycle , by doggedly making a fool of myself until I got used to it .

		Then I practised it in the open air at the street corner , in the market square , in the park the best school .

		... Of course , as an Irishman I have some fluency , and can manage a bit of rhetoric and a bit of humor on occasion , and that goes a long way in
England	LOCATION	.

		But marvellous gift '' is all my eye . ' ''

		The study is also helpful in its detailed ac - count of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's early days , and the light shed on his ancestry and immediate family .

		The result of a reading of this part of the work is to make clear the fact that the gifted Irishman came of persons of quality , whatever their idio - syncracies and defects ; the mother , always so important in explaining men of genius , MfaHj plainly a most unusual and gifted person , and
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's bringing up , unconventional as it was , full of cultural influences for a coming writer , this being particularly true with regard to music , in which Mrs.
Shaw	PERSON	was so proficient .

		Dr.
Henderson	PERSON	's biography might easily be criticized on the ground of spreading its material over too much space ; yet given the method and the aim , it is a question whether it could other - wise be so well accomplished .

		Criticism might perhaps be directed toward the indistinct way
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	is shown in relation to those time-move - ments of which , as the biographer says , the dra - matist is a part .

		KECENT FICTION .

		* '' The Healer '' has the general characteristics of Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's other novels a seriousness so unre - lieved as to he almost deadly , a lofty scorn of the ignoble in life and thought , an intimate knowledge of the currents of our feverish modern life , a strong feeling for natural beauty coupled with a tendency toward poetical or rhapsodical forms of expression , and a style marked by force rather than distinction .

		These qualities have their attendant defects , but the combination produces striking results .

		Had Ibsen been a novelist , and had he chosen Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's theme in '' The Healer , '' he might have written much the same sort of a novel .

		We link the two names because the note common to both is that of a con - fused idealism , quite sure of what is wrong in our ways of life , but not very clear in its suggestions for setting it right .

		In the present instance , for example , the shafts of indignant satire are chiefly aimed at the medical profession , which we are bidden to behold as an occupation of sordid aims , charlatan - ism and trickery , and self-advertising unashamed .

		But are we seriously to believe that the way out of this slough -LRB- assuming it to exist -RRB- is the way of Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's skilled physician , who takes refuge in a northern wilderness , there ministering to such human flotsam as comes within his reach , or even the later way which brings him back to the city , to live in the slums and serve the poor without money and without price ?

		His final phase seems the most rational , for it finds him directing an endowed hospital for the victims of nervous diseases , while over and above his individual striving there is some - what vaguely suggested the ideal of healing as an institutional function , taken over by society for the common weal .

		There is idealism and to spare in all this , but it does not seem quite certain of its aim , and seems still less certain of the means for attain - ing it .

		There is a strain of mysticism in Mr.
Her	PERSON	- * THE HEALER .

		rick 's description of his '' healer '' which takes us dangerously near to the marshy ground of a charla - tanism more dangerous to social welfare than any of the grosser manifestations which he so unsparingly condemns .

		The fascination of straying into this borderland between real and fantastic thought has swayed many other good writers besides Mr.
Her	PERSON	- rick , but it is an aberration likely to lead into an intellectual quagmire .

		The story of '' The Healer '' is concerned with the `` wild man 's '' wooing and capture of a young woman whose life has been saved by his skill .

		The romantic glamour about him is sufficient to make her forsake home and society to share his wilderness life , but it does not last , and the lure of the flesh-pots brings about a complete estrangement .

		Not , however , before the `` healer , '' in his effort to retain the love of his wife , has made terms with mammon , and come to feel that he has sold his birthright for a mess of pottage .

		In time , he wrenches himself loose from the net he has gathered about him , and regains something of his old inde - pendence and self-respect .

		In dealing with this situa - tion , the author again illustrates his favorite thesis that marriage pulls a man down to a lower level because the wife is on the side of convention and material comfort .

		This would be important , if true , but only a jaundiced mind can see in it the pre - ponderating principle of the married relation .

		Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's women restless , hectic , selfish , material creatures that most of them are seem to be studies in abnormal psychology rather than typical examples of womanhood .

		For every Omphale or Delilah of his imagining there is somewhere in the world more than one Alcestis or Ruth , or , to take historical ex - amples , more than one
Beatrice	PERSON	or
Vittoria Colonna	PERSON	.

		But there is one thing that may always be said for Mr.
Herrick	PERSON	's novels , which is that however unpleas - antly they may affect the reader , they at least set him to thinking about the real issues of life ; they plunge him into its deeper currents instead of leav - ing him to disport himself upon its sunlit surface .

		To those who have read '' Sister
Carrie	PERSON	, '' Mr.
Dreiser	PERSON	's new novel , ``
Jennie Gerhardt	PERSON	, '' will ap - pear one of the more significant books of the year .

		It has the same homely quality , and exhibits the same type of realism , as the earlier work , and is infused with the same sort of quiet and deep human sympathy .

		It is the story of a woman , more sinned against than sinning , whose lot falls among the outcasts , yet who remains in most of the essentials a good woman , and whose errors , although technically serious , are attributable to circumstance and environ - ment rather than to anything vicious in her nature .

		She is the child of respectable working-people in
Columbus	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		The father , a crabbed German of the strictest Lutheran orthodoxy , is out of work much of the time , and the mother takes in washing to support the family .

		They are very poor people .

		One of the mother 's customers is a
United States Senator	LOCATION	, and it is the daughter who carries the bundles to and from his hotel .

		He is won by
Jennie	PERSON	's beauty and sweetness of disposition , and 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, she becomes his victim .

		He folly intends to make her his wife , but his sudden death puts an end to her hopes , leaving her with the burden of an unborn child .

		Jennie is cast out from home by her angry father when her disgrace becomes apparent , and is thrown on her own resources .

		She goes into ser - vice with a wealthy family in
Cleveland	LOCATION	, and there attracts the attention of a visitor to the house , a prosperous man of affairs , the scion of a wealthy family .

		He persuades her to live with him , and , removing to
Chicago	LOCATION	, they establish a home appar - ently as man and wife .

		The man is himself by no means vicious , or in any way like the immoral seducer that makes a game of the pursuit of women .

		He is to all intents and purposes
Jennie	PERSON	's husband , and nothing more than hick of determination pre - vents him from giving a legal sanction to their union .

		He has made for himself a home in which he is happy , and his moral sense is too blunt for him to realize that anything more is necessary .

		Mean - while , the social mill is slowly grinding out the con - sequences of this false relation .

		The man learns of the existence of
Jennie	PERSON	's child , of which he has known nothing , and the story of her unfortunate past is revealed to him .

		Then his family and friends get wind of his domestic irregularity , and bring many kinds of pressure to bear upon him .

		His father 's death brings a staggering problem .

		He must put an end to his illicit domestic establish - ment , or lose his rightful share in the gigantic for - tune and the business which has made it .

		He long hesitates , but finally makes the break , providing a country home for
Jennie	PERSON	and her child .

		Then another woman appears , one of his own class , and precisely the one whom he had thought to wed in his earlier days .

		She throws herself at his head in such fashion that there is no evasion for him , a wed - ding follows , and foreign travel , and general social rehabilitation .

		Meanwhile
Jennie	PERSON	loses her child , and eats out her heart in her solitude .

		She has made no scene , she has just suffered dumbly , admitting to herself that she has deserved it all .

		The closing scene is at the man 's death bed , whither
Jennie	PERSON	has been summoned , his wife being absent in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		And in her consciousness the future stretches out as a series of `` days and days in endless reiteration , and then . ''

		This is a very moving story , gravely proceeding to what , given the conditions of the existing social order , is its only possible logical ter - mination , and leaving the reader with a deep sense of the pity of it all , and a stirring wonder whether in some finer scheme of things , such a soul as
Jennie	PERSON	's , even with her succession of haps and mishaps , might not work out its salvation in honor and peace .

		It offers one of these special instances which seem to defy the application of all the general principles of conventional morality , and which puzzle the mind that would base its sympathies upon a clean-cut dis - tinction between what is right and what is wrong .

		``
Jenny	PERSON	's case , '' in this modern presentment , does not seem nearly as clear as the moralist would like to view it .

		The
London	LOCATION	Publishers ' Circular '' recently singled out , as
Chicago	LOCATION	's two leading literary insti - tutions , Tin .

		DIAL and Mr.
Emerson Hough	PERSON	.

		We are not quite sure that our second choice -LRB- or first -RRB- would have been that of our English critic , but a new novel by Mr.
Hough	PERSON	is pretty sure to take rank among the better products of current American lit - erature .

		We are inclined to think ``
John Rawn	PERSON	, Prominent Citizen '' the best piece of work he has thus far given us .

		For one thing , it does not attempt to link invention with the facts of American history , a field of effort in which the author moves a little heavily and is not altogether convincing .

		Its back - ground is social and of the present time , which does not weaken the characteristically strident note of Mr.
Hough	PERSON	's democracy .

		In the '' prominent citi - zen '' whose career he now describes he has given us a portrait of the sort of unscrupulous egotist who rises from humble circumstances to the proud posi - tion of financial magnate and captain of industry .


John Rawn	PERSON	, after a humdrum existence which has brought him well into the thirties , gets possession of an idea , and exploits it at the expense of the public .

		This idea is nothing less than that which obsesses every physicist , the idea that the unlimited supply of energy which is stored in the ether may be tapped and made to supply power for all the motors of the world .

		Unfortunately for
Rawn	PERSON	, the mechanical device by which this revolution is accomplished is worked out by his son-in-law , who keeps to himself the secret of its construction .

		Thereby hangs the whole complication of the tale , for
Charles Halsey	PERSON	is by way of being a socialist , and he believes that the monopoly of mechanical power at which
Rawn	PERSON	is grasping will bear heavily upon the people and make life harder for them .

		Nevertheless , he con - structs his machine , and it works so convincingly that capital is eager to secure it , and builds up the gigantic organization of which
Rawn	PERSON	has dreamed .

		As president of this
Company	ORGANIZATION	,
Rawn	PERSON	soon becomes a millionaire , of which change of condition his transit - ion from a cottage in
Kelly Row	ORGANIZATION	to a stone palace on the
North Shore	ORGANIZATION	is the visible symbol .

		As his wealth increases , he hardens in his egotism , casts off the simple soul who has been his wife for many years , and replaces her by a beautiful stenographer whom he dazzles with jewels and the display of general opulence .

		In due course , two storms gather about him .

		One is in the business world , for his associates in the power scheme become suspicious , and demand that he `` make good '' with his motors .

		The other is in his domestic relations , for
Halsey	LOCATION	, whose wife has practically forsaken him , carries on an intrigue with Mrs.
Rawn	PERSON	the second , who comes to despise her husband , and professes to be enamoured of the altruistic notions of her lover .

		The latter is kilh-l in a labor riot , the guilty wife fades from the picture , Mrs.
Rawn	PERSON	the first turns up in the nick of time with the million dollars that had been given her as a solatium at the time of the divorce , and the story is hurried to a rather unconvincing conclusion which leaves us to infer that things will be patched
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 133 up somehow .

		There is a good deal of melodrama in this story and much crudity of coloring , but there is also dramatic action , and much forcible writing , and a general quality of virility that is fairly striking .

		Mr.
Hough	PERSON	has a pretty talent for veiled invective and suppressed indignation .

		It is not difficult to perceive that there is a chip on his shoulder most of the time .

		Two historical happenings ` have been skilfully com - bined in the romance of ''
John Temple	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Ralph Durand	PERSON	.

		One is that of the Englishman despatched by
Queen Elizabeth	PERSON	with a message of friendship to
Akbar	LOCATION	, the
Great Mogul	ORGANIZATION	.

		The other is that of the luckless expedition of
Barreto	LOCATION	, which by cause of famine , disease , and treachery , failed in the attempt to make a Portuguese conquest of
East Africa	LOCATION	.

		By departing from historical fact to the ex - tent of sending the Englishman from Goa as a forced member of the African expedition , instead of per - mitting him to reach
Akbar 's Court	ORGANIZATION	, the author has provided the story with an English hero , for the pur - pose of enlisting the warmer sympathy of English readers .

		The expedition is shipwrecked upon the African coast at a point about seven hundred miles south of the nearest Portuguese settlement , and the narrative is mainly concerned with the toilsome march northward , with its attendant perils and en - counters with the natives .

		A Portuguese heroine is provided , whom
Temple	ORGANIZATION	protects so valiantly that he wins her love , wedding her in the end , and remain - ing with her in the '' great place '' of the African chief whose power he has usurped .

		Meanwhile , the remnant of the Portuguese expedition dwindles away after
Barreto	PERSON	's death , and what is left of it withdraws from the enterprise .

		The story offers a rather monot - onous tissue of incidents , for the author has not stooped to the cheap heroics of the merely entertain - ing romancer , but he makes us feel all the time that he is handling the real stuff of history , and that he has sifted the old chronicles to good purpose .

		He knows the country as well as the records , and his narrative bears everywhere the impress of essential truth .

		It is a grim sort of truth , uncolored by the imagination , but for that lack all the more welcome to readers who would rather get close to reality than lose themselves in romantic dreams .

		Mr.
George Birmingham	PERSON	's '' Spanish Gold '' also links our interest with the Elizabethan period , but only because the quest of the treasure-hunters is the spoil of a galleon of the Armada , wrecked on the coast of an Irish island .

		Otherwise , the story is modern , and tells how the curate of Ballymoy and his friend Major Kent get track of the gold , repair to the island in their yacht , and have various diffi - culties with the natives , the representatives of the government , and a precious pair of rascally rival gold-hunters .

		The
O'Flaherty	PERSON	-LRB- a native -RRB- bears off the honors , for he has long had the treasure in his possession , but the adventurers get a lot of fun out of their expedition .

		Mr.
Birmingham	PERSON	is by way of being a humorist of the dry type , and his story is really one of character rather than of adventure .

		As such , it is human and diverting in a high degree .

		Two other novels by the same hand give evidence of the same engaging sort of humor . ''

		The Search Party '' tells how Dr.
Lucius O'Grady	PERSON	, an impecuni - ous medical officer of the
Poor Law Union of Clon	ORGANIZATION	- more , falls into the hands of the
A. M. B. A.	PERSON	, and how his determined fiancee ,
Miss Adeline Maud Blow	PERSON	, comes to his rescue .

		The initials betoken the Anti-Militarist Brotherhood of Anarchists , whose leader is one Mr.
Red	PERSON	, who leases the old dower - house of Rosivera , several miles distant from any - thing , and occupies it with his minions .

		What he does there excites the curiosity of the Clonmore villagers , and even the reader is vouchsafed nothing more than a general impression that the place is a laboratory for the manufacture of bombs .

		Dr.
O'Grady	PERSON	is summoned to Rosivera professionally , and becomes lost to the world .

		He is kept a pris - oner by the redoubtable Mr. Red , not unwillingly , because he is promised a handsome fee for each day of his sojourn , and he foresees the possibility of paying all his debts .

		Soon after his disappearance , Miss Blow appears in
Clonmore	LOCATION	, convinced that he has been murdered , and stirs up the authorities to investigate .

		She is the sort of young woman who knows what she wants , and gets it .

		When suspicion falls upon
Rosivera	PERSON	and its mysterious tenant , various persons , from police officers to Members of
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment , seek out the place , and all are kidnapped and held in durance by the truculent Mr. Red .

		Finally , Miss Blow takes command , heads a search party , and discovers all the prisoners , their captor having made his escape .

		The literary value of this simple - minded tale is to be found in its delineation of the evasive Irish character and its satirical dabs at official - dom , as represented by the police and the visiting M. P 's .

		Mr.
Birmingham	PERSON	's third novel is entitled ''
Lai	PERSON	- age 's Lovers , '' which is a misnomer , for Lalage has no lovers in the romantic sense , although toward the end of the book the
Archdeacon	PERSON	sues for her hand , which she bestows instead upon the diplomat who tells her story .

		She is a piquant child , with tomboy - ish propensities , who develops into a young woman with a zeal for reforming the world .

		Her career as a school-girl , a student at
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	, and a political campaigner , is suggestive of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's early years .

		Like the poet , she scandalizes the college authorities by rushing into print , and society by her breezy way of taking a hand in the political game .

		Her `` Gazette , '' the organ of the
Anti-Tommyrot Society	ORGANIZATION	, has for its mark the bench of bishops , and her Asso - ciation for the
Suppression of Public Lying	ORGANIZATION	brings confusion into the campaign for a parliamentary seat in which the diplomat -LRB- whom she has secretly marked for her own -RRB- is one of the contestants .

		Nearly all the electors abstain from voting in their disgust at her revelations , and the hero is defeated , greatly to his relief .

		With all these agitations and activities , Lalage remains deliciously childish , and originality is never lacking in her doings .

		This story is the best of the three with which the planet of the new Irish novelist has swum into our ken ; its humor is the 134 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, dryest and the least forced .

		We shall hope to ex - tend oar acquaintance with Mr.
Birmingham	PERSON	.

		The underlying idea of `` Under Western Eyes '' is that no amount of effort will enable
Western Europe	LOCATION	to understand the Russian character or to fathom its strange workings .

		We may study the Russian writers as diligently as we please and particularly the three great revealers , Tourgue * nu-tl .

		Tolstoy , and Dostoieffsky we shall always be baffled by a residuum of motive and action for which our Western intelligence has no explanation .

		Mr.
Joseph Conrad	PERSON	, being himself of Slavonic strain , can do something to make us realize this difficulty anew , but he is frankly hopeless about clearing away the mystery .

		His new book is in the manner of Dos - toieffsky , and it seems to be quite the equal of '' Crime and Punishment '' in its psychological power .

		It is a very wordy book , forcing its analysis to the in - most depths , but that is a part of the scheme .

		Here is what he says of `` the Russians ' extraordinary love of words : '' '' They gather them up , they cherish them , but they do n't hoard them in their breasts ; on the contrary , they are always ready to pour them out by the hour or by the night with an enthusiasm , a sweeping abundance , with such an aptness of application sometimes that , as in the case of very accom - plished parrots , one ca n't defend oneself from the suspicion that they really understand what they say .

		There is a gen - erosity in their ardor of speech which removes it ajs far as possible from common loquacity ; and it is ever too discon - nected to be classed as eloquence . ''

		The outpouring of words which supplies the ma - terial for the present novel is
Razumov	ORGANIZATION	's journal , an imaginary record which has come into the hands of the author , who represents himself as an imaginary teacher of languages .

		All this is a transparent fic - tion , of course , and is merely the device by which Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	has sought to give added verisimilitude to his narrative .

		He does not quote from the jour - nal verbatim , but draws upon it for the material which he fashions in his own manner .

		The story opens with one of those crimes of assassination which so disfigure Russian history .

		The murderer , fresh from his bloody deed , seeks refuge in the rooms of Razumov , an ambitious and solitary student with whom his acquaintance is of the slightest , and , un - invited , tells what he has done , and asks for aid in effecting an escape .

		Forced thus into an unwelcome complicity ,
Razumov	PERSON	realizes that all his prospects are imperilled by the dangerous knowledge that has been thrust upon him , yet nevertheless volunteers his assistance , and makes an earnest effort to secure for his guest the means of flight .

		But the plan fails , and
Razumov	PERSON	, in a revulsion of feeling , becomes persuaded that self-interest and duty alike require that he should denounce the assassin to the author - ities .

		This he does , with the result that
Haldin	PERSON	is arrested , tried and hanged , while his betrayer 's share in the business is successfully concealed .

		In fact , a rumor spreads through revolutionary circles that
Razumov	PERSON	is a heroic soul who has shared with
Haldin	PERSON	the glory of the crime , and he becomes an object of adulation and reverence .

		Meanwhile , he accepts a government mission to go to
Geneva	LOCATION	as a spy , and report iijxm the revolutionary activities of the Swiss group of exiles .

		Here , by the irony of fate , he becomes acquainted with the mother and sister of the man whom lie has betrayed to death .

		and his soul is torn by love for the sister and re - morse for his treachery .

		His agonized conscience will give him no rest , and at last forces a confes - sion from his lips a confession first made to the girl , and then to the Russian conspirators , who at once wreak a fearful punishment upon him .

		I1U life is not taken , but he is crippled and his hearing is destroyed , leaving him to drag out a useless and miserable existence .

		Such is the outline of this searching story of a tortured conscience , and the story is told with a power and a penetration that make it a very remarkable work indeed .

		It has much of the best quality of the great Russian novels , and with it that element of detachment which Tour - gue ` nieff alone among them was enabled to put into his work .

		We are inclined to say that '' Under Western Eyes '' is Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's masterpiece .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		JJuiEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		To their series of translations from M '
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Messrs. Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have now added '' Death , '' a short essay spread out over one hundred pages , bound in a pale sunset-green that neutralizes the joyless title .

		But if death is joyless , it is not because
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	has made it so his essay primarily aims to rob death of its terrors .

		Complaining that we do not grant '' one hour of our intelligence '' to this flimsiest of human ideas , he sets out to make a sober and thoughtful study of death .

		First he bids us no longer associate death with the last struggles of life ; then not to associate death with the grave , which has its origin in man 's mistaken ideals and not in death itself .

		These two terrors are not essen - tial , but ancillary and avoidable , and only one possi - ble terror remains that of the unknown into which we are plunged .

		Outside of the religious which he puts aside with dispatch rather than regret there are , says
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, only four imaginable solutions : total annihilation , which is impossible since nothing can perish utterly ; survival with our present consciousness , which is absurd and in any case has no terrors ; survival without any sort of con - sciousness , which is possible and also has no terrors ; lastly , survival with universal consciousness differ - ent from that which we possess in this world , which is again possible and terrorless .

		In any event , there is nothing to fear .

		Beautiful Death , gliding with M.t ' t feet , is of course not a new conception ; romanticists like
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, who would fain embrace every - thing , have not failed to embrace Death .

		What is especially significant in
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's essay , how - ever , is his calmness in setting aside the religion of
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 135 his fathers the impediment to free speculation is gone forever ; and , further , his complete aloofness from the question of the ages , the nature of good and evil .

		The whole problem of good and evil , it seems , is so baffling that we had better shun it en - tirely ; far more poetic is the destiny of man if we are all of the elect .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's essay may bring comfort to the virtuous gentleman who reads
Emer	PERSON	- son ,
Browning	PERSON	, and
Maeterlinck	PERSON	in his library of a Sabbath forenoon ; but it is not for the world at large .

		TWO centuries of
Berlin	LOCATION	court life .

		In '' The Ho .

		use of Hohenzollera :
Two Centuries of Berlin Court	ORGANIZATION	L if e '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , Mr.
E. A. Brayley Hodgetts	PERSON	has produced a volume which by those who care for the lighter phases of history will be found of considerable interest .

		The author has brought to the preparation of his book two very necessary qualifications .

		He knows his
Berlin	LOCATION	by prolonged residence in that city , for many years in the capacity of Renter 's special correspondent ; and he is utterly devoid of everything in the nature of prejudice against the Germans or things German .

		The purpose of the book , indeed , it is explained , is to contribute to the enlightenment of English readers with respect to the social history of their cousins - German and to assist in the dispelling of those illu - sions which are in part responsible for the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	- German tension of the present day .

		Beginning with a resume of Prussian history prior to the accession of
Frederick I.	PERSON	as `` king in
Prussia	LOCATION	'' in
1701	DATE	, the author writes entertainingly of the personal life and court affairs of the nine rulers of the Prussian king - dom during the past two hundred years , including the present King and Emperor ,
William II	PERSON	.

		Inci - dentally , he attempts to lay bare the forces and con - ditions which determined the growth of the autocratic Prussian monarchy , the principal thesis being that the situation of
Prussia	LOCATION	, `` inserted like a wedge amongst races and peoples impatient to fly at each other 's throats , '' early accustomed patriotic Prussians to the all but unquestioning identification of sovereign and nation .

		The query is raised though not answered as to whether the present Emperor may not be '' slowly educating his people to the use of free insti - tutions and carefully teaching them to walk by them - selves . ''

		For the student of history the book contains very little that is new , or even worth while .

		It abounds in sweeping statements that betray the au - thor 's lack of the historical sense .

		We are informed , for example , that it was the support of the
Great Elector	LOCATION	,
Frederick William	PERSON	, that '' made the acces - sion of
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	on the English throne as
William III	PERSON	.

		a possibility '' -LRB- p. 10 -RRB- .

		We are told categorically that , but for the statesmanship and genius of the Great Elector , '' there would have been no Prussian state '' -LRB- p. 17 -RRB- .

		An historical work which the author extravagantly commends -LRB- p. 258 -RRB- is agreed by scholars to be of doubtful value .

		Fi - nally , it may be questioned whether a volume which dwells at such length upon the foibles and shortcom - ings of certain of the Emperor 's ancestors may be expected really to contribute to the very laudable ob - ject which Mr.
Hodgetts	PERSON	professes to have in mind .

		Sketches of From the rather obvious moralizings some English on life and duty and things in gen - personahties .

		eral , which have become familiar to us in Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	's recent essays , it is a pleas - ure to read through the biographical sketches which make up his latest volume , '' The Leaves of the Tree '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Brought up in the household of an English schoolmaster , who ultimately became
Archbishop of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	, and engaged in school and university work himself , Mr.
Benson	PERSON	had ample opportunity to meet and know some of the finest minds of his time , from Bishops Westcott and Light - foot in the Church to
Frederick Myers	PERSON	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	out of it .

		The present essays are an attempt to make vital the personalities of the men they treat of and to form an estimate of their work .

		The inti - mate relationships that often sprang from the inter - est of the older man in the observant and intelligent youngster or stripling enable Mr.
Benson	PERSON	to reveal sides of character hidden to the world .

		It is per - sonality that most attracts the essayist , and conse - quently those essays that most reflect personality are the ones that hold the reader .

		The sketch of
Kingsley	PERSON	, whom Mr.
Benson	PERSON	knew well , is much more successful than that of
Arnold	LOCATION	, whom he knew only slightly .

		The former essay is vital with the exuberant individuality of this shining exponent of muscular Christianity ; the latter is a rather labored criticism of
Arnold	LOCATION	's life and work .

		This criticism is mainly concerned with
Arnold	PERSON	's religious opinions , though part of it deals too with his poetry .

		Why '' Balder Dead '' should be spoken of as a play and '' Sohrab and Rustum '' as a fragment is not clear .

		One feels , too , like questioning the statement that
Arnold	PERSON	's is a nature '' which dreads the fight and the struggle , the elements which to coarser and stronger spirits , who do not trouble thpmselves about the wounds they inflict , add zest to the things for which they fight , '' when one recollects the ringing final stanza of `` The Last Word .

New York	LOCATION	-RRB- and held various public offices , including the attorney-generalship under
Jackson	PERSON	, was himself a lawyer of distinction , but more widely known as an author .

		His best-remembered production , '' Nothing to Wear , '' which he contributed to ``
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly '' in
1857	DATE	, was reprinted far and wide , and even made its way into French and German litera - ture in translated form .

		Concerning this and his other literary ventures , Mr.
Butler	PERSON	has much of 136 THE DIAL -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, interest to record in his reminiscences ; but a leading motive with him in writing the book was , he tells us , to trace '' the rise , progress , supremacy and de - struction of the slave power in the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		Many public men and much national history are consequently brought into his reminiscent and nar - rative chapters , but it is his memories of his father and of his more intimate friends that glow with the warmest life .

		The elder
Butler	PERSON	's unsuccessful attempt to start a law school in connection with the
University of the City of New York	ORGANIZATION	the author regards as a novel experiment predestined to failure , forgetting that the
Harvard Law School	ORGANIZATION	had suc - cessfully started in
1817	DATE	, and that the famous school of Judge
Tappan Reeve	PERSON	at
Litchfield	LOCATION	,
Conn.	LOCATION	, flour - ished as early as
1784	DATE	, not to mention the law pro- fessorships early established at various colleges in different parts of the country .

		The editorial work has been well done .

		Several poems and parts of poems are reprinted to illustrate Mr.
Butler	PERSON	's style ; Mr. H -LRB- > wells ' - encomium of the most popular of these poems is reproduced ; and an appendix contains a number of tributes to the lawyer-poet 's memory .

		Good portraits and other illustrations are provided , and a full index completes the volume .

		With the publication of
M. Henri	PERSON	aergton * theory of
Bergson	PERSON	s '' Laughter : An Essay on tte comic .

		tne Meaning of the Comic '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- , as translated by Messrs.
Cloudesley Brereton	PERSON	and
Fred Rothwell	PERSON	, all of
Bergson	PERSON	's main works become accessible to the English reader .

		Of these the present small volume is by far the easiest reading for the layman , and in it the great French thinker gets far enough away from his main theme to indi - cate a general theory of art .

		It also exhibits his method of inquiry , and , in a notable degree , the poetry and richness of his style .

		Starting with the conception of the man who falls over a brick on the pavement , in the customary newspaper cartoon , on to the subtlest of satiric character delineations by
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	and others ,
M. Bergson	PERSON	pursues the trail of the comic , showing incidentally the inadequacy of previous theories of its nature and effects .

		His con - clusion , in barest statement , is that the comic is the result of the human spirit being clogged in its pro- gress by matter , that wherever the soul permits itself to become checked , to fall into mechanical repetition , it there exposes itself to ridicule .

		This ridicule is a purely social phenomenon , and a purely intellectual one .

		It is society 's weapon for disciplin - ing those minor breaches of her rules that are not great enough to bring down condigner punishment . ''

		Its function is to intimidate by humiliating . ''

		While staider art , says
M. Bergson	PERSON	, has the function of showing us individual and unique pictures of life pictures which we need because our intellect , func - tioning for the utilitarian purposes of life , can only give us classes and categories , never the unique .

		The distinction he draws , therefore , between art as art and the comic spirit , is that the comic spirit being of the intellect gives us again the type , the thing that we have recognized before and will recog - nize again .

		And it gives us the type that we may laugh it out of court .

		Like the foam < > t ill .

		- a. laughter plays on the surface of life only .

		Like froth it sparkles .

		It is gaiety itself .

		But the phil - osopher who gathers a handful to taste may find that the substance is .

		scanty , and the aftertaste hitter . ''

		1 two volumes entitled '' In Tudor ifrraijiffui r * < of Tudor and 1 imes and '' In
Stewart	PERSON	Times
Stewart	PERSON	time , .

		-LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- ,
Miss Edith L. Elias	PERSON	has covered the lives of fourteen rulers from
Henry VII	ORGANIZATION	.

		to Queen
Anne	PERSON	a matter of some two centuries and a quarter .

		In addition to the ruler * .

		Mi Klias has given us brief lives of thirty-eight of the prin - cipal personages of those days .

		In the first volume are sketches of half a dozen churchmen , from
Wolsey	LOCATION	to
John Knox	PERSON	, including one foreigner , Luther : of four sailors ,
Columbus	LOCATION	,
Sebastian Cabot	PERSON	,
Hawkins	PERSON	, and
Drake	PERSON	; of four courtiers , all of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's reign ; and , under the heading `` The Renaissance , '' of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	, More ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the second volume , under '' The State , '' are lives of nine men , among them the first Duke of
Buckingham	LOCATION	,
Hampden	LOCATION	, and the
Earls of Strafford	ORGANIZATION	,
Clarendon	LOCATION	, and
Shaftesbury	LOCATION	; under '' The Army , ''
Fairfax	LOCATION	,
Graham	PERSON	,
Monck	PERSON	-LRB- all of Commonwealth times -RRB- , and
Churchill	LOCATION	; under '' Religion , '' Laud ,
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	,
Baxter	PERSON	, and
Penn	LOCATION	; and under '' Science and the Fine Arts , ''
Bacon	PERSON	,
Wren	PERSON	, and
Newton	LOCATION	.

		It would be easy to complain of the omission of perhaps an equal number of men ; but those included all de - serve their place , especially as
Miss Elias	LOCATION	's purpose is historical rather than literary .

		The lives are all brief :
Columbus	LOCATION	has only four pages ,
Elizabeth	PERSON	and
Charles II	PERSON	.

		only fifteen pages each , while the aver - age is about ten pages .

		Dates and precise details are given sparingly , for there is a constant effort to present the characters of the persons and their gen - eral relation to their times .

		There is one puzzling misprint -LRB- `` In Tudor Times , '' p. 164 -RRB- : '' It was a stupendous undertaking to diver his small craft down this tortuous passage . ''

		Should it be '' drive '' ?

		And there is one obvious slip -LRB- '' In Stewart Times , '' p. 51 -RRB- :
Cromwell	PERSON	's death `` was less than two hun - dred years since the great
Elizabeth	PERSON	had passed away . ''

		For the rest , the books are pleasantly writ - ten , and should serve to stimulate their readers to further interest in the periods treat -- !

		. ''

		An
Army	ORGANIZATION	Officer on Leave in JP '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is the account of a journey through
Japan	LOCATION	, preceded by chapters on the city of
Manila	LOCATION	, the Philippine insurrection , the island of
Formosa	ORGANIZATION	, and interlarded with discussions of the origin of the Japanese , the history of
Japan	LOCATION	and its religions , and the story of the persecutions of the Christians in that country .

		The author , Colonel
L. Mervin Maus	PERSON	of the
United States Army	ORGANIZATION	, writes in a familiar style , lacking wholly in distinction , and frequently exceedingly loose .

		This style is in agreement with the quality
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 137 of the matter it conveys , for there is but little origi - nality in thought or information .

		Most of the sub - stance of the volume might be gleaned from the pages of standard books of reference , to which the author acknowledges his indebtedness .

		Yet the agreeable personality of the writer , and the thin stream of personal narrative flowing through the accounts of things seen and discussions of history and religions , render the book entertaining .

		A great portion of the information is conveyed in the form of disquisitions delivered by a well-informed `` Major , '' who , together with a `` Judge , '' happened to be companions of Colonel Maus ; and this device may aid in rendering the book interesting to readers whose chief diet is light fiction .

		With such readers the book will perform a useful service , for its facts appear to have come from the best sources , and its spirit of friendliness and respect toward orientals is wholesome for a large portion of the American pub - lic .

		The appendix , giving information as to routes of travel between the
United States	LOCATION	and eastern
Asia	LOCATION	, and the cost of such travel , is practical and satisfactory .

		.

		The aspiring art-student and more wifon or / particularly the British art-student -LRB- for there are national ideals and national methods in art -RRB- will surely be interested in the practical side of '' Art , Artists , and Land - scape Painting '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , a collection of infor - mal essays by the English artist , Mr.
W. J. Laidlay	PERSON	.

		Chapters on art-subjects , ranging from such general topics as `` Art , '' `` Artists , '' and `` Criticism , '' to mat - ters like `` Composition , '' `` Studies , '' `` Materials , '' and '' Things to be Avoided , '' make up this three - hundred-page octavo , excellent in paper and typog - raphy as one could wish .

		Unfortunately the book itself is rather a disappointment .

		The general essays are a well-meant but tedious pursuit of the obvious , and their weakness is not concealed by a didactic tone and a wealth of more or less relevant gossip .

		An artist , however , is not expected to be strong in aesthetic theory , and the advice Mr.
Laidlay	PERSON	has to offer on specific details of practice is an honest and generous contribution to the science which , since the abandonment of studio-apprenticeship , each artist has had to learn for himself .

		After all , this volume is for the serious beginner in art ; and if the author 's lack of humor prove tedious to less serious people , they should remember the purpose of the volume , and not expect every one of last year 's books on art to be as interesting as
M. Gsell	PERSON	's '' Rodin '' or Mr.
Cox	PERSON	's '' Classic Point of View . ''

		An interpreter Mr '
Edwin BjOrkman	PERSON	, in a small of modern volume of essays entitled '' Is There philosophy .

		Anything New under the Sun ? ''

		-LRB- Kennerley -RRB- , writes informingly on the teachings and personalities of certain leading contemporary thinkers , and optimistically on the meaning and values which modern thought and modern aspira - tion are extracting from life .

		The first three essays in the book are taken up with the author 's own con - ceptions of life , which he sees as no mere product of mechanical or other blind forces but as a pur - posive activity bending matter and circumstances to the higher uses of the spirit .

		In these essays the influence of
M. Bergson	PERSON	and his fellow apostles of the `` 6 Ian vital '' is marked ; and so it is no sur - prise , in passing to the second section of the book , to find a clear and appreciative article on the French philosopher who is being hailed as the world 's great - est contemporary thinker , a philosopher who bids fair to do for Post - Darwinian philosophy what
Kant	PERSON	did for the philosophy of an earlier day .

		The author is equally at home in his essay on
William James	PERSON	, whom he describes as `` a builder of American ideals . ''

		The last chapter is taken up with Mr.
BjOrkman	PERSON	's views of `` Art , Life , and Criticism . ''

		^ Esthetics is so often considered from the standpoint of an escape from life following the pessimism of that master of aesthetics ,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	that it is refreshing to read the ideas of a critic who is free both from the cant of art for art 's sake and from the oppo - site sin of regarding art as a handmaiden of moral instruction , but who sees it as an expression of the life spirit , serving the enlargement of life and having a standing as valid as that of science or religion .


William Allingham	PERSON	's friendship with a wide circle f more r le88 f am .

		US men and women made him the recip - ient of many letters that have unusual interest for the reading public .

		In a volume entitled '' Letters to
William Allingham	PERSON	'' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , his widow , assisted by Mr.
E. Baumer Williams	PERSON	, has collected and published a considerable number of epistolary messages from a half-hundred and more of his correspondents , together with a few of his replies .

		But though we have his '' Diary '' to help us in forming some clear conception of the man , hardly any of his letters have been preserved which a reading of those now printed makes one regret .

		Among the sympathetic English friends who in such numbers conceived a liking for the Irish poet , and corresponded with him more or less familiarly , are to be noted
William Black	PERSON	, Mr. and Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	, the
Carlyles	LOCATION	,
Ros	PERSON	- setti ,
Burne-Jones	PERSON	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	,
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	,
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	,
Lecky	PERSON	,
Martineau	PERSON	, Mill ,
Patmore	PERSON	,
Spedding	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Millais	PERSON	,
Lander	ORGANIZATION	, and many others .

		Two letters from and three to
Emerson	LOCATION	are also in the collection ; likewise two from
Hawthorne	LOCATION	.

		From
Rossetti	PERSON	only one is given , the others having been already published -LRB- first in the `` Atlantic Monthly , ''
1896	DATE	-RRB- under the editorship of Dr.
Birkbeck Hill	PERSON	.

		An appendix contains three of
Allingham	PERSON	's poems referred to in the letters , and other matters of interest .

		A portrait of the poet and facsimiles of letters written and illustrated by Burne-Jones are inserted , and a fourteen-page index ends the book .

		An agreeably varied assortment of letters , strung together most gracefully on a common thread of friendship , they present
William Allingham	PERSON	in very attractive guise .

		138 THE DIAJ , -LSB-
Feb. 16	DATE	, A , tu < t v in the The title of Mis8
Charlotte	LOCATION	E. Mor - gan 's book , '' The Rise of the Novel o f Manners '' -LRB-
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is misleading ; the nature of the work is much more precisely indicated by its sub-title , M A Study of English Prose Fiction between
1600	DATE	and
1740	DATE	. ''

		The volume is mainly a historical and critical treatise of the English novel for the period intervening between the close of the sixteenth cen - tury and the publishing of ''
Pamela	PERSON	. ''

		This period is one of the dreariest for the history of fiction in all of our literary annals .

		But it was , for all that , a period of beginnings , and as such is not without its importance ; and it is one of the substantial re - sults of
Miss Morgan	LOCATION	's inquiry to show how large its influence was upon the major novelists of the eighteenth century in particular , upon
Richard	PERSON	- son .

		The study falls into four chapters , the first devoted to the romance and anti-romance , the second and third to the novel -LRB- by which is meant the brief tale -RRB- , and the last to journalistic and other popular fiction of the type of
Defoe	ORGANIZATION	's pamphlets .

		A chap - tar of conclusions mainly a summary of such tendencies and influences as are discoverable fol - lows .

		And to this is appended a lengthy bibliog * raphy containing , among other things , a list of more than six hundred prose narratives first published in
England	LOCATION	between
1600	DATE	and
1740	DATE	, with brief com - ment on each .

		The study is by no means exhaustive or definitive , it is , as the author frankly admits , '' but a clearing of the ground in a field where little has been done and much remains to be accomp - lished '' ; nevertheless , it affords the fullest discus - sion of the field that has so far been vouchsafed us , and must prove distinctly serviceable both to the general student and to future investigators .

		Mr.
W. Barbrook Grubb	PERSON	, the author of `` An Unknown People in an Unknown L ^ d '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , is a missionary of the
Church of England South American Mis	ORGANIZATION	- sionary Society , who has spent his life since
1889	DATE	among the Lengua Indians of the Paraguayan Chaco , a region of perhaps three thousand square miles on the upper
Paraguay River	LOCATION	.

		He has devoted his time to exploring the country , learning the language and habits of the barbarous peoples , and winning their confidence to such an extent as to receive from the Roman Catholic government of
Paraguay	LOCATION	the title of ''
Commissary General of Chaco	ORGANIZATION	and
Pacifi	PERSON	- cator of the Indians . ''

		As the result of his mission he has practically reclaimed this immense territory , opened it up to white ranchers , and trained the Indians to be useful servants of the world 's indus - trial progress .

		Mr.
Grubb	PERSON	's book is an account of the people of this country rather than a record of his own exploits .

		The book is therefore not only a con - tribution to the heroic literature of missions , but also a contribution of value to the literature of ethnology .

		Appendices dealing with the flora and fauna of the country are contributed by experts .

		The illustrations , furnished by the ubiquitous kodak , are interesting .

March 1	DATE	, The Collected Works of
Ambrose Bierce Edited	ORGANIZATION	and Arranged by the Author 4MBROSE BIERCE no living author has been so much discussed .

		Vet his name is not - ^ * - cried by the newsboys as they pass through the train vending chewing-gum and candy and `` the very latest . ''

		His name is not '' a household word '' among the readers of '' the six best sellers , '' nor is
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	`` studied '' in '' literary '' societies by young ladies .

		But no living author has been so much discussed by the men and the women that have made the literatures of the world of the past fifty years .

		No great living author may say that he has been uninfluenced by
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	.

		Verily this man has colored the literatures of his time .

		And he is still the master whom the masters study and revere .

		We present here extracts from a few of more than five thousand articles in our collection relating to his work and personality .

		BROOKLYN EAGLE : `` The Neale Publishing Company has done the public a real service in prepar - ing a complete and handsome edition of the works of
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	... His work will delight anew , as it long has delighted , the lovers of masterly English .

		The supple English language in his hand is both flail and scalpel and anon the lover 's Into .

		He is one of the writers whom it is a joy to read . ''


EDWIN MARKHAM	PERSON	: `` The genius of
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	travels in many fields in romance , satire , poetry , fable , essay , criticism , epigram .

		We need not look into his books for the learned dulness of the academic Addiaons .

		Wherever we find Bierce we feel the working of a daring intelligence , of an orig - inal mind ; and we feel this even when we dissent from his striding and crushing opinions ... His ia a com - posite mind a blending of Hafiz the Persian , Swift ,
Poe	PERSON	,
Tboreau	LOCATION	, with sometimes a gleam of the Galilean . ''

		BIRMINGHAM AGE-HERALD : `` In every page he has added to the dignity of letters and left his im - print upon the reading world .

		His satire and humor , his style and diction , rank him among the masters of English , and the new and complete edition of his works will no doubt have the effect of bringing the writings of Mr.
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	international renown . ''


TORONTO	LOCATION	MAIL : `` This is a real addition to American letters , for critics everywhere are now vying with one another to honor
Bierce	ORGANIZATION	's qualities as a lit - erary artist .

		It is said in
London	LOCATION	that there has not been such a stir over the work of any American 1k -- tionist since
Frank Norris	PERSON	took
England	LOCATION	by storm . ''


GERTRUDE ATHERTON	PERSON	: `` His place among the American classics is assured . ''

		NEW YORK SUN : `` Mr.
Bierce	PERSON	ia eloquent He makes notable phrases and knows how to construct a tale .

		He has striking imagination and effective humor . ''

		VANITY FAIR -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- : `` Mr.
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	is in the front rank of American critics , if indeed he doea not head them all .

		English critics have some - thing to learn from him ... Satirist , poet , soldier , literary artist in a dozen phases Bierce appeals to the discriminating reader .

		There are no better short stories in the English language than his In the Midtt of Life , but unfortunately these stories have become popular at the expense of his other works .

		... If yon hare not read Bieroe 's Devil 's Dictionary you have a matchless pleasure before you . ''


ROBERT BARR	PERSON	, in The Outlook -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- : '' For years I have been a keen appreciator of
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	.

		... I have written eulogies upon him both in
America	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, and when his latest book came out I bought copies and sent them to a few of the great of the earth .

		... I believe no one on earth can write so terrible a story as
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	can . ''

		PORTLAND -LRB-
Oregon	LOCATION	-RRB- TELEGRAM : `` Indubit - ably the name of
Bierce	ORGANIZATION	is one of the best known among literary men to-day ... Taking his writings ' by and large , ' as a sailor would put it , few competent to judge will contend that he is not one of the greatest masters of English this country has produced , that his rapier-like satire has ever been excelled , and that his war stories do not evince an imagination so terrible , so gruesome as to have an effect on one 's heartbeats and breathing organs , while holding one 's fascinated attention in close leash to the end . ''

		EUGENE FIELD : `` It is our purpose rather to acquaint our readers with the pleasant fact that there has arisen in the literary world in the far , great , glorious West a new and bright star ; that there is of us and among us a genius worthy of our recognition , our encouragement , our benedictions . ''

		THEpDORE F. BONNET , in Town Talk .

		-LRB-
San Francisco	LOCATION	-RRB- : '' Here is a man who has exploited every stream of humor that has ever enriched the literary meadows .

		A critic of literature , of government , and of life , he is at times as droll as
Rabelais	LOCATION	, at time * as caustic as Swift ; he has vindicated the much-disputed maxim that ridicule is the test of truth ; he has been as comic as
Butler	PERSON	, as dexterous and aa mordant as
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, as apt at the finesse of words as Pope .

		As a humorist , like
Horace	PERSON	he has seen the absurdity of pedants , the presumption of political pretenders .

		Like Lucian he ban blended irony with narrative , taking his readers into topsy-turvydom to facilitate the flow of his acid merriment .

		Like
Poe	PERSON	he has taken us into the realm of mystery and builded tales that enchant and bewilder .

		He has written poems that are triumphs of graceful expression and that are permeated with passion and enthusiasm . ''

America	LOCATION	. ''

		SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE : `` Space for - bids the notice adequate to an exposition of
Bierce	ORGANIZATION	's many-sided genius , but it is due to say of the unani - iable
Ambrose	PERSON	that as a combination of the essayist , short-story writer , and versifier he is without peer among living writers of English ...

BRANDER MATTHEWS	PERSON	, in The Cosmopoli - tan : '' Mr.

		A GENIUS OF THE THEATRE XJO publication of many months past is being reviewed so extensively and enthusiastically as
Gordon Craig	PERSON	's book on the Theatre .

		Read the following specimen comments , selected from hundreds of reviews and letters then read the book itself .

		`` In this astonishing volume the soul of the Theatre is articulate ... The author pulls the shrill and tawdry playhouses of two hemispheres clattering about our ears in dust heaps , and from this revolution he rebuilds serene and joyous temples for the aspiring mind ... Whether we agree with its author in whole , or only in part , or not at all , one startling conviction abides from the reading of this book : that , because of it , never again can we think of the Theatre as before . ''

		PERCY MACK AY K -LRB- Author of `` The Scarecrow , '' `` To-morrow , '' etc. i '' Here is a man of genius and his book ... Mr.
Craig	PERSON	is acknowledged all over
Europe	LOCATION	as a master - pioneer in the Theatre .

		... If anyone doubts his genius , they have only to read this book of his .

		Though it will arouse astonishment , anger , despair , on the part of some people , it must also arouse exhilaration , a glow of life , a desire to create on the part of others .

		Few who love the Theatre will know what the book contains without wanting to read it .

		When they do read it , different things will happen ; there will be all sorts of ideas that will conflict , oppose , combine .

		But out of such an apparent chaos it is , very often at least , that there arises finally something beautiful , harmonious , and perfect . ''

He has analyzed the evil of the theatre and stated it with a fearlessness infinitely refreshing in these days of timid thought , speech , writing , and criticism stated it also with charm and disinterestedness .

		179 THE WORK OF THE DRAMA LEAGUE .

		The
Drama League of America	ORGANIZATION	, organized less than
two years ago	DATE	, and engaged in its work of propaganda since the
autumn	DATE	of 1 910 , is growing apace , and its influence is becoming more and more manifest in the field which it has chosen for its activities .

		It works mainly through the agency of women 's clubs , and dur - ing its first year extended its enterprise into no less than
thirty-one States of the Union	LOCATION	, besides gaining members in
Canada	LOCATION	and in
England	LOCATION	.

		It has no paid workers , and the funds at its dis - posal are very limited , but with less than a thou - sand dollars of income it contrived , during its first season , to print and distribute 34,000 copies of its documents courses for the study of the drama , reading lists , and lists of plays for chil - dren .

		Its publicity work was also furthered by some five hundred Chautauqua assemblies and teachers ' institutes , and it was the occasion of many articles in the periodical press .

		This is a highly creditable record , and makes clear the fact that the
League	ORGANIZATION	is a force to be reckoned with in the world of the theatre .

		As is fairly well known by this time , the ef - forts of the organization are especially directed toward the discovery of the plays that are really worth while among the countless offerings of the theatres , and toward the task of acquainting its members and the general public with the results of its investigations .

		It aims to create , in every large city to which its work is extended , a sub - stantial and dependable clientele of playgoers who will be guided by its advice in the selec - tion of the plays which they go to see .

		This is sought to be done by an admirable system of bulletins , prepared immediately after the first performance of a praiseworthy work , and mailed to the members of the
League	ORGANIZATION	, besides being posted in many public places .

		In
Chicago	LOCATION	alone , these bulletins last year were sent to many thousands of persons and were displayed in places where many more thousands must have seen them .

		Fourteen plays were thus bulletined as deserving of support not a large number , and probably not as many as might have been recommended , but enough for the needs of the average play-goer , who does not expect to see everything that is worth seeing , and must be grateful for having his attention directed to so 152 THE DIAL
March 1	DATE	, many commendable works .

		To quote from one of the
League	ORGANIZATION	's circulars , `` so uniformly does this clientele respond to the call of the bulletin that managers have testified to the appreciable influence exerted , '' and '' more than one man - ager has admitted that within forty-eight hours of the time the bulletins are in the mails the effect can be noticed at the box-office . ''

		We noticed the other day on the hoardings a poster proclaiming that a certain worthless production had n `` f been bulletined by the
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	, which seems in its way a fairly striking testi - monial to the usefulness of the organization .

		In view of the record of achievement just outlined , it is not surprising that the note of confidence , and even of jubilation , is sounded in the reports and prospectuses of the
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	.

		It seems hardly too much to assert with its president , Mrs.
A. Starr Best	PERSON	, that '' If we can train the coming generation the au - diences of the next ten years to appreciate and support good drama , to refuse to accept or attend the worthless or unworthy play , the prob - lem of the theatre will have been solved .

		We shall not need specially endowed theatres to put on good plays the managers at large will have to do it themselves in order to secure an au - dience .

		If the audiences of the next decade are trained to know a good play and utterly refuse a bad one , the worthless plays will die an igno - minious death . ''

		The results thus confidently expected are to be brought about by a variety of methods , differing widely in their points of application , but all informed by a common edu - cative purpose .

		The work of the
League	ORGANIZATION	is organized in numerous departments , and some of its collateral activities may be briefly indi - cated .

		It has a committee on publicity which aims to enlist public speakers in many fields to speak of its work , and a large number of lecturers have already pledged themselves to this kind of support .

		It has committees for the collection of press-clippings , for securing the cooperation of clubs in the planning of their yearly programmes , and for getting articles into the magazines .

		It has membership and finance committees with functions related to the in - crease of its budget .

		It has a committee for the preparation of study-courses in the drama , one for the preparation of reading-lists for students , and one for the guidance of amateur actors in the selection of their plays .

		It has a junior department for the encouragement of work with children , both as theatre-goers and as readers or performers of plays .

		It also plans to publish a quarterly bibliography of the cur - rent literature of the subject .

		These are some of the sections of a programme which in its entirety is fairly amazing , so curiously has it searched out the spots of least resistance in the apathy of the general public , and so intelligently has it provided for working upon them .

		Two of the projects of the League call for more extended mention .

		One of these is the determination to do something for the miserable dramatic estate of the small community which has to be content with the occasional '' one night stand '' of the travelling company .

		Whoever has lived in , or even visited for a few days , one of our smaller towns knows how hopeless it is to expect anything of a creditable nature from the local '' opera house '' and its recurrent '' shows . ''

		From one end of the year to the other , no such thing as a good play intelligently produ < - ed is ever visible in most of these places .

		What is needed in a town of this sort is an earnest local committee bent upon securing sufficient advance support for worthy productions to make it possi - ble for their managers to bring them there with - out the certainty of disaster .

		`` Walking the ties '' is an exercise that does not appeal to the imagination of theatrical troupes , and an efficient local committee of
Drama Leaguers	ORGANIZATION	should in many cases be able to see to it that the stranded companies are those that come without its encour - agement . ''

		Organize the audience in advance , and make it possible for the good attractions to visit your town without loss , '' is the slogan of this department of the
League	ORGANIZATION	's activities .

		The other project to which we wish to direct special attention is that of seeing that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's birthday is suitably celebrated this year , and in the years to come .

		This project , already far ad - vanced in the case of
Chicago	LOCATION	, is one that should be applied to the needs of many other coiunnmi - ties in the future , until the twenty-third of
April	DATE	comes to have in the minds of the young an ap - panage of those delightful associations which remain fixed in after life .

		The utterance of the very name of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	breathes a benediction to all who have once yielded to his spell , and his anniversary is as well worth commemorating in the festival spirit as any of the others that tradi - tion has consecrated .

		Such an open-air pageant of Shakespearean groups as the school children of
Chicago	LOCATION	are preparing to produce about the statue of the poet in
Lincoln Park	LOCATION	is one of those things that lend spiritual grace to a com - munity , and appeals to all that is deepest and most reverent in human nature .

		These are stirring times for the drama in
Chicago	LOCATION	, which has never before witnessed any -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 153 thing quite as interesting and significant as the present conjunction of the Irish Players from
Dublin	LOCATION	with the
Drama Players	ORGANIZATION	of our own creat - ing .

		The visiting company is giving us an illus - tration of folk-art of the most absolute sincerity in the most admirable form of presentation .

		The work done by Lady
Gregory	PERSON	's players indicates clearly one of the two chief springs from which the regeneration of the drama must come .

		The work done by Mr.
Donald Robertson	PERSON	's finely - balanced company indicates as the other
spring	DATE	the insistence upon dramas that time has ad - judged to have permanent value .

		The two kinds of work complement each other , and together provide an object-lesson from which the public can not fail to profit .

		It need not be said that the
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	appreciates the opportunity thus offered for the practical furtherance of its aims , and that it is doing valiant work in arous - ing the public from its indifference in things theatrical , and in pointing the moral to be drawn from the two organizations in question .

		What - ever the financial outcome of the two experiments may prove to be , it will have been considerably bettered by the efforts made by the
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	in their behalf .

		WANTED : A CITY-BUILDER .

		A great city ought to be something more than a lodging-place and restaurant for a million people .

		It ought to have a character of its own ; it ought to be an expression of the best thought and life of those who dwell therein ; its ways and walls ought to be a perpetual joy to them ; it ought to be an inspi - ration as well as a possession , a pride and a shield against the rest of the world .

		Except the sowing and reaping of crops , there is nothing in the material way that men do more im - portant than building .

		It provides work and wages for many classes of men architects , artisans , crafts - men , mechanics , laborers .

		It furnishes them with hearths about which their lives centre , and gives them innumerable picture-galleries outside to gaze upon .

		And when the life and glory have departed from a place , the ruins of its buildings draw the feet of travellers to wander among them .

		They are like broken caskets where rich scents have been confined and still exhale the perfume of the past .

		Nature itself has no memories , but a ruined temple or tower ever makes a brave fight for its founders or its families against oblivion .

		The fascination of great cities , what a won - derful thing it is !

		All roads led to
Rome	LOCATION	.

		For a thousand years or more its frontiers and its roofs , its theatres and its baths , its gardens and its thronged ways , glittered in the imaginations of all
Europe	LOCATION	, lured
Gaul	PERSON	and Briton and Spaniard and African to the central hearth of the race .

		The '' lights of
London	LOCATION	'' flare to-day all over
England	LOCATION	, and draw to them a steady stream of human moths .

		The nation is emptying into the town .

		The urban spell the desire to be where life is fullest and brightest , the instinct for the society of crowds and the security of walls , the hope to breathe the intoxicating atmo - sphere where power and genius and art and beauty flourish , to be among them and have one 's name blown abroad over the land , this enchantment works as powerfully to-day as it has always done .

		`` In respect of itself , '' says Touchstone of country life , '' ' t is a good life ; but in respect that it is not at Court , it is naught . ''

		It takes a great mind or a heavy disposition to fight against the contagion of the crowd to refuse to be caught in the whirlpool current of city life .

		Tamerlane the conquerer sent for Hafiz the poet and said to him : ''
Bokhara	LOCATION	and
Samarkand	LOCATION	are the great cities of my realm : yet you , you sir , say in a song that you would give them both for the black mole on your girl 's cheek . '' ''

		Yes , '' answered
Hafiz	PERSON	, '' and it is such liberality as that which has reduced me to the state of desti - tution you see . ''

		After all , the song , or the story of the song , has outlived the cities .

		This indrawing of a nation 's blood to its heart is not the best thing for it , of course ; but it seems to be inevitable .

		Augustus is said to have suggested to
Virgil	PERSON	that he write his Georgics in order to attract the Romans back to their old rural life ; and many statesmen have wrestled with the same problem since .


Baron Munchausen	PERSON	's story of the black mag - netic rock looming up in the ocean , which , when an unwary ship approached it , caused all the nails to fly out of the planking and left the vessel floating in fragments on the waves , may be taken as a sym - bol of what happens to many , very many , of those who yield to the city attraction .

		But if human beings must live in cities , they ought to have the best kind of cities .

		Health , fit - ness , spaciousness ; comfort and beauty in architec - ture ; and something more than a mere hint of nature in trees and gardens , are necessary .

		People left to themselves huddle together , as witness the many-storied houses of
Rome	LOCATION	, of old
Paris	LOCATION	, of Edin - burgh , and the narrow streets and courts of scores of other cities .

		There is undoubtedly a charm and a picturesqueness in the gloom and haphazardness of such constructions .

		The accidental is often happier than the designed .


Baron Haussmann	PERSON	swept away a good part of the romance of
Paris	LOCATION	when he remod - elled that city .

		But democracy demands the best ; it demands the healthfulness , the comfort , the room and privacy , which formerly the nobles only could obtain .

		It demands these things , but it does not get them .

		It is doubtful whether the multitudinous rows of tiny houses , as much alike as pins in a paper , or the gloomy blocks of apartment buildings whose funereal appearance suggests that they are prepared for the urns of the departed , are much better than the 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, happy-go-lucky living-places of the past Better arrangements for health , they may have ; but their dreary monotony strikes terror into the beholder , and must reduce the vitality of those who live in them to the lowest ebb .

		One could only retain one 's senses in them by being continually intoxicated .

		Worse , perhaps , than our domestic architecture in
America	LOCATION	are our business avenues , with their medley of all styles sham Greek , sham Gothic , sham Arabic , and the native dry-goods box set upon end and punched with holes .

		Our great public buildings have largely been kept respectable by being imitations , copies of similar structures abroad .

		At one time in our career we did build with charm and a certain originality .

		The old colonial erec - tions , with their simple lines and hand-wrought de - tails , stand out wherever they are found , in pleasing contrast with the furious and eccentric things around them .

		That
America	LOCATION	can ever produce an entirely new style in architecture , seems improbable ; but some of our greatest buildings have an American note in them which differentiates them from any - thing done before .

		For instance , there is something in the great flights of steps to the Capitol at Wash - ington which recalls that oldest architecture of
America	LOCATION	, the pyramidal buildings of Yucatan and
Central America	LOCATION	.

		And the great feature of the Capitol at
Albany	LOCATION	, the transverse stairways of the facade , is simply a transmogrification and glorifica - tion of the old Dutch stoop , the dominant thing in colonial architecture both in
Albany	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	.

		We have undoubtedly developed a new architec - tural note in the Babel-like towers of our great cities .

		Size is an element of power , and vertical height is the most impressive kind of size .

		These buildings are really impressive ; under certain con - ditions of lighting or of weather , they are remark , - ably picturesque .

		But their details are generally bad , the details of ordinary buildings forced out of all proportion .

		And against them is their unsub - stantiability , apparent or real .

		It is a daring and inartistic thing to build towers and cliffs of cobwebs and lace-work .

		Modern inventions in transportation and com - munication have entirely changed the conditions of the laying out of a great city .

		With the telephone and the automobile , there is no reason why news - papers should not be published in sylvan dells and stock exchanges have their habitat on wooded heights .

		But probably convenience will always dictate that a city should have a central nucleus , a limited area devoted entirely to the business needs of the com - munity .

		But the domestic life of the people can be scattered over many square miles .

		Of all the purposes of public good to which great private wealth can be devoted , there is probably none open to fewer objections than building .

		A man who puts up a fine structure of any kind not only gratifies himself , but improves his neighbor 's property and gives pleasure to multitudes who may live or come in view of it It seems a little remark - able , therefore , that among the possessors of vast fortunes in
America	LOCATION	no one has come forward to build a city of his own , from the egg u p .

		One of them might do what the great conquerors of the past did , or Constantine , or
Peter	PERSON	the Great .

		Imagine a modern City-Builder acquiring , in a favorable and dominating position in this country , a tract of land a hundred miles square .

		It might stretch from the mountains to the sea , and have every variety and diversification of surface val - leys , forests , lakes .

		What a pleasure it would be to assemble together the directing minds of such an enterprise engineers , architects , landscape garden - ers , masters of sociological and sanitary science and with them plan the great design .

		Ordinary mortals haunt the cities of the past to draw from their memories sustenance for the heart and mind .

		In such a palace , we say , occurred this event of his - toric splendor and importance .

		From such a house went forth a romance which has warmed the world .

		At this tavern gathered together the wits and men of fame whose words are on our lips .

		But such a
City	LOCATION	- Builder as we imagine could almost dictate the course of events , could develop glorious and beau - tiful happenings , as we do novel or perfect plants .

		In the beginning it would be necessary to pro- vide means of transportation and communication ; to lay out roads and sewers and subways .

		The Road alone has hardly begun to be treated with de - cent attention by man .

		What possibilities of joy are in it not merely in the roadbed itself , which may be supposed perfect in our dream city , but in its directions , its prospects , its enclosing trees and hedges and walls .

		Fruit-trees and flowers could be planted along it , free to all travellers .

		Bowers and seats and pavilions should be erected at points of best prospect or in places of secluded charm .

		For our dream city should be a woodland city , a park city .

		There should be a great many more trees and flower-beds than human beings .

		Means of transportation the most direct and most unob - trusive should radiate from the more solidly-built central mart to every part of the domain .

		But the people should mainly live in delightful villages , on mountain-side or in valley , by lake or sea .

		And though the architecture of the buildings and houses should not be restricted to one style or mould , there should be a harmony of conception , a toning together of effects , which practically do not exist anywhere to-day in the modern world .

		Such an ideal scheme might easily be realized by great wealth in the hands of a man of bold thought and unselfish devotion .

		But even if it is too vast to be practical , there is enough for such a man or men to do in transforming our present cities into really decent and delightful places of abode .

		Two-third > .

		perhaps , of the architecture of our towns needs to be swept away , for simplicity and beauty to take its place .

		Streets should be more beautifully aligned , and the woods and grass made to march over many squalid areas .

		THE DIAL 155 CASUAL COMMENT .

		BEWARE OF THE BEGUILING BOOK-AGENT , is the burden of a song that can not be too often chanted in the ears of both private buyers of books and library officials .

		The
February	DATE	number of `` Public Libra - ries '' does well to print Miss
Ange V. Wilner	PERSON	's cau - tions on the subject , as contained in a paper recently read before the
Illinois Library Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sub - scription books , as has been repeatedly pointed out , should as a class be viewed with suspicion ; and when the subscription book is offered by an agent the wise person becomes doubly suspicious .

		`` It is a fact , '' says
Miss Wilner	PERSON	, '' that the most expensive way of buying subscription books is to buy of the book agent .

		We all know how the bargain catalogues tell us of subscription sets , ' publishers ' price
$ 150	MONEY	, our price
$ 80	MONEY	, ' etc. , etc. .

		You may remember that in
1910	DATE	the
Appleton Co.	ORGANIZATION	offered their New Practical Cyclopedia at
$ 18	MONEY	for the six volumes , selling only through book agents , but now they are selling the same work in the open market at
$ 9.75	MONEY	. ''

		The cajoleries of the modern salesman , trained in accordance with the latest psychological principles as set forth by Profes - sor
Scott	PERSON	and others , are indeed hard to withstand ; but , as
Miss Wilner	PERSON	further remarks , a later opportu - nity to buy at a reduced price the temptingly offered subscription book of real worth , will in most cases not be very long in presenting itself .

		Let us , then , harden ourselves to the blandishments of the sleek and plausible travelling salesman and patronize as a rule only our tried and trusty book dealer .

		THE AIRY HEIGHTS OF AUTHORSHIP , of exception - ally gifted authorship , where the proverbial `` plenty of room at the top '' is forever destined to remain but scantily occupied , must offer to the few and fit such thrilling mountaineering as no alpine climber has ever experienced .

		A significant illustration of the ease with which these heights are scaled by the properly equipped , while the less sturdy and agile are left hopelessly in the rear , is offered by a curious experience of Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's that has recently found its way into print . ''


Hugh Wynne	PERSON	'' was in process of revision , and the author , not yet willing to part with the manuscript , sent to Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	an elaborate synopsis of the story , offering the serial rights to `` The Century '' on certain terms .

		Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	re - plied that acceptance was simply impossible since the magazine was made up for eighteen months ahead and a novel by another author was about to run in serial form .

		Two other prominent magazines were then approached , with like results .

		Then the Cen - tury Company was offered the book for immediate publication , and it was accepted unread .

		Five thou - sand copies were printed and a few sample copies had been sent out , when some members of the staff , after reading the romance , appealed to Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	-LRB- who had meantime been to
Europe	LOCATION	and returned -RRB- to find out why the story had not first been turned to account as a serial in the magazine .

		The same reply was made as to the author himself ; but the editor took a copy of the book and read it .

		Sequel : Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	received a telegram announcing the ac - ceptance of his terms , and serial publication began .

		What became of the other author and his crowded - out novel ?

		Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	says he does not know .

		NOTABLE LIBRARY CONFERENCES OF THE COMING SUMMER call for some skilful manipulation of the library worker 's engagement schedule , and , in most instances , some close economy of time and money in order not to miss the good things that are going .

		Foremost in importance to American librarians is , of course , the annual
A. L. A.	PERSON	conference , to be held this year at
Ottawa	LOCATION	, the second Canadian city having the honor to entertain the American Library Asso - ciation ,
Montreal	LOCATION	-LRB- in
1900	DATE	-RRB- being the first .

		Then there are the various conventions of the
State	ORGANIZATION	library associations , that in
California	LOCATION	at
Lake Tahoe	LOCATION	,
June 1722	DATE	, in conjunction with the county librarians ' conference , being among the most important .

		Fur - thermore , the yearly meeting of the Library Asso - ciation of the
United Kingdom	ORGANIZATION	at
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	in
September	DATE	will tempt our eastern librarians espe - cially to indulge in an ocean voyage .

		Indeed , the honorary secretary , Mr.
L. Stanley Jast	PERSON	, has already issued a general invitation to all and sundry American library workers to lend their aid , and their presence , in making the coming gathering an Anglo-American one .

		Toobtainfullparticularsconcerningprogramme and local arrangements the expecting attendant should address both Mr.
Jast	PERSON	, at 24
Bloomsbury Square	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
W. C.	PERSON	, and Mr.
G. T. Shaw	PERSON	, the honorary local secretary , at the
Liverpool Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		But how , one seems to hear asked , with a pitiful two or three weeks ' vacation , and on an exigu - ous salary , is all this to be managed ?

		Well , it is difficult , that 's a fact .

		ELIMINATION OF WASTE IN EDUCATIONAL EF - FORT is of course desirable in every community .

		About a year ago the
Council for Library	ORGANIZATION	and Mu - seum Extension in
Chicago	LOCATION	issued an instructive booklet on the '' Educational Opportunities of Chi - cago , '' with a view to the better coordination of the work of the many institutions engaged in promoting the city 's intellectual life .

		Two years earlier there had appeared in
Buffalo	LOCATION	a pamphlet entitled '' Means of Education and Culture Offered to Day Workers by the City of
Buffalo	LOCATION	. ''

		And now Mr.
Walter L. Brown	PERSON	, librarian of the
Buffalo Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, con - tributes a further utterance on the same general theme . ''

		Educational Unity '' is the title of a paper reprinted from the
January	DATE	'' Bulletin of the
Ameri	PERSON	- can
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	'' after having been origi - nally presented at a meeting of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	of that association .

		The quintessence of the whole ques - tion is found in the following passage : '' It is diffi - cult to bring about a closer cooperation with the present lack of any central authority to exercise con - trol .

		We believe the time has come to ask at least if some means to this end can not be found , so far as it concerns the various institutions which receive 156 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, support from the municipalities .

		It might , perhaps , he brought ahout through the forming of an educa - tional commission , which should at least advise the scope and direction of the efforts of such institutions .

		Such a commission might be made up of representa - tives from the governing boards of the different institutions , or the executive officers , or both , and in addition to formulating the lines of work , it might be a clearing house of suggestions for cooperation and extension . ''

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's paper gives instance * of wasteful duplication of activity in his own city , and a thoughtful reading of it can hardly fail to carry conviction .

		... TUB
CALIFORNIA	LOCATION	COUNTY LIBRARY SYSTEM * which has aroused such interest in the library world - resembles many of nature 's most valuable products in being a plant of slow growth .

		From the latest issue of '' News Notes of
California	LOCATION	Libraries '' it appears that as yet only fourteen of the fifty-seven counties in the
State	ORGANIZATION	have adopted the system , and that the current annual appropriations for its support range from
fifteen thousand dollars	MONEY	in
Alameda County	LOCATION	to one hundred and twenty in
Modoc	LOCATION	.

		The number of branches maintained varies from twenty - six in
Sacramento County	LOCATION	to an inappreciable num - ber indicated by a blank in four of the other counties .

		It is not surprising to find the northern and central counties more active in this movement than are the southern .

		An examination of applicants for county librarianships has recently been held at the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	and at the
Los Angeles Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and in this connection the following official announce - ment is of interest : `` Experience has shown that only persons who have lived in the
State	ORGANIZATION	and have done library work in a way to gain a personal knowl - edge of
California	LOCATION	conditions really understand the county library plan for
California	LOCATION	.

		The aim of the examination is to see how thorough is the applicant 's knowledge of the conditions under which the county library work must be carried on , and of the problems to be met in the work as it is actually being done in this State ... And those who do understand what we are doing and what we hope to do , will not find the examination difficult '' That personality and appearance count for something in the examination appears from the examining board 's insistence upon a personal interview with the candidate an u oral examination '' they call it AX INSTANCE OF LITERARY PIRACY perhaps already familiar to some of our readers is the cheap , paper-covered , wretchedly-printed '' Love Adven - tures of a Milkmaid , '' with no indication of author - ship , appealing by the crude illustration on its cover to the class of readers with whom questions of author - ship are quite irrelevant The book proves to be a transmogrification of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's story of nearly thirty years ago , '' The Romantic Adven - tures of a Milkmaid , '' the typographical errors in the anonymous reprint being such as would probably make the author shudder if he were to encounter a copy which he probably never will .

		Nevertheless , though it may not be as gieat an honor to be pirated in
America	LOCATION	as to be lawfully reprinted by Tauchnitz in
Germany	LOCATION	, yet it ought not to be altogether dis - pleasing to find one 's literary wares so valuable as to be worth stealing .

		Would not the elder
Dumas	PERSON	, if he were alive now , enjoy the spectacle of his mul - titudinous cheap reprints , and even the sight of those sufficiently numerous novels , like '' The Coun - tess of Monte Cristo , '' which enterprising publishers have fathered upon him just because his name is one to conjure with ?

		THE SEABOARD AIR LINK KRKE TKA VKI.I.I N. LIBRARY SYSTEM carries in its very name a pleasing suggestion of largeness and beneficence and of expe - ditious , businesslike methods , so that one conceives an immediate desire to be a resident on this same
Seaboard Air Line	ORGANIZATION	of freely-circulating literature .

		The system was organized by the late Mr.
St. John	PERSON	, vice-president and general manager of the
Seaboard Air Line Railway	ORGANIZATION	, which binds together with ribbons of steel six of our Southern states where the scarcity of library facilities , and indeed of any sort of read - ing matter , is extreme .

		This first of free travelling library systems in the South , financially aided by Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	and enjoying the able superintendence of Mrs.
Eugene B. Heard	PERSON	of
Middleton	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, has acted as a potent factor in bringing about library legislation in the six commonwealths concerned , and hundreds of small towns and of public schools have been moved to establish permanent libraries of their own .

		And so it appears that the big railroad sys - tem is not always and in all respects an all-devouring octopus of conscienceless greed .

		For further interest - ing details of the growth of library extension in the
United States	LOCATION	the reader should consult the late public document on that subject prepared by Mr.
John D. Wolcott	PERSON	, acting librarian of the national
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, and now separately reprinted from the current Report of the Commissioner of Education ... IN HER SECOND CENTURY OF LITEKARV ACTIVITY , Miss
Caroline A. White	PERSON	, one hundred and one years young , puts to shame those of us who pusillaniniously entertain even the bare thought of beginning to take in sail at the half-century line , or at the sixtieth or even the seventieth milestone .

		Inthequietand refine - ment of her home at
Upper Norwood	LOCATION	,
Miss White	LOCATION	is reported to be still busy with her pen when the impulse to write visits her .

		A voluminous magazine contributor , she has put forth but one book , Sweet
Hampstead	LOCATION	, '' dealing with the historic , literary , and artistic associations of
London	LOCATION	's northern suburb , and enjoying sufficient vogue in its day to get into a second edition .

		Befriended and encouraged by
Thomas Hood	PERSON	,
Miss White	LOCATION	sent her first literary ven - ture to
Douglas Jerrold	PERSON	's `` Shilling Magazine , '' \ v hirh accepted it ; and she recalls with satisfaction that she never had a manuscript returned either from that periodical or from ''
Ainsworth	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		In the middle of
last century	DATE	she assumed the editorship of

		Naturally she has many interesting recollections of Hood and other writers of his time .

		... NOTEWORTHY NEGRO SCHOLARSHIP that might well puzzle and confound the experts in heredity and eugenics was that of the late
Edward Wilmot Blyden	PERSON	,
A.M.	LOCATION	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, LL.D. , a native West Indian of purest Ethiopic strain , a rejected applicant for admission into some of our colleges about
1850	DATE	, and soon afterward heard of from
Liberia	LOCATION	, as having gained an education there and risen to the presidency of
Liberia College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The secretaryships of state and of the interior in the Liberian government were at different times held by him , also the commissionership to this country from
Liberia	LOCATION	; and after resignation of his college presidency in
1884	DATE	he took up inde - pendent work among the
Mohammedans of Sierra Leone	ORGANIZATION	.

		Proficiency in eight languages , including Hebrew , Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, and Arabic , was acquired by him , his specialty being Arabic .

		Author of several scholarly works and many lesser productions , he enjoyed the acquaintance of scholars of distinction and other noted men .

		What pre-natal or post-natal influence was it that so compellingly turned to lit - erature and learning this descendant of countless generations of African savages ?

		JANE
AUSTEN	PERSON	ON THE AMATEUR STAGE , as pre ~ sented recently by the
Mount Holyoke College	ORGANIZATION	girls in Mrs.
Steele Mackaye	PERSON	's dramatization of '' Pride and Prejudice , '' is reported a more pronounced suc - cess than might have been expected , and indeed than was actually expected , in the case of a play so little dramatic in its action , so dependent upon portrayal of character of a not very demonstrative sort .

		Un - doubtedly the sympathy and the culture of the audi - ence contributed almost as much as the clever acting of the college seniors to the hearty enjoyment of the evening .

		The departure from the usual custom of presenting an original play lent additional interest to the occasion .

		The simple scenery required was designed and painted by members of the class , the chief outside help apparently being in the matter of costumes of the eighteenth century .

		Altogether , the preparation of the piece must have been to the stu - dents participating quite as valuable , in the way of education , as a formal course in eighteenth century English literature .

		A HISTORY OF THE
BOSTON	LOCATION	PUBLIC LIBRARY has been prepared by the librarian ,
Horace G. Wadlin	PERSON	, Litt.D. , and published in a handsome octavo volume by the trustees .

		Beginning with the first agita - tation started for a free library by the mercurial
Alexandre Vattemare	PERSON	, the philanthropic Frenchman who visited
Boston	LOCATION	in
1841	DATE	and conveyed to the city a gift of books from
Paris	LOCATION	, the history traces the increasingly rapid growth of the library idea and of the library itself down to the present time , with appreciative sketches of its deceased benefactors and officials of distinction .

		From the first librarian 's first report it appears that , so far as was known , not '' in any instance a wilful , and in only one instance an ac - cidental , injury was done to a book , and in the latter case the damage was voluntarily and cheerfully made good , '' and only one book was lost , and that was paid for .

		In the record of city appropriations for the library 's maintenance for the ten years from
1901	DATE	it is pleasing to note two instances in which the amount granted considerably exceeded the amount asked for , while in every other instance the response has been generous , either equalling or fall - ing but little short of the demand .

		The people of
Boston	LOCATION	value their splendid library and give it their loyal support .

		Excellent portraits and views , with a map showing the location of the library and its branches and stations , and a full index , are note - worthy features of this elaborate account of our oldest large public library .

		.

		THE MULTIPLICATION OF ADVANCED STUDIES , which in the last decade surpasses all that was un - dertaken of that sort in the preceding century , still goes forward in a kind of geometrical progression .

		At
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	alone the seeker for special knowledge is lured by such variously attract - ive courses as these lately announced for the second semester of the year : Semitic epigraphy , the his - torical background of the gospels , the appreciation of Latin poetry , the topography of
Rome	LOCATION	, the phil - osophy of art , typical theories of life , contemporary Asiatic politics , European government , industrial evolution , the distribution of wealth , the biology of water supply , practical hygiene and sanitation , indus - trial bacteriology , journalism for technical students , the teaching of English composition , collodial chem - istry , advanced geography , and a graduate course in geology .

		Thus , but in greater wealth of detail than can here be indicated , do star-eyed science , divine philosophy , and the delights of literature combine to promote the intellectual life in this our so-called materialistic age .

		THE INTRICACIES OF COPYRIGHT are enough to bewilder the average person .

		The new British Copy - right Act , as printed for circulation by the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	, fills seventeen large pages of rather fine print , divided into sections , sub-sections , and sub - sub-sections .

		Among the manifold provisions of this praiseworthy act the eye alights on such minutely particular , but probably not too particular , clauses as the following : ' `` Infringing , ' when applied to a copy of a work in which copyright subsists , means any copy , including any colorable imitation , made or imported in contravention of the provisions of this Act . '' ''

		For the purposes of the provisions of this Act as to residence , , an author of a work shall be deemed to be a resident in the parts of
His Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's dominions to which this Act extends if he is domi - ciled within any such part . ''

		And all these clauses , and subsidiary clauses , were needed merely to assert a workman 's right to the product of his toil !

		158 THE DIAL -LSB- Man-h 1 , COMMUNICA TIONS .

		A MODEL JAPANESE POEM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It is , no doubt , well understood , in literary circles in
America	LOCATION	, that a Japanese poem is , like Japanese art , quite unique .

		In fact , versification in
Japan	LOCATION	is con - sidered one of the fine arts .

		And '' versification '' is an appropriate term , for a Japanese poem is generally manu - factured .

		There are certain very rigid forms , and only a few , for verse ; and these forms are well known by all fairly educated Japanese .

		In schools , moreover , the Japanese are carefully taught both the theory and the practice of versification .

		Therefore , it may be said that , in
Japan	LOCATION	, poeta et ncutcitur etjit .

		The most common form of a Japanese poem is that called tanka , or `` tiny ode , '' which consists of only thirty - one syllables , arranged in five verses of respectively five , seven , five , seven and seven syllables .

		Such a brief poem must necessarily be quite concise and suggestive or impressionistic .

		It has been truly said that a
Japan	LOCATION	- ese poem is a picture , or even only the outline of a pic - ture , to be filled in by the imagination .

		And this must be even more positively affirmed of the hokku , which contains only the seventeen syllables of the first three verses of the tanka .

		And yet it is possible to express , or rather to suggest , a very beautiful scene in only seventeen syllables .

		One excellent example of this tini - est form is the following : `` Kare-eda ni U no tomari keri
Aki	PERSON	no kmv . ''

		Which means literally : '' On a withered branch A crow 's perching An autumn evening . ''

		It does not take a very strong imagination to fill out that picture .

		For an example of the longer form , I should like to present one which received high honors at the recent
Imperial Poetry Contest	ORGANIZATION	in the Palace .

		The subject given out by His Imperial Majesty was '' A
Crane	PERSON	on a Pine , '' although , from the indefiniteness of Japanese words , either or both of those nouns might be plural .

		Over 29,000 tnnkn on this subject were sent in to the
Imperial Household Department	ORGANIZATION	; but only fifty-eight were selected as eminently worthy , and only twenty-one enjoyed the rare distinction of being read in the presence of His Majesty .

		Among these was one by an old man , a primary school teacher in the country ; it reads as follows : '' Ash i t at MI mo Moto wo wasurenu Kokoro yori Su-tachishi matsu wa Taezu touramu . ''

		Now , it may be well to proceed with an analysis of this poem word by word , somewhat in the present fash - ion of parsing ad nauseam and dissecting to pieces the real masterpieces of English literature .

		In this case , however , such a course is quite necessary to an appre - ciation of the conciseness and suggestiveiiess of this '' tiny ode . '' ''

		AshitaUu '' is a poetical word for '' crane '' ; '' mo '' is emphatic and means `` also '' or `` even '' ; `` moto '' is `` origin '' or `` birthplace '' ; `` wo '' is the sign of the objective case ; `` wasurenu '' means `` forgetting-not '' ; `` kokoro '' is '' heart '' or `` desire '' ; y. , ri '' is a post - position meaning `` from '' ; '' su-tachishi '' '' means M nest - left '' ; `` matsu '' is `` pirn - '' ; `` wa '' is an t-mpliatir particle , often indicating the subject , or tin - important word , of a sentence ; `` taezu '' means `` continually , '' `` constantly '' ; and `` touramu '' means `` visit . ''

		A literal translation , verse by verse , with the same number of syllables in each line as in the original , reads as follows : '' The old crane alao , Forgetting not his birthplace , Very willingly The pine with the nest he left Continually visits . ''

		Professor
Murata	PERSON	, one of my colleagues in the
First Higher School	ORGANIZATION	, has favored me with a poetical transla - tion , as follows : '' The crone , forgetting not his dear old home .

		Oft comes unto the nest on yonder pine Wherein hia mother taught him tir-t to fly . ''

		ST. ANTHONY 'S SERMON TO THE FISHI-X -LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		In the
Warner Library of American Literature	ORGANIZATION	, Vol .

		X
I.I.	LOCATION	, page 16,700 , appears a poem perhaps doggerel in form entitled `` St.
Anthony	PERSON	's Sermon to Fishes , '' which is marked `` anonymous . ''

		It opens as follows : '' Saint
Anthony	PERSON	, at church , Was left in the lurch ; So he went to the ditches And preached to the fishes , '' etc. .

		Most of the verses end with the refrain : '' No sermon beside `` Had the carps '' -LRB- eels , pikes , etc. -RRB- `` so edified . ''

		Though when the sermon is ended , it come > to this : '' Much delighted were they But preferred the old way . ''

		I once had what was , on the whole , a much worthier ren - dition of this legendary tale just a waif clipped from some paper , which is now hopelessly lost .

		Kithn the same author tried again ; or one writer 's scheme was before the other ; or , as is most probable , both trans - lated quite literally from some foreign source .

		A ^ I remember , that too was anonymous , but it began : '' Saint
Anthony	PERSON	, one day , found the church empty
Sunday	DATE	, So he goes to the river , a discourse to deliver . ''

		Then it details how the fish '' Came swimming and squirming in shoals to the sermon . ''

		In this form , however , the common refrain is '' But all said they never Heard sermon so clever . ''

		Even when the carps '' went back to their carping , '' the eels to good living , '' the pikes to their thieving , '' etc. , Yi-t all said they never Heard sermon so clever . ''

		I should be very glad to know from any of your readers where the latter form of the poem can be found , or to see it reproduced , still more to learn win-nee , if it can be ascertained , the two were derived or translated , as embodying the quaint old legend of the good saint of
Padua	LOCATION	.

		A
HERITAGE OF AMERICAN PERSONALITY	ORGANIZATION	.

		* If in this era , when our minds are bent upon peace , there be anything we can find to admire in war , it is that nobility in human character which the dire stress of conflict sometimes re - veals .

		What chiefly we look for in battle is murderous hatred ; the more , then , can we appre - ciate those spirits which touch its pitch and yet are not denied , which radiate instead an unsus - pected `` sweetness and light . ''

		Our American Civil War is one of the awful tragedies of his - tory ; yet from it rise two personalities that go far to redeem the havoc of the struggle .

		We shall never think back upon that time without a shudder ; yet we shall never forget that it gave us Lincoln and Lee .

		The character of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, though by no means universally understood , has been studied from many angles and appraised at something near its proper value .

		Not so with
Lee	PERSON	.

		The South - ern chieftain has been viewed in the main from but two standpoints , and these have been more or less extreme .

		The average man in the North has had a conception of him hardly flattering ; the average man in the South has had a dif - ferent conception , but one not much closer to the truth .

		Too few have thought of Lee in connection with our national life and traditions .

		Something more than a year ago the present writer expressed the belief that '' if the
Ameri	PERSON	- can people would repair their greatest neglect of the legacy derivable from a single character in their history , they would have to acquaint themselves thoroughly with the real nature of Lee . ''

		At that time there was but one volume on Lee the '' Recollections and Letters '' by his son which offered the means of adequate in - sight ; and this volume afforded the material for judgment rather than the final utterance itself .

		Recently , however , two books have appeared , which , taken together , are well-nigh if not en - tirely definitive .

		They are complementary to each other ; they issued from the press almost simultaneously ; one is the work of a `` F. F. V. '' student of Lee 's , while the other was written by a descendant of a well-known family of
Massa	LOCATION	- chusetts abolitionists .

		ment of his previous work , ''
Robert E. Lee	PERSON	, the Southerner . ''

		It did not stop with that , how - ever ; it '' finally assumed the proportions of a biography '' an unusually full and fascinat - ing one .

		It adds to the treatment of Lee 's per - sonal character , the theme of the earlier book , an elaborate study of his military career and of his relation to the civil power of the Confed - erate Government . ''

		It has , unfortunately , some faults , both ex - ternal and internal .

		The former are due to a slight carelessness in the details of literary com - position .

		They are partly excused by the large - ness of the author 's undertaking ; but surely so good a literary artist as Mr.
Page	PERSON	should not perpetrate a sentence such as '' No more were
Jackson	PERSON	or
Johnston	PERSON	, '' nor should he head a chap - ter '' Lee 's Audacity Antietam and
Chancel	LOCATION	- lorsville , '' when the chapter is devoted in toto to the first-named battle .

		He has , further , a provoking habit largely to be explained by his method of arrangement of discussing a given point on the instalment plan , with long inter - vals of foreign matter between the several instal - ments .

		Readers would be better satisfied if the explanation of such questions as
Hooker	PERSON	's inde - cision at
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	and
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's relations with
Butler	PERSON	were concentrated in single passages instead of being dispersed over much space .

		The internal faults are more serious , because they impair in some measure the high value of the volume .

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	disclaims any purpose of panegyric , and his attitude toward the peo - ple of the North is that which
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	,
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's minister to
Great Britain	LOCATION	, expressed toward Southerners : '' They also are my countrymen . ''

		Yet one can not help feeling that he holds a brief for Lee and for
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		His contention that final success is not the test of military genius is , in the light of his refer - ence to Hannibal and
Napoleon	PERSON	, reasonable enough ; but we may admit
Lee	PERSON	's greatness with - out maintaining that his generalship was flaw - less .

		The study of
Lee	ORGANIZATION	's character shows the same tendency to exaggerate : Lee comes about as near the ideal as anyone could wish , but he was a real human being after all .

		And why so many commendations of
Virginia	LOCATION	, when the ob - ject of our scrutiny is the individual hero ?

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	halts between two opinions : he wishes to show us the great superiority of the man , and at the same time he is anxious to bring up the
State	ORGANIZATION	to the same exalted height .

		Our sus - picions are aroused when we read , '' Lee 's char - acter I deem absolutely the fruit of the Vir - ginian civilization which existed in times past . ''

		160 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, Then follow statements that we can not recon - cile .

		He calls Lee '' The noblest gentleman of our time '' ; yet elsewhere he asserts that '' noble as he was , ten thousand gentlemen marched be - hind him who , in all the elements of private character , were his peers . ''

		It is a pity that fervor and a divided purpose mar in some de - gree the fine disinterestedness and symmetry of the work .

		But when these reservations have been made , there is still a vast deal in the volume which is altogether praiseworthy .

		The accounts of Lee 's various campaigns are full and interesting .

		By a happy device , the author sketches the main outlines of each , then tells of it again at much greater length , in painstaking detail , and with constant attention to the exact movements of each corps and division .

		In this way general information is followed by that which is minute , and the reader need not stop for the latter un - less he chooses .

		Along with the operations in the field is unfolded a knowledge of the extra - ordinary difficulties under which Lee labored .

		It is something of a revelation to learn how great an advantage the
Union	ORGANIZATION	forces possessed in having a navy constantly at their disposal .

		It is equally surprising to know how important it was to the Confederacy to protect the
Trede	PERSON	- gar Iron Works at
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		More astonish - ing still is the information we obtain of how Lee was hampered by the inefficiency of the Con - federate government .

		The government had theories about making the war one of pure de - fense ; it hoped that by refusing to ship cotton to
Europe	LOCATION	it could force recognition ; it tried to hold the entire country , instead of concentrat - ing its armies ; it insisted that the army elect its officers ; it failed to punish desertion ; it for - bade Lee to pick bis own chief of staff ; it cramped his strategy by forcing him to submit his plans for approval ; and it managed miser - ably the forwarding of supplies .

		Mr.
Page	PERSON	maintains that Lee would certainly have made a third invasion of the North had his troops had proper shoes and clothing , and that he would have struck Grant a fatal blow in the
Wilder	PERSON	- ness had not his men been so widely dispersed for subsistence .

		In the face of such obstacles , and of well-equipped armies numerically stronger than his own ,
Lee	PERSON	's struggle was truly heroic and pathetic .

		The key to
Lee	ORGANIZATION	's character Mr. Page finds in its likeness to that of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Lee	PERSON	's model .

		He was a humane , self-sacrificing , pious man if possible , more pious even than
Jackson	PERSON	.

		The secret of his life lay in his re - liance on God and in the precepts he conveyed to his son : `` To be obedient to all authority , and to do his duty in everything , great or small . ''

		His serene dignity and purpose to serve shone forth resplendent in defeat . ''

		He was indicted for treason by a grand jury composed partly of negroes '' ; u to his death he remain .

		< !

		* a prisoner on parole . ' ''

		Yet he set calmly about his task of healing discord and building up the devastated South .

		High positions and large salaries were offered him '' everything , '' said his daughter , '' but the only thing he will ac - cept : a place to earn honest bread while en - gaged in some useful work . ''

		Finally he l > ecame president of a struggling denominational college , and gave the rest of his life to its betterment and that of its students .

		His salary was only
$ 1,500	MONEY	a year ; but he rejected another offer of lucra - tive employment with these words : '' I have led the young men of the South in battle ; I have seen many of them die on the field ; I shall de - vote my remaining energies to training young men to do their duty in life . ''

		Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	, far more than Mr.
Page	PERSON	, has the sense of
Lee	ORGANIZATION	's character as a part of our national inheritance .

		He regards it not as a sectional but as our common possession .

		His dedication reads : ' To the young men both of the North and of the South who can make or unmake the future of the
America	LOCATION	of
Washington	LOCATION	, of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, and of Lee . ''

		Three other passages that I can not forbear quot - ing at length show the depth of his insight and the rightness of his attitude : `` Abandon all these local animosities , and make your sons Americans .

		What finer sentence could be inscribed on the pedestal of Lee 's statue than that ?

		Americans !

		All the local animosities forgiven and forgotten , can we not say that he too , though dying only five years after the terrible struggle , died a loyal , a confident , a hope - ful American , and one of the very greatest ? ''

		One was a man of the eighteenth century , the other of the nineteenth ; one of the old
America	LOCATION	, the other of the new .

		Grant stands for our modern world , with its rough business habits , its practical energy , its desire to do things no matter how , its indifference to the sweet grace of ceremony and dignity and courtesy .

		Lee had the traditions of an older day , not only its high beliefs , but its grave stateliness , its feeling that the way of doing things was almost as much as the thing done .

		In short ,
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's
America	LOCATION	was the
America	LOCATION	of
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Lee	PERSON	's the
America	LOCATION	of

		It is in part because of thU difference , and because I would fain believe that with - out loss of the one we may some day regain something of the other , that I have given so much thought to the portrayal of

		America in the twentieth century worships success , is too ready to test character by it , to be blind to those faults success hides , to those qualities that can do with -

		THE DIAL 161 out it .

		Here was a man who failed grandly , a man who said that ' human virtue should be equal to human calamity , ' and showed that it could be equal to it , and so , without pretense , without display , without self - consciousness , left an example that future Americans may study with profit as long as there is an

		A young sophomore was once summoned and gently admonished that only patience and industry would prevent the failure that would inevitably come to him through college and through life . ''

		` But ,
General	ORGANIZATION	, you failed , ' remarked the sophomore , with the inconceivable ineptitude of sophomores . '' '

		I hope that you may be more fortunate than I , ' was the tranquil answer . ''

		Literature can add nothing to that . ''

		In reaching an understanding of Lee 's char - acter , Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	has discarded legend and engaged in exhaustive research . ''

		A complete bibliography of sources , '' he declares , '' would be practically a bibliography of the war litera - ture both
Northern and Southern	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Yet he does not present , as does Mr.
Page	PERSON	, in epic narrative a multitude of facts about Lee 's career .

		Nor does his familiarity with the background of gen - eral conditions upon which Lee 's actions were projected his knowledge of the social and moral issues , and of the larger phases of the technical and administrative problems lure him from his peculiar theme .

		Happily , we are promised the fruitage of these by-studies in a subsequent volume , '' Portraits of the Confed - eracy . ''

		Wise readers will not expect the forth - coming studies to reveal any such ideal as Lee .

		The other leaders had merits and weaknesses : we may be sure Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	will be blind to neither .

		He will show the men as they were , and that is all we can ask .

		Here , as I have suggested , Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	has made it his purpose to portray Lee 's soul .

		He has shown this in the various relations suggested by the titles of all the chapters save one : '' The Great Decision , '' `` Lee and
Davis	PERSON	, '' `` Lee and the Confederate Government , '' ''
Lee	PERSON	and his
Army	ORGANIZATION	, ' ; `` Lee and
Jackson	PERSON	, '' `` Lee in Battle , '' `` Lee as a General , '' `` Lee 's Social and Domes - tic Life , '' '' Lee 's Spiritual Life , '' and '' Lee after the War . ''

		It will be seen that Mr.
Brad	PERSON	- ford falls in with the new school of writers who in their treatment of historical figures lay stress upon character rather than upon deeds .

		So vital and so valuable is this aim , and so suc - cessful is Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	in carrying it out , that readers will be especially interested in his own comments on his method of approach .

		These comprise an attractive and illuminating ap - pendix , '' Lee and Psychography . ''

		He says : '' What I have aimed at in this book is the portrayal of a soul .

		We live in an age of names , and a new name has recently been invented psychography .

		This means , I suppose , an art which is not psychology , because it deals with individuals , not general principles , and is not biography , because it swings clear of the formal sequence of chronological detail , and uses only those deeds and words and happenings that are spiritually significant . ''

		After explaining the dangers , both subjective and objective , that threaten the psychographer 's poise , he maintains that the chief advantage in studying great men is in finding their resem - blance to ordinary mortals .

		He parts company with the believers in
Lee	ORGANIZATION	's absolute perfection when he shows us that
Lee	PERSON	was the barest trifle aloof , and that the invasion proclamations were prompted by sound common-sense as well as by lofty principles .

		But the purpose is not to be - little his subject .

		It is rather to inspire us .

		The process need not be , as might seem , disillu - sioning .

		Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	's method is that of thor - ough sanity ; yet he finds
Lee	PERSON	`` a human being as lovable as any that ever lived . '' ''

		I have loved him , '' he declares , '' and I may say that his influence upon my own life , though I came to him late , has been as deep and as inspiring as any I have ever known . ''

		Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	's chapter on '' The Great De - cision '' shows us that
Lee	PERSON	's actions were guided '' strictly and loftily by conscience . ''

		The se - verest test came at the outbreak of hostilities .

		Then , as always , Lee excluded personal con - siderations ; but he was not satisfied with either party . ''

		While I wish to do what is right , '' he wrote , '' I am unwilling to do what is wrong at the bidding of the South or of the North . ''

		He felt that the destruction of the old balance between local and central authority would '' be an end to Republican government in this coun - try '' ; on the other hand , he considered slavery '' a moral and political evil '' an evil which a decision for the South would force him to up - hold .

		`` It is precisely this network of moral conditions , '' affirms Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	, `` that makes his heroic struggle so pathetic , so appealing , so irresistibly human ... Lee is one of the most striking , one of the noblest tragic figures the world ever produced . ''

		The most perfect com - ment on his life is his own statement that to do our duty is '' all the pleasure , all the comfort , all the glory we can enjoy in this world . ''

		The chapters on Lee 's relations with
Davis	PERSON	, with the Confederate government , with his army , and with
Jackson	PERSON	, are absorbing .

		Of these , the first two show his fine modesty and courtesy ; they also show his patience under trying diffi - culties that lead Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	to write , '' He was never free . ''

		The third explains his extra - ordinary hold upon his men through the confi - dence he inspired , his personal magnetism , his 162 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	.

		own love for his soldiers , and his recognition of the fact that he was leading an army of Ameri - can freemen .

		The fourth shows his wisdom in dealing with the most inflexible personalities .

		Nothing is more characteristic of him than the suggestion through which he reconciled differ - ences between
Jackson	PERSON	and
A. P. Hill	PERSON	: `` He who has been the most aggrieved can be the most magnanimous and make the first overture of peace . ''

		The chapter on '' Lee in Battle '' reveals to us again that nice balance of
Lee	ORGANIZATION	's gifts which accounts for Alexander 's dictum '' Probably no man ever commanded an army and at the same time so entirely commanded himself . ''

		The treatment of '' Lee as a General '' shows the enormous difficulties with which he had to con - tend , and finds four outstanding military quali - ties : organizing power , boldness , rapidity and perhaps energy of action , and a knowledge of human nature .

		The last quality enabled him to deal effectively with subordinate and foeman .

		Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	thinks it the chief of his military merits , and hence believes Colonel
Henderson	PERSON	's words are the most satisfying eulogy : '' He was the clearest-sighted soldier in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		In '' Lee 's Social and Domestic Life '' we see his dignity , not stiff and pompous , but natural , and softened by the inborn deference of the true democrat .

		He had charm and thoroughgoing kindliness ; his inherent moderation bordered a little on reserve .

		In '' Lee 's Spiritual Life '' we learn that the bent of his character was '' abso - lutely moral and practical . ''

		He had passions and sensibilities , but he kept them under con - trol .

		Perhaps he was a little too precise , a little too scrupulous ; yet we like to think of him as worrying a little after
Gettysburg	LOCATION	because he could not lay his hands upon officials to whom he might pay his taxes .

		He had no desire for rank or honors , no jealousy , no impatience un - der criticism , no wish to justify himself at the expense of others even when those others were at fault .

		His religion was `` a pure and vivify - ing light '' ; it was compact of love .

		God was the cardinal fact of his life . ''

		Lee before the War '' is the only chapter which is largely narrative .

		It further traces early influences and the growth of high motives which were to govern him so thoroughly when his role became conspicuous . ''

		Lee after the War '' presents a period as instructive and in - spiring as any in his life .

		Whatever he did was sure , as
Grant	ORGANIZATION	asserted , to have tremendous influence in the South .

		What , then , shall we say of his restraint , of his hopefulness , of the fact that , `` so far as his limited opportunities will allow us to judge , he was a thinker in edu - cation as he was a thinker in war '' ' . '

		1 1 is pro- gramme was one of constructive labor : `` Tell them they must all set to work , and if they can - not do what they prefer , do what they can . ''

		A summary so meagre as has here been given is likely to mislead .

		It is earnestly recommended that every good citizen , every student of worthy personality , read for himself Captain Lee 's '' Recollections and Letters '' of his father , Mr.
Page	PERSON	's absorbing biography , and Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	's study of
Lee	ORGANIZATION	's inmost character .

		The last must be considered an altogether indispensable book .

		Its discriminating analysis is supported by a wealth of humanized evidence and vital illustra - tion , and it gives a superb and convincing por - trayal of the actual soul of Lee .

		One wonders as he reads it whether the resurrection of human character is not almost the equal of great crea - tive writing especially when the character resurrected is one so noble as is here portrayed .

		beginning with the '' Library Edition '' of 1867-9 , and ending with the '' Biographical Edition '' of 1898-9 two editions for each decade from
1869	DATE	to
1899	DATE	, with innumerable cheaper reprints of either the whole or a part of the great novelist 's writings .

		To these numer - ous editions is now added another , the '' Cen - tenary Edition de Luxe , '' enriched with notes of both biographical and bibliographical inter - est from the competent pen of Mr.
Lewis Mel	PERSON	- ville , and not only reproducing the original
Thackeray	PERSON	illustrations and some others by artists of his time , but also presenting a new series of drawings , some five hundred in num - ber , by Mr.
Harry Furniss	PERSON	.

		The volumes are substantial octavos , attractively bound in blue and gilt , and sufficiently capacious to contain even the longest of the novels within the covers of a single book each .

		The `` Vanity Fair , '' for example , runs to seven hundred and forty-six pages , with
Thackeray	PERSON	's drawings in the text and Mr.

		THE DIAL 163 '' Artist 's Preface '' with which each volume is provided , and wherein the latest illustrator of
Thackeray	PERSON	takes the reader into his confi - dence and points out some of the peculiar diffi - culties confronting the pictorial interpreter of the novelist 's works .

		In preparing illustra - tions for '' Vanity Fair , '' for instance , shall the modern artist bring his designs into some har - mony with
Thackeray	PERSON	's own and clothe his characters in early Victorian costume , or shall he risk the discord of letting his historically correct drawings clash with the accompanying Victorian conceptions ?

		Strange enough to us now is
Thackeray	PERSON	's explicit reason for prefer - ring contemporary costume to that of a genera - tion earlier , the actual period of the story . ''

		When I remember the appearance of people in those days , '' he says in a footnote at the end of his sixth chapter , '' and that an officer and lady were actually habited like -LSB- illustration inserted -RSB- , I have not the heart to disfigure my heroes and heroines by costumes so hideous , and have , on the contrary , engaged a model of rank dressed according to the present fashion . ''

		As Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	takes occasion to observe , we of the present day look back upon the early Victorian monstrosities of crinoline and other peculiarities of dress as exceedingly unbecoming , whereas the costume of the
Waterloo	LOCATION	period strikes the eye as unusually pleasing , and has , moreover , in ladies ' dress at least , a certain sim - ilarity to fashions not unknown to the twentieth century .

		Consequently the costumes he has drawn are not so strange and repellent to the modern reader as are those of
1845	DATE	, drawn by the author himself .

		That
Thackeray	PERSON	was by no means the ideal illustrator of his own more serious works , no one will deny ; and this is attributed by Mr.
Fur	PERSON	- niss to '' the fact that he thoroughly enjoyed throwing off unconsidered trifles , slight carica - tures and fanciful suggestions for initial letters and tail-pieces , but that illustrating novels wor - ried him .

		He was never satisfied with his own or other artists ' rendering of his heroines , and I doubt if I would have dared to illustrate him had I lived in his day . ''

		But that it was not merely his heroines who gave trouble to
Thack	PERSON	- eray the draughtsman , is of course apparent even to a casual observer .

		In his very first illustration to '' Vanity Fair , '' the vignette accompanying the ornamental initial at the be - ginning of the first chapter , he depicts an equi - page absurdly out of harmony with his written description of it in the opening paragraph .

		The '' two fat horses '' are the smallest of ponies ; and the '' fat coachman , '' a small , boyish figure , is on the wrong side of the box .

		These and other inconsistencies touched lightly upon by Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	are matters of curious interest to us now , rather than ground for complaint ; but they probably add somewhat to the perplexities of the modern artist who wishes to make his own illustrations to
Thackeray	PERSON	not too incon - sistent with one another and with the familiar designs of the novelist himself .

		As a test , and a severe one , of the artist 's sympathetic imagination and technical skill , Beatrix offers difficulties enough , and the reader will examine with interest the depiction of her in her varying moods by the illustrator 's pencil .

		Rightly enough Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	holds that `` the interest of the story to artists , and I venture to think to the reader as well , centres in
Beatrix	LOCATION	and her mother , with
Esmond	PERSON	between the two , like
Garrick	PERSON	between comedy and tragedy .

		Esmond is , after all , but the walking gentleman perhaps we ought to say the fighting gentleman in this play bearing his name .

		He is artistically the foil to the mother and daughter in whom the interest lies , the mother for her part the foil to Beatrix : so it comes to this , Beatrix dominates all , and one would have thought , at least I have , but hardly dare to suggest , that the title of the book should have been ' Beatrix . ' ''

		A captivat - ing creature Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	makes of her , but frankly despairs of doing justice to the author 's conception , and goes so far as to maintain that no brush or pencil can produce a satisfactory likeness , although , strangely enough , the sculp - tor might succeed in the undertaking .

		As illustrating Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	's careful atten - tion to minute details in his difficult task , let us quote what he says in connection with
Thack	PERSON	- eray 's frequent raptures over the dainty feet of his heroines .

		`` It is very seldom indeed . ''

		he affirms , `` a pretty or a handsome woman has small feet , or even good proportions .

		All artists know that models with good figures have gen - erally plain frequently coarse faces ... Every haberdasher in selling hosiery demon - strates that the hand is the index to the foot , but it may not be generally known that the hand is a complete reflex of the whole figure ... This fact is , as I say , little known , otherwise I am sure
Thackeray	PERSON	and other writers , dwelling upon the charms of their heroines , would have referred more to their perfectly shaped hands than to their pretty and impossible feet . ''

		But this is carrying us pretty far into the domain of realism and away from romance , which neither
Thackeray	PERSON	nor his illustrator seriously intends .

		164 I M : irch 1 , In comparing Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	's drawings with those of such famous earlier
Thackeray	PERSON	illustra - tors as
Doyle	PERSON	and
Walker	PERSON	, hardly any modern reader can fail to find something in the later artist 's conceptions that grips him with a stronger sense of reality than do the perhaps equally excellent drawings of
Thackeray	PERSON	's own contem - poraries .

		Every illustrator of course breathes more or less of the spirit of his age ; and so , whether it be in the costume or attitude or bear - ing of the characters he draws , or in something far more intangible and indefinable '' atmos - phere '' is perhaps the word for it there cer - tainly is some quality in the work of an illustrator contemporary with the reader , that is likely to please him more than that of a much earlier workman in the same field .

		Hence , just as history and biography and romance have to be written over and over again for succeeding gen - erations , so the masterpieces of literature call for fresh illustration with each new half-century or e v n less ; or if the pictures are not actually drawn they are sure to be imagined by the reader for himself , which is not seldom the better way .

		Mr.
Melville	PERSON	's prefatory bibliographical notes are always very much to the point and frequently packed with information of more than biblio - graphical interest .

		The account which Mr.
Eyre Crowe	PERSON	, at one time
Thackeray	PERSON	's secretary and amanuensis , gives of the work upon `` Esmond '' engages our willing attention . ''

		An appeal to an obliging attendant , '' Mr.
Crowe	PERSON	has related , '' brought us through the now public portion of the library -LSB- of the British Museum -RSB- , where , I remember , on his touching a hidden
spring	DATE	in what seemed to be beautifully bound folios , but which were in reality only sham backs of these , a door flew open , and we were in the presence of Sir
Anthony Panizzi	PERSON	.

		He readily granted permission to write in one of the secluded gal - leries , at a table placed in the midst of the vol - umes to be consulted .

		I sat down and wrote to dictation the scathing sentences about the great

Cadogan	LOCATION	, etc. , etc. '' The volume of '' Ballads and Verses , and Miscellaneous Contributions to ' Punch , ' '' with its amusing pictures by
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Leech	ORGANIZATION	, and others , has allowed Mr.
Furniss	PERSON	the freest range to his fancy , and has also given Mr.
Melville	PERSON	an opportunity to present a fuller collection of bibliographical notes than usual .

		The '' Artist 's Preface , '' too , is of unusual length and interest .

		In fact , the variety of readable matter contrib - uted to this edition of Thackeray by other pens than that of the novelist himself constitutes not the least of its admirable features .

		So much of matter within the compass of twenty volumes has of course imposed the necessity of a rather small print ; but it is clear and , to any but defective eyesight , large enough for comfort , even if not for the luxury implied in the pub - lisher 's designation of the edition .

		At any rate , this centenary set of
Thackeray	PERSON	's works worthily helps to make memorable the year of its appear - ance > PERCY F. BICKNKI i .

		* The two substantial volumes on '' The Indian Tribes of the

Radisson	ORGANIZATION	,
Hennepin	LOCATION	, and Lahontan , and later by
Jonathan Carver	PERSON	; and it is much to be regretted that the scholarly translator and editor ,
Emma Helen Blair	PERSON	, did not live to receive the grateful ac - knowledgments of students and the reading public for having performed a difficult task with care and discrimination .

		It may be said that the work constitutes , in a general way , a history of the Indian tribes of the North west and the region of the
Great Lakes	LOCATION	, from their first contact with civilization to
1827	DATE	, although there is a gap of a century be - tween the French narratives and those written by American officials .

		THE DIAL 165 fairs , by
Thomas Forsyth	PERSON	, United States Indian Agent .

		The English translation of
Perrot	PERSON	's `` Me - moire '' is the most notable feature of the work .

		This book in English has long been a desidera - tum , for the French edition -LRB-
Leipzig	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	, 1864 -RRB- , edited by Father Tailhan , a learned Jesuit , is not easily accessible to those far re - moved from the more important libraries , and is , of course , a sealed volume to those unfamiliar with the French language .

		The present trans - lation will make available to the general reader a really important contribution to our knowledge of the Indians of the
Upper Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	and lake region a contribution which has here - tofore been little known to those not specialists in the field of aboriginal history .

		Perrot , like
Du Lhut	PERSON	, was a prince of cou - reurs de bois ; a man of tough fibre , brave , tactful , and shrewd ; a consummate master of Indian character , and perhaps the most success - ful of all the French emissaries among the
West	LOCATION	- ern Indians .

		Born in
1644	DATE	,
Perrot	PERSON	came to
New France	LOCATION	in a year unknown , and began life there in the service of the missionaries .

		He first came West in
1665	DATE	, and at once saw the im - portance of uniting the Western tribes against their common enemy , the Iroquois , and making them allies of the French .

		He was frequently employed by the governors of
New France	LOCATION	on account of his great ability in managing the wily savage .

		A master of many of their dia - lects , and for many years a close student of their customs ,
Perrot	PERSON	exercised an influence over the Indians with whom he came in contact unsur - passed by that of any other Frenchman of his day .

		As a trader , he established several posts in the Indian country .

		It is not remarkable , there - fore , that this man , though an unskilled writer , produced a work at once interesting and reli - able , which , unfortunately , remained in man - uscript for more than a century and a half .

		He not only gives us an intimate account of the primitive Indian of the Old West , but also throws much light on the relations existing be - tween the French and the tribes coming within the sphere of their influence .

		Here is a fair example of
Perrot	PERSON	's manner of writing -LRB- volume 1 , pages 47-49 -RRB- : '' It can not be said that the savages profess any doc - trine ; and it is certain that they do not , so to speak , follow any religion .

		They only observe some Jewish customs , for they have certain feasts at which they make no use of a knife for cutting their cooked meat , which they devour with their teeth .

		The women have also a custom , when they bring their children into the world , of spending a month without entering the husband 's cabin ; and during all that time they can not even eat there with the men , or eat food which has been pre - pared by men 's hands .

		It is for this reason that the women cook their own food separately . ''

		The savages I mean those who are not converted -LSB- to Christianity -RSB- recognize as principal divinities only the
Great Hare	LOCATION	, the sun , and the devils .

		They oftenest invoke the
Great Hare	LOCATION	, because they revere and adore him as the creator of the world ; they reverence the sun as the author of light ; but if they place the devils among their divinities , and invoke them , it is because they are afraid of them , and in the invocations which they make to the devils they entreat them for -LSB- the means of -RSB- life .

		Those among the savages whom the French call ' jugglers ' talk with the demon , whom they consult for -LSB- success in -RSB- war and hunting . ''

		It is altogether likely that
Perrot	PERSON	would have extended his work somewhat had he been better provided with writing materials .

		He concludes the '' Memoire '' rather abruptly with an '' ha - rangue which ought to have been made to all the
Outaoiia Tribes	ORGANIZATION	, in order to bind them to the peace with the Renards and their allies '' ; and adds : '' The scarcity of paper does not per - mit me to give fuller examples of this sort of harangue , as I would have been able to if I were not destitute of paper . ''

		La Pother ie was appointed , in
1698	DATE	, '' comp - troller-general of the marine and fortifications in
Canada	LOCATION	, the first incumbent of a newly cre - ated post . ''

		His '' Histoire , '' long very scarce , and now in part published in English for the first time , is a work of great importance , but little known except to the few who are engaged in historical research .

		It is generally believed that the lost writings of
Perrot	LOCATION	, to which refer - ence is made by some of the early writers , were freely drawn upon by La Potherie , thus en - hancing rather than diminishing the value of his book .

		He also supplemented his own expe - riences as an official of the French government in the Indian country with information received from
Joliet	LOCATION	, the Jesuit fathers , and others .

		In making her translation ,
Miss Blair	PERSON	has used the fourth edition of the '' Histoire '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	, 1753 -RRB- .

		La Potherie was a keen observer and at times a lively writer .

		There follows his description of an Indian feast -LRB- volume 1 , pages 337 , 338 -RRB- : `` They -LSB- the assembled tribes -RSB- decided that they would go with the Frenchmen -LSB- to
Montreal	LOCATION	-RSB- ; preparations for this were accordingly made , and a solemn feast was held ; and on the eve of their departure a volley of musketry was fired in the village .

		Three men sang incessantly , all night long , in a cabin , invoking their spirits from time to time .

		They began with the song of Michabous ; then they came to that of the god of lakes , rivers , and forests , begging the winds , the thunder , the storms , and the tempests to be favorable to them during the voyage .

		The next day , the crier went through the village , invit - ing the men to the cabin where the feast was to be pre - pared .

		They found no difficulty in going thither , each 166 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, furnished with his On rag an and
Mikouen	PERSON	-LSB- ' hia dish and spoon ' La Potherie -RSB- .

		The three musicians of the previous night begun to sing ; one was placed at the en - trance of the cabin , another in the middle , and the third at its end ; they were armed with quivers , bows , and arrows , and their faces and entire bodies were blackened with coal .

		While the people sat in this assembly , in the utmost quiet , twenty young men entirely naked , elaborately painted and wearing girdles of otter-skin , to which were attached the skins of crows , with their plumage , and gourds lifted from the fires ten great kettles ; then the singing ceased .

		The first of these actors next sang hia war song , keeping time with it in a dance from one end to the other of the cabin , while all the savages cried in deep guttural tones , < Hay , hay ! '

		When the musicians ended , all the others uttered a loud yell , in which their voices gradually died away , much as a loud noise disappears among the mountains .

		Then the second and third musicians repeated , in turn , the Mum - performance ; and , in a word , nearly all the savages did the same , in alternation each singing hia own song , but no one venturing to repeat that of another , unless he were willing deliberately to offend the one who had composed the song , or unless the latter were dead -LRB- in order to exalt , as it were , the dead man 's name by appro - priating his song -RRB- .

		During this , their looks were accom - panied with gestures and violent movements ; and some of them took hatcheta with which they pretended to strike the women and children who were watching them .

		Some took firebrands , which they tossed about every - where ; others filled their diahea with red-hot coals , which they threw at each other . ''

		The letter of Major
Marston	PERSON	, who was in command of
Fort Armstrong	LOCATION	, now
Rock Island	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, was printed -LRB- 1822 -RRB- in a report made by
Jedidiah Morse	PERSON	in the capacity of special govern - ment agent ; but the text for the present work has been obtained from a copy of the original in the well-known
Draper	PERSON	manuscripts .

		Marston shows great familarity with the tribes of the
Northwest Territory	ORGANIZATION	, and his relation could not well be spared from the collection .

		Forsyth 's manuscript , also from the
Draper	PERSON	collection , dealing with the
Sauk	ORGANIZATION	and Fox tribes , has never before been printed ; and it is cause for wonder that the nimble Secretary of the Wis - consin Historical Society , Dr.
Thwaites	PERSON	, did not long ago make use of it in the excellent publi - cations of that Society ; but it is far better that it should have been reserved for the present work .

		Forsyth adds to his interesting and valuable account of Indian customs and mode of life a considerable vocabulary .

		There are appendixes giving additional infor - mation concerning Perrot ; Indian society , char - acter , and religious beliefs -LRB- chiefly from the '' Handbook of American Indians '' -RRB- ; extracts from letters written to Miss Blair by mission - aries and others during the preparation of her volumes , setting forth the present condition of the
Sioux	LOCATION	, the
Pottawatomi	LOCATION	, and the
Winnebago	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is an exhaustive bibliography , with critical and biographic notes , riv ` rin < j fifty-two pages ; and it is a pleasure to observe that the index , prepared by
Gertrude M. Robertson	PERSON	, is all that could be desired .

		Miss
Blair	PERSON	's preface , although brief , adequately introduces the work .

		With characteristic vigor she pleads for fair treatment of the Indians , in whom she has confidence , saying : `` Let them be given a ' square deal ' in every way , and there is no doubt that in time they will prove them - selves worthy of it . ''

		The French works have been skilfully
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- glished ; and
Miss Blair	PERSON	's method of editing
Perrot	PERSON	's '' Me `` moire , '' as also the other narra - tives , is admirable .

		She has been discriminating in the work of annotation ; the essential parts of Father Tailhan 's notes which are often diffuse and not always important have been retained , and much new matter added .

		Her scrupulous honesty in editing is shown by punc - tilious acknowledgment of the contributions of others ; there are no uncredited borrowings .

		An excellent map giving the locations of the leading Indian tribes serves as the frontispiece to Volume I. ; and there are fourteen other illustrations , perhaps the most interesting being a photographic facsimile of a precious auto - graph letter of Perrot , now in the possession of the
Wisconsin Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		A few typo - graphical errors have been found , but nothing that will mislead the reader .

		The books are handsomely printed and durably bound .

		MORE LIETTERS OF RICHARD WAGM i : .

		- There probably never lived a man more com - pelled to a complete revelation of what was in him than
Richard Wagner	PERSON	.

		There is no sort of self-revelation which his career does not manifest .

		He stormed through life in the fierce exhibition of a personality that broke over every limitation which the world without him or the world within him might set .

		He poured himself into his artistic productions , both poetic and musical , with surpassing ardor .

		He reveals himself in every musical drama : in times of darkness and defeat he is his own '' Flying Dutchman , '' seek - ing eagerly for help and guidance ; in times of light and triumph he is his own
Walter	PERSON	, who car - ries off the prize at the contest of the '' Master - singers in Nuremberg . ''

		THE DIAL 167 anticipations , his illuminative insights , are dis - closed in his dramas , and in the music which repeats their substance , scene for scene , char - acter for character .

		There came to him the inexorable demand to understand himself , to measure his work , to transform the existing state of the great art to which he found his life must be devoted .

		His views of music were evidently not those of his contemporaries ; there had been forerunners great and sincere men , indeed ; but the full ex - pression of the advance was a task which called on him for its sure and adequate consummation .

		So once more he sends forth his writings in prose , in which he reveals himself as the re - former in his art , the austere critic of the lower ideals which dominated his compeers , a voice cry - ing out in the wilderness , a message mingled of many and in some ways incongruous elements .

		The restless spirit was not satisfied with lit - erature and music ; nor could the individual activities of home and friendship bound the eagerness of self-realization .

		The time was out of joint , and he was chosen to set it right .

		If the means to be used were revolutionary , if peaceful governments were to be assailed , there surely would be more glory in the warfare , and the courage of the man should not fail to meet any test .

		So he becomes an exile from his country and has another grim disappointment added to those which had already taxed his endurance .

		In addition to all these activities , any one of which would have filled up the measure of an ordinary life , he was a voluminous letter-writer .

		It was inevitable that he should come in contact with leading minds in all departments of thought and action .

		There are now extant and published these letters to every sort of person , from kings to the simple toiler for his daily bread .

		He was possessed by the insatiable need of self-expres - sion .

		He could not hold anything secret .

		His friends and his family must share with him his never-ending projects and slow-coming triumphs .

		So we get the effusions to
Uhlig	PERSON	and
Fischer	PERSON	and
Heine	PERSON	, his elaborate correspondence with
Liszt	PERSON	, the kindred spirit who understood him and gave him aid and sympathy when he needed them most , his constant expressions of himself to his first wife
Minna	PERSON	, his more elevated epistolary discussions of art and philosophy with those who dwelt in the same intellectual regions with himself ; and now we have the familiar and in - timate exchange of opinion and anticipation with his mother , with brothers and sisters , and with other relatives .

		To crown all , there is the Autobiography as if he were compelled , like
Socrates	PERSON	, by some divinity to make a further revelation to mankind , and put himself and his great work justly before posterity , so willing to accept him at the highest reach which his appre - ciators could formulate .

		The family was a large one .

		The mother was twice married , and there were children by both unions .

		They were a talented company .

		The theatre exercised upon them a controlling fasci - nation , and several of them were either singers or actresses of considerable distinction .

		Some of the sisters made fortunate marriages , giving the perturbed family prospects a favorable turn .

		Two of the sisters married into the
Brockhaus	PERSON	family , well-known in connection with the popu - lar and useful JZbnversations-Lexicon .

		The half-sister -LRB- the youngest child -RRB- married
Edward Avenarius	PERSON	, chief of the
Paris	LOCATION	branch of the
Brockhaus	PERSON	business .

		She was devotedly at - tached to her famous brother , and the preserva - tion of many of the letters is due to her filial piety .

		There were children of the children upon whom the master seems to have looked with much affection , especially as his first marriage was destitute of offspring , a source of great grief to him in the dark hours of toil unrequited , and then showing no evidences that it would ever be requited .

		They were all held in genuinely close and happy relations ; and for one brother ,
Julius	PERSON	, who appeared incapable of winning even a small meed of success in life , they made provision , and
Richard	PERSON	sent him money when his own circum - stances were so straitened that he was calling for help from all available sources .

		Mr.
Ashton Ellis	PERSON	, to whom we are again in - debted for the excellent and characteristic trans - lation of these
Wagner	PERSON	letters , makes the fol - lowing observations on the new collection : `` For my own part , as between the three works just named -LSB- the Autobiography , the letters to the first wife
Minna	PERSON	, the Family Letters here under review -RSB- in the matter of self-portraiture I should give decided prefer - ence and should have even before seeing any of them to the one which displays to us the author in the most levelling of all human relations , that of the member of a large family conclave , and youngest but one of a numer - ous middle-class brood .

		Here no possible suspicion of attitudinizing can arise in the mind of the most inveter - ate carper ; if I may be allowed to appeal to personal ex - perience of a similar quiverful , elder brothers and sisters knock all that sort of thing out of their juniors mighty soon .

		And so we get a picture of the naked human spirit in the driest and most neutral of lights , even the letters addressed to a younger generation , those to two or three adoring nieces , being sobered by the certainty that they will be shown to the girls ' parents .

		Yet what letters they are , the majority of those to his nieces !

		Take No. 65 , for instance , with its C I court the affection of 168 THE DIAL -LSB-

		< li ; i \ v the wliiili - mortal to nif liv it if I can , and give him , an * it may be , just such a thorough hearty kiss as I should like to give yourself today . '

		As pendant to which I may cite that to his brother-in-law Edward of almost ten years earlier : ' I know no first or last midst those my heart belongs to ; I ' ve only one heart , and who - ever dwells there is its tenant from bottom to top . ' ''

		The first letter has for date and address the 3d of
March , 1832	DATE	,
Leipsic	LOCATION	; it is written to his sister
Ottilie	PERSON	; here is an extract : `` For you must know that for over the past half year I have been the pupil of our
Cantor Weinlig	PERSON	, whom one may rightly call the greatest contrapuntist now alive ; added to which he is such an excellent man that I 'm fond of him aa of a father ... Last Christmas an overture of mine was performed at the theatre , and actually one at the
Grand Concert	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Gewandhaus -RRB- last week ; and I would have you know this latter is no trifle . ''

		The last letter has for date and address the 27th of
October , 1874	DATE	,
Bayreuth	LOCATION	; it is written to his widowed sister ,
Clara Wolfram	PERSON	; an ex - tract follows : How strange , dear Clare !

		Only yesterday I was thinking of yourself most vividly , and made up my mind to invite you to visit us here next
summer	DATE	and stay as long as you liked in our at last completed house .

		You were to bring your Roschen with you ; it was all settled , and I was recalling so many chapters in my life which you had helped go through , and thinking how you really are my greatest intimate of all my brothers and sisters .

		My childhood , too , of which wife so often wants to hear , you alone could have distinct remembrance of .

		So I was rejoicing in the thought of writing you soon and behold !

		there comes this sable message .

		Good Wolfram !

		how glad I am I saw him once again last year , after so long an interval !

		... And now I ask myself if you ought n't , perhaps , to come to us this very autumn so lovely here now ... Then we 'll have many a long talk and that 's often a wonderful help . ''

		The interval spans the mighty and successful career ; the letters between are filled with hopes and fears , aspirations and exultations .

		The record is of remarkable interest ; the man is seen again from many points of view ; his utter - ance is as usual vehement , picturesque , and individual .

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	, the translator , is completing the great work to which he has given so much of his Hfe .

		He is , with
Herr Glasenapp	PERSON	, the accepted chronicler of
Wagner	PERSON	.

		Such work as his can - not be overestimated ; indeed , to make an ade - quate statement of its value and importance forces one to speak in superlatives that would sound as vain exaggerations .

		The present volume is , like its predecessors , filled with understand - ing of the life with which it deals , and repro - duces the characteristics of the original with skill and effectiveness .

		Few oral deliverances rank alx > ve the me - diocre as literature .

		At best the speeches of one orator , dealing with issues once alive but long since dead and buried , can but serve as models for later orators treating the themes of a newer day .

		If ever a speaker truly perpetuates himself in print , it is because the fortunate occa - sion and the great man have cooperated to ele - vate the local and transitory into tin - universal and lasting ; but such men and such occasions are in conjunction only once in an age .

		Burke 's orations will live ; it is to be doubted whether those of

Lincoln	LOCATION	's speeches have become a por - tion of American literature .

		The `` American Addresses '' of former ambassador

		Choate do not belong in this small class of ora - tions that are literature , but they are excellent specimens of modern eloquence , flowing and yet chaste in diction , restrained and thoughtful , rising frequently to elevated levels of idea and emotion , and revealing always a personality of rare charm and magnanimity .

		Indeed , the volume is a substantial and in - teresting contribution to recent prose .

		The dis - tinguished name of the orator from whose D addresses these selections have been made by himself would bespeak for the book a wider in - terest than is usually elicited by oral discourses put into cold print , and this interest is abun - dantly justified by the range and quality of the addresses .

		They are the select speeches of a life - time , a sort of record of a life enviable in rich and abundant experience .

		The earliest address was delivered at the opening of the famous Sani - tary Fair in
New York	LOCATION	in
1864	DATE	; the latest , dated
1910	DATE	, was spoken , by a strange coincidence , at the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the first training school for nurses in the same city .

		When the first address was made , Mr.
Choate	PERSON	had been practising his pro- fession but nine years ; at the time of the last .

		forty-six years afterwards , he had long worn almost all the coveted laurels of a great lawyer , and had represented his country for six years at
the Court of St. James	ORGANIZATION	.

		The earlier speeches are original documents throwing inti-rr-t in - side - lights on critical passages in the history of
New York City	LOCATION	or of the nation ; some of the later are reminiscences of a past as foreign to the present generation as is our Colonial epoch .

		Still other speeches deal with questions of the present .

		The biographic and memorial addresses are a picture gallery of notable American leaders ,
Rufus Choate	PERSON	, the great
Massachusetts	LOCATION	orator , '' the flashing glance of whose dark eye , and the light of whose bewitching smile , '' faded out together with the last '' tones of his matchless voice '' fifty-three years ago ; Admiral Farragut , '' whose name will ever stir like a trumpet the hearts of his grateful countrymen '' ; '' the great and dear name of

		Many of the briefer addresses , indeed , are models of good sense , fine considerateness , and delightful wit .

		Certain of the memorial orations on
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, for instance , and
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	are so suffused with genuine conviction and strong feeling as to stir the heart even in their printed form .

		Indeed , it is the sincerity and depth of the speaker 's convictions as to morals , character , and patriotism that give greatest value to the book .

		The frequently reiterated emphasis upon the fundamental importance of the radical vir - tues as the ultimate source of achievement and success makes the book a timely antidote to much that passes to-day for sound wisdom and trustworthy teaching . ''

		But last and more than all , '' says the distinguished lawyer , speaking in
1898	DATE	before the
Chicago Bar Association	ORGANIZATION	, `` what Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	said of character is far more true in our profession than anywhere else , that character is a far higher power than intel - lect , and character and conscience in the long run are sure to come out ahead . ''

		The rising generation will profit in essentials if it will take to heart similar wholesome and eloquent words of sound wisdom contained in almost every ad - dress in this volume .

		DEVELOPMENT OF THE MEDIAEVAL , MIND .

		* That the mediaeval mind was dominated by two great influences that of classical an - tiquity , or the antique culture , and that of patristic theology is the main theme of Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's great interpretative history of mediae - val culture .

		The cultural historical manifes - tation of the two-fold dominance referred to is also two-fold ; namely , intellectual and emotional , the thought and the feeling of the age .

		The aim constantly before the author throughout these two large octavos is '' to follow through the Middle Ages the development of intellectual energy and the growth of emotion . ''

		The organization and treatment of the im - mense mass of material illustrative of the char - acter and tendencies of mediaeval culture show a remarkable combination of scholarly objec - tivity with subjectivity of a high order .

		This , however , was only to be expected from the au - thor of '' Ancient Ideals '' and '' The Classical Heritage of the Middle Ages . ''

		Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	holds that the function of the historian is not merely to delve into the minutiae of the past .

		He must , at his peril , judge as well as narrate . ''

		He can not state the facts and sit aloof , impartial between good and ill , between success and failure , progress and retrogression , the soul 's health and love - liness and spiritual foulness and disease .

		He must love and hate , and at his peril love aright and hate what is truly hateful .

		And although his sympathies quiver to understand and feel as the man and woman before him , his sympathies must be controlled by wisdom . ''

		So in regard to the Middle Ages , '' we have to sympathize with their best , and understand their lives out of their lives and the conditions in which they were passed . ''

		This is not an easy task , and it calls for an extraordinary knowledge and sympathy on the part of moderns .

		We are * THE MEDLEVAL MIND .

		A History of
the Development of Thought	ORGANIZATION	and Emotion in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		By
Henry Osborn Taylor	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	: The Mac - niillan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		170 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, so much nearer akin to the cultural ideas and ideals of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	than to those of mediaeval Empire and Papacy that much of the finest and best in mediaeval ascetic and chivalric thought and emotion is apt to escape us through lack of understanding of fundamental socio - psychic traits .

		A careful reading of Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's two volumes can not fail to put the sympathetic student on an appreciative and understanding basis with regard to what was best and most characteristic in mediaeval cul - ture .

		The work is not merely informing in its wealth of illustration and citation , it is an '' Open Sesame '' to a thorough understanding of the forces and influences producing and de - veloping the mediaeval mind .

		In working out his thesis of dual influences and dual manifestations , Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	first de - scribes the groundwork of mediaeval thought and emotion .

		He shows how the west was Latinized , and how Greek philosophy was clearly the antecedent of the patristic theolog - ical apprehension of fact .

		That this apprehen - sion was warped and narrowed by the growth of doctrines and dogmas of salvation , is shown in an interesting chapter on the '' Intellectual Interests of the Latin Fathers , '' who , however , in spite of their '' intellectual obliquities '' developed '' Catholic Christianity consisting in the union of two complements , ecclesiastical organization and the complete and consistent organism of doctrine , '' which in their union '' were to prove unequalled in history for coherence and efficiency . ''

		Next we have a description and interpretation of the ''
Latin Transmitters of Antique	ORGANIZATION	and Patristic Thought , '' such as the great transitional scholar
Boethius	PERSON	, whom Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	rather daringly characterizes as '' a professing Christian , '' the longeval
Cas	ORGANIZATION	- siodorus with his Christian utilitarian view of knowledge , '' the almost mediaeval Gregory the Great in whom cultural decadence and barbarism meet and join , and , as a final type ,
Isidore	PERSON	, the princely scholar-bishop of
Seville	LOCATION	, the encyclopaedist of the Middle Ages whose `` Etymologise , '' in twenty books , contains `` a conglomerate of knowledge , secular and sacred , exactly suited to the coming centuries . ''

		The - ology , grammar , and rhetoric were dominant over reason and science by the middle of the seventh century .

		In the remainder of the section devoted to the groundwork , Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	describes the na - ture and effects of the barbaric disruption of the empire : how the Celtic people of
Gaul	PERSON	and Ire - land contributed a peculiar emotional romantic strain , how Teuton qualities came from
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	, German , and
Norseman	ORGANIZATION	, and how
Chris	PERSON	- tianity and antique knowledge were brought by Irish and Roman monks to the pagan peoples of the north .

		All this is well and skilfully told , and the function of the Teutons in mediaeval evolution is shown to have been to accept Christianity and learn something of the pagan antique , and then to react upon what they had received and change it to their natures . ''

		The next section of the work takes up in detail the intellectual forces and figures of the early Middle Ages .

		The Carolingian period shows the first stage in the appropriation of the patriot i - and antique , while the beginnings of European nationalism in the eleventh century are recog - nized by separate chapters on the Latin cul - tural thought of
Italy	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	.

		In closing this section , attention is drawn to the growth of mediaeval emotion in connection with Latin Christianity .

		The struggle to maintain the ideal and the failure of realization , thus producing the actual , in connection with both the saints and ordinary society , furnishes the basic motive for Books III .

		and IV .

		Monastic reforms , eremitism , the spiritual love of
St. Bernard	ORGANIZATION	and St.
Francis	PERSON	, and the mystic visions of ascetic women , illus - trate the saintly ideal ; while the '' spotted actuality '' of religious life is shown by the tes - timony of mediaeval invective and satire , by the astounding revelations of Archbishop Rigaud 's Register , and other evidences of failure to rise to the ideal .

		One of Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's greatest descrip - tive triumphs is the delightful chapter dealing with the thirteenth-century world of the honest garrulous Franciscan friar Salimbene .

		Here the actual is seen in true perspective through the '' uncloistered eye '' of the naive ecclesiastic .

		In regard to the ideal and actual in society , we have feudalism and knighthood described and contrasted with romantic chivalry , courtly love , and mystical aspirations ; while the mediaeval woman is shown us in the person of
Heloise	ORGANIZATION	, and the critic of society in
Walther	LOCATION	von der Vogelweide , type of German nationalism and of Teutonic opposition to what was Roman .

		The topic of Mediaeval Symbolism is inter - estingly discussed in three chapters of Book V. , dealing with scriptural allegories , the interpre - tation of the visible world , as given by the inven - tive Hugo of St.
Victor	PERSON	, and the symbolism of the cathedral , the mass , and the hymn or relig - ious poem .

		A wealth of illustration is given to round out a scholarly general treatment of a difficult subject .

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 171 The next section is devoted to '' Latinity and Law , '' and shows the origin and development of Latin culture along somewhat secular lines of prose and verse which approach the popular and vernacular .

		An additional chapter dealing with the mediaeval appropriation of the Roman Law hardly does justice to the dynamic significance of the great legal revival of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries .

		The task of tracing the development of the mediaeval mind and interpreting its produc - tions is brought to a most successful close in Book VII. , dealing with the '' Ultimate
Intel	ORGANIZATION	- lectual Interests of the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries . ''

		Scholasticism is made clear in its spirit , scope , and method , from its beginnings to its triumph in
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	.

		The great rationalist
Roger Bacon	PERSON	is skilfully depicted , and the keen-minded controversialists Duns Scotus and
Occam	LOCATION	are given a chapter .

		Finally , in
Dante	LOCATION	, in whom '' the elements of mediaeval growth combine , '' Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	finds his type for the mediaeval synthesis .

		`` When the contents of patristic Christianity and the surviving antique culture had been conceived anew , and had been felt as well , and novel forms of senti - ment evolved , at last comes Dante to possess the whole , to think it , feel it , visualize its sum , and make of it a poem . ''

		It is easier to appreciate than to criticize such a work as Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	's on '' The Mediaeval Mind . ''

		The erudition , scholarship , and under - standing of developmental forces , command respect and admiration .

		Possibly the author has brought to his task of interpretation too set ideas of exact influences and channels of development .

		There will certainly be some who will feel that the vernacular aspects of mediaeval culture have been slighted for the sake of the Latin .

		Others will criticize the absence of a certain institutional sense in relation to culture and civilization ; and still others will feel that there is too much of the biographical and personal in the work .

		No writer can please everyone , but it may be safely prophesied that Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	will lead many into new cultural paths .

		His work should be an incentive to more vital study of the past , and should serve to draw attention to the field of cultural history so much neglected in our American universities .

		Special courses in the history of European culture are now given at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	,
Missouri	LOCATION	, and possibly at one or two other universities .

		They should be given in all the larger institutions .


NORMAN M. TRENHOLME	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The causes and Durin g * h e fiscal year ending
June	DATE	effects of Greek 30 ,
1910	DATE	, a total of somewhat over immigration .

		thirty-nine thousand people of Greek nationality passed through the immigrant ports of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This body of newcomers com - prised only between three and a half and four per cent of our aggregate alien influx for the year .

		None the less , by reason of the peculiar problems that have been created by the coming of the Greeks among us , not to mention the romantic interest attaching always to the fortunes of the modern Hellenes , the subject of the Greeks in
America	LOCATION	is one which is distinctly worthy of careful attention .

		It is agreeable to record that in Dr.
Henry Pratt Fairchild	PERSON	's '' Greek Immigration to the United States '' -LRB-
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are brought together in attractive form the results of a thor - oughly commendable study of this subject .

		In the writing of his book Dr.
Fairchild	PERSON	has had the ad - vantage not merely of the most approved training in anthropology and social science , but also of first - hand knowledge of the Greek people , including their language , in both their old and their new home .

		If the number of the Greeks is small , the impressions which they yield are the more definite and clear - cut , and it has been possible for Dr. Fairchild to compass his subject and to present a many-sided view of it in a measure which one might hardly hope to attain in dealing with the Italians , the Hungarians , the Jews , or any one of our larger foreign groups .

		In the first portion of his volume the author describes the conditions , causes , and sources of Greek emigration ; in the second , the Greeks as they are in their American homes ; and in the third , the effects of immigration upon the home land , upon the
United States	LOCATION	, and upon the immigrants themselves .

		The causes of Greek emi - gration are shown to be almost exclusively economic , arising fundamentally from the lack of a diversifi - cation of industry , and more immediately from the agricultural depression of recent years , combined with the cutting off of opportunity for employment in the adjacent countries of
Roumania	LOCATION	and
Bulgaria	LOCATION	.

		Money-making , it is pointed out , is with the modern Greek a ruling passion .

		It is for the purpose of making money that the Athenian or Tripolitan comes to
America	LOCATION	, and it is from the same consider - ation that , at the sacrifice generally of more pleasant living conditions , of the society of his kind , and often even of health , he remains .

		The effects of an American residence upon the average Greek the author feels generally to be dubious .

		The most unfavorable aspects of Greek life in the
United States	LOCATION	, it is pointed out , arise from the insignificant proportion of women -LRB- in
1910	DATE	only six per cent -RRB- among the immigrant arrivals , effectually precluding the benefits of family ties .

		Upon
Greece	LOCATION	itself the effects of emigration to
America	LOCATION	are declared to be serious in the extreme . ''

		It is no exaggeration to say that if emigration keeps on at its present rate of 172 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, increase , as it promises to do , within twenty years
Greece	LOCATION	will be completely drained of its natural working force , and the population will consist of a few old men and a host of old women and middle - aged spinsters . ''

		The author 's conclusion would seem to he that while it would be better all around for the Greek to remain in
Greece	LOCATION	, there is slender likelihood of his doing so .

		incident * in With a lack of literary thrift which the making of he himself acknowledges , Mr.
Joseph	PERSON	a tailor-author .

		Conrad has packed into his small autobiographical volume , '' A Personal Record '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , enough incident and adventure to form the ground-work of several novels .

		In an agreeably hap - hazard fashion he recalls some of the more sig - nificant events in his various wanderings on sea and land , and gives us glimpses meanwhile of his mental growth and of his gradual and rather late develop - ment as an author .

		Not until he was thirty-six years old did this vagrant son of unhappy
Poland	LOCATION	write a line for publication , and even then his first book , ''
Almayer	PERSON	's Folly , '' was four years in getting itself put upon paper .

		Surely there has been in his case no precipitate rushing into print under the spur of thirst for fame .

		A pleasing picture of the boy
Joseph	PERSON	, who learned to read so early that he never could recall the process of learning , is given in his account of his introduction , at the age of eight , to English literature .

		`` Two Gentlemen of
Verona	LOCATION	, '' in a manu - script translation by his father , a scholar and a writer , ushered him into a new world where he seems soon to have made himself at home .

		Turning the rich pages of Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	's book , in which he makes a praiseworthy attempt to picture himself honestly and accurately to the reader 's view , one might feel tempted to note a rather curious inconsistency of statement .

		In his preface he modestly disclaims anything like inspiration , any compelling force that has made him write romances of the sea , adding that he has '' a positive horror of losing even for one mov - ing moment that full possession of myself which is the first condition of good service . ''

		But in his open - ing chapter he writes : '' I dare say I am compelled unconsciously compelled now to write volume after volume , as in past years I was compelled to go to sea voyage after voyage .

		Leaves must follow upon one another as leagues used to follow in the days gone by , on and on to the appointed end , which , being Truth itself , is One one for all men and for all occupations . ''

		So little does introspection help a man really to know himself .

		One oddity of idiom is likely to puzzle the reader of this anglicized Polish author : he has an unaccountable fondness for a par - ticipial construction where the sense might better require an infinitive .

		For example : '' I failed in being the second white man on record drowned at that interesting spot '' ; and again , - Would it bore you very much reading a MS. in a handwriting like mine ? ''

		But the book is too interesting as a human document , partly by reason of its very blemishes , to make those blemishes count against it very heavily .

i %	PERCENT	11 which , subdue ita processes to our of Mvtticiim .

		ngeg ag we niay , still sets us insoluble problems which refuse to be banished even \ \ li.-n their insolubility is most apparent .

		It is no wonder that we are always seeking short-cuts , away from the jungle of the senses and the intellect , into the pure and calm reality which we imagine must be somewhere and somehow available .

		Mysticism i - the philosophy of the short-cut to reality .

		Men and women in all ages have told of a realm of peace , entry into which could only be obtained by the use of a kind of contemplative technique which had the effect of freeing one from one 's self and attaching one 's soul to God .

		In '' Mysticism : A Study in the Nature and Development of Man 's Spiritual Consciousness '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , Miss
Evelyn Underbill	PERSON	, already known on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	as a novelist , has written a remarkably detailed and documented study of tin - activity or rather passivity of the human spirit .

		Herself a thorough believer in mysticism , she has traced reverently and sympathetically , and yet with independent comment and explanation , the expe - riences of the soul which all the mystics agree in reporting as the fruits of their heavenly quests .

		As a contribution to religious psychology made from an empirical standpoint , the book can not be too highly commended .

		Miss Underbill reports widely , fairly , and intelligently , and her bibliographies hint at a vast amount of research work .

		As to mysticism 's validity , and
Miss Underbill	PERSON	's philosophical defence of it , one can not speak in the same strain .

		By its own implications mysticism is aristocratic fitted neither to the endowment nor the vocation of the average man , and it is reactionary by the very fact that it is a contemplative appropriation of the static and the established -LRB- if indeed it is not purely sub - jective -RRB- , and not the active creation of any new value .

		This latter criticism of mysticism makes it all the more curious that Miss Underbill should appeal to
M. Henri Bergson	PERSON	, the great activistic philosopher , for a confirmation of the mystic philosophy .

		His '' vital urge '' as a life principle is very far from the '' Absolute '' of which Miss Underbill habitually speaks .

		Her use of the philosophy of the German idealist ,
Eucken	LOCATION	, in this connection , is more logical ; but
Encken	LOCATION	, it must be remembered , is a moralist as well as a mystic , and it is only fair to say that , with most modern philosophers , he lays more and in fact more fundamental stress upon activism , the creation of new values , than he does upon mere contemplation , however emotionally satisfying the latter may be .

		_ PtiatiaHWrt.ter * h title suggests DrHannis at Superman of
Taylor	PERSON	s `` Origin and Growth of the the Comtuution .

		American Constitution '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- undertakes to carry out for the constitutional his - tory of the
United States	LOCATION	the method of treatment which characterized the same author 's `` Origin and Growth of the English Constitution . ''

		A connection between the two works is established in a chapter
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 173 in the later publication on '' The Evolution of the
Typical American State	ORGANIZATION	, '' in which Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	gives a summary of the constitutional development of En - gland as far as it bears on the origin of American legal and political institutions .

		Succeeding chapters treat of the federal state ; the Constitutional Con - vention of
1787	DATE	; the first twelve amendments ; African slavery in its legal aspects ; constitutional growth from the time of
John Marshall	PERSON	to the Civil War ; the Civil War amendments ; the constitutional questions arising from the territorial acquisitions of the
United States	LOCATION	; the problems of interstate com - merce ; and , finally , '' The Outcome of Our Growth . ''

		Although open to criticism in some details , these chapters contain much that is interesting and valu - able .

		Unfortunately , in the earlier section of the book , and at intervals in the latter part , Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	has attempted to combine with a general account of the constitutional history of the
United States	LOCATION	a very special task which properly belongs to a separate work .

		The nature of this task is indicated by Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	in the sub-title to his work , which describes it as '' an historical treatise in which the document - ary evidence as to the making of the entirely new plan of federal government embodied in the existing Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	is , for the first time , set forth as a complete and consistent whole . ''

		The meaning of this , the reader learns , is that
Pelatiah Webster	PERSON	, through his '' Dissertation on the
Political Union	ORGANIZATION	and Constitution of the
Thirteen United States	LOCATION	, '' published in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	in
1783	DATE	, was the `` daring innovator , '' the `` great architect , '' the '' father of the Constitution , '' from whom
Madi	PERSON	- son and
Hamilton	PERSON	and
Pinckney	PERSON	, and consequently the
Federal Convention	ORGANIZATION	, derived all the essential features of the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It need hardly be said that the most careful students of this period of American history have not agreed with Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	's estimate of the importance of this pamphlet of
Webster	PERSON	's , or with the author 's emphasis upon his '' unearthing '' of it .

		But even if the argu - ments of Dr.
Taylor	PERSON	were to prevail , the inclusion of these in a one-volume treatise upon the develop - ment of our constitutional history would necessarily destroy the balance and proportion of the work .

		If the author were a beginner or of small reputation this would be , perhaps , of little consequence ; but in the case of one whose career has been so long and so distinguished it must be regretted that so much labor has been expended on a work which , as a whole , can not be regarded as satisfactory .

		We are living in the centenary of A great German .

		J military hero .

		events which kept
Europe	LOCATION	in turmoil .

		Napoleon 's overwhelming prestige was beginning to show signs of disintegration , though his Russian disaster apparently taught him no mod - eration .


Austria	LOCATION	was his football ,
Prussia	LOCATION	his de - spised tool ; and it was not till 181314 that the Germans `` found themselves , '' massed their forces with those of
Russia	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	and slowly forced the world-conqueror back , from
Leipzig	LOCATION	to
Paris	LOCATION	,
Elba	PERSON	,
Waterloo	LOCATION	, and
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	.

		In all these cam - paigns no man was more persistently active than the rugged septuagenarian
Gebhard Leberecht von Blucher	PERSON	, affectionately known to his men as `` Mar - shal Vorwarts . ''

		Very timely , then , is the appear - ance of a new volume in the '' Heroes of the Na - tions '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , dealing with
Blucher	PERSON	, and written by Mr.
Ernest F. Henderson	PERSON	.

		The author 's special object is to raise
Bltlcher	PERSON	's fame from a secondary to a primary rank ; to show that '' instead of being merely the man who came to
Wellington	LOCATION	's aid at
Waterloo	LOCATION	, he had a separate existence of his own and performed other great deeds in the cause that were equally deserving , '' and `` to establish him in his rightful position as the peer of
Wellington	LOCATION	in all that concerns the overthrow of Napoleon . ''

		Against
Wellington	LOCATION	's Spanish campaigns he sets forth
Blucher	PERSON	as '' the one progressive inspiring ele - ment among the leaders of the allies from
1813	DATE	on . ''

		Blucher certainly shone with many heroic qualities in the midst of the unheroic magnates who constantly thwarted his fierce and aggressive spirit .

		Yet he was a fighter , not a master of strategy ; allowing Gneisenau to plan for him movements which he eagerly executed a proof , surely , of self-knowledge and good sense .

		His one overmastering passion was hatred of
Napoleon	PERSON	, and he was quite free from the obsession of fear created in his colleagues ' hearts by the presence or approach of the arch-enemy .

		At seventy-two , this stalwart veteran was never hap - pier than when leading a charge or a forlorn hope ; and was singularly indifferent to danger or hardship .

		It would seem that he regarded his life-work as done when
Napoleon	PERSON	was safely caged in
St. Helena	LOCATION	; though he lived four years longer , dying in
1819	DATE	.

		As there is no English life of
Blucher	PERSON	or any English translation of his German biographies , Mr.
Hender	PERSON	- son 's work would appear to fill a real gap .

		The book is written with considerable descriptive power , is amply illustrated with portraits , maps , and plans , and has an interesting appendix , containing extracts from German Volksongs by
Arndt	PERSON	, KOrner ,
Ruckert	PERSON	, and others , which fired the Teutonic heart , and many of which chanted the praises of '' the old hoary hero who stands forth as the one national figure of the Liberation wars . ''

		Social conditions study of Greek may be fading in the Greek from American college class-rooms ; Commonwealth .

		but t jj ere J s no f a lli n g o ff j n the books put forth about
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Scholars are found and encouraged to write them ; and some kind of reading public is obviously expected by both authors and publishers .

		The line of demarcation seems sharp-drawn between the study of the language and the study of the race and its products ; though it is difficult to see how any scholarly reference use can be made of books dealing with Greek antiquities without some reading knowledge of the language .

		However , to students , teachers , and philhellenes generally , a delightful occupation is assured in the perusal of Mr.
Alfred E. Zimmern	PERSON	's recent work on 174 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, '' The Greek Commonwealth '' -LRB- Oxford : Clarendon Press -RRB- .

		It is an admirable essay , of about 450 pages , on the social and economic conditions in the
Athens	LOCATION	of the great golden fifth century B. c. Environment , natural influences , and inter-action of individual and national character are subjected to a penetrat - ing analysis , the results of which are set forth in an engaging and even fascinating manner .

		Mr.
Zimmern	PERSON	has caught the breezy and colloquial style of his much-admired friend , Professor
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	; and he commends his subject to the most indifferent reader by a thousand modern touches , allusions , and comparisons with twentieth century conditions ; as in the striking chapter on '' Poverty , '' where , showing that a great race could be poverty - stricken and yet highly civilized , he says : `` We forget that they were more innocent of most of these -LSB- material blessings and comforts -RSB- than the up-country Greeks of to-day , or than most Englishmen were before the Industrial Revolution .

		It is easy to think away railways and telegraphs and gasworks and tea and advertisements and bananas .

		But we must peel off far more than this .

		We must imagine houses without drains , beds without sheets or springs , rooms as cold , or as hot , as the open air , meals that began and ended with pudding , and cities that boasted neither gentry nor millionaires .

		We must learn to tell the time without watches , to cross rivers without bridges , and seas without a compass , to fasten our clothes -LRB- or rather our two pieces of cloth -RRB- with two pins instead of rows of buttons , to wear our shoes or sandals without stock - ings , to warm ourselves over a pot of ashes , to judge open - air plays or lawsuits on a cold winter 's morning , to study poetry without books , geography without maps , and politics without newspapers .

		In a word , we must learn how to be civilized without being comfortable .

		Or rather we must learn to enjoy the society of people for whom comfort meant something very different from motor-cars and arm - chairs , who , although or because they lived plainly and austerely and sat at the table of life without expecting any dessert , saw more of the use and beauty and goodness of the few things which were vouchsafed them their minds , their bodies , and
Nature	ORGANIZATION	outside and around them . ''

		The book is not all condensed epigram , as might perhaps be inferred from the above extract ; but the author has not failed to impart a piquant flavor to everything statistics , constitutional developments , and lists of magistrates ; and he holds the reader 's attention and interest to the very end .

		William jamet * Boutroux has undertaken interpreted bv to interpret
William James	PERSON	to French a Frenchman , students of philosophy .

		His study of the great American is at once an appreciation and a version of
James	PERSON	's thought and personality .

		When brought back to the medium of the original , it impresses the English reader as peculiarly yet evasively foreign .

		The crisp and juicy phrases of
James	PERSON	are lacking , the gait of the thought fitted to an alien movement , and this despite the fact that
James	PERSON	had an intimate knowledge and sympathy with the Gallic procedure .

		M. Boutroux 's essay deserves to be judged for its service to French readers .

		For them it doubtless supplies an approach to the main features of
James	PERSON	's philosophy , adapted to their accustomed assimilation .

		The leading doc - trines are briefly presented : the persistent emphasis of the active principle in thought ; the concreteness of experience ; the pervasiveness of personality : the pragmatic criterion ; the legitimacy of the non - intellectual forms of apprehension ; the reaction from traditional philosophical systems ; the vitality of philosophy when brought to bear upon the issues of life .

		The transformation of the thought is a matter of the rendering ; bold pen-and-ink directness be - comes a water-color delicacy of stroke , that reveals identity of subject but feebly reflects the artist .

		It is James the philosopher rather than
James	PERSON	the psychologist that has appealed to foreign students ; and the same preference of interest t hat brought him fame and recognition in
France	LOCATION	appears in the interpretation of his thought for the French mind .

		The discrepancy is least apparent in the chapter on
James	PERSON	's pedagogy itself an un-Jamesian rubric , which well sets forth the intellectual maturing that to
James	PERSON	was an essential variety of experience and of profoundest influence upon the stamp of philoso - phies .

		These words furni > h ample apology for a series of lectures delivered in the
spring of 1910	DATE	, by Dr.
G. Baldwin Brown	PERSON	,
Watson Gordon	PERSON	Professor of Fine Art in the Uni - versity of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, now expanded into a volume entitled `` The Arts and Crafts of Our Teutonic Fore - fathers '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		The author recognizes two great divisions in the general history of the Arts in western
Europe	LOCATION	in the period between the decline of classical art and the establishment in the eleventh century of what is known as the Romanesque .

		The hitherto more neglected of these divisions has to do with the arts and crafts of the Teutons , a phase of esthetic activity differing from that of the
Mediter	PERSON	- ranean region in that it is essentially decorative rather than representative .

		It is to a very small extent monumental , but largely applied to purposes of personal use and adornment , to `` the apparatus of useful or pleasing things with which men have in all ages equipped their daily life . ''

		The author calls attention to the fact that a part of the exhibits in public museums with which students of archaeology and historic ornament are familiar , such as `` Tomb Furniture , '' consists of things `` originally concealed as treasure deposits by those who expected one day to recover them . ''

		These furnish the most valuable objects of study , because of their rarity , costliness , and variety .

		They belong to the period of the Teutonic migrations , beginning with the
Marcoman	PERSON	- nic War in the region north of the
Danube	LOCATION	, about A.D. 170 , and extending to the year 800 , when the Empire of Charlemagne became technically Unman .

		THE DIAI , 175 Professor
Brown	PERSON	's study of this rich material is complete and scholarly , and is intended to exploit an original Northern art whose most characteristic ex - pression consists of zoOmorphic decoration , and the combination of animal motives with interlaced rib - bons or straps , which in its later form is called Celtic .

		He explains , however , that `` originality in art does not necessarily depend upon invention , but on the extent to which the borrowed or inherited suggestion can be developed into some new and striking con - tribution to the artistic treasures of mankind . ''

		The book presents a new point of view in art history , and introduces the reader to an entirely new field of study .

		The only fault to be found with it is that the half-tone illustrations are too small to present the subjects adequately .

		imprestiont Not cat hedrals or museums or pal - of European aces , not ruined castles or sublime travel .

		scenery , not the places starred in the guide-books and conscientiously visited by the determined tourist , form the subject of the late Per - cival
Pollard	PERSON	's '' Vagabond Journeys '' -LRB- Neale -RRB- , but rather the oddities and whimsicalities of the people he has familiarly moved among in his lifelong roam - ing from country to country .

		The subjective ele - ment , the impressions of the writer , will be found emphasized on every page , with little or nothing of prosaic fact or mere objective detail .

		`` The reader need not be afraid , '' considerately announces the author in his preface , '' that either facts or dogmatic infliction of opinion will be forced upon him .

		Here are simply the impressions of one individual , a few random excursions with a whimsical temper . ''

		In this spirit he favors us with some passing impres - sions , curious indeed and sometimes surprising , of
Florence	LOCATION	,
Munich	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	,
Berlin	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and '' a typical cure resort , '' with a brief glimpse of
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		Among the countless snap-shots that his pages con - tain , here is one of the travelling American college professor : `` Our friend , the professor , approaches the voyage with all the pomp and circumstance that he is sure his position entitles him to .

		Is there a place in the dining-saloon more choice than another ?

		He files his claim for it , waving close to the purser 's nose his scholarly credentials and his whiskers . ''

		How far the portrait is lifelike the reader is at lib - erty to decide for himself .

		Berlin Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	finds to be at once '' more fierce '' than
Boston	LOCATION	in the pursuit of culture , and more determinedly dissolute than
Paris	LOCATION	in nocturnal amusements .

		His researches , it will be perceived , have a generous amplitude of range .

		For sprightliness and verve , and for variety of vivid impressions , few books of travel can be named in the same breath with these astonishing '' Vagabond Journeys . ''

		Primitive justice T .

		he lawlessness of frontier mining in early life has never received a more vivid presentation at the historian 's hands than in Mr.
Nathaniel Pitt Langford	PERSON	's `` Vigilante Days and Ways '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , wherein is most graphically depicted the painful struggle of
Montana	LOCATION	and
Idaho	LOCATION	, fifty years ago , out of turbulent lawless - ness into order and quiet .

		The writer was an active participant in this rude conflict , and what he has to say about the vigilance committees of the period , and about the desperate characters whom they were organized to bring to summary justice , commands ready attention and makes a narrative more interest - ing than fiction .

		Beginning with the notorious
Henry Plummer	PERSON	and the rude state of society in
Lewiston	LOCATION	,
Montana	LOCATION	, where that adroit villain practised his ras - calities and organized his company of cut-throats and horse - thieves , the chronicle makes us acquainted with numerous other adepts in crime , such as
Cherokee Bob	ORGANIZATION	and
Charley Harper	PERSON	and
Boone Helm	PERSON	, and leads us through a half hundred chapters of breathless inci - dent to the final establishment of that peace and order which the author regards as most gratifying evidence of the effectiveness of the punitive meth - ods adopted .

		`` Equal in degree , '' he maintains in glowing language at the close of his book , '' to the sacrifices made by the brave soldiers of the war who saved our Republic , were the deeds of those who saved
Montana	LOCATION	from rapine and slaughter .

		Like them , the graves of the dead should be crowned with flowers , and the pathway of the living be brightened with the rewards of a grateful people . ''

		No reader will regret that the writer yielded to the temptation facetiously referred to by him in this quotation from Cervantes : '' One of the chief temptations of the Devil is that he can persuade a man that he can write a book , by which he can achieve both wealth and fame . ''

		The volume is well illustrated , well printed , and has a useful index .

		Near views The g litter and P m P f ro y al ^ d of pomp and imperial courts , the spectacle of pageantry .

		haughty nobility doing homage to its sovereign , and all the attendant proud parade and solemn circumstance , have captivated the fancy of the anonymous writer of '' Intimacies of Court and Society '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- , and her detailed account of diplo - matic life , as seen and participated in for many years by the wife of an American diplomat , will appeal to those numerous readers to whose view the distance of European court life lends an unfailing enchant - ment .

		Also there is the amusement of trying to fol - low the few personal clues given by this '' widow of an American diplomat '' to her proper identification .

		Her narrative is mostly confined to the events of her later '' unofficial days , '' as she calls them , when she felt greater freedom in ordering her ways and choosing from among the invitations extended to her by the titled friends of earlier times .

		Thus the reader is introduced to the courts and the fashionable society of the principal European capitals , and sees in a near view and under new lights a number of the mighty ones of the earth .

		By one monarch , however , the writer failed to feel herself overawed or even impressed .

		The Czar of
Russia	LOCATION	, as seen at his coronation , `` produced in himself no illusion of royalty such as may impress and thrill even the 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1	DATE	, most democratic when face to face with a king who is really kingly .

		His narrow forehead and receding chin , visible even behind the beard , spoke little of intelligence and nothing of power ; while the insig - nificance of his small form was emphasized beside the tall men of hia family , splendid-looking fellows , all over six feet '' The book is written in a rapid and not unattractive style , even though without claim to any particular literary merit , and is well illustrated .

Henri Bernstein	PERSON	came near to being read out of the German party on account of the ideas expressed in his '' Evolutionary Socialism , '' a criticism of some of the doctrines of

		Mr.
John Spargo	PERSON	's '' Sidelights on Contemporary Socialism '' -LRB-
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- , like the German work mentioned , is an argument for modernism in social - istic theory and practice .

		The book consists of three parts , the first and last dealing with
Karl Marx	PERSON	, and the other with the menace of '' anti-intellectualism '' to the party .

		Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	bears strongly upon the human and poetical aspects of
Marx	PERSON	's personality , and urges his fellow Socialists to regard him , not primarily as the author of ''
Das Kapital	PERSON	, '' but as the personal leader and far-seeing tactician .

		He admits that many of the Marxian economic doctrines have been overthrown , and that others have been so per - verted by the Socialists themselves that they now do more harm than good to the movement .

		The chap - ter on anti-intellectualism the demand that all but actual proletarians should be excluded from the party is as strong a denunciation of demagogism as the most conservative could wish to read .

		If we are `` in for '' Socialism , let us hope that the movement will permit such men as Mr.

		It is true , there is a possibility that she was something more than a mis - tress to the young prince with whom her name is associated .

		This question and many others puzzle the student of the scanty records of her life , nor does her present biographer undertake to answer them with any degree of certainty .

		The fact of having seen ' two or three letters written by her to her mother and a sampler worked by her at school '' was mainly instru - mental in causing this new account of
Hannah Light	PERSON	- foot to be written .

		Unfortunately the owner of the letters refuses to allow their publication or even to permit the biographer a second reading of them ; therefore it is only a vague impression of their char - actor and contents that can now be contributed as the new and first-hand element in this rehearsal of tlu - fair
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	's oft-told tale .

		The book reveals a diligent study of a wide range of authorities , many of them but remotely pertinent to the subject in hand , and an active exercise of sympathetic imagination .

		But the writer acknowledges at the end : '' I have written her story for love of her , and hope someone else will write her history , if I may not . ''

		One may devour the book quickly it is light reading and suffer no indigestion ; and yet one is sure to long afresh for critical `` studies '' that really indicate reflection and intellectual force .

		The chief idea that runs through the book is that
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	has undergone a desirable evolution and is still changing his point of view .

		This idea is elaborated by a survey of his poems , plays , and essays , rather than by a study of his life and temper .

		Of '' The Blue Bird , '' his most conspicuous popular success , Mr.

		`` Readings in American History '' is the title given to two small source-booklets , edited by Mr.
Edgar W. Ames	PERSON	, and published by the
Charles E. Merrill Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They differ from most books of this kind by being made up of selections of considerable length .

		Thus , the first volume includes only four extracts :
John Smith	PERSON	's '' True Relation , ''
Juet	PERSON	's account of the discovery of the
Hudson	LOCATION	,
Bradford	PERSON	's '' Plimouth Plantation , '' and Gov - ernor
Hutchinson	PERSON	on `` The Destruction of the Tea . ''

		In the second volume we find the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	, Lincoln 's most famous writings ,
Seward	ORGANIZATION	's Speech on
Alaska	LOCATION	, and the autobiography of
Peter Cooper	PERSON	.

		These are capital little books , and may be warmly commended to teachers of American history .

		A long and powerful poem by Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	, entitled '' The Widow in the Bye Street , '' is the princi - pal feature of '' The English Review '' for
February	DATE	.

		Mr.
Charles Whibley	PERSON	, author of '' A Book of
Scoun	PERSON	- drels , '' '' Literary Portraits , '' etc. , will publish shortly through
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	two new volumes of essays entitled '' Studies in Frankness '' and '' The Pageantry of Life . ''

		Two new biographies of
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	are soon to appear in
England	LOCATION	.

		One of these , written by Mr.
Herbert Jenkins	PERSON	, will be issued by the descendant of Borrow 's original publisher ,
John Murray	PERSON	; the other is the work of Mr.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	.

		The hitherto unpublished novel by
H. de Balzac	ORGANIZATION	, re - cently discovered in
Paris	LOCATION	, will be published at once by
Messrs. Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	under the title , '' Love in a Mask . ''

		The same publishers also announce `` Lady Eleanor : Lawbreaker , '' a novel by Mr.
Robert Barr	PERSON	; and ''
Betty Moore	PERSON	's Journal , '' by Mrs.
Mabel D. Corry	PERSON	.

		The attention of historical students is directed to the fact that competition is open this year for the

J. C. Hemmeon	PERSON	of
McGill University	ORGANIZATION	.

		In addition to an account of the development and present organization of the postal department of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the book includes a discussion of the parcels post , the telegraph and telephone system , and similar subjects . ''

		The People 's Books , '' a sixpenny series of original contributions by authoritative writers on science , phil - osophy , history , economics , and literature , is announced by Messrs.
Jack	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	. ''

		Shakespeare , '' by Pro- fessor
C. H. Herford	PERSON	; `` Dante , '' by Mr.
A. G. Ferrers Howell	PERSON	; '' Heredity , '' by Mr.
J. A. S. Watson	PERSON	; ''
Berg	PERSON	- son and the Philosophy of Change , '' by Mr.
H. Wildon Carr	PERSON	; and `` Ethics , '' by
Canon Hastings Rashdall	ORGANIZATION	, will be among the early volumes .

		The preparation of the late
Henry Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	's biography , a book that ought to contain much highly entertaining reading , has been assigned by his executors to Mr.
Labouchere	PERSON	's nephew , Mr.
Algar Thorold	PERSON	, who requests that any letters likely to be of service in writ - ing the life be sent to
T. Hart-Davies	PERSON	,
Esq.	LOCATION	, care of '' Truth , '' Carteret Street ,
Westminster	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	.

		All papers sent in will be properly cared for , and will be returned in due course if desired .

		A Centenary Edition of

March 1	DATE	, seven hundred and fifty sets .

		It is expected that Volumes 1 and 2 will be ready in
May	DATE	, the subsequent volumes following at short intervals so as to be completed in the Centenary year .

		Those interested in the establishment of public libra - ries and compelled , as is commonly the case , to figure pretty closely the various items of expense , will find valuable information and suggestions in '' A Normal Library Budget and its Units of Expense , '' a paper read at a recent meeting of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	librarians by Mr.
O. K. Howard Thomson	PERSON	, of the
James V. Brown	PERSON	Library at
Williamsport	LOCATION	.

		The paper is printed in the current issue of ''
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Library Notes . ''

		Some time ago a biography of
Jane Austen	PERSON	by
Canon Beeching	ORGANIZATION	was announced to appear in Messrs.
Mac	PERSON	- mi Han 's English Men of Letters '' series .


Canon Beeching	ORGANIZATION	has been obliged to abandon the volume , and it has now been entrusted to Dr.
Warre Cornish	PERSON	, the Vice-Provost of
Eton	LOCATION	, author of a volume of '' Essays on Poets and Poetry . ''

		Up to the present the only women who have been given a place in the '' English Men of Letters '' series are
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Fanny Burney	PERSON	, and
Maria Edgeworth	PERSON	, though a biography of Mrs. Gas - kell , by Mr.
Clement Shorter	PERSON	, has been announced .

		Miss
Emily Lawless	PERSON	is the only woman who has contributed a volume that on
Maria Edgeworth	PERSON	to the series .

		The
Jersey City Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, one of the compara - tively few public libraries which make a practice of pub - lishing from time to time monographs of more than local or ephemeral interest , has contributed to the
Dickens	PERSON	centennial literature , already rather abundant , a pam - phlet on the life and writings of that novelist .

		The sig - nificant facts of his biography are briefly stated , and a chronological and descriptive list of his works is added .

		From the
Brooklyn Public Library	ORGANIZATION	there comes a handy '' List of Books and of References to Periodicals in the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	Public Library '' on the subject of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	.

		It is uniform in style and excellence with simi - lar bibliographies already issued by that library .

		In connection with the
Dickens Centenary , Messrs. Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	are preparing to bring out next month , in their series of limited Riverside Press Editions , ''
Charles Dickens	PERSON	: His Life and Works , '' by the dis - tinguished American writer and critic ,
Edward Percy Whipple	PERSON	.

		Forty years ago Mr.
Whipple	PERSON	prepared a series of Introductions for a notable edition of the novel - ist 's works .

		These Introductions have hitherto been held strictly as an integral part of that and of a succeed - ing edition ; but now , in order that they may be more fully appreciated , they have been collected in two vol - umes , to be issued with an autobiographical and appre - ciative introduction on Whipple by Mr.
Arlo Bates	PERSON	.

		The
Bromley	PERSON	lecturer at
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	this year will be Mr.
A. Maurice Low	PERSON	, author of '' The American People . ''

		The
Bromley	PERSON	lectureship was endowed in
1900	DATE	by Mrs.
Isaac H. Bromley	PERSON	as a memorial to her husband , a member of the class of

Pollard	PERSON	, American letters -LRB- world literature , in fact ! -RRB-

		sustained a loss that could not be greater .

		Notable as were his achievements , they were but the shadows cast by a powerful figure advancing to the rescue of the literature of the English language , step by step , fighting like an avenging God .

		He was easily the greatest among the younger American authors .

		As a critic he had no superior in any land . ''

		Their Day in Court '' was published somewhat more than a year ago ; '' Vagabond Journeys '' was published the day of Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	's funeral .

		In these two books his genius is best shown .

		Mr.
Thomas Seccombe	PERSON	, in The Weekly Graphic -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- : '' He has kept me alive and awake aa few American critics since
Lowell	PERSON	have done ... A clever and stimulating book ... Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	, like
Will Wimble	PERSON	, is a connoisseur of the lash ... Blazing in eulogy or knee-deep in slaughter , Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	is con - summate ... Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	's severity on the literary conscience of the man who knows how to write , and on the literary critics of
America	LOCATION	in general , appals me .

		... ''
Boston	LOCATION	Transcript : '' For his outspokenness he deserves the sincerest thanks . ''

		St.
Louis	PERSON	Post-Dispatch : `` Like Nordau , the author has the whole field under consideration at his fingers ' tips ... He does not merely condemn .

		He quotes , thus giving those he censures or indicts a hearing in their own defense . ''

		Mr.
Frank Powell	PERSON	, in Vanity Fair -LRB-
London	LOCATION	-RRB- : `` A book about books which is as fascinating as a novel , which carries the imprint of a big personality ; a book which is humorous , fresh , and unconventional ; which , further , is all for the truth and the ' damns ' of life . ''


Signor R. Nobili	PERSON	, in La Nazione -LRB-
Florence	LOCATION	-RRB- : `` This is not merely a destructive work : it aims to recon - struct , and bring to light true worth .

		... Of the success of the book we can judge from the stir it has caused everywhere . ''

		San Jose * Times : '' The most brilliant volume of literary criticism published in the hut ten years . ''

		Mr.
Charles Nirdlinger	PERSON	: `` A book of surprises , ingenuous and often audacious ones as always happens when a man who is at once expert , candid , and brilliant declares himself ... Much too readable for a book of its kind ; anything so witty , spirited and independent will not be deemed to conform to the rules of the game . ''


London	LOCATION	Academy : `` Quite the moat remarkable and honestly intentioned < book that has come out of
America	LOCATION	for many a long day . ''


Mons	LOCATION	.

		G. Saint-Aubin : `` The foremost critic of the
United States	LOCATION	,
Peroival Pollard	PERSON	, does not hesitate to declare that mediocrity dominates .

		Union Square The Neale Publishing Company
New York	LOCATION	VAGABOND JOURNEYS The Human Comedy at Home and Abroad By
PERCIVAL POLLARD	PERSON	rPHIS volume does not pander so much to the needs of travellers as to their sense of humor .

		Its most ironic passages are made at the typical Anglo-Saxon tourists .

		We all like fun made of our neighbors ; it is not in human nature to feel that we ourselves are satirised ; no one makes fun of us .

		Yet for individual ironic comment on our own people you will search long in our current literature of travel .

		The book does not profess to inform .

		It does not direct us how to get there ; what luggage to take ; nor instruct us as to what must be seen , what avoided .

		All such general orders , thinks Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	, surely affect only those that admit themselves without identity of their own the members of the rabble .

		This book is addressed to individuals .

		It is the whimsical record of an individual 's adventures along the primrose path of entertainment .

		The book 's range of comparisons , between
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	and
New York	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	and
Washington	LOCATION	, will give the student of our central modern civilisation plenty of food for thought .

		Cooking and feminine fashions in
Paris	LOCATION	; sports and masculine fashions in
London	LOCATION	; open - air theatres in
Switzerland	LOCATION	and the
Rhine	LOCATION	country ; the pursuit of ancient art in
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Florence	LOCATION	, and of modern art in
Munich	LOCATION	; the pursuit of culture in
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	, such matters as these engage the author , and should entertain the reader .

		Entertainment is the essential quality in the book .

		The reader may be lured into reading opinions con - trary to his own ; may be piqued by prejudices that he abhors ; but he is little likely to drop the book for its dullness .

		Sophisticated travellers will , it is believed , be continually amused by these passages .

		Inno - cents abroad , if resentful at first of an apparent unconcern for their welfare , will find , as they close the book , that they have unconsciously absorbed knowledge , and that they have begun to emerge from provincials into citizens of the world .

		Baltimore Sun : '' ... you will find the volume a never-ending delight , one to read and place upon the shelves , to take down and re-read again when the vision of Piccadilly Circus at night flashes across your mind , or the swarming Avenue de 1 ` Opera in all its glittering glory .

		In brief , ' Vagabond Journeys ' is one of the best things Mr.
Pollard	PERSON	ever did . ''

		Norfolk Virginian-Pilot and Landmark : `` A book which Maupassant might have written had he been less sensuous and sensual ; which
Washington	LOCATION	Irving would have wished he had written , but which many admirers of < Travels by an American Clergyman ' will turn from in disgust as void of historical , geographical , or statistical information . ''

		THE MAGAZINE GIRL .

		This is the literary era of the wax doll with the brick-dust complexion .

		She stares at us from every news-stand .

		No self-respecting magazine ventures to issue forth without her picture on its cover .

		Head or bust or full length ; walking , golf - ing , motoring ; rampant , couchant , or regardant , she is the heraldic emblem under which the cohorts of periodicals charge to victory .

		Eighty or a hundred years ago there was a somewhat similar putting-forth of feminine charms in the `` Books of Beauty , '' `` Annuals , '' and `` Keepsakes '' of that period .

		Elegance was the note then , as prettiness is now .

		The duchesses were elegant in their boudoirs ; the heroines of the poets were elegant against their backgrounds of storm or sunshine ; the wives of brigands were elegant in their mountain caves ; even the bare-legged peasant women tending their flocks , or reaping a ten-acre field with a twelve-inch sickle , were prevailingly elegant .

		We confess that we have a weakness both for the older female -LRB- one would not dare to call her woman -RRB- of the '' Annuals , '' and the newer Girl of the Magazines .

		Of course both are dolls , and of the latter it may be said that the paint on her face has sunken in and circulates in her veins .

		If she were stabbed with one of her own hat-pins she would hardly exude a drop of real blood .

		But she is pretty ; and her vogue tes - tifies to the undying ideality of the race , its craving for beauty and romance `` the desire of the moth for the star , '' and so forth .

		That is it !

		For thirty years we have been wandering in the desert of realism .

		Our novel - ists have swathed us in sand , and burned us with pitiless light .

		We have starved and been athirst ; we have panted for the shadow of a great rock or the softening veil of trees or mist .

		Now and then we have stumbled into an oasis , and we have fortunately been fed with manna from abroad .

		Oh , the horror of the retro - spect !

		the gaunt sordid spectacle of life on
New England	LOCATION	or
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	farms or on the prairies of the
West	LOCATION	; the descent into the In - ferno of
New York	LOCATION	slums ; the ever-recurring visions of middle-class life in factory and shop and mansion .

		It has been an orgy of the ordi - nary , a delirium of dulness , an apotheosis of the commonplace .

		So we do well to welcome the
Magazine Girl	ORGANIZATION	, 2lJ THE DIAL -LSB-
March 1G	DATE	, with all the literary output which she repre - sents .

		She does not work ; she is the creature of the leisure and opportunity and affluence which most of us covet .

		And
Solomon	PERSON	was cer - tainly not arrayed like her .

		Give her time and she will develop into a genuine heroine .

		Her eyes will deepen with other emotions than desire for an automobile ride or a dinner at
Sherry 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Her lips , which now discourse the slang of the studio or of the streets , will utter poetic phrases .

		She may attain to the wit of
Rosalind	PERSON	, the tender - ness of
Imogen	PERSON	, the gentle austerity of
Isabella	LOCATION	.

		She is at least on the right way .

		She sees the Promised Land on the edge of the desert .

		The flowery meadows of the Age of Gold , which always open to the purview of every great liter - ary epoch , are in sight .

		We have said that the new Magazine Girl does not work , and we must explain this apparent blasphemy against current ideas .

		Every sane human being wants to exercise his or her muscles and mind , wants to produce something , the labor of hands or brain , to justify existence .

		Health and sanity are only retainable on those terms .

		But there is a vast difference between voluntary labor , however extreme , labor done with pleasure and delight , and uncongenial work done at the command of a superior or at the bidding of necessity .

		Modern industrialism , we should say , is responsible for modern realism in literature .

		By its dreary uniformity and monotony it stunts body and soul alike , and makes its victims un - fit either to serve as models for great art or to enjoy the art when done .

		What is it that irre - sistibly attracts the soul of mankind to warfare ?

		Is it not its freedom and variety of action , its culminating excitement of battle ?

		War is an intoxication , a play , for which men are willing to lose their lives .

		Imaginative literature is a less brutal form of intoxication , a less danger - ous kind of play .

		And as anything is praise - worthy which brings back this primal , central conception of literature , we think the
Magazine Girl	ORGANIZATION	deserves credit .

		If play is the main purpose of imaginative literature , we are for the rigor of the game .

		The world is always loth to believe that there is any distinction between life and literature , that there is an unspanned gap between the two .

		Like children , it demands of every story , '' Is this true ? ''

		Literature is the profoundest kind of truth ; but it is far enough from being fact .

		Take the mere mechanical aspect of the case .

		Here you have an oblong volume wherein some hundreds of thousands of black marks on white paper are supposed to represent the solid earth and the superincumbent sky and the procession of life between them .

		Nay , this book which can be read in a few hours pretends to give the life history of some score or two of human be - ings , from their cradles to their graves .

		Obvi - ously we are a far way from reality , much further off than in painting or sculpture , which do give some palpable simulacrum of rxi ^ t. - m .

		The piece of literature cxi > ts only in the idea of the person who creates it , and in the minds of the people who read it .

		There are three main methods by which liter - ary creations may be effected .

		The first is the method of pure idealism .

		A richly endowed mind may draw from the cave of his own being the figures and scenes of a phantasmal world .

		He may deck and adorn it with the treasures of his own feelings and fancies , and spread over it a light that never was on sea or land .

		Some promptings from without he must have : he takes the names of visible persons and things , but he fills them out from his own stock of imagina - tions .

		Perhaps it is from some state of pre - existence that he acquires a notion of real exist - ence .

		Or perhaps it is the pollen from the poets of the past which impregnates and makes fruitful the buds and blossoms latent in his own mind .

		It is needless to say that in the hands of men entirely great this method is capable of tremendous successes .

		All poets follow it to a greater or less extent .

		Probably the best half of the greatest creations of literature are of this dream substance .

		It is doubtful whether human nature ever quite equals , either in good or evil , the supreme figures of fiction and poetry .

		Schil - ler and
Shelley	PERSON	are the modern types of creators who have little hold on real life . ''

		Does this remind you of Hellas ? ''

		said
Trelawney	PERSON	to
Shel	PERSON	- ley when they were viewing some Italian town .

		`` No , but it does of Hell , '' answered the poet .

		He was indignant that life should disturb and belie his dream .

		The weakness of the idealistic method is that it becomes too wire-spun , it becomes a convention .

		It needs every now and then to be subjected to the rude shock of reality : its aerial visions need to be reborn out of earth , as the clouds are reborn out of the sea .

		The second method is that of realism or nat - uralism .

		An author sets himself to study a certain part or section of the life about him .

		He vivisects , dissects , analyzes , and photographs .

		He sets his models in a glass case and studies them from every point of view .

		He becomes a prodigy of notes , a marvel of memoranda .

		But in the first place , any man 's life is too short to exhaust all the possibilities of any piece of exist -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE D1AJL 217 ence , and the patience of readers would balk at any true , full record .

		In the second place , per - spective and relation are lost , and what was intended to be extra true becomes absurdly false .

		In the third place , the volatile and essen - tial spirit of life , which is the only thing really worth while in literature , flies such close , mi - nute investigation .

		The thing was vital , and now it is a caput mortuum .

		Nevertheless , in all times the absolute facing of facts and the sin - cere attempt to record them has resulted in great literature .

		Aristophanes and Euripides , in part , Juvenal and Petronius ,
Rabelais	PERSON	and the authors of the
Beast Fabliaux	LOCATION	and Satires of the Middle Ages , Chaucer and Swift and
Burns	PERSON	, are mas - ters of the real and natural .

		But perhaps real - ism has been best realized by the great idealists , by
Homer	ORGANIZATION	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		The third creative method is that of abstrac - tion .

		It is really a combination of the other two , neither of them being pushed to excess .

		An author views the world , as it were , by glimpses and glances .

		He takes enough from it to fill out his preconceived idea .

		He concentrates and condenses the things and persons of the world , and breathes his own breath into his creations .

		He builds up figures out of many models , or from a mere suggestion provided by one .

		He gives us the impression of true life while we know very well that no such life ever existed .

		If the originals of Hamlet or Falstaff or
Rosalind	PERSON	, Mr.
Shandy	PERSON	or My Uncle Toby , the Master of
Ravenswood	LOCATION	or Captain Dalgetty ,
Micawber	LOCATION	,
Pecksniff	PERSON	, or Mrs.
Gamp	PERSON	, could be confronted with their literary doubles , we should see how immeasurably distant and different the two sets of personages were , how much has been left out of the real and how much has been put into the imaginary beings .

		Everything seems to be there , but everything has suffered a sea-change .

		What is intolerable in life , because of wicked - ness , foulness , or dulness , becomes not only tolerable but delightful in literature .

		Folly has the effect of wit , and weakness of power .

		To give us this brief abstraction and transformation of life is the greatest work of genius .

		But we must return to our theme and make an application of our discourse .

		Literature in
America	LOCATION	began with pure idealism .

		Poe ,
Emer	PERSON	- son ,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	,
Bryant	PERSON	,
Cooper	PERSON	, and nearly all our first great flight of writers , built from the idea whether innate in their own natures or derived from
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Then came the men of fact , the students of contemporary life .

		They came in their multitude , men and women , and drove the idealists , thinkers , poets , from the field .

		We are now far enough from them partially to adjudge their product , and it certainly bears no comparison with the first vintage of our wits .

		Just at present a new sap seems to be rising in our midst .

		There seems to be the promise of a
Spring	DATE	, and that is why we pitch upon the
Magazine Girl	ORGANIZATION	as a symbol of hope .

		She has a touch of poetry and idealism in her , and is , we hope , the prelude to a rich harvest of the wine of literature .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL C OMMENT .

		ALL-THE-YEAB-ROUND PUBLISHING , which has been , for obvious good reasons , advocated by the
London	LOCATION	'' Book Monthly '' as an improvement on the present system of two breathlessly busy seasons alter - nating with two more or less idle ones
autumn	DATE	and
spring	DATE	being the rush periods , midwinter and mid -
summer	DATE	the least active ones is made the subject of a noteworthy `` symposium '' of publishers , book - sellers , and librarians in the
February	DATE	issue of that magazine .

		Far from treating the proposal after the scornful fashion of
Goldsmith	ORGANIZATION	's Mr.
Fudge	PERSON	-LRB- in `` The Citizen of the World '' -RRB- who maintained that `` books have their time as well as cucumbers , '' the gentlemen called upon for an expression of opinion have discussed the matter seriously and intelligently in many instances , it is true , without much encour - agement for the proposed change , but in not a few with an emphatic advocacy of such change .

		Mr.
John Lane	PERSON	not only writes sympathetically , but even asserts that some of his own most successful publish - ing has been done at the so-called dull times of the year , at the end of
July	DATE	, the beginning of
August	DATE	, and the middle of
January	DATE	.

		Some of the contri - butors to the discussion aver that even now there is practically no slack season in the book world that there is always something doing ; others doubt the feasibility of a change ; and nearly all recognize that the booksellers even more than the book-publishers are responsible for the existing order .

		The book - sellers , of course , throw the blame -LRB- so to call it -RRB- back on the bookbuyers .

		Nevertheless , it has been noted that the public will buy novels and other light litera - ture as readily in
summer	DATE	as in winter .

		Why not , then , even things up by distributing the books of entertainment over the whole year , and leave the winter sacred to science , to history , to philosophy , and their like ?

		Some such equalization is certainly desired by literary journals and book-reviewers , while all who have the handling of books in the way of business would find themselves benefitted by the change .

		... MB .

		HOWELLS 'S SEVENTY-FIFTH BIBTHDAY , the first of this month , called forth many tributes of en - thusiastic admiration , high respect , and warm affec - tion .

		Amid the general chorus of congratulation and good wishes there have appeared numerous ap -
21	DATE	* THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, preciative comments on his work as an author , from men and women whose words carry weight .

		Nat urally enough it is the unapproachable and all but faultless literary style of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	that these admirers of his delight to dwell upon , after doing justice to the charm of the man as self-revealed in his writings , and to the genius displayed in his won - derful pictures of American life and character .

		Indeed , it is a never-ceasing marvel to note the inev - itable ease and precision and lucidity , the grace and finish and geniality , of his every utterance .

		The facility and felicity of it all , the naturalness and seeming unstudiedness , deceive the unwary reader and tempt him to imagine that he too could have written those smooth and polished periods if the im - pulse had seized him .

		The ease of the true artist , however , is a thing concerning whose .

		acquisition probably the artist himself could tell us a good deal that we had never suspected .

		That Mr.
Howells	PERSON	may continue to practise his art a good number of years still , is a hope that can not seem extravagant to anyone who recalls the prolonged activity of the ever-youthful Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	, Colonel
Higginson	PERSON	, and
John Bigelow	PERSON	.

		A LEGISLATIVE REFERENCE DEPARTMENT FOR THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS is now advocated by
Representative Nelson of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, and he has in - troduced a bill to establish such department The project has had a thorough airing , and speakers in its favor , including Ambassador
Bryce	PERSON	, Mr.
Herbert Putnam	PERSON	, Dr.
McCarthy	PERSON	of the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	legisla - tive reference bureau , Speaker
Clark	PERSON	, and others , have sufficiently demonstrated the need of expert assistance such as the proposed department would furnish to our national legislators in the proper and intelligent framing of laws .

		Inasmuch as already fourteen states and many cities have established bureaus of this sort , and the movement is rapidly gathering further impetus , no detailed explanation of the beneficent functions of the proposed bureau should be needed to convince the intelligent ob - server of its desirability at
Washington	LOCATION	.

		Neverthe - less one congressman , in the hearing before the
Committee on Library	ORGANIZATION	, felt called upon to object to its establishment , on the ground that every repre - sentative or senator with a bill to introduce ought in person to go through all the drudgery of its draughting , collecting his data and looking up the already existing statutes in the same field , in order to be able to speak with understanding in behalf of his bill when he presents it for legislative action .

		What , pray , is a man sent to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	for , if not for just such work ?

		asks the objector , apparently forgetful that this an age of specialization .

		AN UNWRITTEN CHAPTER IN
HAWTHORNE	LOCATION	'S LIFE unwritten , that is , in all its details has to do with his unceremonious removal , in
1849	DATE	, from the posi - tion of surveyor of customs of the port of Salem , and with the indignant remonstrance which this ruthless application of the spoils system called forth from some of his friends .

		The
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	ha asked the
Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION	to transfer to the library 's keeping a file of papers relating to Haw - thorne 's appointment ami n-movul .

		Among letters urging the appointment are those written by
George Bancroft	PERSON	and
Franklin Pierce	PERSON	, while among those protesting against the removal arc l.-tt .

		- r - from
Rufua Cboato	ORGANIZATION	and
Horace Mann	PERSON	.

		Another interesting paper is a memorial from certain of the Whigs of Salem setting forth the reasons why , in their opinion , a discharge of Democratic officials at the customs house in favor of Whigs was a thing to be desired .

		That this desirable change was presently effect - il need not surprise anyone .

		The official papers in the case have not been preserved in their entirety , but a sufficient number of interesting documents appear to be extant to furnish an authentic and significant record of this episode in the novelist 's life .

		Already the
Essex Institute	ORGANIZATION	at Salem has procured photo - graphic reproductions of these papers , and they are to be used in a work relating to
Hawthorne	LOCATION	now said to be in preparation at the hands of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	's secretary , Mr.
George Francis	PERSON	Dow .

		THE ENGLISH PROTEST AGAINST PERNICIOUS LITERATURE , as voiced by the editor of `` The Spec - tator , '' who recently acted as chief spokesman of a deputation before the Home Secretary , revives a wearisome discussion in which it is all but impos - sible to take part without incurring the charge of either prudishness or license .

		What constitutes im - morality in literature apart from the grossly inde - cent productions that the police already have power to suppress will always remain an open question as surely as that manners and customs and the cri - terions of propriety and impropriety will ever con - tinue to shift and vary from age to age and from country to country .

		The Home Secretary 's promise that the government would gravely consider the problem and deal with it energetically , was no more than might have been expected ; but what sensible person really expects or even desires the establish - ment in
England	LOCATION	of anything in the nature of an official censorship of printed matter ?

		However , we shall see what we shall see .

		Meanwhile , those who are greatly exercised on the subject , and who feel convinced that something ought to be done , will en - joy reading
Canon Rawnsley	ORGANIZATION	's vigorous assault on the purveyors of immoral literature , in the current number of '' The Hibbert Journal . ''

		THE LIBRARY REPORT AS LITERATURE that i 8 , as a contribution to the '' literature of power '' as distinguished from the `` literature of knowledge '' often and necessarily leaves something to be de - sired ; but not always .

		For instance , the poetical Mr.
Ballard	PERSON	, of
Pittsfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, has on at least one occasion accomplished the feat of putting his annual record of progress into smoothly-flowing verse ; and the
Visiting Committee of the Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	succeeded in imparting a very human quality to one section of a recent report of that institution , by means
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 219 of graphic and touching descriptions of life among the lowly lovers of books .

		And there are other instances .

		The
Enoch Pratt	PERSON	Free Library of
Balti	LOCATION	- more , as a very recent example , issues a `` Twenty - sixth Annual Report '' -LRB- from the pen of its head , Dr.
Bernard C. Steiner	PERSON	-RRB- which is something more than a shivering skeleton of statistics .

		It is clothed with flesh and pulses with life .

		The eye rests grate - fully on occasional apt quotations , as , for example , a tine passage from '' Instructions Concerning Erect - ing of a Library , '' by
Gabriel Naudd	PERSON	; and another from
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	; and still another from Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	; and one from
Hazlitt	PERSON	; and others besides .

		Nor does the human interest lan - guish for want of incidents from real life .

		Truly , there is more in this modest-looking blue-covered pamphlet than the casual observer would suspect , and far more than we can here do justice to .

		GOLD BRICKS OF THE BOOK-TRADE , the '' de luxe '' subscription books that cost perhaps a dollar or two a volume to manufacture , and that sell at ten or twenty times as much , form the subject of a recent sprightly article by Mr.
Robert Sterling	PERSON	Yard in the ''
Satur	PERSON	- day Evening Post . ''

		He casts no reflections on the ``
Houghton Mifflin-Scribner-Little Brown	PERSON	kind of limited editions , '' but mercilessly scores the manifest frauds which unscrupulous dealers unload on a too willing public .

		This is the way it is done : '' A little group of speculators will get up a set of books printed from old plates they 've bought somewhere here at a bargain ; hire some college professor or other generally at a good price , too to write an essay for an introduction ; reproduce in mere half-tone some fine old prints they 've bought at auction good things , maybe , and never used before ; get an artist of accomplishment to design a special title-page and cover the cover adapted from some fine old English or French binding and there you are ! ''

		Among the amusing incidents of the trade occurs the follow * ing : `` A few months ago a woman 's executors sued to recover on a set of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, ' specially printed for Mrs. Blank , ' for which she had paid an absolutely fabulous price on the strength of each volume hav - ing been ' signed by the author . ' ''

		Verily , a fatuous book-buyer and his money are soon parted .

		ONE VIEW OF LITERARY ART that is of interest in connection with Mr.
Labouchere	PERSON	's recent death is his assertion , in his early journalistic days : `` It has always appeared to me that the making of an art -LSB- article -RSB- requires two persons , one to write it , the other to cut it down and generally to cut out what the first man most admires . ''

		Another saying of his , quoted , with the foregoing , by a former associate of
Labouchere	ORGANIZATION	's , and printed in the
London	LOCATION	'' Truth , '' reminds one of
Walter Scott	PERSON	's fine indifference as to what may or may not have flowed from his pen .

		When apologies had been offered for cutting out a part of the brilliant journalist 's matter , he wrote back : '' You need not sentimentalize about my stuff .

		I send it to you to do what you like with . ''

		And again : '' I am the only person , I believe , on the Press who does not care in the least whether his lucubrations do or do not appear in print . ''

		Probably his pecuniary independence had something to do with this careless attitude toward his articles , and this in turn may have contributed no little to the dash and freedom and scorn of consequences that characterized his style .

		It is not every editor that can indulge in the luxury of courting libel suits to the extent allowed himself by the founder and proprietor of '' Truth . ''

		A STATE-WIDE SPELLING MATCH soon to be held at the capital of
Missouri	LOCATION	owes its originating impulse , apparently , to the zealous activity of the
Macon County	LOCATION	best-spellers , who by the time this is in print will have spelled one another to the last ditch , leaving the sole survivor to champion the county in the state contest .

		Of course the local preliminary matches leading up to the county contest have been going on in spirited fashion for weeks , and the whole thing has been , in its way , a great educational event , recalling our good old
New England	LOCATION	spelling bees , intellectual tournaments unknown to those of the present gen - eration who are taught to read without learning the alphabet , and to spell without naming the letters .

		Alas , that this festive banquet of fun and philology should have become so nearly a thing of the past with us !

		But its revival in the
Mississippi	LOCATION	valley is a cheering sign , and not even the baleful activity of the reformed spellers , striving to bring all ortho - graphy down to .

		the dead level of a monotonous and characterless simplicity , shall prevent our taking heart of hope and looking forward to still further manifestations of popular attachment to the spelling and the spelling matches of our fathers .

		THE MAINTENANCE OF THE
NEW YORK	LOCATION	PUBLIC LIBRARY , the magnificent institution recently opened to general use and already having a record of nearly two million visitors , is calling for magnificent appro - priations from the city treasury .

		The estimated running expenses for the current year come within twenty thousand dollars of the half-million mark , and only seveny-four thousand has been set aside for books and binding .

		The librarian would like , and doubtless could make good use of , one hundred and fifty thousand a year for the purchase of books , and seventy-five thousand for binding .

		It is interesting to compare with these figures the
Boston	LOCATION	Public Li - brary 's annual expenditure of about three hundred and fifty thousand dollars , a seventh part of which goes for new books .

		But the mere physical im - mensity of the sister institution in
New York	LOCATION	, with its staff of nine hundred and twenty-seven members , makes a thousand dollars look very much , as the slang of the street might express it , `` like
thirty cents	MONEY	. ''

		Published at two shillings , under the ban of the official censor of stage produc - tions , it will be well within the reach of many who would not have felt able to buy the ticket , or two tickets , for such theatre seat or seats as self-respect and acoustic conditions demand .

		The piquant sauce of censorship , while it imparts relish to the dish , need not of course imply any injurious amount of spice .

		Perhaps the play in question contained some reference to the Deity , as it could hardly fail to , from its title , or otherwise transgressed the time-honored rules by which the presentability of British plays has been so arbitrarily determined .

		But certain cis-Atlantic demonstrations in connection with one of

		FRANCISCO FERRER AND THE CATHOLICS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL . -RRB-

		Since the appearance of my review of Mr.
William Archer	PERSON	's '' The Life , Trial , and Death of Francisco Fer - rer , '' in your issue of
January 16	DATE	last , I have received from Catholic sources two little volumes which are prob - ably of sufficient interest to warrant my calling atten - tion to them here .

		One is entitled `` Francisco Ferrer : Criminal Conspirator , '' and is the work of Rev.
John A Ryan	PERSON	of
St. Paul Seminary	ORGANIZATION	.

		It makes a careful analysis of Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's book in an attempt to show , from the information that the author himself furnishes , that
Ferrer	PERSON	received a fair trial and deserved death on the basis of the practice of the average civili/ed country Father Ryan lays no claim to first-hand knowledge of Ferrer in particular or of Spanish institutions in < ; eneral .

		The other volume , issued with a preface by Mr.
Paul Blakewell	PERSON	, of the
St. Louis	LOCATION	bar , is a collection and re - print of a series of English magazine articles by Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	maintains that tin - interna - tional outbreak at
Ferrer	ORGANIZATION	's death was a carefully-planned move in an international anti-Catholic conspiracy in which the press of the world is involved and of which Mr.
Archer	PERSON	's book was a detail , and calls the attention of Catholics to the recent establishment of an
International Press Agency	ORGANIZATION	under the control of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		This pamphlet bears the title '' A Conspiracy and Its Ageney . ''

		Father
Ryan	PERSON	's monograph is quiet and reasonable in tone , Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's violent and bitter .

		I infer that either may be secured by writing for it , the former to B. Herder , Publisher ,
St. Louis	LOCATION	, and the latter probably from Mr.
Blakewell	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's version seems to me brighter than most other renderings which have fallen under my eye , although pretty free in its rhymes .

		The last of the eight stanzas of his trans - lation runs in this wise : '' When sermon was ended To their businesH all wended ; The pikea to their thieving , The eels to good living ; The crab still goes crooked , The codfish is stupid .

		A POET AXD HIS CIRCLE .

		* `` When it is remembered that the letters pub - lished by Lord
Tennyson	PERSON	in the '' Life and Let - ters '' of his father were selected from more than forty thousand , and , further , that the poet 's wide circle of friends and correspondents included many of the most gifted men of his time , it will be seen that no lack of highly interesting material need embarrass the compiler of a volume supple - mentary to the biography .

		Rather , his embar - rassment will arise from an excess of material .

		``
Tennyson	PERSON	and his Friends , '' from the same hand that gave us the `` Life and Letters , '' is a full sheaf of memories and correspondence gleaned from the same general field that produced the larger work of fifteen years ago .

		Among the recollections put upon paper by those whose remembrance runs back to the mid - Victorian days of the poet 's prime , are to be especially noted the initial chapter , `` Recollections of my Early Life , '' written at her son 's request by
Emily	PERSON	,
Lady Tennyson	PERSON	, in
1896	DATE	; Mr.
Charles Tennyson	PERSON	's ac - count of the three
Tennyson	PERSON	brothers ; the paper on
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	and
Carlyle	PERSON	in their relations to
Tennyson	LOCATION	, by Dr.Warren of
Magdalen College	ORGANIZATION	; the reminiscences of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	contributed by the
Master of Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	; and Mr.
Arthur Coleridge	PERSON	's '' Fragmentary Notes of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's Talk . ''

		The book also contains the centennial addresses on the poet by Mr.
Arthur Sidgwick	PERSON	and the late Professor
Henry Butcher	PERSON	, and the `` Edinburgh Review '' article by the late Sir
Alfred Lyall	PERSON	on '' Tennyson : His Life and Work , '' written on the occasion of the ap - pearance of the biography .

		Among the numer - ous letters inserted or quoted from , those writ - ten by
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	to
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and mostly new to the reading public , deserve foremost mention .

		Others by
Frederick Tennyson	PERSON	are nearly as good , and some from
James Spedding	PERSON	are full of interest .

		Twenty-five of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's shorter poems , addressed to as many of his friends , are reprinted , as is also Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	's chapter on
Arthur Hallam	PERSON	from the ''
Horae Subsecivae	PERSON	, '' while an appendix contains some miscellaneous letters from unknown admirers of the poet , and other appropriate matter .

		The near views of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's relations and intimate friends which the book furnishes are hardly less welcome than the occasional passages touching on the poet ` sown personality and habits .

		* TENNYSON AN HIS FRIENDS .

		Edited by
Hallam	PERSON	,
Lord Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	.

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		One is glad to learn here something more about the '' strong , haughty , and passionate ''
Fred	PERSON	- erick
Tennyson	PERSON	of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's letters .

		There was in both men the same admirable sturdiness of independence , the same hatred of senseless conventionality , the same determination to live his life each in his own way .

		And in the case of each a sufficient fortune was inherited to make easily possible this unsocial but not neces - sarily unattractive mode of existence .

		From Mr.
Charles Tennyson	PERSON	's chapter on the
Tenny	PERSON	- son brothers we quote : '' But
Frederick	PERSON	was too much of a man of moods to care for society .

		He used to describe himself as a ` per - son of gloomy insignificance and unsocial monomania . '

		Society he dismissed contemptuously as ' Snookdom , ' and would liken it gruffly to a street row .

		The ' high - jinks of the high-nosed ' -LRB- to use another phrase of his -RRB- angered him , as did all persons ' who go about with well-cut trousers and ill-arranged ideas . ' ''

		As is well known to readers of the
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	letters , the
Woodbridge	PERSON	recluse could make no headway with
Browning	PERSON	's poetry , and in fact refused to acknowledge greatness in any con - temporary poet but
Tennyson	LOCATION	, whom however he held to have sadly declined from his earlier heroic manner .


Frederick Tennyson	PERSON	's attitude toward
Browning	PERSON	the poet was strikingly simi - lar , even though he delighted in
Browning	PERSON	the man .

		In a letter to a friend he wrote : '' What you say of
Browning	PERSON	's ' Ring and the Book ' I have no doubt is strictly applicable , however slash - ing .

		... I confess , however , that I have never had the courage to read the book .

		He is a great friend of mine ... But it does not follow that I should put up with obsolete horrors , and unrhythmical composition .

		What has come upon the world that it should take any metrical -LRB- ? -RRB-

		arrangement of facts for holy Poesy ?

		It has been my weakness to believe that the Fine Arts and Imaginative Literature should do something more than astonish us by tours deforce , black and white contrasts , outrageous inhumanities , or anything criminally sensa - tional , or merely intellectually potent . ''

		From the many passages on the poet
Tenny	PERSON	- son and his art , a few selections will be not out of place here .

		Speaking of his '' Crossing the Bar , '' he declared : '' They say I write so slowly .

		Well , that poem came to me in five minutes .

		Anyhow , under ten minutes . ''

		And afterward Lady
Tennyson	PERSON	confirmed what he had implied concerning his usual rate of composition .

		It was rapid rather than slow .

		In the chapter entitled `` Recollections of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, '' by the
Master of Trinity	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Dr.
Butler	PERSON	-RRB- , a significant reference to
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's feeling toward
Brown	PERSON	- ing , and also his admiration for
Wordsworth	PERSON	, arrests the attention . ''

		I noticed that he never spoke of
Wordsworth	PERSON	with - out marked reverence .

		Obviously , with his exquisite 2-2-2 THE DIAL -LSB-
March 16	DATE	, ear for choice words and rhythm , he must have ' been more sensitive than most men to the prosaic , bathetic side of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	; but 1 never heard him say a word implying that he felt this , whereas I have heard him qualify his admiration for
Robert Browning	PERSON	's geniu - > and his affection for his person by some allusion to the roughness of bis style .

		This , he thought , must lead to his being less read than he deserved in yean to come , and he evidently regretted it . ''

		A passage from Mrs.
Butler	PERSON	's journal of a visit to Farringford in
January , 1892	DATE	, gives instances of the poet 's well-known resentment of unjust criticism .

		She writes of a walk that she and her husband took with their host and his son .

		Montagu and he were in front ,
Hallam Tennyson	PERSON	and I behind .

		Montagu tells me how he was indignant with Z. for charging him with general plagiarism , in particular about Lactantius and other classics , ' of whom , ' he said , ' I have n't read a word . '

		Also , of taking from Sophocles , ' whom I never read since I was a young man ' ; and of owing bis meanings of the sea ' to
Horace	PERSON	's gementis litora Bospori .

		Some one charged him with having stolen the ' In Memoriam ' metre from some very old poet of whom he had never heard .

		He said , in answer to
Montagu	ORGANIZATION	's question , that the metres of both '
Maurice	PERSON	' and The Daisy ' were original .

		He had never written in the metre of
Grey	PERSON	's 4 Elegy , ' ex - cept epitaphs in
Westminster Abbey	LOCATION	.

		He admired the metre much , and thought the poem immortal ... He told me that his lines ' came to ' him ; he did not make them up , but that , when they had come , he wrote them down , and looked into them to see what they were like .

		... Then he said again , what I have heard him say before , that though a poet is born , be will not be much of a poet if he is not made too . ''

		Tennyson 's sensitiveness to criticism , as illus - trated in the foregoing , rather intensifies to us his human quality , and at the same time indi - cates an admirable modesty in the man .

		Had he been conscious of his true worth he would have seen that all these petty assaults , which seemed to him so vexatious , were really not worthy of notice and would weigh not the mil - lionth of a milligram in the balance against him .

		Other human traits come out in anecdotes told about him and by him .

		Among the stories of his
Cambridge	LOCATION	days occurs the following : `` A wine-party was going on in
Arthur Hallam	PERSON	's rooms in the
New Court	ORGANIZATION	, when enter angrily the Senior Dean ,
Tommy Thorp	PERSON	. '

		What is the meaning , Mr.
Hallam	PERSON	, of all this noise ? ' '

		I am very sorry , sir , ' said
Hallam	PERSON	, we had no idea we were making a noise . '

		Well , gentlemen , if you '11 all come down into the Court , you '11 hear what a noise you 're making . ' '

		Per - haps , ' admits
Tennyson	PERSON	, I may have put in the all . ' ''

		Here is a characteristic bit from '' Old Fit / .

		and curiously similar to the passage already quoted from
Frederick Tennyson	PERSON	.

		It is from a letter to `` My dear old Alfred , '' which begins thus : `` I abuse
Browning	PERSON	myself ; and get others to abuse him ; and write to you about it ; for the sake of easing my heart not yours .

		Why is it -LRB- as I asked Mrs. Ten - nyson -RRB- that , while the Magazine critics are belauding him , not one of the men I know , who are not inferior to the writers in the AthMi : riim .

		K < Hnburgh , etc. , can endure , and -LRB- for the most part -RRB- can read him at all ?

		I mean his hist poem .

		Thus it has been with the Cowells ,
Trinity Thompsons	ORGANIZATION	,
Donnes	LOCATION	, and some others whom you do n't know , but in whose candour and judgment I have equal confidence , men and women too . ''

		Since I wrote to your wife ,
Pollock	PERSON	, a great friend of
Browning	PERSON	's , writes to me : I agree with you about
Browning	PERSON	and A. T. I ca n't understand it .

		Ter conatus eram to get through the Ring and the Book and fail - ing to perform the feat in its totality , I have stooped to the humiliatiou to point out extracts for me -LRB- they hav - ing read it all quite through three times -RRB- and still could not do it .

		So I pretend to have read it , and let
Browning	PERSON	so suppose when I talk to him about it .

		But do n't you be afraid * -LRB- N. B. I am not , only angry -RRB- ` things will come round , and
A. T.	PERSON	will take his right place again , and R. B. will have all the honours due to his learning , wit and philosophy . ' ''

		The chapter of '' fragmentary notes of Ten - nyson 's talk '' has many quotable sayings .

		I am sorry , ' * said he on one occasion , `` that I am turned into a school-book at
Harrow	LOCATION	; the boys will say of me , * That horrible
Tennyson	PERSON	. '

		The cheapness of English classics makes the plan acceptable to schoolmasters and parents . '' ''

		My prize poem Timbuctoo ' was an altered version of a work I had written at home and called ' The Battle of Armageddon . '

		I fell out with my father , for I had no wish to compete for the prize and he insisted on my writing .

		To my amazement , the prize was awarded to me .

		I could n't face the public recitation in the
Senate House	ORGANIZATION	, feeling very much as
Cowper	PERSON	felt ; Mer - ivale declaimed my poem for me in the
Senate House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		My tailor at
Cambridge	LOCATION	was a man of the name of Law .

		When he made his way into our rooms , and worried us about paying our bills , we used to say , This is Law 's Serious Call . ' ''

		A similar
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	tradition concerns the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	tailor , whose name was Joy .

		The undergraduates , after a liberal indulgence in port wine , used to say : '' Heaviness may endure for a night , but Joy cometh in the morning . ''

		Tennyson 's love of animals is illustrated in the following : '' 1 could imitate the hoot of an owl , and once practised successfully enough to attract one which flew in through iny window .

		The bird soon made friends with me , would sit on my shoulder and kiss my face .

		My pet monkey became jealous , and one day pushed the owl off a board that 1 had raised some feet from the ground .

		The owl was not hurt , but he died afterwards a
Narcissus	ORGANIZATION	death from vanity .

		He fell into a tub of water contemplating his own beauty , and was drowned . ''

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 223 Among the tributes of admiration from read - ers in many lands , there are some from
America	LOCATION	that will make the American reader blush for his country , even while he laughs .

		For example : '' Will you accept the enclosed lines as a slight testi - monial of the high admiration entertained for your ex - quisite genius , by a rhyming daughter of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	; whose poetic wings just fledging from a first unpublished vol .

		-LRB- commended by Wm.
Cullen Bryant	PERSON	and Geo .

		Bancroft , Esqrs . -RRB-

		permit only a feeble fluttering around the base of that ' Parnassus , ' whose summit you have so bril - liantly , and justly attained . ''

		An angler for autographs writes as follows : `` SiR I hope that you will kindly excuse the liberty I take in requesting you to be so good as to inform me how the word ` humble ' should be pronounced : i.e. whether or not it is proper to aspirate the ' h ' ?

		A reply at your kind convenience will inexpressibly oblige ... '' One would like to know how these and count - less other similar importunities were borne by the victim .

		He must have amassed a consider - able library of gift volumes of verse from unre - nowned poets that is , if he kept these offerings .

		To have read all the printed and unprinted metrical effusions sent to him , commonly with request for criticism -LRB- and with fond hopes of praise -RRB- , would have been impossible .

		As a treasury of literary and personal remi - niscence and anecdote , embellished with appro - priate illustrations , ``
Tennyson	PERSON	and his Friends '' is a book to revel in as the mood seizes one , and to read through in a season of leisure ; and by reason of its uniformity in style with the `` Life and Letters , '' as well as for other and deeper rea - sons , it claims a place beside that earlier work from the same hand .

		ECONOMICS MADE INTELLIGIBLE .

		* There is a dearth of good books in economics .

		Exhaustive monographs and voluminous inves - tigations there are in plenty .

		But even in the field of applied economics taxation , the labor problem , the trust problem , and the like it is difficult to find a really good book , a book written for men , not for college boys , a book intelligible to persons not already experts in the field , a book that covers its subject adequately , that is interesting yet free from bias .

		As for the general works on economics , those published in
America	LOCATION	prior to
1911	DATE	have all been designed primarily as university text-books , and very good text-books some of them are .

		But who * PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS .

		ByF .


W. Taussig	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		ever reads a text-book unless as a task imposed upon him by authority ?

		This lack of books written to meet the needs of the general reader is not , as many superficial thinkers urge , a serious reproach to the body of economic writers .

		It is the chief business of the economist , for the present at least , to con - duct investigations and to teach other men how to conduct investigations .

		The field of eco - nomics is a vast one , very inadequately explored .

		The force of investigators is too small , and their resources inadequate to the work .

		They are therefore compelled in many cases to content themselves with merely plausible working hypo - theses .

		In so far as the progress of the science consists in the substitution of reasonably cer - tain conclusions for tentative ones , the real sig - nificance of the work will almost inevitably escape the layman .

		In so far as it consists in the investigation of the hidden implications of the problems that lie on the surface an in - vestigation essential to the solution of these problems the progress of the science will ap - pear to the layman to be in the direction of bar - ren subtleties .

		What layman can understand why economists have in recent years devoted so much energy to the `` minutiae '' of the value problem ?

		As a scientific investigator , the econ - omist must select his problems without refer - ence to the immediate popular interest .

		If he can make it clear to his co-workers in the science what he is driving at , and why , it is usually all he can do , and all he can be expected to do .

		It is all that the professional chemist or physicist does .

		Economics as a science , like most other sciences , assumes by necessity a somewhat eso - teric form .

		But , unlike other sciences , economics must in the end divest itself of the esoteric if it is to be at all useful .

		Society can enjoy the fruits of discoveries in the physical sciences , the na - ture of which only the select few understand .

		There is no reason why even a considerable minority of the population should understand the principles underlying wireless telegraphy ; the invention is none the less put to its most effective use .

		The invention of a new plan for regulating bank-note issues , on the other hand , must remain without practical result until a working majority of society has become con - vinced of its worth .

		It follows that in econom - ics great value is properly ascribed to the work of a man who succeeds in making himself under - stood by the general public .

		Accordingly almost all economists will regard Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's THE DIAL -LSB-
March Iti	DATE	, '' Principles of Economics '' as a work of great importance .

		Some , no doubt , will deny that it contributes materially to the solution of any vital problem of economic science .

		Others perhaps will even assert that it is reactionary in its tendencies .

		But no one can deny that the book is a readable one , and intelligible , in the main , to anyone seriously interested in economic questions and willing to do a reasonable amount of thinking .

		The scope of the work is exceedingly wide .

		What may be termed the general principles of economics the organization of production , the laws of value , and the forces governing distribu - tion occupy Books I. , II. , and V .

		The re - maining five books cover the more important problems of economic policy money and bank - ing , foreign trade , labor problems , problems of economic organization -LRB- railway problems , trusts , socialism -RRB- , and taxation .

		The discussion often ranges beyond the strict limits indicated by these captions , and in the end covers pretty nearly all of the economic field in which there is any - thing like generally accepted conclusions .

		Professor
Taussig	PERSON	is one of those economists who believe in the essential soundness of the classical system of economics .

		Accordingly no one will be surprised to find that his theory of value is practically that of Mill , with some con - cessions to a more recent terminology .

		His theory of money is also constructed on the clas - sical model .

		The discussion begins with a bald statement of the quantity theory , followed by some two hundred pages of the qualifications necessary to adapt the theory to the facts of life .

		Despite all the qualifications , however , the orig - inal quantity theory of money remains as the governing principle in the field of price changes .

		The theory of international trade presented by Professor
Taussig	PERSON	is also classical in outline .

		The argument for free trade here given is based upon the theory of comparative costs : it is for - tified , however , by the results of much concrete investigation in this field , in which Professor
Taussig	PERSON	is acknowledged master .

		The author 's theory of distribution is classi - cal in its emphasis upon the relation to the rate of wages of the forces governing the increase in population .

		It is also strictly classical in its conception of the nature of rent .

		A departure from the older political economy appears in the explanation of interest , which is described as originating in men 's undervaluation in the pres - ent of goods that are designed for future use .

		What is perhaps most classical in Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's theory is a certain ruthlessness of logic , a disregard for consequences of a revolu - tionary character that might be deduced from it .

		Other economists have displayed great ingenuity in arguing that property incomes are not deduc - tions from the product of labor , but are funda - mentally the product of the material instruments of production themselves .

		Professor
Taussig	PERSON	rejects this view without serious discussion .

		Labor he regards as the sole source of income .

		As wii ` jv * .

		tin - lalion-r fan p-t only hi > marginal product what labor employed on the poorest lands and in the poorest mines in use actually adds to production .

		Thus a first deduction from the product of labor consists in rents , royalties , and other differential gains .

		Even the rewards of superior management are to be regarded as the product of the labor subject to mauap ` incut .

		if we are to construe strictly some of the pas - sages in Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's chapters on business profit -LRB- cf. , Vol .

		II. , p. 172 -RRB- .

		And since , under modern conditions , what the laborer produces is rarely fit for his own consumption , but must undergo further elaboration , be transported and warehoused until wanted , the laborer must re - ceive , not his marginal product , but a price for it , advanced by the capitalist .

		This price is not the price of the product when ready for con - sumption ; it is that price , less the capitalist 's discount .

		Thus interest appears to be a second deduction from the product of labor ; and wages , so far from being the whole product of labor , are at most only the discounted marginal product .

		Such a theory of distribution might appear to serve as a basis for an attack upon property incomes .

		No such attack is contemplated by Professor
Taussig	PERSON	, who seeks justification of concrete incomes not in the abstract principles of productivity but in broad considerations of social utility .

		Interest , rents , and profits are defended on the ground that such incomes must exist if society is to be adequately supplied with capital , if its natural resources are to be properly utilized , if men are to assume the risks attendant upon the introduction of new processes .

		Profes - sor
Taussig	PERSON	recognizes that the existence of such incomes makes for serious inequalities among men a prolific source of discontent and disor - der .

		In so far their tendency is evil .

		He be - lieves that some mitigation of existing inequalities is possible through a development of popular education with consequent equalization of oppor - tunity , and through assumption by the State of the duty of relieving some of the most serious hardships that now weigh upon the poor the hopeless destitution of old age , the ' miseries re -

		THE DIAL 225 suiting from industrial accidents and protracted illness .

		A quickened sense of obligation on the part of the rich may also assist in mitigating the evils of inequality .

		The author does not , how - ever , anticipate radical changes in the near future . ''

		The main features of the existing dis - tribution of wealth are likely to persist for an indefinite period in the future : shorn , indeed , at either end , of the extremes of abject poverty and endless riches , but still with rich and poor , leisure class and well-to-do class and working class , social stratification and the leaven of social ambition . ''

		-LRB- Vol .

		II. , p. 256 . -RRB-

		A consideration of Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's theory of distribution leads naturally to an inference as to his attitude toward the labor movement .

		If wages are at most the '' discounted marginal product of labor , '' how much chance is there that organized labor will succeed in its ultimate object of directing a greater and greater share of the social income stream toward itself ?

		This question is answered by the author in Book VI. , under the caption `` The Problems of Labor . ''

		In his view , all that organized labor can do is to secure for labor its full discounted marginal product .

		It can do nothing to change the basis of distribution .

		This doctrine of the limited efficacy of labor organization is taught , to be sure , by practically the whole body of economic theorists who are of classical antecedents .

		Its validity is vigorously denied by the leaders of the labor movement and by many of the scien - tific students of the labor problem .

		One who accepts it will almost inevitably display a cer - tain hostility toward organized labor , or at least impatience with its aims and methods .

		He is likely to look upon trade union exclusive - ness as vulgar monopoly ; restraints imposed by the unions upon their members and upon em - ployers he is apt to regard as a form of tyranny .

		Such practices of trade unions as lead to violence and the destruction of property will receive from him the more vigorous condemnation be - cause he regards the end toward which they are directed as an unattainable one .

		In this view the general public is forced to suffer all manner of inconvenience and injury while trade unions are trying out unlawful means to gain what the constitution of society makes it impossible for them to gain .

		Professor
Taussig	PERSON	, to be sure , endeavors to maintain a sympathetic attitude toward trade unionism , and justifies himself in this by placing a great deal of emphasis upon the potency of the union to remove the minor disabilities under which the workers labor weakness in bargaining with large employers , etc. .

		In the reviewer 's opinion , this justification of trade unionism is inadequate .

		The gains do not appear to be commensurate with the costs , if we accept Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's general doctrine .

		Are we compelled to accept this doctrine ?

		Not by any argument presented by the author .

		When a body of workers gains control of a field of employment and forces up their own wages , this will no doubt be in part at the expense of other workers .

		If the textile workers secure a general advance in wages , a readjustment of textile prices will follow , laborers in general will pay more for their clothes .

		There are also losses to laborers excluded from a unionized in - dustry and exclusion of some applicants for admission is inevitable , if wages are to be kept above the average .

		Possibly other losses to labor must be added to these , before we can strike a just balance of the advantages and dis - advantages of an advance in wages restricted to a single industry .

		The point here made is , that Professor
Taussig	PERSON	does not attempt to strike any such balance .

		He arrives at a conclusion of great practical significance without giving the reader an insight into the reasons upon which that conclusion is based .

		For this omission there are , to be sure , many precedents in the works of other economists who defend a similar position .

		And the reason is the same .

		To estab - lish the point scientifically would require an extremely laborious structure of mathematical analysis that could hardly find place in a book of this kind .

		And , since the analysis has never been made , it is possible that if it were worked out , it would support another conclusion .

		Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's attitude toward socialism is a generous one .

		Men who know little of the character of the advocates of socialism are prone to assume that they are inspired as a rule by envy .

		Professor
Taussig	PERSON	asserts that brotherly love , rather than envy , underlies the socialistic movement .

		Most of the stock arguments against socialism he dismisses as almost too trivial for consideration .

		His own criticism of socialism is that it underestimates the difficulty of check - ing excessive increase of population in a
State	ORGANIZATION	in which responsibility for the child rests with the
State	ORGANIZATION	instead of with the parents ; the diffi - culty of securing systematic effort in the per - formance of the routine tasks that will always make up the greater part of the world 's work ; and the difficulty of insuring progress in indus - try when the rewards given under the present system for invention and for the assumption of the risks inseparable from the introduction of THE DIAL j
March If.	DATE	, inventions are withdrawn .

		Professor
Taussig	PERSON	sees no justification for the view that produc - tion in its existing state is sufficiently effective to secure a maximum of social welfare .

		The annual production of wealth , even in the
United States	LOCATION	, is less than
$ 1,000	MONEY	per family .

		We must do much better than that before we can regard the problems of production as solved .

		Private enterprise finds at every hand problems of production to solve ; accordingly it is far too early to talk of supplanting it by the relatively unprogressive forms of
State	ORGANIZATION	activity .

		But a system of private enterprise can not , in Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's opinion , result in the great - est social good unless it is subject to effective State regulation .

		This is especially true in the case of monopolistic industries .

		The so-called public service industries , practically all persons now admit , must either be regulated with re - spect to charges and character of service , or must be owned by the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the present , the author holds private ownership and public super - vision to be practically best , in the
United States	LOCATION	at least .

		He contemplates for the future an increasing range of publicly-owned industries ; and expresses hearty approval of the experiments in public ownership now under way in the leaser American cities .

		He is less disposed to approve of similar experiments in the great cities , where the political situation presents problems of far greater complexity .

		With respect to the trust question , Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's position may be characterized as some - what more advanced than that of most of his contemporaries .

		His practical programme in - cludes the establishment of direct federal con - trol over all corporations doing an interstate business , enforced publicity as to the important details of corporate business , control of capitali - zation , and perhaps eventually of profits and of prices .

		Sufficient evidence has been given in the preceding paragraphs to indicate Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's point of view a point of view fairly representative of that of the general body of his profession .

		Professor
Taussig	PERSON	would be char - acterized , in the political phraseology of the day , as a Progressive .

		He accepts the existing economic system as fundamentally sound , an efficient system , which promotes not merely mate - rial progress , but the development of wholesome character in the great majority .

		At the same time , the system is full of evils , some of them inherent , but most of them eradicable if men would but take thought .

		DOMAIN OK P - ' K HOI.OI.Y .

		* The transformation of interest in psychologi - cal problems , the wide range of theory and prac - tice which they have assumed , and the general awakening to the importance of the field of mind , make timely a topographical survey of this domain , indicating the contours of trends and interests while yet free of encumbering de - tails .

		Such a survey is available in a peculiarly attractive form in the published lectures delivered by Professor
J. R. Angell	PERSON	last year , as the first course upon the Spencer foundation in psychology established at
Union College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Augell	PERSON	has chosen to divide the field according to dominant problems and the methods developed for their pursuit .

		In addition he lias held in mind critically though hopefully the prac - tical applications of psychological doctrine to the art of living , which these various types of in - vestigation yield .

		The first lecture , upon Gen - eral Psychology , sets forth the professional and technical interest which supports the psycholo - gist in his attempt to analyze the basal processes of the mental operations .

		Here the bent of the analyst and of the practitioner lie somewhat apart , a divergence of purpose as well as of route .

		The discussion serves to remove the diffi - culty experienced by the layman in comprehend - ing the magnified proportion which analytic problems occupy in the professional mind .

		This difficulty is but a phase of the inevitable dis - crepancy between research and application .

		It implies on the part of the public a confidence in the judgment of the expert and in that wisdom born of scholarship , that is liable to develop an excessive scholastic absorption in self-made theories .

		Modern psychology is fortunate in finding salvation from the danger of the narrow interest that for centuries determined its lines of advance , through the mutual interactions of the several sciences dealing with life expressed in the vitalizing power of evolutionary principles .

		None the less , each science is entitled to the development of its own technique and to an intensive absorption in and basal elaboration of processes which must be interpreted and dis - sected as well as appreciated and applied .

		The second lecture is devoted to
Physiologi	PERSON	- cal Psychology , and sets forth the commanding import of the nervous system as the conditioning instrument of the mental functions , of the man - ner in which the scope and quality of the senses and muscles , as inlets and outlets of the mind , CHAPTERS FROM MODKHN PSYCHOLOGY .

		THE DIAL 227 condition the type and efficiency of the mental life .

		More specifically the third lecture pursues the problem of Experimental Psychology , partly in an historical aperyu , by showing how one after another of the mental procedures has yielded to experimental ingenuity , to the control that apparatus and set conditions afford , while yet subject to the commanding condition of the supreme instrument of research the mind of the observer as well as the mind of the subject .

		Here lie the most distinctive relations differen - tiating psychology from other sciences ; for however expert the instrument of research , the mind with its limitations is at once the subject and the object of investigation .

		The conquest of the experimental field requires patience and technical analysis , as well as common sense , a perspective easily spoiled by crudity of design and execution .

		The peculiar idol of psychol - ogy may prove to be a love of figures and of the niceties of experiment for their own sake , and a consequent neglect of the inspiration which alone gives enduring value , that of the understanding of the problems as dominant and of the method as subservient to the ends which these impose .

		At this point the field subdivides with refer - ence to observation and practical application .

		One phase of this service is indicated by the word '' clinical . ''

		Abnormal Psychology sug - gests the meeting place of the practitioner who regards mental health as essential as bodily health , but whose acquaintance with the vagaries of the mind gone wrong is not quite adequate to the comprehension of the lesser variations , the study of which forms the specific field of the psychology of the abnormal .

		From dreams to hypnotism ; from the action of drugs to di - vided and disorganized personalities ; from the belief in unusual mental powers that have ac - companied the development of the human race from ancient to modern times to their scientific interpretation ; in brief , from the normal relations and uses of mental trends to their most abnor - mal manifestations , whether in genius or insan - ity ; all these transitions suggest the widening of the field , an extension of interest , and an ex - pansion of prospect which together contribute an enlarged insight and a comprehensive addi - tion to the field of mind .

		Individual and Applied Psychology set forth how these several aspects of the mind are con - cretely present in the only data that nature sup - plies , namely , the individual mind with indi - vidual endowments , set to a particular purpose and educated and developed to the uses of life .

		Here a caution is indispensable .

		The wisdom of practice is ever to be guided by the insight conferred by theory .

		Charlatanism in the field of mind has always flourished , and short-circuits to learning and the command of human re - sources are as misleading in modern as in an - cient guise .

		It is true that the complications of our busy life have brought forward in sharp outline such special problems as the appeal of advertising and the more detailed analysis of the processes which education uses for the ma - turing of mental powers .

		Social and
Racial Psychology	ORGANIZATION	represent what in some respects is the dominant interest of the day .

		The socialization of impulses which are as ancient as the race , but which modern society is putting to new uses , has imposed on psy - chology a reconstruction of many of its funda - mental attitudes and as well has vitalized the older problems , making it necessary for the psychologist of to-day to be a man of the world rather than or in addition to being a man of the study and the laboratory .

		The racial aspects of mind set the older conditions imposed by nature in the differentiation of species hi con - trast with the social demands of civilized life , which the diverse ends and means of social or - ganization have introduced .

		This interest im - parts to the psychological manifestations of humanity an historical interpretation .

		It gives a valuable cumulative sense of the fact that history is but a record of mind applied by human ideals to the accomplishment of formu - lated purposes .

		Man is not the only representative of the mental kingdom indeed , in the same sense in which he who knows but one language knows none is it true that the human mind has only a limited and foreshortened perspective of the range of mental phenomena , unless there be added to this equipment an appreciation of what mind has done for the animal kingdom .

		Once more popular impression and exact study diverge in interest and result .

		Animal Psychol - ogy is valuable no less in reflecting the restric - tions to which the march of human endowment has been subject , as in contributing to the com - parative point of view which has proved of such large advantage in other fields .

		The problem presents an example of the general difficulty of reducing to exact form the processes that underlie expressions manifest enough in their general bearing but quite concealing their own proce - dure .

		In no field has there been such a peculiar 2-2 * THE DIAL temptation to interpret results by the acquired and inherent human prejudices as in the under - standing of animal behavior . ''

		Nature fak i 1 1 - in the biological sense is quite secondary in importance to the misconstruction of what is im - plied psychologically in animal conduct .

		This leads naturally to Professor
Angell	PERSON	's conclud - ing lecture on
General Genetic Principles in Psychology	ORGANIZATION	, which presents the field of endow - ment as well as of achievement in stages of evolu - tion as well as of accomplishment , and makes it obligatory upon psychologists to trace momen - tous effects back to small beginnings .

		To differ - entiate between instinct and reason ; to observe community of purpose and process despite con - trast of personality and expression ; and in the individual as well as in the social field to observe how largely and how limitedly nature provides for the psychological vantage of men , all con - tribute to the perplexities of the genetic psy - chologist .

		The concentration of interest in the evolution of the child to the full stature of adult mentality purposely dominates , but its study profits by comparison with other phases and stages of evolutionary progress .

		It is important that such judicial surveys of general domains of knowledge should from time to time be made .

		They serve to keep the intelli - gent layman in touch with the advance that oc - cupies the scholar , and provide a rational basis of appreciation of what may be properly expected of professional pursuit .

		All sciences are subject to the benefit as well as the loss of encourage - ment that influence human action ; and to keep psychology vital requires some general apprecia - tion of its purposes and methods .

		In thus pro- viding the basis of appreciation this volume may be recommended as performing a worthy service in a worthy manner .

		Naturally the perspective of such a survey will vary with the interests and the appraisals of the surveyor .

		Professor
Angell	PERSON	is at once critical and catholic .

		If the obligations which he has imposed upon himself to keep well within the field of the ascertained , to present both sides of all disputed points , and to make no excessive drafts on the attention of his audience , have here and there operated against the deci - siveness of his statements and the appeal of his presentations , he has at least the excuse that the temporal conditions of the lecture-room are less favorable than the more studious attitude of the reader .

		As a survey of the psychological domain , Professor
Angell	PERSON	's latest volume will imme - diately assume the favored place which its con - spicuous merits warrant .

		It has wellnigh come about , as
Carlyle	LOCATION	re - marked , that `` the Creation of a \ \ , , rl , l is littl , more ^ mysterious than the cooking of a dump - ling '' ; but the time has not yet arrived when men may look upon Poetry , the creation of an immaterial world , with as much certainty and as little abashment .

		The note of wonder that
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	brought into th criticism of poetry has not yet given signs of surrender to pedantry and formalism ; and the religious attitude toward poetry , synonymous , to
Arnold	LOCATION	, with `` The Study of Poetry , '' poetry as a consolation and an interpretation of the perplexities of life , has allied itself with the attitude of wonder .

		In the lectures on poetry given by the twenty - fourth Professor of Poetry at
Oxford	LOCATION	, this atti - tude of wonder has almost , if not quite , gone to seed .

		Beginning with an excellent characteriza - tion of the formal and technical aspect of poetry as '' patterned language '' or rhythm in verses , '' and insisting , as Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	had insisted , that form and substance are indissoluble , Mr.
Mac	PERSON	- kail proceeds to seek an analogous definition of poetry as an imaginative expression of life .

		Milton 's description of a true poem as `` a com position and pattern of the best and honourablest things '' is apparently behind the analogy drawn by Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	.

		`` Just as the technical art of poetry consists in making patterns out of lan - guage , so the vital function of poetry consists in making patterns out of life . '' ''

		These pat - terns , '' he goes on , '' are latent and implicit ; poetry reveals , and in a quite real sense , creates them ... This it does by virtue of imagina - tion , by the potency of the shaping spirit . ''

		Clearly , Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	's definition is not to be frowned upon ; properly interpreted and elabo - rated , it would be both sound and fruitful .

		But unfortunately the author of the not unilluminat - ing '' Springs of
Helicon	ORGANIZATION	'' has descended to a type of criticism that one is tempted to call jugglery .

		By what intellectual and emotional processes he reached his conclusions it would be difficult to say they scarcely appear in these essays .

		Ordinarily he treats his ideas as pretty toys , to be displayed with a childish triumph of ownership .

		His '' function of life '' and '' pat - tern of life '' he repeats till one is distraught .

		THE DIAL 229 repetition of phrase , but with a difference : when one objects to
Arnold	LOCATION	's repetitions , a technical matter of style is involved ; when one winces at Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	's repetitions , it is because so little seems to lie behind them .

		The sense of won - der and religious elevation that poetry surely evokes in Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	becomes , in his criticism , too often an uninspired trifling with incalculably great things .

		Is it possible that so staunch a follower of
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Swinburne	PERSON	, braced with the robust All 's - well doctrines of
Browning	PERSON	, is on the verge of a disillusionment ?

		Or is it simply a matter of lapsing into impotence ?

		It may be that Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	's scientific inter - ests are at the root of this trifling and ineffec - tualness .

		Everything , he says somewhere , is in a state of flux .

		The notion of a hostility be - tween science and poetry is baseless ; and then he re-defines poetry as '' the projection on a visible plane of a vast and exceedingly complex mass of poetical tendencies and potentialities . ''

		One of his lectures , `` The Progress of Poetry , '' is a deliberate application of evolutionary ideas to poetry ; the title is suggested by Gray , the lecture itself by Darwinian science .

		The prog - ress of poetry is not necessarily one toward per - fection ; like '' all other vital functions '' poetry must have movement , and , like history , never repeats itself .

		We may study the movements of the past , as the historian does , but can say noth - ing of the future .

		Incidentally , Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	points to the exuberance of minor poetry as an instance of '' the enormous wastefulness of Na - ture , '' uses in combination such terms as demand and supply , and shows an ominous familiarity with '' the most recent physical doctrine , '' a treatise by Sir
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	on the
Ether of Space	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a consequence , it may be , of this influence , his style sinks at times to what
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	would surely have called a base lingo : '' Poetry , like life , is always beginning afresh .

		In all the embodiments of itself through which it passes it is mixed with matter .

		To that matter it gives life ; by its incorporation in that matter it makes its own life visible and sensible .

		But the matter tends to encroach upon the vital spirit which informs it ; poetry becomes encumbered by its own creations .

		It has to shake itself free from them , volatilise for a new condensation . ''

		This , then , is the style and habit of thought that proceeds from the combination of Coleridgean wonder with scientific study ; or , to adopt Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	's manner of language , this is the seed that results from the fertilization of the pistillate flower of modern romanticism by the pollen of evolutionary science .

		One is compelled to admit , on completing a reading of Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	's latest work , as Mr.
John Bailey	PERSON	reluctantly admitted of the lecture placed last in the volume , that '' there is not , to tell the truth , a very great deal in it . ''

		Yet certain and not slight reservations must be made .

		The discussion of Arabian poetry is in many respects excellent ; the lecture on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets is eminently worth while , rebuking as it does the assertions of those who find in the sonnets a history of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life and those who label them ingenious literary exercises .

		Still more worth while is the lecture on
Virgil	PERSON	and Virgilianism , which is at the same time en - tirely readable and scholarly , and which presents a very acceptable solution to the problem of the Culex .

		And indeed throughout the volume one will come upon passages in which erudition is blended refreshingly with literary felicity and that tone of urbanity which Arnold may almost be said to have introduced into English literary criticism .

		These things one will find in Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	's latest volume , and they are not to be set aside lightly , however deficient that volume may be in the higher qualities of criticism .

		Mr.
John Bailey	PERSON	's book is a collection of re - views reprinted from the literary supplement of the
London	LOCATION	'' Times , '' twenty-two reviews , on subjects ranging from Chaucer to
Meredith	LOCATION	, in a volume of only two hundred pages .

		In the nature of the case the result is somewhat frag - mentary ; but Mr.
Bailey	PERSON	brings to his task a responsive gusto and a degree of thoughtfulness , together with a conciseness of expression , that go far to make the book not only readable but profitable .

		For him poetry is a radiance of light illuminating all existence ; and criticism is another kind of radiance of light , the purpose of which is to illuminate poetry .

		Whatever one may think of this view of criticism , one must at least grant that Mr.
Bailey	PERSON	frequently accom - plishes his purpose .

		He '' surrenders '' himself to use his own word to wellnigh every poet that he discusses , acts the spy diligently , and reports in terse language what he has learned .

		He has the same charity for Shelley as for Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, yet without the open-mouthed and often empty-mouthed admiration of not a few modern critics .

		In the course of his sympa - thetic and thoughtful chatting , he says many good things , condenses aptly impressions that we all had vaguely , and moves with ease as well as reverence in the domains of high poetry .

		That he is always sound is not to be expected ; in his judgment
Wordsworth	PERSON	and Pater are both true Platonists , despite their predilection for revery and for intuition not based on reason , and
Wordsworth	PERSON	-LRB- whose lesser half was
Rous	PERSON	- 230 THE DIAL -LSB- Man-h 16 , seaii -RRB- is '' less like
Rousseau	PERSON	than any man who ever lived . ''

		In general , however , Mr.
Hailey	PERSON	's clear and sober thinking and really large fund of information enable him to spend his sympathy with discretion .

		The following , from ''
Scott	PERSON	's Poetry , '' is typical : '' It is a poetry that uses its eyes but not its mind .

		It asks no questions and belongs very emphatically to the age before responsibility for the universe was in - vented .

		It is an external poetry , enjoying its own mo - tion , dancing with youth and joy in the open air and the animal pleasure of being alive .

		Obviously it loses much by being only that ; but after all it is fair to re - member how much it gains by being that .

		Here is a poetry which is not doggerel , and which yet sticks in the memory of a schoolboy , a boatman , or a private of the Guards , as nothing else but doggerel would .

		Here is the language of a scholar and a gentleman , the eye of a poet , the ear of no mean master of the art of metre , and the result is what a soldier can march to and a child understand .

		That is no mean achievement ; it is what no one since
Scott	PERSON	has achieved . ''

		But no sooner does the author get under way , than he must turn to another phase of his sub - ject , with a journalistic '' There is one other thing '' that disappoints while it stimulates .

		The explanation is that Professor
Fournier	PERSON	pub - lished his first edition about twenty years ago , and a translation was undertaken by the late Professor
E. G. Bourne	PERSON	.

		The work was < lr la \ v < l , and appeared finally only a few month * before
Fournier	PERSON	began to publish a revised edi - tion .

		Changes in this revised edition , completed in
1906	DATE	, and including new matter amount in ^ to about a ninth of the whole , have given > < ; , sion for a second translation , issued in two volumes , instead of one as before .

		The student of Napoleonic affairs would welcome thi > tran > - lation unreservedly had not the translator taken unexplained liberties , omitting or abridging many of
Fournier	PERSON	's notes and venturing in a few instances to alter statements of the text .

		Professor
Fournier	PERSON	is regarded as one of the most authoritative writers on the Napoleonic period .

		As Rose has drawn especially from the papers in the
British Record Office	ORGANIZATION	, and
Sorel	PERSON	from the French archives , so
Fournier	PERSON	has made a large use of the archives at
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		His work is distinguished by a commendable absence of rhetoric , and by definiteness in statements of fact .

		From his treatment it is easy to grasp the distinction between the French empire and that '' Grand Empire '' which came into existence after Austerlitz .

		As might be expected of an Austrian , he gives a more sympathetic and intel - ligible presentation of Austrian diplomacy in the critical months from
December 1812	DATE	to
April 1814	DATE	.

		He does not credit
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	with that Machiavellian shrewdness which
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	was not averse to ascribing to himself , and which hostile critics have unhesitatingly asriiU-d to him .

		Fournier believes that
Metternich	ORGANIZATION	's policy was dictated by the perception of
Austria	LOCATION	's weak - ness , by a desire to recover territories of which
Napoleon	PERSON	had despoiled her , and by fears that if he demanded too much all would be lost or rival states would gain undue advantages .

		Fournier gives little space to subtle analyses of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's character .

		The reader is left to make his own generalizations .

		Occasionally , however , the author states frankly his concep - tion of the man and his significance .

		Writing of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's warlike policy in
1802	DATE	, he says that had
Napoleon	PERSON	been a Frenchman In - would have rested content to see
France	LOCATION	play a leading part among the powers of
Europe	LOCATION	; but neither his patriotism nor his ambition were French .

		Corsica had disowned him , and henceforth his ambition lacked the wholesome restraint of na - tional boundaries , and had become a thing at once gigantic , embracing the whole world in its sweep , and infinitely paltry the selfish greed

		THE DIAL , 231 of an individual . ''

		But Professor
Fournier	PERSON	be - lieves that while striving apparently to carry out his own purposes
Napoleon	PERSON	derived his real force from being an unconscious instrument of '' that civilization of humanity at which the intellectual forces had been laboring for centuries , '' and which was introducing a higher social order .

		Mr.
Arthur Hassall	PERSON	also treats
Napoleon	PERSON	's whole career , but in a summary fashion .

		He has attempted to solve the baffling problem of explaining the principal facts of his biography in seventy-five thousand words .

		This demands , above all , definiteness and brevity of statement .

		Mr.
Hassall	PERSON	has the fault of alluding to facts rather than stating them .

		He is repetitious , and interjects irrelevant reflections .

		The con - sequences of the battle of Austerlitz are stated in substantially the same language four times within eleven pages .

		This is not a typical case , but it shows that the task of organizing the material within narrow compass has not been accomplished .

		The books of
Masson	PERSON	and Espitalier treat special events or phases of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's career : the first , the reasons for and manner of his coronation ; the second , his relations with Murat from
1808	DATE	to
1814	DATE	.

		What
Fournier	PERSON	sums up in eighteen lines , Espitalier explains in five hundred pages .

		Fournier gives a page and a half to
Masson	PERSON	's subject .

		This does not imply that either Espitalier or
Masson	PERSON	have wasted space by descending into unnecessary details ; it illustrates the fact that even a two or three volume biography of
Napoleon	PERSON	must leave many interesting features of his career almost un - touched .

		The interest of
M. Masson	PERSON	's book is derived from the minuteness of his information in re - gard to all the details of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's coronation and the careful preparations for it .

		His opinion as to whether
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	gained or lost by the transaction is of secondary importance , because this matter has been discussed many times ; but the preparations for the coronation have never found so painstaking a chronicler .

		The prob - lems connected with the ceremony were so intri - cate that four different editions were prepared of the '' Extract from the Ceremonial Relating to the Consecration of their Imperial Majesties . ''

		The forms chosen were selected in part from the old French ceremonial aud the Roman service - book .

		To these were added new prayers and some ceremonies unknown to either
Reims	LOCATION	or
Rome	LOCATION	.

		All questions of ceremonial were gone over with the Pope before the day of corona - tion .

		Contrary to the traditional story , which
Fournier	ORGANIZATION	repeats in a mild form , it was ex - pressly provided in the official order of service that the Emperor `` will ascend to the altar , take the crown , place it on his head , and , taking that of the Empress in his hands , will crown her . ''

		At every stage of the preparations , says
M. Masson	PERSON	,
Napoleon	PERSON	took an intense interest , and '' refined and added r and demanded more pomp , pageantry , and actors . ''

		The cost of the whole was about twenty million francs .

		In an ap - pendix are the official descriptions of the cos - tumes with itemized statements of expense .

		One thing
M. Masson	PERSON	does not venture to explain the reasons which moved
Napoleon	PERSON	to crown
Josephine	PERSON	, contrary to the precedents of four centuries , during which only one French queen ,
Marie de Medici	PERSON	, had been crowned .

		Why should he flout public opinion by calling such attention to a woman whose history could not adorn pinnacles of glory ? ''

		Why ?

		.

		Doubtless because he had no sense of humor .

		He calmly did what no Parisian , no European , would have dared .

		It was enough that the woman was pleasing to him , and that he had chosen her . ''

		While
M. Espitalier	PERSON	gives an account of
Murat	ORGANIZATION	's relations to
Napoleon	PERSON	from the time
Napoleon	PERSON	made him king of
Naples	LOCATION	, the theme of the volume is the defection of Murat completed by the treaty of
January 11 , 1814	DATE	.

		All the way through ,
M. Espitalier	ORGANIZATION	's work is based on a careful study of the documents .

		Through the researches of Commandant
Weil	PERSON	, a mass of material on Murat has been recently published ; but
M. Espitalier	PERSON	has supplemented this by his own researches .

		In the earlier chapters he seems to display towards Murat a captious spirit , find - ing it strange that he desired to be a real mon - arch and was not content to remain a faithful viceroy of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some things may be alleged in excuse of this innkeeper 's son , the most glorious cavalier among all
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's generals .

		Since his marriage to
Caroline Bona	PERSON	- parte in
1800	DATE	he had been trained in a school of parvenus , and naturally concluded that he had a claim to share in the prodigious fortunes of the family .

		What wonder that patience and modesty were not among his merits ?

		M. Espi - talier says , however , that it was a traitress , rather than a traitor , who was responsible for the Janu - ary treaty , and that this person was
Caroline Bonaparte	PERSON	.

		The defeat at
Leipsic	LOCATION	, which he had witnessed , caused Murat to listen to over - tures from
Metternich	LOCATION	; but
Caroline	PERSON	did not wait for news from that fatal field before she concluded to open negotiations with
Austria	LOCATION	.

		The event showed that Murat was not content 23:2 THE DIAL , -LSB-
March 1U	DATE	, with the guarantee of his crown which M.-tt .

		- r - nich was ready to give , and that he hoped to force
Austria	LOCATION	to give him at least all
Italy	LOCATION	south of the Po .

		The way he played his game , trying to hoodwink both the Austrians and
Napoleon	PERSON	, was shameless ; but the reason for it was the weakness of his position quite as much as the crookedness of his character .

		To attempt to force the hand of a power of the first class , when he had an army of less than thirty thousand , was sheer folly .

		Metternich easily outmano3uvred him , and the result was the treaty in which his treachery to his brother-in-law stood revealed .

		The terms of the treaty were a bitter disappoint - ment , for he was promised only territory suffi - cient to add four hundred thousand subjects .

		Another Napoleonic volume , edited by Mr. M acKenzie Mac Bride , includes papers on Water - loo and on the Peninsular campaigns .

		One of the diaries also gives an account of English campaigning in
Egypt	LOCATION	in
1799	DATE	.

		The miscel - laneous character of the collection is shown by the inclusion of Sergeant
Dickson	PERSON	's account of the charge of the
Scots Greys	ORGANIZATION	, told forty years afterwards over the cups at a coffee-house .

		The diaries of Sergeant
Nicol	PERSON	and of Sergeant
Robertson	PERSON	are more interesting , and portray life in the army from the point of view of the soldier .

		The editor of the volume takes the complacent British view that
Napoleon	PERSON	's successes are to be accounted for by the fact that neither he nor his officers were pitted against British generals until the Peninsular and
Waterloo	LOCATION	campaigns .

		Napoleon 's '' conventional methods of warfare were good enough for the Russian peasants or the Portuguese and Spaniards . ''


HENRY E. BOURNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Thewrgeon crea tion of sound public opinion and MI place in on many important social phases of modern tocietv .

		tnfc surgical profession is the under - lying motive of Dr.
C. W. Saleeby	PERSON	's latest work , '' Surgery and Society : A Tribute to Listerism '' -LRB-
Moffat/Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author is abundantly qualified to deal with this subject because of his own medical training and experience .

		He wields a facile and wonted pen in his presentation of the state of surgical practice it can scarcely be desig - nated science prior to the discovery of anaesthesia and of antiseptic as well as aseptic surgery .

		Against this foil of horror , pain , gangrene , and frightful mortality in military and maternity hospitals , the epoch-making achievements of Lord
Lister	PERSON	are por * trayed in their true relation .

		Incidentally the anti- vivisectionist is revealed in the role of obstructor of medical and social progress .

		High tribute is paid to the noble and merciful ideal which inspires this propaganda , but the reader will not be blinded to tin - scientific and social consequences which How from thi.s idealistic - but misdirected zeal for tin - im - mediate welfare of a few of the countless animals which man turns to higher uses .

		The relation of alcohol and alcoholism to surgery , the obstacles it raises to ami ` thtnia , the reduction in powers of resistance to germs and of recuperative capacity attendant upon the u * e of this what the author calls a protoplasmic poison , are set forth in no equivocal terms .

		The present status of the surgeon in society as related to the general practitioner , to the hospital , to the charity clinic , to the wealthy client , and to the less fortunate patient of moderate means who does not deign to accept charity and can ill afford a year 's income as a fee , is fully di-cu-M-d .

		and a solution of the social and professional prob - lems which these relationships create our sanguine author foresees in the growing socialization of the surgeon 's profession .

		The freer use of the hospital by all classes , especially under the encouragement of the Government Insurance Act , and the prompter resort to the knife as a means of prevention of dis - ease and social deterioration , portend a wider and more effective service for this noble profession , un - less perchance the future growth of Listerism in other words , of our control of disease germs by pre - ventive methods shall rob even the surgeon 's knife of its task .

		Mtmorie * and ** the first of a trilo gy entitled '' Hail mm ing i of an and Farewell , '' Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's irith author .

		Ave '' makes its appearance with a prefatory note by the publishers of the American edition -LRB- Apple ton -RRB- explaining that the Knglish re - viewers of the book have done it an injustice in treating it as a mere volume of reminiscences .

		The author , we are assured , '' has rather tried to pro- duce something quite different .

		His intentions were to take a certain amount of material and to model it just as he would do in a novel .

		The people in his book are not personalities ; they are types of human characters .


Edward Marty n	PERSON	, for instance , is , in Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's own words , ` as typical of
Ireland	LOCATION	as
Sancho Panza	PERSON	is of
Spain	LOCATION	...
Yeats	PERSON	is not only the man who has gone to
America	LOCATION	to explain the Abbey Theatre to the American people ; he is the typical literary fop .

		Gill as he appears in the first volume represents the posthumous intelligence or should I say the disembodied intelligence which Catholic super - stitions create . '

		A philosophy is indicated between the lines if the interviewer cares to read between the lines .

		This philosophy will transpire in the volume entitled ` Salve ' which is to follow . ''

		The final volume of this autobiographic-philosophic trilogy is to be called '' Vale . ''

		There is much curious observa - tion and reflection in the work , and excellent charac - ter-painting occurs in abundance .

		Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's readers do not need to be told that hia peculiarities of style , his conceptions of literary art , give their
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		233 unmistakable character to these pages .

		Occasional details that one need not be unduly squeamish to regard as unornamental and inartistic are rendered with frank distinctness .

		Probably the book will for this reason appeal to many with all the more force , while others will inevitably be repelled .

		At any rate , it is not a commonplace production , even though it does incidentally treat of some commonplace things .

		Others that are not commonplace are there in plenty .

		A great poetry of ruins , especially in the architectural ruins of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	, is something etcher .

		now so universally conceded that probably few persons realize how really modern is this attitude of mind ; still fewer realize how much it is due to the insight of one man
Giovanni Battista Piranesi	ORGANIZATION	.

		For centuries , the debris of an - tique art in
Italy	LOCATION	had lain half submerged , dismissed from the care of men and abolished from their recol - lections .

		In company with
Winckelmann	PERSON	, it was Piranesi who helped to drag them , as it were , to the light once more ; and he lent his etcher 's needle to bring about an extension of the knowledge of the beautiful to that heritage of art which the world owned but had overlooked .

		People awoke , recog - nized , admired , and wondered how blind they and their forefathers had been , and proceeded to redis - cover architecture in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		A century and a half has passed since his best work appeared , and Mr.
Arthur Samuel	PERSON	, in a book called `` Piranesi '' -LRB- Scrib - ner -RRB- , justly considers that the time is ripe to redis - cover this neglected artist and to give him the credit that he really deserves .

		In that category , he places not only his influence on the art of etching , but also on archaeology , on the architecture and decoration associated with the names of the brothers
Adam	PERSON	, and on the furniture designs of
Chippendale	ORGANIZATION	,
Sheraton	LOCATION	, and their successors .

		Piranesi was one of those for - tunate men who have appeared at the juncture when their skill and individuality afford the greatest serv - ice .

		Architectural etching culminated with him .

		His successors are all able to reproduce more or less of his characteristics , but up to the present they have suggested no improvement or further develop - ment of the art as he left it .

		In English furniture , many splendid examples now called by various other names might be classed more truly as '' Piranesi furniture . ''

		It was the admiration inspired by the publication of his Roman etchings that checked the tendency among English furniture-makers to slip away towards the rococo .

		The points to be noted in what may be called a piece of '' Piranesi furni - ture '' are as follows : a noble simplicity of outline , but treated in such a way as to be entirely English in character ; carved mouldings similar to those on classic stone work ; a suggestion of Renaissance feel - ing or inspiration lending lightness , color , and sali - ency to the whole , in places where a piece made from
Chippendale	ORGANIZATION	's designs would be found heavy , dull , and uninteresting .

		The man
Piranesi	ORGANIZATION	is shown in Mr.
Samuel	PERSON	's pages to be quite as interesting as the artist , recalling
Benvenuto Cellini	PERSON	in his fiery and impetuous character .

		The etchings , of which twenty-five double-page plates serve as illustrations , do not lose in charm as much as one would expect from their great reduction in size , and the volume as a whole is one to justify the biographer 's claim that
Piranesi	ORGANIZATION	is of the utmost value to the architect of to-day , and particularly to the student of the early Renaissance .

		The author of ''
Sherman	PERSON	's
March	DATE	to war .

		th * Sea , '' Major
Samuel H. M. Byers	PERSON	, presents some of his war-time memo - ries in a brisk and at times thrilling narrative to which , without explanation or apology , he has given the title of the popular
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	romance , '' With Fire and Sword . ''

		But , under whatever name , the book is well able to stand on its own merits .

		The author 's eagerness for military adventure in those youthful days when volunteers were called for to defend the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, his determination to be in the thick of every fight even though his duties as quar - termaster sergeant compelled him to provide a substi - tute to perform those duties whenever the prospect of a battle lured him to the front , the fifteen months of awful prison life and of repeated attempts to es - cape , the circumstances attending his writing of his famous war ballad in prison , and his final recovery of freedom by a bold and artful stratagem these and many other matters go to make up one of the best accounts of army experience that the Civil War has been instrumental in giving to the reading pub - lic .

		Major
Byers	PERSON	gained the reward of his gallantry when
Sherman	PERSON	made him a member of his staff and selected him to carry to Grant the first official re - port of the successful '' march to the sea . ''

		It was as a corporal in Company B of the
Fifth Iowa Infan	LOCATION	- try that the young patriot entered his country 's serv - ice in
1861	DATE	, and he saw some hot fighting under Grant in those early years of the war , being finally taken prisoner at
Chattanooga	LOCATION	and suffering the hard - ships of confinement in
Libby Prison	LOCATION	and afterward at
Columbia	LOCATION	,
S.C.	LOCATION	His regiment almost fought itself out of existence , being reduced by the fortunes of war from one thousand men to two hundred and twenty-three .

		These figures will show that the author 's pages have no lack of stirring incidents and exciting scenes .

		A portrait of General
Sherman	PERSON	and one of Major
Byers	PERSON	illustrate the book .

Atlantic	LOCATION	coast has been so volumi - nously and so minutely written .

		Workers within the field have been few , and the widely scattered and in some measure inaccessible sources of information have only begun to be exploited .

		A good many years ago Mr.
Hubert Howe Bancroft	PERSON	brought to - gether a collection of upwards of one hundred and fifty volumes of documents pertaining to the history of the Far West in general .

		But even this remark - 234 THE DIAL , -LSB-

Seville	LOCATION	, and
Mexico City	LOCATION	-LRB- not to mention the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	and other American reposi - tories -RRB- , if he would compass the limits of his subject .

		A volume which is the fruit of thoroughgoing re - search of this character is ''

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by .

		Mr.
Irving B. Richman	PERSON	.

		Beginning with the explora - tion of Alta -LRB- or Upper -RRB-
California	LOCATION	by
Juan Rodri	PERSON	- guez Cabrillo in 1542-43 , Mr.
Richman	PERSON	describes in detail the opening of
California	LOCATION	by the Spaniards , the establishment of the missions , the planting of political and social institutions , the growth of inter - national rivalries , the movement for
Calif	LOCATION	ornian inde - pendence , the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast phases of the war between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Mexico	LOCATION	, and the circumstances lying back of the acquisition of
California	LOCATION	by the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The book has been written almost en - tirely from manuscript sources , and the earlier por - tions of it largely from materials hitherto unused .

		The work has been done in a painstaking manner , and the product must be adjudged distinctly credit - able to American historical scholarship .

		The text , besides being fortified by a hundred and fifty pages of closely-printed critical notes , is illuminated by a score of maps and charts , several of them never here - tofore reproduced .

		It is of interest to note that with respect to the ranch disputed question of Cap - tain
John C. Fremont	ORGANIZATION	's complicity in the so-called Bear Flag revolt of
June , 1846	DATE	, Mr.
Richman	PERSON	holds not merely , as do most writers , that the young engi - neer assisted in instigating the movement , but also that in doing so he was , as substantiated both by documents and by his own subsequent admission , deliberately disregarding the instructions of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		A pragmatic outlook .

		So much has philosophy been popu - larized by its treatment at the hands of the late Professor
James	PERSON	that peo - ple who would never have thought of asking the old Pilatean question , '' What is truth ? ''

		may now be heard every day asking , '' What is pragmatism ? ''

		While pragmatism is , at the very least , two things a method in philosophy and a view of reality , and as one philosophic writer has claimed to identify thirteen different '' pragmatisms , '' a reply to the question might seem rather hopeless .

		It will not be hopeless , however , if the inquirers will refer to Pro- fessor
David Starr Jordan	PERSON	's little book , `` The Sta - bility of Truth : A
Discussion of Reality	ORGANIZATION	as Related to Thought and Action '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	takes an eminently sane view of the world in which we live , and he presents that view with dignity and with a simplicity that will give him the largest pos - sible audience for a book of serious character . ''

		The purpose of this book , '' says its author , `` is to set forth the doctrine that the final test of truth is found in trusting our lives to it .

		Truth is livable while error is not , and the difference appears through the strain of the conduct of life ... Science ... can not grasp any truth in final or absolute complete - ness .

		But science may grasp certain relations of truth and certain phases of reality , and may state these in terms of previous human experience .

		Such versions or transcripts of reality are truth , and they represent actual verity as far as they go . ''

		One of the most interesting chapters in the book from a philosophic standpoint is that wherein Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	shows that Monism , despite its loudly colored scien - tific garb , is nothing but poetry after all , and -LRB- one might add -RRB- rather indifferent poetry at that .

		Of lighter interest is the chapter on `` Reality and Illu - - inn . ''

		in which Dr.
Jordan	PERSON	displays a comprehensive knowledge of all the illusions and delusions of this mad world , from clairvoyant methods of silver - mining to astral
Atlantic	LOCATION	transit of thoughts and bodies .

		The reader will lay down this book with admiration of its author 's catholicity of spirit and -LRB- it is to be hoped -RRB- with agreement that '' the life of action verifies and validates the world of realities , '' a declaration that is the gist of the pragmatic philosophy .

		M.Emile Faguet 's latest volume bears ** g * g in g title of - The Cult of Incompetence '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Coming from a member of the French Academy , it has ex - erted a rather wide influence upon the philosophic - ally minded of French politicians .

		Transferred to English , the treatment carries with it too strongly the oratorical flavor , and too constantly the attempt at clever expression .

		Viewed intimately the essay is concerned with the psychology of democracy ; its basal position regards as inherent in the democratic expression the desire tliat its rulers be of the people and like the people , and for this end sacrifices all other benefits .

		The inevitable consequence of the resulting political government is incompetence , since the people having no competence for government yet democratically insist upon control of administra - tion , of the judiciary , and of legislation .

		All this is traced back to a marked psychological trait of democracy that declines to recognize superiority of capacity or of any other type , and finds in treating as equal what really is not equal the satisfaction of personal self-assertion .

		M. Faguet treats this theme with more direct reference to philosophy and his - tory than would be the case in the hands of an equally independent American thinker .

		The same radical question of the compatibility of democracy with efficiency is engaging serious students in
France	LOCATION	as in
America	LOCATION	; both point to the strong contrast be - tween the efficiency of private corporations and the incompetence of political rule .

		The value of the book lies in taking the issue away from the political platform and back to the fundamental position of the philosophy and psychology of the political atti - tude , for this is the view that must ultimately pre - vail .

		`` The Life Story of
J. Pierpont Morgan	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- follows in some detail the rise of Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	from his first inconspicuous place in his father 's banking house to undisputed leadership in the world of finance .

		The personal and private aspect of the man barely appears , though the final chapter does attempt to present `` the man himself '' apart from his business interests .

		Full and interesting are the accounts of his achieve - ments in building up and consolidating railroad systems , in financing the
United States Steel Corpo	LOCATION	- ration , and in other large operations .

		In describ - ing the underwriting of the immense steel corpora - tion , the author rather puzzles one with some of his details .

		He makes eight thousand dollars to be twelve and
one-half per cent	MONEY	of one hundred thou - sand once explicitly , and twice by implication .

		But slips of this sort will show him to belong rather to the world of letters than to Wall Street and the world of finance , and thus may inspire greater con - fidence in his book as written impartially and from a sufficient distance to gain the proper perspective .

		In fact , he himself declares at the outset : `` As for the book , let it be said at once that it was con - ceived and written independently by the author ; there was never the least influence or dictation from without .

		The material was gathered because the subject was interesting and the opportunities lay close at hand . ''

		The portraits and other illustra - tions that embellish the text are appropriate and good , and the print is unusually clear and free from errors .

		Now , at last , a .

Saginaw	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , to the book-reading public .

		The author was paymas - ter of the ``
Saginaw	LOCATION	, '' which in its last cruise was engaged in carrying supplies to the
Midway Islands	LOCATION	, where the enlarging of a channel leading into the harbor was in progress .

		It was on her home voyage that the vessel , going out of her way to pick up any chance victims of shipwreck on
Ocean Island	LOCATION	, was herself wrecked on an outlying reef of that island .

		Luckily no lives were lost , but for nearly six months the ship 's company had a grim fight for existence on that low-lying spot of sandy desolation .

		How they economized their resources and eked out their rations with seal and albatross , how they tinkered up a condenser for supplying them with fresh water when rains were infrequent , how four of the men set out in the captain 's gig for the Sandwich Islands a thousand miles away to summon aid , and how only one reached his destination alive all this and much else is crammed into the terse diary account of the paymaster of the ill-fated vessel .

		Illustrations from drawings made at the time are given , and also photographs .

		The bane of our present-day investi - A neglected .

		gation in the modern languages , it has been charged , is its mediaevalism .

		Nevertheless , it is safe to predict that the Middle Ages will continue to furnish much of the materials for our doctors ' theses for some time to come ; the field affords specific problems , and it has by no means been exhausted as yet .

		Among the neglected problems belonging peculiarly to this field is that of the history and influence of the so-called political prophecy , a species of prophecy literary in form , but written , either ostensibly or actually , for political purposes .

		A painstaking study of this genre from the point of view of the British versions has recently been made by Dr.
Rupert Taylor	PERSON	in his volume entitled `` The Political Prophecy in
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author shows that the political prophecy first flourished in En - gland in the twelfth century , having been introduced by
Geoffrey	PERSON	of
Monmouth	LOCATION	, and that it attained its greatest vogue in the thirteenth and fourteenth cen - turies .

		In the
fifteenth century	DATE	it fell into disfavor , and in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	's time it came to be a favorite subject of burlesque .

		The species had become ex - tinct in
Great Britain	LOCATION	by the
end of the seventeenth century	DATE	.

		In the earlier versions the leading role is taken by the wizard
Merlin	PERSON	; and in the later versions Thomas a Becket plays a prominent part .

		The type appears to have enjoyed a wide popularity , and ex - ercised at one time , so Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	thinks , consider - able influence on political events .

		These volumes are numbered , respectively , two , seven , eight , nine , and sixteen .

		Eighteen volumes are to be included in the complete set .

		One is almost tempted to say that we get the most thorough studies of men and periods in English liter - ature from the group of younger French scholars who have made our literature their chosen field of research .

		Dr.
Floris Delattre	PERSON	is the latest of this company to make us his debtor , and his ''

M. Delattre	PERSON	has also given us -LRB- in English -RRB- a treatise on '' English Fairy Poetry from the Origins to the Seven - teenth Century '' -LRB- Frowde -RRB- an interesting study of a fascinating subject , for which he has placed students of our literature deeply in his debt .

		We are not told who is responsible for the translations offered , but we recommend them to the attention of the misguided people who think that these works should be sung in English , and who airily dismiss the objection that translations adequate for the purpose are practically impossible to make .

		A volume of `` Opera Synopses , '' prepared by Mr.

		Lovers of folk-lore will welcome the volume of '' Myths and Legends of
Alaska	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , compiled and edited by Miss
Katharine Benson Judson	PERSON	.

		This is a collection of some three score of the commonest folk-tales current among the Alaskan Indians .

		The raven is tin - chief figure in these legends .

		It was at the command of Raven that the world came into being , that man was created , that the Hood was sent upon the earth , and it was through his agency that fire was brought down from heaven and that the tides were made to ebb and How .

		Other animals that figure prominently are the porcupine , the beaver , the walrus , and the whale .

		Miss
Benson	PERSON	has reproduced these tales in a simple , terse English , approximating as nearly as possible the style of the natives ; at the same time , she has taken no liberties with the matter of her originals .

		Upwards of fifty full-page illustrations , de - picting life and customs among the Alaskans , add to the attractiveness of the volume .

		The country parishes of
England	LOCATION	furnish attractive fields for the student of the lore and legend of the En - glish Church .

		Some of them possess a deeper interest and enjoy world-wide fame because of the incumbency therein , at one time or another in the last three centuries , of men who will always live in the world of
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	thought .

		It is of visits to several of these parishes that Mr.
Ezra S. Tipple	PERSON	, of Drew Theological Seminary , writes in his book entitled '' Some Famous Country Par - ishes '' -LRB-
Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		He gives us some delightful sketches of
Hursley	ORGANIZATION	,
Bemerton	LOCATION	,
Madeley	PERSON	,
Kidderminster	LOCATION	,
Somersby	LOCATION	, and
Eversley	LOCATION	; and of
John Keble	PERSON	,
George Herbert	PERSON	,
John Fletcher	PERSON	,
Richard Baxter	PERSON	, the Tennysons , and
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	.

		The book is by no means ex - haustive of the parishes of
England	LOCATION	thus made famous .

		The selection was doubtless based upon individual pre - ferences ; but it was a wise selection , and it presents the names of persons of whom we love to read .

		The illus - trations are from photographs by the author .

		The collection of '' One Hundred Folk Songs of All Nations '' which Mr.
Granville Bantock	PERSON	has edited for the '' Musician 's Library '' of the Messrs.
Ditson	PERSON	, is one of the most attractive and valuable works now included in that admirable series .

		Mr.
Bantock	PERSON	con - tributes no introductory essay , but gives us instead notes upon the hundred songs , and an extensive biblio - graphy of the literature of folk-music .

		Practically all countries and races are represented , each by from one to four examples , excepting
Germany	LOCATION	, which has eleven .

		The American examples are '' Dixie , '' `` Tenting on the Old Camp Ground , '' and '' Old Folks at Home , '' be - sides two native pieces of Pawnee and
Dakota	LOCATION	origin .

		An important feature of this work is that with e \ er \ song the original text is given -LRB- transliterated when necessary -RRB- together with an English translation .

		A Chinaman , an Arab , a Turk , or
Finn	PERSON	might sing his national music directly from these pages .

		This is a veritable treasure-house of melodies familiar and un - familiar , for which we can not be too grateful to the scholarly editorial work of Mr.
Bantock	PERSON	.

		Two other
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 237 volumes now published in this collection are of a kind already well represented .

		One of them is Mr.
Carl Armbruster	PERSON	's selection of '' Thirty Songs by Franz Liszt '' ; the other is Mr.
H. E. Krehbiel	PERSON	's selection of '' Songs from the Operas for Baritone and Bass . ''

		The latter work represents twenty-three composers by twenty-seven numbers .

		The '' Musician 's Library '' now numbers upwards of sixty volumes , and more than ful - fills the promise of its inception .

		NOTES .

		A collection of posthumous essays by the late Profes - sor
Churton Collins	PERSON	is to be published shortly .

		Among the subjects are
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Burke	PERSON	, Word - sworth ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, and
Browning	PERSON	.

		It is announced that Mr.
Hermann J. Warner	PERSON	is the author of '' European Years : The Letters of an Idle Man , '' which was published anonymously last autumn by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, under the editorship of Mr.
George E. Woodberry	PERSON	.

		Three books by Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	hold a promi - nent place in the
spring	DATE	publishing lists .

		Two of these are plays , `` The Eldest Son '' and `` The Pigeon '' ; the other is a volume of poems , entitled '' Wild Oats : Moods , Songs , and Doggerels . ''

		Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	will publish these books in
America	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Rudolf Eucken	PERSON	of the
University of Jena	ORGANIZATION	, whose most popular book , ft The Problem of Human Life , '' as translated by Professors
Williston S. Hough	PERSON	and
W. R. Boyce Gibson	PERSON	, has just been published in a new and cheaper edition by the
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	, has been appointed Exchange Professor at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	for next autumn .

		The first number of a new architectural journal , en - titled '' The Architectural Quarterly of Harvard Uni - versity , '' will be published this month .

		The purpose of the periodical is to present in easily accessible form important work by students , special lectures delivered in the school , and contributions by members of the teaching staff and graduates .

		Three lectures on
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	have just been given in
London	LOCATION	by Sir
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	.

		The spe - cific subjects were : ''
R. L. S.	PERSON	: Personality and Per - sonal Writings '' ; `` R. L. S. : Tales , Fantasies , and Ro - mances '' ; and ''
R. L. S.	PERSON	: Some Comparisons with Other Writers . ''

		It is to be hoped that these lectures will soon find their way into book form .

		Mrs.
Hamilton King	PERSON	, author of '' The Disciples , '' a poem dealing with
Mazzini	PERSON	and the liberation and unity of
Italy	LOCATION	, is about to publish through Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	a book entitled '' Letters and Recollections of
Mazzini	PERSON	. ''

		It is a personal record of the more inti - mate side of
Mazzini	PERSON	's life during his later years , and contains some of his most characteristic letters .

		We learn that all preliminary arrangements have been made for a bibliography of the modern history of
Great Britain	LOCATION	which is to be compiled by the Committees of the
Royal Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	and of the
American Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work , of which Professor
G. W. Prothero	PERSON	is the general editor , will consist of three volumes , one general , one on the Tudor and
Stuart	PERSON	periods , and one on the Hanoverian period .

		Some six - teen scholars on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	are at present engaged upon the selection of titles and data for the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . ''

		The
Macmillan Standard Library	ORGANIZATION	'' is a series planned to provide at a nominal price well-made reprints of books in all fields of knowledge , published within the past few years , which have been accepted as authoritative contributions to their subjects , such books , for instance , as Professor
Veblen	PERSON	's '' Theory of the Leisure Class , '' Dr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's '' The Spirit of
America	LOCATION	, '' Rev.
R. J. Campbell	PERSON	's '' The New Theology , '' Miss
Jane Addams	PERSON	's '' The Spirit of Youth and the City Streets , '' Professor
L. A. Sherman	PERSON	's '' What Is Shakespeare ? ''

		etc. .

		The first issue of a monthly '' Index to Dates of Cur - rent Events '' has just been issued by the
R. R. Bowker	PERSON	Company of
New York	LOCATION	.

		This publication is the suc - cessor of two independent previous lists : the annual '' Index to Dates '' published since
1895	DATE	in the Annual Library Index , and the quarterly '' Current Events In - dex , '' begun by the
Wisconsin Free Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and published since
1910	DATE	by the
H. W. Wilson	PERSON	Company as a feature of their '' Readers ' Guide to Periodical Lit - erature . ''

		In its new form this Index should prove of immense value to many sorts of workers , forming as it does a classified summary of the world 's news .

		Foremost among articles of contemporary interest in '' The Hibbert Journal '' for
January	DATE	is that by Sir
Oliver Lodge	PERSON	defending the philosophy of
Henri Bergson	PERSON	against the recent strictures of Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	.

		Professor
J. Arthur Thomson	PERSON	continues his discussion , '' Is There One Science of Nature ? ''

		making out a strong case for those biologists who call themselves `` vitalists , '' and who deny that life can ever be understood or expressed much less created in terms of chemical or mechani - cal reactions .

		A summary of recent philosophical liter - ature by Professor
G. Dawes Hicks	PERSON	brings the general reader into intelligent touch with some most interest - ing developments in the field .

		The American agents for `` The Hibbert Journal '' are Messrs.
Sherman	PERSON	,
French & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		That
Dickens	PERSON	has a considerable vogue in
France	LOCATION	is shown in the extracts from appreciations by some dis - tinguished French critics printed in a recent number of the popular weekly journal , '' Les Annales . ''

		M.
Gaston Deschamps	PERSON	,
M. Paul Ginisty	PERSON	,
M. Anatole France	PERSON	,
M. Jules Claretie	PERSON	, and
M. Adolphe Brisson	PERSON	, are all to be found among the admirers of
Dickens	LOCATION	,
M. Ginisty	ORGANIZATION	going so far as to say that ''
Dickens	PERSON	is one of the very few foreign writers who have exerted an influence on French literature , and who have retained that influence . ''

		The same journal states that the
Franco-Russian Association of the University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	proposes to celebrate the centenary of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's birth by a lecture at the Sor - bonne , and readings from ''
David Copperfield	PERSON	, '' in which several of the leading actors and actresses of
Paris	LOCATION	will take part .

		The library of the
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	, at Washing - ton , has attained a size and importance unsuspected by many who would otherwise be glad to avail themselves of its freely-offered privileges .

		Numbering more than one hundred thousand volumes , the collection consti - tutes the best pedagogical library in the country , and under its present management it is constantly growing in size and usefulness .

		Its rooms are open to readers and students , and it lends books freely to those at a dis - tance , either by the inter-library system of loans , or directly to individual borrowers , books being sent out by mail , under frank , and retainable for two weeks as a rule .

		Special lists and bibliographies are furnished upon request , and in other ways the resources of the library are turned to the utmost possible profit of its users .

		The Squirrel Cage A personal and real tale of what might have happened to any one of us .

		This original and complete version of
Lydia Emery	PERSON	's love story embraces the influence on her life of her family ; of her lovable godfather ; of her husband , a potential captain of industry ; and of a radical young cabinet maker .

		Lydia grows from a care-free girl to a mature woman , who knows life and wants to choose for her children 's happiness and her own .

		unhampered by what the `` social '' hierarchy of a middle western town say and think .

		Her story makes us ask whether the social and business system which virtually sep - arate husbands from their wives and children is worth the material prosperity it creates or the sacrifice of comradeship usually necessary to keep the establishment whirling ?

		The value of travel as a means of culture has long been recognized , and everything that tends to lessen its difficulties , and to increase the number of those who may avail themselves of its inspiring influence , should be welcomed as an aid to that enlargement of view , that deepen - ing of sympathy , and that enrichment of the mind which are the objects of culture , by what - ever paths it be pursued .

		To '' survey man - kind from
China	LOCATION	to
Peru	LOCATION	'' with one 's own eyes is certainly the cultural equivalent for a great many college courses or other formal endeavors to gain an education .

		To quote Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's familiar words : '' That man is little to be en - vied whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plain of Marathon , or whose piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of lona . ''

		The development of patriotism and piety may not be reckoned among the avowed aims of the edu - cational process , but they are assuredly more de - sirable elements of culture than is the pedantry which is the product of too close an application to the letter of learning .

		It would be interesting to trace the growth of this idea during the last few centuries .

		The wandering scholar of the middle ages doubtless had some sub-conscious notion of the way in which the impressions of travel were enriching his life , even if the perils of his encounters with highwaymen and pirates and robber barons filled the forefront of his consciousness , leaving scant opportunity for introspective survey .

		It was the excitement of adventure , and the wonder of the unknown , rather than any set purpose of self - improvement , that impelled the Elizabethans upon their journeyings to far lands and among strange peoples ; but they were building better than they knew , and laying the foundations , not of character alone , but also of a large intellectual tolerance which was making them citizens of the world of ideas rather than denizens of some bailiwick of provincial prejudice .

		They might return laden with Spanish treasure , or bursting with the report of the new lands of their discov - ery ; they also brought themselves back as new men , transformed by contact with distant things and peoples , filled with rich memories , and with a clear-eyed capacity for dealing intelligently with their own personal problems of thought and
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
April 1	DATE	, action .

		The Horatian saying that `` who cross the seas their skies change , not their souls '' is not to be accepted without qualification ; such changes as are possible to the soul in the way of development are quite naturally brought about by foreign travel .

		It was a realization of this truth that made the seventeenth and eighteenth century descendant of the adventurous
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan regard the '' grand tour '' as the crowning stage of a young gentleman 's education , as the one thing essential to transform the mere scholar into the man of the world .

		Travel may , in fact , be taken as one of the most searching tests of personality , and often discloses unexpected capacities and possibilities .

		How sharply do the experiences of travel serve to bring out the contrast between the vacuous mind and stolid temperament , on the one hand , and the richly-furnished intelligence allied with emotional capacity on the other !

		Somewhere in the writings of
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	of Rugby there is a passage upon the
Mediterranean Sea	LOCATION	, in which its meaning to the traveller who beholds in it only a body of water with picturesque shores is contrasted with its meaning to the trav - eller who views it in the light of its immense historical suggestiveness , and in whose richly - stored mind it evokes a tumultuous throng of images which make the past live anew in color and in action .

		With what quickening of mem - ory and exaltation of spirit does the pilgrim who is worthy of the experience visit the old-world spots where great issues have trembled in the balance upon the field of battle
Marathon	ORGANIZATION	,
Lake Trasimene	LOCATION	,
Stiklestad	LOCATION	,

Ravenna	LOCATION	,

Bayreuth	LOCATION	; the spots invested by legend with a significance that rivals fact in its appeal to the imagination
Sinai	ORGANIZATION	,
Delphi	ORGANIZATION	, Avernus , the
Venusberg	LOCATION	,
Montserrat	LOCATION	.

		Each of these places , and each of countless others , may become to the reader much more than a geographical expres - sion , to the visitor , much more than a halting - place to be remembered chiefly by the quality of its inn , if he but prepare himself by study and reflection for the revelation which it has to offer .

		The case of the typical AmM-ir : n man of busi - ness in
Europe	LOCATION	upon a vacation is , rightly con - sidered , one of the most pitiable that can be imagined .

		It is , indeed , a vacation of the mind , for its customary content is lacking , and there is no iv > idiimu of thought and feeling to de - rive healthy and truly re-creative exercise from contact with its strange new environment .

		I It - demands material comforts , and usually gets them , for their price is measured in the material coin with which his pockets are lined .

		But those delights which are purchasable only with the coin of knowledge and of taste are unknown to him .

		He finds no texts in the Bible of
Amiens	LOCATION	, no sermons in the Stones of
Venice	LOCATION	; for him are the Seven Lamps of Architecture kindled in vain .

		He has not the historical consciousness which would tell another that he was treading on holy ground , or the social consciousness which in another would bear fruit of penetrative sym - pathy with the life of alien peoples .

		For him .

		the galleries of art are sights to be wearily `` done '' when there is no escape from the duty ; the concert-hall has no message for one who thinks of music only as an adjunct of the res - taurant and the street parade , and the theatre no instruction for one who is ignorant of all tongues but his own nasal speech .

		So he con - sorts with his fellow Americans , sharers in a common boredom , and his converse with them is of the market reports , and of such news from
America	LOCATION	as trickles into his ear from the
Conti	ORGANIZATION	- nental press .

		The case of his children is equally pathetic , although youth has possibilities which save the case from being quite hopeless .

		Ruskin describes it once for all in `` Fors Clavigera . ''

		He was going from
Venice	LOCATION	to
Verona	LOCATION	by the afternoon train , and in the carriage were two American girls with their parents . ''

		Here they were , specimens of the utmost which the money and invention of the nineteenth century could pro- duce in maidenhood children of its most progressive race enjoying the full advantages of political liberty , of enlightened philosophical education , of cheap pilfered literature , and of luxury at any cost ... And they were travelling through a district which , if any in the world , should touch the hearts and delight the eyes of young girls .

		Exquisite midsummer sunshine , with low rays , glanced through the vine-leaves ; all the Alps were clear , from the
Lake of Garda	LOCATION	to
Cadore	LOCATION	, and to farthest
Tyrol	LOCATION	.

		What a princess 's cham - ber , this , if these are princesses , and what dreams might they not dream , therein !

		But the two American girls were neither princesses , nor S-TS .

		nor dreamers .

		By infinite self-indulgence , they had reduced themselves simply to two pieces of white putty that could feel pain .

		The Hies and dust stuck to them as to clay , and they perceived , between
Venice	LOCATION	and
Verona	LOCATION	, nothing but the
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 265 flies and the dvist .

		They pulled down the blinds the moment they entered the carriage , and then sprawled , and writhed , and tossed among the cushions of it , with every miserable sensation of bodily affliction that could make time intolerable .

		They were dressed in thin white frocks , coming vaguely open at the backs as they stretched or wriggled ; they had French novels , lemons , and lumps of sugar , to beguile their state with ; the novels hanging together by the ends of string that had once stitched them ; or adhering at the corners in densely bruised dog 's - ears , out of which the girls , wetting their fingers , occasionally extricated a gluey leaf .

		From time to time , they cut a lemon open , ground a lump of sugar backwards and forwards over it till every fibre was in a treacly pulp ; then sucked the pulp , and gnawed the white skin into leathery strings , for the sake of its bitter .

		Only one sentence was exchanged , in the fifty miles , on the subject of things outside the carriage -LRB- the Alps being once visible from a station where they had drawn up the blinds -RRB- . '

		Do n't those snow-caps make you cool ? '

		< No I wish they did . '

		And so they went their way , with sealed eyes and tor - mented limbs , their numbered miles of pain . ''

		It sometimes seems as if the means of travel , and the opportunities which it offers for culture , were most frequently allotted by a malicious fate to just those people who are congenitally or by virtue of defective training incapable of responding to its stimulus or appreciating its advantages , while those who might profit by it most richly are restricted to travel of the arm - chair and fire-side sort , perhaps supplemented by visits to the picture-show .

		There is not a little to be said for these vicarious forms of travel , and photography has done much to bring to our doors the '' sights '' which formerly could be seen only at the cost of long journeyings .

		One who has witnessed , for example , an exhibi - tion of the colored film-pictures of last year 's Coronation , feels that he has actually been pres - ent at the spectacle , and has , indeed , in some respects seen it to better advantage than would have been possible to the average tourist .

		The profusely illustrated book of travel reproduces distant scenes , including many that the tourist would find it difficult to view , in such a way as to make them seem very familiar .

		There are many respects in which these substitutes for experience are inadequate , but they provide a resource that was hardly dreamed of by the last generation .

		As for travel itself , while it is not cheap , ex - cept for those who `` rough it '' on the road after the fashion of
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	in his `` Views Afoot , '' it is much less expensive than it used to be , and the '' grand tour '' no longer needs the outlay , and may be made with much more than the comfort , of the days in which it was not to be thought of by the multitude .

		One can go around the world at a surprisingly mod - erate cost , and so speedily that the eighty days , which seemed a marvel when
Jules Verne	PERSON	wrote of the adventures of
Phileas Fogg	PERSON	, has been reduced to sixty or less .

		To-day , one can book with any tourist agency for
Vladivostok	LOCATION	or Samarcand , for Delhi or
Khartoum	LOCATION	.

		Both Hammarfest and
Sandy Point	ORGANIZATION	are included in the regular vacation itinerary , and both offer the apparatus of civilization to welcome the visitor .

		Special excursions enable one to visit the Spanish Main and the
Caucasus	LOCATION	and the ^ Egean under luxurious conditions , and this very
summer	DATE	one can , if one wishes , embark upon a monster steamship at
Bremen	LOCATION	, sail to the palseocrystic sea within something like ten degrees distance from the
North Pole	LOCATION	, and return to the starting - point exactly four weeks from the date of de - parture .

		Another
summer	DATE	will perhaps provide an excursion to the ice-barrier of the Antarctic , now that the explorations of
Shackleton	LOCATION	and
Amundsen	PERSON	have made it familiar .

		There is wonder in all this , even if the eyes of the mar - iner behold no mount of Purgatory rising from the remote seas ; and whatever keeps alive the sense of wonder makes an important contribu - tion to the life of culture .

		THE PROBLEM OF
LAFCADIO HEARN	PERSON	.

		`` Form and substance are one , '' says
William Blake	PERSON	somewhere ; and continues : '' I have heard many people say , ' Give me the ideas , it is no mat - ter what words you put them into , ' and others say , ' Give me the design , it is no matter for the execu - tion . '

		These people knew enough of artifice , but nothing of art .

		Ideas can not be given but in their minutely appropriate words , nor can a design be made without its minutely appropriate execution . ''

		Spoken by
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, there would be nothing sur - prising in the statement which I have copied out as a kind of text .

		Emanating from an English poet , it holds our attention as being foreign to the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	standpoint .

		If , however , one were asked what author , out of all our writers of yesterday , practised such a doctrine , one could name his man .

		In the work of
Laf	ORGANIZATION	cadio
Hearn	PERSON	, at least , '' form and substance are one . ''

		By fate 's irony , one of his critics has yet been able to write with a shade of justifica - tion that Hearn '' created or invented nothing ; his stories were always told him by others .

		... A multicolored echo . ''

		It was
Hearn	PERSON	, withal , who most perfectly represents , among the modern writ - ers whom I know , a harmony of sense and form , of words and music .

		Now ,
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's mystery derived , not from any literary obscurity , but from his reserve toward the general public , from his unfortunate way of dropping those with whom he had entered upon terms of intimacy , from the clouds which obscure his THE D1AJL |
April 1	DATE	, beginnings , and , finally , from his disappearance into the
East	LOCATION	, and his absorption of or by that East 's greater mysteries .

		Thus it is that
Stedman	PERSON	could assert that `` Hearn will in time -RRB- > < a - much of a romantic personality and tradition as
Poe	ORGANIZATION	is now . ''

		For the moment , however , the enigma of the writer 's personality pales before another enigma : that of his work .

		How reconcile the paradox of one for whom form and substance are one , yet whose nature was chameleon-like , and whose plumes were borrowed ?

		How reconcile other seeming incongruities , only too easily suggested ?

		* Certainly there is something baffling about every - thing that he put his hand to if we except his journeyman 's work -LRB- and very good work , too -RRB- as a newspaper writer .

		His interpretation of
Japan	LOCATION	has been fairly described as the most remarkable at - tempt at the interpretation of an alien race ever made , in any language ; and yet it was produced by one who never himself mastered the Japanese tongue .

		This is not the chief difficulty , however .

		For what are we to think of his interpretation of the elder civilization of
Japan	LOCATION	not merely in the book which he calls ''
Japan	LOCATION	: An Attempt at Inter - pretation , '' but as we find it in all his volumes of studies and legends ?

		What are we to think of it , that is , now that certain documents of an intimate sort have been recently published in the so-called One of these startling incongruities is revealed by
Hearn	PERSON	himself in describing his method of composition in the final period of his craftsmanship .

		There are two methods of work , he writes : the first -LRB- fatiguing beyond expression -RRB- is `` to force thought by concentration '' ; the second `` is to force the work only , and let the thought develop itself . '' ''

		The subject is before me ; I ca n't bother even thinking about it .

		That would tire me too much .

		I simply arrange the note * , and write down whatever part of the subject most pleases me first .

		I write hur - riedly without care .

		Then I put the MS. aside for the day , and do something else more agreeable .

		Next day I read over the page * written , correct , and write them all over again .

		In the course of doing this , quite mechanically , new thoughU come up , error * make themselves felt , improvement * are suggested .

		I stop .

		Next day I rewrite the third time .

		This I * the best time .

		The result is a great improvement usually , but not perfection .

		I then take clean paper and begin to make the final copy .

		Usually , this ha * to be done twice .

		In the course of four or fire rewriting * , the whole thought reshapes itself , and the whole style U changed and fixed .

		The work ha * done itself , developed , grown ; it would have been very different had I trusted to the first thought ... `` The result is amazing .

		The average is five perfect page * -LRB- not printed page * -RRB- a day , with about two or three hour * ' work .

		By the other method one or two page * a day are extremely difficult to write ... though ... I have had to rewrite page * fifty tune * . ''

		While industry is attested , so too is a singular limitation in mental force .

		I can not help wondering how nearly thin method of composition comes to
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's Flaubert not only being an object of
Beam	ORGANIZATION	's admiration , but an equally labored stylist .

		Mr.
Hnneker	PERSON	, it is true , has a shrewd suspicion that Flaubert nursed the '' legend '' of his terrible pangs in literary creation , and hints that life at Croisset consisted in no small degree in the pleasures of sleep and Ji finer if and pipe-smoking .

		Flaubert is only one of the modern Frenchmen whom
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	studied with zeal ; besides translating the '' Saint-Antoine , '' a volume by
Gautier	PERSON	, and
France	LOCATION	's ``
Sylvestre Bonnard	PERSON	, '' he translated for the
New Orleans	LOCATION	'' Times-Democrat '' about two hundred stories and passages , chiefly from contemporary French literature .

		Hearn himself has been translated into French , in part , at least ; while a sympathetic critical and biographical study by
M. Joseph de Smet	PERSON	appeared only
last fall	DATE	-LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	: Mercure de
France	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		As M. de Smet remarks ,
Hearn	PERSON	`` studied painstakingly all the line issued from Flau - bert , '' and `` his methods of work were formed in that study . '' ''

		Japanese Letters , '' edited by his sympathetic biog - rapher ?

		One may learn here how melancholy was the man . '

		* I am absolutely unproductive now , '' he writes in one letter of depression ; '' hovering between one thing and another , sometimes angry with men , sometimes with the Gods . ''

		But we were aln-ailv aware how pathetic was this figure , best likened -LRB- in the simile of a Japanese poem of the people -RRB- to '' The water-weed drifting , finding no place of attachment . '

		* The first value of the '' Japanese Letters '' lies , not so much in the insight they give us into
Hearn	PERSON	' H personality , as in the light they throw or seem to throw , since we are for the moment left in no little perplexity on
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's later writings .

		What are we to think when the author of '' Kwaidan '' and '' Kokoro '' writes : '' The finale of my long correspondence with you on the Japanese character is frankly this ... I hate and detest the Japanese ... '' adding , wistfully , `` There 's a nice confession '' ; then , with more vigor , '' D n the Japanese ! ''

		Before deciding what to think of it all , one may read further .

		A letter to his American friend , \ \ .


B. Mason	PERSON	, is instructive .

		`` Professor
Chamberlain	PERSON	spoke to me about the variability of one 's feelings toward
Japan	LOCATION	being like the oscillations of a pen - dulum : one day swinging towards pessimism , and the next to optimism .

		I have this feeling very often , and I suppose you must have had it many times .

		But the pessimistic feeling is generally coincident with some experience of
New Japan	LOCATION	, and the optimistic with something of Old
Japan	LOCATION	.

		... With what hideous rapidity
Japan	LOCATION	is modern - izing after all ! ''

		For one who has read
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	with either thorough - ness or sympathy , there is no suspicion that he was to an appreciable degree insincere in his writings about the Japanese .

		He was at first radiantly happy in achieving his life-dream : the study of the Oriental mind at close range ; life in a wonderful exotic king - dom of flowers and singing cicada .

		But , apart from the fact that
Japan	LOCATION	is itself in transition , apart from the fact that the student of
Japan	LOCATION	must oscil - late , as
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	says Professor
Chamberlain	PERSON	put it .

		between optimism and pessimism , admiration and repulsion , there is the personal element to be taken into account .

		Hearn was
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	.

		That means , in part , that he was one of those who have set up '' Whim '' over their portals .

		It means , too , that he was a victim of romantic nostalgia literally , as well as in critics ' cant , a native of No-man 's Land .

		To quote this man himself , he suffered from the nostalgia which is rather a world-sickness than a home-sickness '' '' like an unutterable wish to flee away from the Present into the Unknown . ''

		It was not in him to be lastingly happy anywhere .

		Earlier , in
New Orleans	LOCATION	, his imagination , captured at first by the tropical and intoxicating beauty of the old Creole city , with all its contrasts , was soon satt - .

		l , and we find him writing to Mr.
Krehbiel	PERSON	, at
New York	LOCATION	, '' I am very weary of
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		The cit \
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 267 of my dreams ... has vanished . ''

		Philosophically , morally , and aesthetically , no less than nationally , he was a hybrid and hybrids are notoriously unhappy .

		But to return to his own report of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		It is well to reread , now that we have the new instal - ment of Letters , the '' Attempt at Interpretation . '' ''

		According to the degree of altruism within your - self , '' he writes of the Japanese , `` these good folk will be able , without any apparent effort , to make you happy .

		The mere sensation of the milieu is a placid happiness ... Yes , for a little time these fairy folk can give you all the soft bliss of sleep . ''

		Neither here nor elsewhere does
Hearn	PERSON	tell us of the other side of the picture , tell us , that is , in concrete terms .

		Except in his correspondence , he scarcely hints at anything morally unbeautiful .

		Nor does he discuss the evil smells of the town , its beggars and lepers .

		As we grow , nowadays , to know
Hearn	PERSON	better , we realize how he strove in all his writings about
Japan	LOCATION	to throw over his reader that spell of illusion cast , for a time , over himself .

		This is , it seems to me , the lesson of these new letters , which made , on the first reading , so harsh an impression .

		But that his earlier contentment in
Japan	LOCATION	was illu - sionary , he himself knew : knew long before the rest of us ; knew long before cruel and perhaps unjust treatment was accorded him as a teacher in the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	.

		u It will lift at last , '' he writes in his ''
Japan	LOCATION	'' of this fondly cherished illusion , '' like those vapors of
spring	DATE	which lend preter - natural loveliness to a Japanese landscape in the fore - noon of radiant days .

		Really you are happy because you have entered bodily into
Fairyland	LOCATION	, into a world that is not , and never could be , your own . ''

		In
Hearn	PERSON	's tales of Old
Japan	LOCATION	, and in his wonder - ful essays , he brings us very close to the wonder - land that he sketches for us in the `` Interpretation . ''

		But what was
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's literary doctrine ?

		He ex - pounds it in a letter of
June , 1908	DATE	-LRB- '' Life and Letters , '' II. , 343 -RRB- .

		`` Artistic literature can never be raw truth , any more than a photograph can be compared with a painting .

		Here is a little sentence from one of the greatest of modern French writers : ` Z , a litterature n ' a pas la verite pout I ` objet .

		II faut demander la ve ` rite ' aux sciences ... il ne faut pas la de - mander k la litterature , qui n ' a et ne pent avoir d'objet que le beau . '' ''

		I have written these sentences from
Anatole France	LOCATION	, quoted by one who received them as gospel , across the flyleaf of `` Out of the East . ''

		In justice to him who reproduced them , I have added what
Hearn	PERSON	himself adds in his letter : '' Remember that noth - ing can be beautiful which does not contain truth . ''

		Fortunately , if we only read aright ,
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	's best work stands even his own tests tests not wanting in severity .

		Practically , as well as in his theory of aesthetics , the writer made noteworthy progress .

		No really satisfactory account of
Hearn	ORGANIZATION	has yet appeared .

		In many ways the most comprehensive is Mrs.
Nina H. Kennard	PERSON	's recently-published vol - ume , faulty as it is in details .

		But I hope that we may long be spared a '' scientific '' biography of
Hearn	LOCATION	.

		Knowledge of those who have wrought exquisite things is not always to be had with impunity .

		It is not always even desirable .

		There were dark places in the career of this elusive genius who , without belong - ing to the family of the greater geniuses , succeeded as no one else in retelling the tales of
Old Japan	LOCATION	in the English tongue , and in imparting to what Mr.
Noguchi	PERSON	described as his '' Spencerian-Buddhistic Studies '' a charming and penetrating accent of mystery .

		Hearn 's Japanese critic lays emphasis , however , on the retold tales : and here we must fol - low him .

		Hearn 's later work , done in the gray and blue coloring of his adopted country , though it wants the fire and enthusiasm of his first impressions , re - ceives the highest praise of the Japanese , as shining with
Hearn	PERSON	's '' golden light , which was as old as a
spring	DATE	in
Horai	ORGANIZATION	; its slowness was poetry and its reticence was a blessing . ''

		No longer did this writer practise style for style 's sake .

		Let us then be con - tent with the knowledge that his best poetry , his '' blessings , '' have an appeal truer and deeper than that of mere exoticism , skilfully managed like the japoneries of
Pierre Loti	PERSON	.

		Their beauty is not wasted even upon the critic born in the land of whose myths and elder traditions they are the treasury .

		And while we have testimony that the Japanese home-life of the man whose '' absolute lack of prac - tical sexual virtue '' one of his American judges has condemned , was , in reality , idyllic , let us not dwell on that : if only to avoid the reopening of contro - versv -

		CAS
UAL	ORGANIZATION	COMMENT .

		THE WAYS OF ARCHIVISTS are not always like those of the lately - retired Adjutant-General whose custodianship of the War Department archives might remind a visitor of the rules metrically formulated by the admirable
Jared Bean	PERSON	in his famous '' Old Librarian 's Almanack . ''

		From the ''
Ars Bibliothe	PERSON	- carii , '' there made public , we quote four pertinent lines : '' Let naught intrude ; to all the World be blind , And chase each vain allurement from your Mind .

		Be also deaf : ' t is well to turn the Lock , And let who will the outer portal knock . ''

		An impressive array of remonstrances against this safe and conservative guardianship of literary treas - ure appears in the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post , '' from certain scholars who in the past have sought to pursue their researches among the archives of the
War Department	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of these remonstrants , for example , desired that certain files of old newspapers might be rendered accessible to historians , and with the approval and encouragement of high govern - ment officials he applied for permission to explain his wishes .

		But , with a deep sense of the sacred - ness of his person as custodian of government prop - erty , the archivist refused to admit the applicant to his presence , and sent a colored servant to announce 268 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, that the newspapers were stored away and nothing could be done in the matter .

		Another indignant gentleman , instead of praising this faithful watch - dog of the archives , has something to say about a dog in the manger ; and still another even claims that the effete monarchies of the Old World are ahead of us in their housing of and care for govern - ment documents . ''

		Even
Finland	LOCATION	, '' he goes so far as to aftirm , '' has a handsome Staatsarchiv , which I had the pleasure of visiting recently , and where I found the records very intelligently cared for and the way of the investigator made smooth and allur - ing . ''

		Would not the excellent Jared Bean have shuddered to contemplate such exposure of ancient archives to the public gaze and touch ?

		OUR ENGLISH GUEST , the one who at the present writing is holding our interested attention , is Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		It is a relief to be assured that he has not come to receive impressions for future literary use in the magazines , although one of his alertness , his keenness of observation , his suscepti - bility to impressions , could not well avoid receiving a good many new and , we hope , favorable impres - sions while he tarries with us . ''

		A man whose busi - ness it is to write , '' he is reported as saying , '' and who has any human feeling whatsoever , ca n't go through the streets of
London	LOCATION	, or of any other place .

		and see the people , and the lives they live , without being moved .

		He sees wrongness and injustice and suffering , and so he writes about wrongness and in - justice and suffering .

		And if he is an artist and a human man , he suffers , too .

		And so the purpose of what he writes , the picturing of something that is bad and should be made better , is utterly unconscious .

		And it is inevitable ... for a man who writes , who sees and writes what he sees , it is just inevitable . ''

		It is this '' inevitability '' in Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's as in every other true artist 's work that gives it its excel - lence ; and so , after all , we hope he will feel him - self inevitably moved to utterance by some of the American scenes and events that meet his eyes .

		* PRIMITIVE LIBRARY ECONOMY , often of an amus - ing nature , forms the subject of some of Mr.
Ernest A. Savage	PERSON	's scholarly and interesting chapters in his recent book , '' Old English Libraries . ''

		Rules governing the circulation of books at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were of a sort that would in this age of hustle and hurry arouse much dissatisfaction .

		We complain now , and with some reason , if we are denied the privilege of exchanging a book the same day it is borrowed ; but at
Oriel College	ORGANIZATION	the borrowers could take out books from the college library only onoe a year , and only one book at a time , while at
Peter	PERSON	- house it was ruled that all the books not chained might be circulated once every two years on a day to be fixed by the Master and Senior Dean . ''

		But at
New College	ORGANIZATION	an exceptional liberality prevailed : - students in civil and canon law could have two books -LSB- at once , apparently -RSB- for their special use during the time they devoted themselves to those facilities '' ami `` if books remained over , after tin - * distribution , they were to be distributed annually in the usual way . ''

		So precious were books in th < .

		After expressing to

		THE DIAL 269 MOVING A LARGE BOOK-COLLECTION , such as that of a great public library when a new building is taken possession of , presents some practical problems , especially when it is desired to interrupt as little as possible the free use and circulation of the books themselves .

		Few such removals have been effected as speedily as that which took place recently in
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, upon the completion of that city 's new library building .

		As the old and the new buildings were but a few rods apart , a mechanical conveying apparatus a sort of elevated railway was used for the trans-shipment , and the entire col - lection of 180,000 volumes was moved in seven days , without an hour 's interruption to the regular library service .

		Compare this with the record of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, for example , in 1894-95 .

		It is true that the old Boylston Street building was half a mile or more from the new one in
Copley Square	LOCATION	, which made impossible any such speedy transfer as at
Springfield	LOCATION	.

		As a matter of fact , moving operations began
December 14	DATE	, and were finished
January 28	DATE	, though the circulation of books from the new build - ing did not begin until
March 4	DATE	, after being , dis - continued at the old more than a month before .

		Therefore , though the actual momentum mass multiplied by velocity may have been not so very different in the two instances , still one must view with admiration and approbation the late
Springfield	LOCATION	achievement .

		... ECONOMY OF EFFORT IN WRITING , just as in speaking , though to a lesser extent , is continually producing abbreviations unknown to an earlier gen - eration .

		At the present moment a tendency is observ - able to contract '' in so far '' into one word .

		We have long had `` inasmuch '' ; why not , then , `` insofar '' ?

		`` Nevertheless '' now strikes no reader as odd or barbarous , and the day will doubtless come when `` nonetheless '' will take its place in the dictionary as a single word .

		Many readers not yet old will recall the time when `` any one `` and `` everyone '' and the less common `` onto '' were invariably printed as `` any one '' and `` every one '' and `` on to . ''

		The last-named is still in the transition stage .

		Rather remarkable is it that `` to-day '' and `` to-morrow '' and `` o'clock , '' common though they are and written every day by nearly everyone , still remain in a state of imperfect compression , though one does occasion - ally see `` today '' and `` tomorrow '' in print , and more often in writing .

		These slight changes and economies that the decades work in our speech , written as well as spoken , though they may evoke a sigh now and then from the purist or the old fogy , nevertheless pleasantly serve as vivid reminders that it is a living language in which we express our thoughts , and not a medium to be unalterably fixed or artificially fitted by worrisome word-tinkerers to some Procrustean bed of phonetics .

		MR.
MORGAN	PERSON	'S GIFT TO
GOTTINGEN	LOCATION	UNIVERSITY , whereby the English literature department finds itself enriched to the extent of fifty thousand dollars , recalls the fact that two years of the donor 's youth were spent in study -LRB- and some other things -RRB- at that famous old seminary of learning .

		But it was in mathematics and not in literature that he specialized , and one might have expected him to spend his spare pin-money in strengthening the mathematical depart - ment , the more so as he appears to have been a favorite of his teacher there .

		Years after the young American student had completed his course in mathe - matics and mud-baths at
Gottingen	LOCATION	, as his biographer , Mr.
Carl Hovey	PERSON	, now relates , the professor of mathe - matics under whom he had studied visited this coun - try and found his former pupil a commanding figure in the world of finance .

		Meeting him at a dinner given in honor of the German visitor , the latter created some amusement by deploring the financier 's defection from pure science , where if he had only remained he might unquestionably have become as - sistant professor of mathematics at
Gdttingen	LOCATION	, and , on the death of the incumbent , would undoubtedly have succeeded to the professorship .

		But the promising pupil had perversely chosen to apply his mathematical knowledge to more practical problems than were likely to arise at
Gottingen	LOCATION	.

		* TARIFF BARS AGAINST IMPORTED BOOKS are about to be raised still higher if a recent decision of the
Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION	, as announced by the Ap - praiser of the Port of
New York	LOCATION	, is to be the rule governing future customs duties on such importa - tions .

		This decision is aimed particularly at those American publishers who import imprinted editions of English publications in quantities of from one hundred to several thousand copies .

		Often such books are cooperative enterprises , the expense of which is borne equally by the English and the
Ameri	PERSON	- can publisher ; and the American edition is therefore invoiced for customs purposes at its proportionate share of the actual cost of manufacture .

		Heretofore the duty has been paid on such actual cost ; but the zealous Appraiser now proposes an innovation .

		D'ANNUNZIO AS A NATIONAL POET .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I seem to recall having seen in
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL some vague and rather unsympathetic notice of the re - markable series of Canzoni in triple rhyme which
Gabriele d'Annunzio	PERSON	printed in rapid succession last fall in the
Corriere delta Sera of Milan	LOCATION	.

		On the 24th of
January	DATE	a first edition of this poem was sequestrated by a timid administration on account of a few satirical stanzas of which I shall submit a free translation .

		A second edition of the book now appears , beautifully printed by Treves .

		Now this book impresses me as being perhaps the most re - markable one yet produced by d'Annunzio , who , despite prejudice , remains , such as he is , the first poet of
Italy	LOCATION	since the death of
Carducci	LOCATION	, M incon - testably as was Swinburne the first poet of En - gland after the death of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		Formally , the book is the fourth volume of the
Laudi	PERSON	-LRB-
Lauds of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, Sea ,
Earth	LOCATION	, and Heroes -RRB- .

		It consists of ten cantos of masterly versification , whose titles I ren - der as follows : The Song of
Oversea	LOCATION	, the
Song of Blood	ORGANIZATION	, the Song of the Sacrament , the Song of the Trophies , the
Song of Diana	ORGANIZATION	, the
Song of Helen of France	ORGANIZATION	, the Song of the Dardanelles , the Song of
Humbert Cagni	PERSON	, the Song of
Mario Bianco	PERSON	, the Last Song .

		The poem is certainly full of dazzling passages , though I apprehend that it will be found as a whole somewhat lacking in sustained power , and in single cantos more or less invertebrate .

		The form , and the frequent homage to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	in the way of quotation or allusion , as well as the apostrophes to the cities of
Italy	LOCATION	, render comparison with the Divine Poet inevitable .

		Whether or not such comparison be , as may seem , challenged by the modern poet , it is cer - tainly unfortunate for him .

		With all his undeniable talent , eloquence , alertness , mastery of his instru - ment , d'Annunzio falls palpably short in the three qualifications in which
Dante	ORGANIZATION	is supreme , in grasp , in seriousness of purpose , in character .

		But it is very unfair to suggest such a comparison , which would be crushing to any modern poet since
Milton	LOCATION	, and in some respects even to him .

		I leave criticism to those who shall be able to give the poem that exact scrutiny which it doubtless deserves , but for which I have not leisure .

		Time and patience , indeed , are requisite , inasmuch as the cantos swarm with allusions to local Italian history , local , perforce , because from the break-up of the Roman Empire to the founding of the Kingdom of
Italy	LOCATION	all Italian history was the history of a multitude of separate and generally warring communities rather than of a nation .

		Even intelligent Italians find themselves at sea upon this vast flood of local allusion , and the poet himself has felt the need of appending a com - mentary .

		Thin is a heavy handicap upon the r < a < l * i .

		who , in the course of these interesting historical ex - cursions , is apt to forget the starting-point .

		From this commentary I quote the following impressive words which give the key or leit-motiv of the poem : '' That national consciotuneu is strongest which is moat intimately tempered by time and by example ... The most powerful nation is not that one which improvises its emtgy and ardor , bat rather that one which , with the faith and the will resultant from all it * past ages , as well as with its newly acquired virtue , broadens like a flood of many waters toward the unknown future .

		Therefore Memory is the Muse of this poem . ''

		Whether or not the poet has attained his purpose of being the Tyrtaeus of the Italian enterprise in
North Africa	LOCATION	, these cantos have at the present time a more than literary interest , are , indeed , the national apologia for that enterprise , an apologia the argument of which is briefly something like the following : For historical as well as for geographical reasons ,
Italy	LOCATION	is , more than any other nation except
Greece	LOCATION	, vitally interested in maintaining itself upon that great sea which , under whatever name ,
Tyr	ORGANIZATION	- rhene ,
Ionic	LOCATION	,
Adriatic	LOCATION	,
/ Kgean	PERSON	, is essentially one and
Mediterranean	LOCATION	.

		As the channel between the French coast and the English is necessarily the English Channel , so by equal political necessity the channel between
Italy	LOCATION	and
Epirus	LOCATION	is Otrantine , not Epirote , and the channel between
Sicily	LOCATION	and
Tunis	LOCATION	is not Tunisian but Sicilian . ''

		Italia fara da se , '' said her greatest statesman ; she will not exist , as does the Kingdom of
Greece	LOCATION	, by the sufferance of her neighbors .

		Obviously she can not fulfil the prophecy of
Cavour	LOCATION	, hemmed in on every side by powers each one of which is individually more powerful than she , while the supremacy of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	is divided between
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		Imagine England in the geographical situation of
Italy	LOCATION	: would not
England	LOCATION	's stake in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	be immeasurably greater than it now is ?

		As to
France	LOCATION	, where she has twe great doors opening upon the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	she has four upon the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		The disintegrated despotism of
Turkey	LOCATION	, weak in all that respects efficient government , strong only in fanat - icism and ferocity , exists only by sufferance and not by what may be called , as in the case of
Greece	LOCATION	, an enlightened sufferance .

		If there be such a thing * as manifest destiny , it would seem to point to an Italian protectorate in
Tunis	LOCATION	, which stretches its arms toward
Italy	LOCATION	halfway across the sea , can , indeed , be seen in fair weather from
Sicily	LOCATION	.


Italy	LOCATION	was too weak to dispute the claims of
France	LOCATION	in
that quarter	DATE	, but she has other and better than strategical reasons for still insisting upon a footing on the north coast of
Africa	LOCATION	: the same reasons that
Japan	LOCATION	has for demanding a footing on the nearest mainland .

		The over-exploited Italian peninsula , rich as it naturally is , has not bread enough for all her swarming chil - dren , who are obliged to seek it through the world

		THE DIAL 271 from the
Levant	LOCATION	to
Argentina	LOCATION	.

		What more natural than that
Italy	LOCATION	should anticipate
France	LOCATION	or Ger - many or
Austria	LOCATION	in establishing a colony on that part of the North African shore which is still prac - tically vacant and ungoverned ?

		It is a question of economic as well as of national independence .

		The justifications that English , French , American states - men put forward for their respective acts of '' benev - olent absorption '' in the
Transvaal	LOCATION	, in
Algiers	LOCATION	, in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, were shadowy in comparison with those of
Italy	LOCATION	for her adventure in
Tripolitania	LOCATION	and
Cyrenaica	LOCATION	.

		If results have justified the English '' condominium '' in
Egypt	LOCATION	and the French colon - ization of
Algeria	LOCATION	, we may fairly expect that the Italian empire over the waiting desert may equally justify itself .

		Considerations like these may appear out of place in a purely literary article , but they are in fact essen - tial to an appreciation of the point of view of the Italian national poet .

		Whatever may be the final decision of the civilized world as to the rights and wrongs of questions so complicated as those here raised , the observer who would understand the pres - ent remarkable unanimity of the Italian nation , the reader who would give ear to the most recent strains of the Italian Muse , must accord at least imaginative sympathy to the line of thought I have so briefly sketched .

		If a
Burke	PERSON	could not draw up an indict - ment against a great nation , who is likely to have so perfect a vision of history as to be able to give the lie to a great national conviction ?

		If I can judge from abroad as to the impressions that prevail in the
United States	LOCATION	with respect to the war in
Africa	LOCATION	, the point of view I have indicated deserves attention .

		At all events , it is essential to the appreciation of the principal passage which I now offer the reader as a fine example of the poetic treatment of a national theme .

		I will not indulge in a trite apology for the shortcomings of a translation in which no one will expect the direct and inevitable sweep of the original , but which at worst is , I hope , a little better than a prose version .

		In La Canzone -LRB- TOltremare the Italian people is addressed as follows by Victory : With me toward the burning - Desert speed , Toward the sphinxless desert-land with me , That waits the foot , the furrow , and the seed , With me , O fruitful race , that girdest thee To walk upon the ancient ways again Leading to selfhood and to destiny , With me where warriors to reap remain , That in the coronal upon thy brow I braid the oaken leaf with bladed grain !

		Beholdest thou me to-day upon the prow Erect in arms , to-morrow I incline My knee upon the glebe that waits the plow , While bare-brawn legions break the battle-line , And beat their spears to pruning-hooks , and fill Thy hungry hands with corn , thy vats with wine .

		Too long against the threatened fever-chill And threatened sleep , I watched in
Ostia	LOCATION	dead , My face to Tiber-slime reverted still , Alone my wakeful bivouac I made Between the pillars which the harbor mark , That glow at vespertide with fatal red , And held my palpitating breath to hark If the great shade of some Divinity Enter the river-mouth with Fortune 's barque .

		Ah , since so long that awful bourne by me Was sentinelled , be now my slumber light And brief beneath the Arch beyond the sea !

		Gyrene 's Grecian dream be mine to-night Under the Arch of the wise Emperor Rescued from sand and barbarous despite , Wide to the triumph , while from every prore Shines peace in
Latin Tripoli	LOCATION	, a train Of camels bringing perfumes to her door .

		sacred odors blown across the plain From unknown lands to where the ocean lies , Frankincense tawny as the lion 's mane , And wheat and herds and minerals and spice ; And
Berenice	PERSON	with her golden hair !

		In shadow of the sword is Paradise .

		Here are the prohibited stanzas from La Canzone del Dardanelli : But one fears more than all the others : he , The executioner angelical , The Angel of the eternal gallows-tree .

		Another miracle : they round him draw The noose , now spotless girdle , to denote The old decrepit hangman 's pious awe , While every night he dreams he feels his throat Clutched by the mutilated jewelled hand That stained with blood the pocket of the Croat !

		The foolish art of censorship has given a prom - inence to this bit of satire which it does not in itself deserve .

		One feels the inferiority of d'Annunzio in this line I do not say to
Dante	LOCATION	to
Carducci	PERSON	or to
Leopardi	LOCATION	.

		The allusion to the jewelled female hand found in the pocket of a dead Austrian soldier is explained in d'Annunzio 's commentary .

		The satire , if to the address of old
Francis Joseph	PERSON	, is almost as ferocious as the deed !

		This is not the only passage in which the poet , aiming at saeva indignatio , degenerates into abusiveness .

		One turns with relief to the sweeping picture of a desert battle in the Song of
Diana	LOCATION	, to the descrip - tion of
Cagni	ORGANIZATION	's polar enterprise , to the many splendid historical pictures .

		One of the most beautiful of all is the apostrophe to
Genoa	LOCATION	about
Garibaldi	PERSON	and
Mazzini	PERSON	in La
Canzone del Sangue	ORGANIZATION	.

		So between Love and Death the hero stood , Embarking with his crew red-garmented , While to one soul he fused that brotherhood , Nor did he turn again his noble head Toward the eternal shore , for fear to miss Eurydice whom out of Hell he led .

		And so didst thou , but unaware of this , Nurse the pale outlaw of the brow and eye , Banished from home without a
Beatrice	LOCATION	; Who in the languor of that twilight sky , Like to a beacon lifted up his woe , Like to a banner raised his thought on high , And to the flesh , yoke-ridden by the foe , Breathed that third breath of life , which every where Doth warm us now , and palpitate , and glow .

		HOUSE .

		* It was in
1817	DATE	that
James	PERSON	and
John Harper	PERSON	, the two eldest of the four brothers who estab - lished the great publishing house now known the world over , entered into a partnership under the style of J. &
J. Harper	PERSON	, and started business as printers in a dingy little room in
Dover Street	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, where , as their first important piece of work , they superintended and largely executed in person the printing of Seneca 's '' Morals '' for the elder
Duyckinck	PERSON	, a bookseller of note in his time .

		The next year
Locke	PERSON	's '' Essay on the Human Understanding '' was undertaken inde - pendently by the young printers , who first , how - ever , secured enough orders from the booksellers to warrant the success of the enterprise .

		Such were the beginnings of the '' House of
Harper	PERSON	, '' whose history is now traced by Mr.
J. Henry Harper	PERSON	, one of the third generation of Harpers at present conducting the business handed down from fathers to sons for almost a century .

		The completion of the original quar - tet of printer-publishers took place in
1825	DATE	, when
Fletcher Harper	PERSON	, the youngest of the four brothers , entered the firm , two years after the third brother ,
Joseph Wesley Harper	PERSON	, had cast in his lot with the infant establishment .

		Then followed a steady and increasingly rapid develop - ment of the business , connections being formed with many of our leading writers , and consider - able republishing of foreign works being also undertaken , with gratifying results to the house .

		Four times within three decades serious fire losses were sustained and quickly recovered from , the most disastrous calamity of the sort being that of
1853	DATE	in
Pearl	LOCATION	and
Cliff Streets	LOCATION	, where had been built the largest and best-equipped plant of its kind in the world , that of Brockhaus in
Leipzig	LOCATION	ranking next .

		The present fire-proof buildings , occupying the site of those destroyed , were erected with all possible speed after the clearing-away of the ruins ; and as temporary quarters had meanwhile been secured , the regu - lar business of the house was not interrupted for a single day .

		Reverting to the foregoing reference to the Harpers ' republication of English books , one finds some interesting notes on the subject in an early chapter of Mr.
Harper	PERSON	's history , which THE HOUHK or

		Voluntary payments in large sums have from the first been made to foreign authors whose works were brought out by the Harpers , although of course the publishers enjoyed until recently no copyright protection in making such ventures , and the authors could legally demand no royalties .

1700	DATE	for a single novel .


Wilkie Collins	PERSON	,
Charles Reade	PERSON	,
Macaulay	LOCATION	, and many other English authors were liberally treated by the same house in the days before international copyright .

		The author adds that the record-books of many other prominent American publishers , some of whom he names , would show a similar array of facts and figures , and make clear that while .

		many people in this country and
England	LOCATION	were of the opinion that the editions of English books pub - lished in this country brought no pecuniary re - turn to the authors , the facts were that large sums were regularly paid by American pub - lishers for the privilege of a few days ' priority .

		These arrangements were satisfactory , with few exceptions , to English authors , and were usually sought by them . ''

		A most attractive feature of Mr.
Harper	PERSON	's richly reminiscent book is the part devoted to the distinguished authors and editors and other literacy or artist workers whose names have be - come associated with the
Harper	PERSON	firm .

		Some - times these persons are made to tell in part , in the form of letters or of especially prepared papers , the story of their connection with the house .

		Particularly interesting is the portion thus contributed by Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, and not less welcome is the account of Mr.
Henry M. Alden	PERSON	from Mr.
Harper	PERSON	's pen ; also full of entertain - ing recollections are the pages relating to
Mark Twain	PERSON	, to
George William Curtis	PERSON	, to General
Lew Wallace	PERSON	, to
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	and
William Black	PERSON	and Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	and numerous others .

		In Mr.
Alden	PERSON	's own words occurs the following brief characterization of the four
Harper	PERSON	brothers as he first knew them in the early sixties : '' For nearly six yean after my connection with the establishment the beautiful association of the four Har - per brothers remained unbroken .

		They were known among themselves and their intimates by sobriquets whose origin referred to a time far antedating my ac - quaintance with them .

		James was for obvious reason known aa ` the Mayor ' ;
John	PERSON	was ` the Colonel ' ;
Joseph Wesley	PERSON	` the Captain ' ;
Fletcher	PERSON	` the Major . '

		How
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 273 indelible in my memory are the faces of these men and their frankly disclosed characters ! ''

		Of the good old-fashioned business methods of these gentlemen some pleasing glimpses are given .

		The subjoined anecdote , illustrating
Fletcher Harper	PERSON	's winning manner in his daily routine , is here in place : ``
Frederick Halpin	PERSON	was one of the last of the old steel-plate portrait engravers .

		He frequently did work for the
House	ORGANIZATION	, which was always in the highest degree satisfactory .

		He had the artistic temperament , was gentle , modest and unobtrusive in manner .

		One day he brought in a portrait which he had engraved for the
House	ORGANIZATION	, and it was taken to Mr.
Fletcher Harper	PERSON	, who looked over the proof of the portrait very carefully .

		Turning to
Halpin	PERSON	, he said most pleasantly , ' It is a very fine piece of work , Mr.
Halpin	PERSON	; what is your bill ? '


Halpin	PERSON	said very modestly , as if almost ashamed to mention the sum , ' One hundred and fifty dollars . '

		` Is that all ? '

		said Mr.
Harper	PERSON	; ' I wish for your sake it was more , ' and he immediately paid the bill .

		Of course this is a small circumstance , but it is not always that successful business men meet demands upon them in the same cordial , encouraging spirit . ''


Fletcher Harper	PERSON	, by the way , was the grand - father of Mr.
J. Henry Harper	PERSON	, and not unnat - urally many instances are cited of his conspicuous ability as the head of the literary department of the business and supervisor of its work in illus - tration and of other details having to do with the artistic side of printing and publishing .

		But the other brothers also are shown in their character - istic traits .

		For example , of the eldest , we read : ``
James Harper	PERSON	in many respects reminds one of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, or rather of what Lincoln would prob - ably have been had a less heavy burden been laid upon his shoulders .

		There was the same keen sense of humor , the same fondness for jokes and witticisms , and the same readiness in finding or making an anecdote pat to the purpose .

		James 's favorite way was to father his joke upon the person to whom he was speaking .

		Apropos of anything that came up he would say , ' That puts me in mind of what you told me once , ' and then would come some story most likely invented on the spot . '

		Why !

		Mr.
Harper	PERSON	, ' would come the response , ' I never told you that ; in fact , I never heard it before . ' '

		It is quite possible , ' would be the rejoinder , ` but if it was not you it must have been somebody else , ' and then would prob - ably come another story . ''

		`` A keener judge of character I never knew , '' says one of his old friends . ''

		While apparently joking with a man , he was taking his measure , and in this he was rarely mistaken .

		If he thought him trustworthy there was no limit to his friend - liness , not merely in word , but in act . ''

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's account of his connection with the Harpers should be read and enjoyed in its entirety .

		Near its close he says , in reference to the firm 's reorganization of a dozen years ago and the placing of its affairs under the able management of Colonel Harvey : '' Since then I have remained attached to the
House of Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, with no desire for any other business relations .

		As there is some superstition to the contrary , and authors and publishers are supposed to be natural enemies , I think I may properly testify here to the friendship which has always existed between my publishers and myself .

		I do not believe the instance is uncommon , at least in
America	LOCATION	, though I have heard terrible things about authors and publishers in
England	LOCATION	, while from my own Scotch publishers I have constantly experienced a consideration worthy of
Franklin Square	LOCATION	in the past and in the present . ''


Mark Twain	PERSON	, of whom some characteristic anecdotes are told in the book , regretted in later years that he had not assumed two pseudonyms , one for humorous and the other for serious pro- ductions .

		His historical and sociological study , '' The Prince and the Pauper , '' was written , he himself declared , in entire seriousness and after months of careful reading-up on the period in which the little Prince and his Pauper double were supposed to have lived .

		But it was no use ; the signature `` Mark Twain '' proved the ruin of the book as a sober and earnest piece of work .

		Hence the anonymity of his next attempt in sim - ilar vein , `` Joan of Arc . ''

		`` And did any of these literary highbrows suggest in all their ravings that it was a book of humor ? ''

		asks the author . ''

		Well , I guess not !

		Mark Twain at last stood for something more than mere tom - foolery . ''

		Mention must not be omitted of the chapter devoted to the cartoonist
Nast	ORGANIZATION	and his part in breaking up the notorious Tweed Ring .

		The
New York	LOCATION	'' Times , '' with
Louis J. Jennings	PERSON	in the editorial chair and
George Jones	PERSON	to back him up as proprietor of the paper , and `` Har - per 's Weekly , '' with the genius of
Nast	ORGANIZATION	in its service , fought mightily and effectively for mu - nicipal reform ; and Mr.
Harper	PERSON	's account of the campaign is good reading , and shows the
House of Harper	ORGANIZATION	as a valiant champion of the right .

		The last chapter of the book , except the brief '' Conclusion , '' contains a full and eulo - gistic review of the business activity of Colonel
George Harvey	PERSON	, the present president of the
Harper	PERSON	corporation , and a many-sided genius whose commercial acumen and administrative ability promise well for the increasing future prosperity of the great publishing house under his direction .

		If its second century of achieve - ment shall prompt some yet unborn
Harper	PERSON	to produce as excellent and gratifying a record of progress as that just put forth in so handsome a form , with so much of literary charm , and so appropriately and richly illustrated , there will be only one thing to regret , that we can not be there to read it .

		HISTORY OF OUR TARIFF .

		* In all American history it would be difficult to find an issue which has been more persistently before the public than that of the tariff .

		The chief difference between the demand for protec - tion to-day and that of a century or more ago is that when
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	was advocat - ing this policy the infant manufactures thought themselves fortunate if they could secure duties of five to fifteen per cent , while now these in - fants have attained such growth and propor - tions that nothing less than a duty averaging at least fifty per cent will satisfy the cravings of their hunger and keep them alive at least so they tell us .

		Perhaps this is one reason why the problem has attained such prominence of late .

		At any rate we may be sure that before the current year is over we shall all have heard a great deal about the tariff .

		Hence we may wel - come the appearance in book form of the articles on that subject which Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	originally contributed to '' The American Magazine . ''

		The volume is chiefly welcome , however , be - cause it treats the topic from a point of view unlike that of most previous writers .

		On the economic side of the question we already have Professor
Taussig	PERSON	's authoritative work .

		Others have dealt with its political history .

		But in the book before us still another phase of the subject is developed , and it is one which much needs attention .

		To quote the author herself , here '' is an attempt to tell in narrative form the story of this defeat of the popular will , '' since , '' as far as the tariff has been concerned public opinion has never been fairly embodied in the bills adopted . ''

		Had this popular will been followed '' there would be to-day no duties on iron and steel products , on cheap cottons and cotton mix - tures , and certainly none on a great variety of raw materials probably including raw wool . ''

		The reason is that in these cases and many others either the purposes of protection have been realized or it has been proved that they never could be realized , and in either instance the duty should be withdrawn .

		Some readers will be inclined to doubt whether the author has gone into the question as to the economic effects of the tariff with sufficient thoroughness entirely to fulfil this promise .

		What she has given us is rather a story of how the tariff is actually made , a description of how private bar - gaining , special interests , lobbying and political wire-pulling , rather than economic principles , THB TARIFF IK OUR TIMES .

		By
Ida M. Tarbell	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macnnllan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		have in fact determined the actual construction of our tariff schedules ; in short , it is what we may call the moral history of the tariff .

		Such .

		indeed , in the end , serins to !

		> the author 's own conclusion , for in the last chapter we find her writing : `` Simmered down to its final essence the tariff question as it stands in this country to-day is a question of national morals , a ques - tion of the kind of men it is making . ''

		And we must add that the evidence here adduced is only too convincing .

		Miss
Tarbell	PERSON	* s narrative begins with the Civil War , the period which marks such an abrupt change in our tariff legislation .

		A glance at the preceding years shows that with the first strong demand for fairly high protection , which came after the War of
1812	DATE	, several sorts of manufactures secured duties ranging from fif - teen to thirty per cent .

		The demand continu - ing , the duties were raised from time to time , the movement culminating in the famous Tariff of Abominations '' of 1 8 28 .

		From then on , until
1860	DATE	, the trend of duties in all the tariff acts but that of
1842	DATE	was steadily downward , partly due to the growing opposition and influence of the South , partly to the fact that manufactures seemed to progress in spite of the reductions .

		On the outbreak of the Civil War the govern - ment naturally turned to the tariff , since from the first customs duties had been the chief source of revenue .

		Throughout the war rates were rap - idly advanced , so that the average rate on duti - able commodities in
1864	DATE	was forty-seven per cent as compared with about twenty per cent in
1860	DATE	.

		But the really significant fact is that these high rates , which everyone assumed to be simply temporary , which , in fact , could never have been obtained but for the pressure of a great crisis , not only were not appreciably re - duced , generally speaking , after the war -LRB- the revenue duties excepted -RRB- , but in more recent years have actually been still further increased , till in
1897	DATE	, on the passage of the
Dingley Tariff	ORGANIZATION	, the country reached a level of duties averaging fifty-seven per cent , the highest in our history .

		One might almost infer that the longer we had a tariff the more we needed it .

		At least the situation is bound to arouse one 's curiosity and to lead to the inquiry , how is it possible to bring about a trend of affairs so diametrically the oppo - site of what we might reasonably expect ?

		This is what
Miss Tarbell	PERSON	tries to explain , and the nar - rative , vividly told and full of the human ele - ment , is as interesting as it is illuminating .

		A typical example of tariff-making is fur - nished by the now famous wool and woolens
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 275 schedule .

		The interests of the growers and manufacturers of wool are naturally absolutely opposed so far as concerns the price of wool .

		The manufacturers , however , are willing to work for a duty on wool which will raise the price of that product provided the growers will in turn lend their political support to secure a duty on manufactures of wool .

		But inasmuch as the cost of the manufacturer 's raw material has been increased he very reasonably demands , and gets , in addition to the protective duty on his cloth , a compensating duty to offset the increased cost of his wool .

		Back in
1867	DATE	the manufacturer declared that twenty-five per cent net protection was all that he needed , but now he is obtaining much more ; while it may be noted , incidentally , that the compensating duty is adjusted on a basis which generally much more than offsets the duty on raw wool and thus really affords just so much additional protection .

		Sometimes a schedule is shaped by give-and-take bargain - ing of this sort , at other times it is chiefly deter - mined by the insistent demands of one person , as when Senator
Sherman	PERSON	practically held up the whole Republican Party for a higher duty on pig iron , or when
Wharton	PERSON	got his duty on nickel , or Whitman his duty on wool-tops .

		The extent to which this may go is well illustrated by the tariff-making of
1894	DATE	, at which time one senator after another threatened to prevent any legislation until his particular duties were granted , the result leading
Tom Reed	PERSON	to declare that the bill was '' framed upon the broad bed - rock foundation of the necessities of securing forty-three votes , and all minor considerations had to give way to this great underlying princi - ple . ''

		Thus it always happened that , in one or another of these ways , the interests of certain individuals or sections won out , while economic principles , even those of scientific protection , were no less completely ignored than the desires of the party or the well-being of the people as a whole .

		But when the author turns from the ethics of tariff-making to some of the economic aspects of the problem the treatment is less satisfactory .

		The conclusions concerning the economic effects of the duties need a considerably more accurate and keenly analytical study , and there is fre - quent evidence of the common tendency to exag - gerate the tariff 's influence .

		For example , it is implied that the tariff is largely responsible for the conditions which exist in the mills of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	and the evils shown by the
Pittsburg	LOCATION	Survey .

		Would that this were so !

		for then we could find in its removal a panacea of such power as the most hopeful social worker has seldom dreamed .

		These evils are , alas !

		far more deeply rooted than the tariff , and their removal infi - nitely more difficult and complicated .

		It is to be wished that such exaggeration had been avoided , but a volume intended to arouse people on an important moral issue should not be seriously criticized on these grounds .

		A narrative of this character is much more likely to catch the public eye and accomplish the desired result than the painstaking analysis of the carefully trained economist , important as such an analysis may be in its place .

		Finally , let it be noted that one who believes in scientific protection may condemn the methods of tariff - making here portrayed quite as sincerely as one who believes in free trade .

		It is not until all the people are keenly conscious of the evils which have grown up in connection with these methods that the country can hope to secure that scientific tariff , be it protective or for revenue only , for which everyone so strongly hopes .

		In securing such a tariff this book should prove a powerful aid .

		RE-ENTER DOCTOR JOHXSON .

		* So firm a hold on us has the rugged personality of
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	that his is still a name to con - jure with .

		How odd it is that this grotesquely unromantic figure should periodically issue forth with an irresistible appeal to the romantic side of our imagination .

		When in doubt , intro - duce Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	this is warrantable advice to the searcher for literary types or themes .

		And once again we welcome with responsive interest the latest re-appearance of the honest , irascible , sententious old dictator in the very entertaining volume compiled by Professor Tinker .

		Is the Johnsonian tradition the creation of
Boswell	ORGANIZATION	, as Macaulay implied , or is it rather due to the dominating personality of
Johnson	PERSON	himself ?

		Mr.
Tinker	PERSON	believes that it was
John	PERSON	- son who made
Boswell	PERSON	great .

		It is not possible to discover
Johnson	PERSON	's greatness in his literary work ; it is evident that he represents more than he achieved in his books `` that he stimulated more than he wrote . ''

		THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, quick anticipation when the old lion enters ?

		To meet with
Johnson	PERSON	, we are accustomed to go to BOB well ; and our visits with the Doctor are likely to begin and end with these excursions .

		Some of us may have the habit , like a certain Pres - byterian pastor of scholarly taste and human in - stincts who once said in a moment of confidential fellowship : '' I keep my
Boswell	PERSON	on my study table and usually read a passage from it before retiring . ''

		But it is good to be reminded that the faithful
Scotchman	PERSON	is not the only contem - porary chronicler of the sayings and doings of
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	.

		The diary and letters of
Fanny Burney	ORGANIZATION	are rich in something more than mere reminiscence : here are dramatic sketches , amazingly vivid and at full length .

		She met Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	first in
1777	DATE	, in her father 's house .

		Fanny 's sisters were playing a duet when the great man was announced .

		lit - is indeed very ill-favoured ; is tall and stout ; but stoops terribly ; he is almost bent double .

		His mouth is almost continually opening and shutting , as if he was chewing .

		He has a strange method of frequently twirl - ing his fingers , and twisting his hands .

		His body is in continual agitation , see-sawing up and down ; his feet are never a moment quiet ; and , in short , his whole person is in perpetual motion .

		His dress , too , considering the times , and that he had meant to put on his best becomes , being engaged to dine in a large company , was as much out of the common road as his figure ; he had a large wig , snuff-color coat , and gold buttons , but no ruffles to his shirt , doughty -LSB- dirty ? -RSB-

		fists , and black worsted stockings .

		He is shockingly near-sighted , and did not , till she held out her hand to him , even know Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	.

		He poked his nose over the keys of the harpsichord , till the duet was finished , and then my father introduced
Hetty	PERSON	to him as an old acquaintance , and he cordially kissed her ! ''

		And the writer goes on to say that as they were in the library , the Doctor 's attention was at once drawn to the books , from which he could not be diverted .

		Poring over them shelf by shelf , almost touching their backs with his eye-lashes , he at last fixed upon one and began without further ceremony to read to himself ; when the company adjourned to the drawing-room he entered into the conversation .

		In the
summer of 1778	DATE	Miss
Burney	PERSON	made her first visit with Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	at
Streatham	LOCATION	, a visit made memorable as the occasion of her inti - mate acquaintance with
Johnson	PERSON	.

		She was not yet publicly known as the author of ''
Evelina	PERSON	, '' which was then being read and praised by every - body , but Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	was in the secret and con - fidentially imparted it to the dictator , who had himself been beguiled into reading the novel .

		To the infinite delight of the young author ,
John	PERSON	- son had nothing but praise for
Evelina	LOCATION	'' and admiration for Miss
Burney	PERSON	; and from the hour of their acquaintance to that of his death he was her admirer and friend .

		The little gallantries of speech and conduct which attended his kind - ness to the novelist are set forth most amusingly in the journal . ''

		After supper , Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	turned the discourse upon silent folks whether by way of reflection and i - proof , or by accident , I know not ; but I do know he is provoked with me for not talking more ; and I was afraid he was seriously provoked ; but , a little while ago , I went into the music-room where he was tete-a-tete with Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	, and calling me to him , he took my hand , and made me sit next him , in a manner that seeinrd truly affectionate . ''

		Sir , ' cried I , ' I was much afraid I was going out of your favor t ' '' ' Why so ?

		What should make you think so ? '

		` Why , I do n't know my silence , I believe .

		I be - gan to fear you would give me up . '

		`` No , my darling !

		my dear little
Burney	PERSON	, no .

		When I give you up ' '' What then , sir ? '

		cried Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	. ''

		Why , I do n't know ; for whoever could give her up would deserve worse than I can say ; 1 know not what would be bad enough . '

		Now for
this morning	TIME	's breakfast .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, as usual , came hist into the library ; he was in high spirits , and full of mirth and sport .

		I had the honor of sitting next to him ; and now , all at once , he flung aside his reserve , thinking , perhaps , that it was time I should fling aside mine .

		`` Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	told him that she intended taking me to Mr. T 's . ''

		So you ought , madam , ' cried he ; 4 ' t is your business to be
Cicerone	PERSON	to her . '

		`` Then suddenly he snatched my hand , and kissing it , Ah ! '

		he added , ' they will little think what a Tartar you carry to them ! ' ''

		` No , that .

		they wo n't ! '

		cried Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	; ` Miss
Burney	PERSON	looks so meek and so quiet , nobody would sus - pect what a comical girl she is ; but I believe she has a great deal of malice at heart . ' ''

		` Oh , she 's a toad , ' cried the doctor , laughing ' a sly young rogue t with her Smiths and her Branghtons ! ' ''

		Miss
Burney	PERSON	evidently put her powers of dramatic interpretation to as vigorous and happy use in these intimate accounts as she did in de - lineating the characters in her novels .

		Usually the dialogue is thoroughly vivacious ; occasion - ally it is altogether Johnsonese in its formality . ''

		Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	. '

		Your compliments , sir , are made seldom , but when they are made they have an elegance unequalled ; but then when you are angry , who dares make speeches so bitter and cruel ? ' ''

		Dr.
J. ' Madame	PERSON	, I am always sorry when I mnke bitter speeches , and 1 never do it but when I am insuf - ferably vexed . ' ''

		Quite typical is the scene described by
Miss Burney	PERSON	as occurring at : i party jiv ' i 1 > \ Mr - .

		Let wit be dressed how it will , it will be equally wit , and neither the more nor the less for any advantage dress can give it . '

		`` Mr.
P.	PERSON	' But , sir , may not wit be so ill expressed , and so obscure , by a bad speaker , as to be lost ? ' ''

		Dr. J .

		The fault , then , sir , must be with the hearer .

		If a man can not distinguish wit from words , he little deserves to hear it . ' ''

		Mr.
P. <	PERSON	But , sir , what Pope means ' '' Dr.
J.	PERSON	' Sir , what Pope means , if he means what he says , is both false and foolish .

		In the first place , '' what oft was thought , '' is all the worse for being often thought , because to be wit , it ought to be newly thought . ' ''

		Mr.
P.	PERSON	' But , sir , ' t is the expression that makes it new . ' ''

		Dr.
J.	PERSON	' How can the expression make it new ?

		It may make it clear , or may make it elegant ; but how new ?

		You are confounding words with things . ' ''

		Mr.
P.	PERSON	' But , sir , if one man says a thing very ill , may not another man say it so much better that ' '' Dr. J .

		That other man , sir , deserves but small praise for the amendment ; he is but the tailor to the first man 's thoughts . ' ''

		Mr.
P.	PERSON	' True , sir , he may be the tailor ; but then the difference is as great as between a man in a gold lace suit and a man in a blanket . '

		`` Dr. J. ` Just so , sir , I thank you for that : the difference is precisely such , since it consists neither in the gold lace suit nor the blanket , but in the man by whom they are worn . '

		`` This was the summary ; the various contemptuous sarcasms intermixed would fill , and very unpleasantly , a quire . ''

		There are some two hundred pages of this material thus brought together in an arrange - ment approximately chronological .

		Forty addi - tional pages contain further allusions to
John	PERSON	- son found in
Miss Burney	LOCATION	's later memoirs of her father . ''

		It is remarkable , '' says the edi - tor , '' that no such volume has appeared before ; for , apart from
Boswell	PERSON	, there is no account of
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	more lifelike and picturesque than
Miss Burney	PERSON	's .

		Yet although practi - cally all the other
Johnsonian	DATE	material has been edited with scrupulous care ,
Miss Burney	PERSON	's account has been allowed to remain scattered through the pages of two voluminous diaries and hidden in the now-forgotten ` Memoirs of Dr.
Burney	PERSON	. ' ''

		The reader of this volume will echo the senti - ment .

		He will , indeed , find it difficult to take leave of the volume until he has finished it .

		It contains more than it promises ; for while the ponderous figure of the great
Samuel	PERSON	, awkwardly see-sawing in its chair , dominates every scene , there are a dozen brilliant notabilities of the day joining in the discourse and listening In varied moods for the pregnant '' Sir ! ''

		of the oracle .

		Here sits Lady
Mary Montague	PERSON	, some - what stiffly on this occasion ; for she and the Doctor have had their falling out .

		Here come
Burke	PERSON	and
Reynolds	PERSON	to pay their compliments to Fanny ; here , too , for once at least comes
Boswell	PERSON	, surprised to find that the chair at his hero 's elbow is reserved for another ; and there is Mrs.
Thrale	PERSON	, and many lesser lights who re - flect , at least , the brightness of the few .

		Last but not least , sharing the centre of the stage , self-conscious but hardly less captivating now than then , is little
Burney	PERSON	herself . ''

		Whoever could give her up would deserve worse than I could say ; I know not what would be bad enough ! ''

		So said the Doctor ; and we say amen I

		THE ART OF
INDIA	LOCATION	.

		* '' Undoubtedly the most significant fact in modern Western art is that artists , dimly con - scious of the limitations which the narrow con - ventions of the Italian Renaissance have so long imposed upon them , have been looking for many years once more to the East for new ideas and new sources of inspiration . ''

		With this ingenious and ingenuous ming - ling of truth and error , Mr.
E. B. Havell	PERSON	begins his exposition of '' The Ideals of Indian Art . '' '

		It is without doubt of the highest significance that art lovers in the West are in steadily in - creasing numbers finding spiritual refreshment in the art of the
Far East	LOCATION	, and are beginning to realize that the message it holds is one of prime importance .

		But it is our art lovers rather than our artists -LRB- who may be art lovers , but seldom are in the broad sense in which the term is here used -RRB- who are thus turning to the
East	LOCATION	.

		Of the artists only a few of the more thoughtful are so doing , and they are more than dimly conscious of the stifling effect of the false standards to which most of their fellows are committed , and from which they find it extremely difficult to break away .

		Had their revolt begun many years ago , as Mr.
Havell	PERSON	implies , it is fair to presume that the results as shown in their work would be much more pronounced than they have as yet become .

		As a class our artists are not very impressionable .

		Modern training does not conduce to this .

		It might be supposed that of all men they would be the quickest to recognize merit in any work of art , however strange its form .

		Instead the effect of the neo-romautic individualism in which most of them are steeped , * THE IDEALS OF INDIAN ART .

		278 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	, and of the habit of concentrating their attention upon scientific problems of realistic representa - tion , is that from paintings and sculpture con - ceived in a spirit different from that to which they are accustomed they turn away unmoved .

		And Far Eastern art works in particular are likely to mean little or nothing to them because they do not understand them .

		The wider public outside the studios is for the most part ignorant of art , and either echoes the artists ' views , or , in looking at works of art , sees only the subject matter .

		Still on the whole , the public is more receptive of new ideas than the artists are , and it includes a group of de - voted students who have performed a service of inestimable value to the advancement of art by their efforts to make the art of the
East	LOCATION	widely known and appreciated for the vital thing it is .

		Mr.
Havell	PERSON	, though an artist , should be counted in this group .

		He was for some years the principal of the
Government School of Art	ORGANIZATION	in
Calcutta	LOCATION	, and it is due to his initiative and per - severance that Indian students have abandoned the attempt to master European methods and have been induced to resume their native tra - ditions in art , with most encouraging results as shown in the work of his pupils and notably in that of Mr.
Tagore	PERSON	.

		As director of the
Calcutta Art Gallery	ORGANIZATION	, also , Mr.
Havell	PERSON	performed true knight 's service for the recognition of Indian art .

		Four years ago be published his '' Indian Sculpture and Painting . ''

		This was a pioneer work .

		Not enough is known about the histor - ical development of art in
India	LOCATION	to afford mate - rial for more than an incomplete sketch .

		What he accomplished was to give an idea of the scope and character of the creative arts of painting and sculpture as practised in
India	LOCATION	from ancient times , and to tell of the existence of a much larger remnant of notable works than were gen - erally known .

		His attempt to interpret the aims and ideals of the artists was less successful .

		His enthusiasm did not meet with quite the response from the critics that he seems to have expected , and partly in reply to their exceptions to what they regarded as over-statements and partly to fill in `` particulars necessarily omitted , '' he again addresses himself to the public in a work which may in a sense be considered supple - mental to the earlier book .

		In Indian idealism Mr.
Havell	PERSON	finds `` the key to the understanding , not only of all Asiatic art but of that of the Christian art of the Middle Ages . ''

		Baldly stated , this means that not only Indian art but a large part of European art should be viewed as the exponent of religious emotion .

		The author does not leave us in doubt as to where he stands .

		`` The true aim of the arti-t i * not to extract Ix-auty from nature , but to reveal the Life within life , the Noumenon within phenomenon , Ae Reality within un - reality , and the Soul within matter .

		When that is re - vealed , beauty reveals itself .

		So all nature is beautiful for us , if only we can realize the
Divine Idea	ORGANIZATION	within it .

		There if nothing common or unclean in what God has made , but we can only make life beautiful for ourselves by the power of the spirit that is within us .

		Therefore it is , as the sage
Sukracharya	PERSON	says , that , in making images of the gods , the artist should depend upon spirit - ual vision only , and not upon the appearance of ol > perceived by human senses . ''

		It may be that the cultivation of this faculty of spiritual vision was the main endeavor of the Indian artist in the golden age of Indian art and literature ... when the immortal Hindu epics , the Ram ay ana and the
Mahabharata	LOCATION	, were moulded into their present form ; when the poet
Kalidasa	PERSON	sang at the court of
King Vikrama	LOCATION	; and when the sc-nlp - tors of
Elephanta	LOCATION	and
Kllora	PERSON	hewed out of stupendous masses of living rock their visions of the gods throned in their Himalayan paradise , '' though one suspects that Mr.
Havell	PERSON	draws somewhat upon his imagination in making this statement , as he does also when he goes back to the Vedic age for the origin of Indian art , and asserts that it '' was conceived when that wonder - ful intuition flashed upon the Indian mind that the soul of man is eternal and one with the Su - preme Soul , the Lord and Creator of all things . ''

		Without doubt the content of Indian art is not intelligible unless interpreted in the light of Indian religion and philosophy .

		And in the principle insisted upon in the ritual of the Indian yogin , that it is necessary for the artist to identify himself absolutely with his subject , there is a measure of truth , for an artist can express only what he feels .

		But it can not be too often pointed out that art is not the thing said but the manner of saying .

		Though the artists who produced the great religious paintings and sculptures were believers , and may even have been fiery zealots , the force that quickened the creative impulse and inspired the masterpieces was not religious emotion but love of the work itself , or , in other words , the desire of the artist soul for self - expression .

		Religious fervor alone never brought forth a work of art .

		Its tendency is rather to turn the artist from his art .

		Indeed it would seem not improbable that herein lies at least a partial explanation of the fact that in
India	LOCATION	art did not reach the full development it attains !

		in
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, though it was
India	LOCATION	that gave those lands the `` kindling ideals and imagery '' that spurred them onward , and that have domi - nated the thought of all eastern
Asia	LOCATION	.

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 279 Blinded by excess of devotion , Mr.
Havell	PERSON	refuses to concede that Indian art is inferior to that of
Japan	LOCATION	or
China	LOCATION	.

		He insists that the whole essence of Asiatic art-creation lies in '' the inner informing spirit , '' and that our relative estimate should rest upon the extent to which `` the original creative thought-power '' in
India	LOCATION	has acted upon that of the countries to which it was carried .

		We need only turn to the illustrations in this volume to be convinced that the claims of Indian art do not have to be bolstered up by such spe - cial pleading .

		Very splendid are many of the works shown in these excellent photographic reproductions .

		Their artistic worth is quite apparent , even to those without knowledge of the religious ideas they embody .

		While we may not in every instance be able to go as far as Mr.
Havell	PERSON	does in his enthusiastic commen - dation , we should feel grateful to him for bring - ing these works to our attention .

		In some of his theories he asks us to recast our ideas of the psychology of art production , as when he sug - gests that the abnormally slow development of the technic arts in the Indian civilization was deliberately willed .

		But the task of the pio - neer in this field is not a light one .

		Mr.
Havell	PERSON	has approached it in a catholic spirit and with an open mind , and he has the needful equip - ment of profound knowledge of Indian thought and acquaintance with Indian literature .

		His presentation of the ideals that have found ex - pression in Indian art could not be clearer .

		He is a forceful writer , and did he not mistake the message of art , which is not religious but aesthetic , we should have little fault to find with his book , which is interesting and stimulating throughout .

		* Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	's collection of '' Studies Military and Diplomatic '' comprises ten historical essays , each bearing out the author 's reputation for vigorous writing , origin - ality , and accuracy .

Long Island	LOCATION	, and
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		Two others , ''
Washington	LOCATION	and Cavalry '' and '' The Revolutionary Campaign of

		treat of the later and , to many , the more interest - ing contest .

		The two last-named were public addresses , both delivered in the South , the last upon the occasion of the centennial celebra - tion of the birth of General
Lee	PERSON	, at
Washington	LOCATION	and
Lee University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The two remaining papers , both again concerned with the Civil War , offer instructive and destructive enlightenment upon the diplomacy of that trying time .

		Entitled '' An Historical Residuum '' and '' Queen
Vic	PERSON	- toria and the Civil War , '' each states a widely known and generally accepted historical tradi - tion which the author convincingly shows to be unfounded .

		To be sure , there is little save negative evidence , but there is sufficient of that to dispose conclusively of the story .

		In the first essay , '' The Battle of Bunker Hill , '' the author proves conclusively that the entire affair was replete with '' gross military blundering on both sides . ''

		In choice of posi - tion , arrangements before the battle , and mili - tary tactics , each commander was repeatedly at fault , while in every case the luck was all on the American side .

		This is not a new view of the battle , as Mr.
Adams	PERSON	himself states , for the mis - takes of that day were clear to contemporaries and were catalogued and analyzed by military writers of the time .

		They have , however , been lost sight of in a vanishing perspective , and a romantic worship of Revolutionary heroes has created a fiction of superior generalship , a tradi - tion which later generations have accepted as unquestioned .

		The one remarkable feature of the battle , as of others in the Revolutionary War , was the resourcefulness of the American soldier in improvising hasty yet effective en - trenchments .

		This , says Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, was a new departure in warfare long neglected by European armies , though to-day a matter of careful instruction .

		The blunders of Prescott on
June 17 , 1775	DATE	, were counterbalanced by the greater military stupidity of Gage and
Howe	PERSON	.

		But
Prescott	PERSON	's men at least proved that the shovel and pick were implements of war , and , as Putnam sagely remarked , '' the Yankee as a soldier was peculiar , not seeming to care much about his head , but dreadfully afraid of his shins ; cover him half-leg high , and you could depend on him to fight . ''

		Prescott , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	writes , did not realize the lesson his soldiers had taught , '' and apparently it took almost a century for the professional soldier to master the fact thoroughly ; but those light , temporary earthworks , scientifically thrown up on Bunker Hill in the closing hours of a single
June	DATE
night	TIME	, introduced a new element into the defensive tac -

April 1	DATE	, tics of the battle-field .

		Its final demonstration was at
Plevna	LOCATION	, a whole century later . ''

		While fully recognizing the military ability displayed by
Washington	LOCATION	in the later years of the Revolution , Mr.
Adams	PERSON	maintains in several essays that
Washington	LOCATION	, like all other American generals , had to learn the art of war , and that in the earlier years his management of the army was often defective .

		The battle of
Long Island	LOCATION	is cited in particular as an illustration of bad judgment and poor tactics , the Americans being saved by the '' stupidity and dilatoriness of the enemy '' and being blessed by an '' amazing run of pure luck . ''

		It is pointed out also that it was long before the effectiveness of cavalry as a scouting and feeling arm of the service was understood .

		Both Americans and British were at fault here , the former not seeming to under - stand the importance of organizing a cavalry force , and the latter not utilizing that which they had .

		In still another essay , treating of effective war - fare , but this time referring to the Civil War , the author criticizes the historian
Rhodes	PERSON	for under - rating , or at least for under-stating , the tremen - dous value to the North of a greatly superior naval force .

		The blockade , writes Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, when one seeks for the chief cause of Northern victory , outweighed all other advantages com - bined , and was indeed the final compelling force whose enveloping embrace the South could not escape .

		A distinct grasp and full recognition of the advan - tage in the struggle pertaining to the mastery of the sea is one of the most noticeable deficiencies in Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	's treatment of the outcome of the conflict .

		In this respect his narrative is lacking in a proper sense of proportion .

		As compared with the space devoted to the movements on land , he fails to give to the sea opera - tions the emphasis properly belonging to them . ''

		In Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's opinion an examination of conditions giving the North an advantage sim - mers down to '' one factor , the blockade , as the controlling condition of
Union	LOCATION	success .

		In other words , that success was made possible by the un - disputed naval and maritime supremacy of the national government .

		Cut off from the outer world and all exterior sources of supply , reduced to a state of inanition by the blockade , the Con - federacy was pounded to death . ''

		While historical writers generally have appre - ciated the blockade as a weapon , and have ad - mitted the immense value to the North of its naval supremacy , few , hitherto , have ranked it as of the first importance .

		However , the block - ade in the Civil War has yet to !

		> invrsti ^ atni with thoroughness .

		There has been no study of its influence upon industry within the South , or upon trade -LRB- save the cotton trade -RRB- of foreign nations .

		The picturesque and dramatic features of the blockade have had adequate description , but there remains the question , What did it really mean , not only for the South indeed , l > ut for the great neutral nations ?

		It is possible that the military essays will appeal more to the general reader than the two which discuss diplomacy .

		The studies of cam - paigns and battles and the lifelike portraits of our great military figures permit an imrompli - cated , straightforward narration , which the au - thor 's facile pen makes unfailingly interesting .

		It inevitably holds the reader 's attention , even though scholarly investigation has obliged the writer to tone down the lights and shadows , and sometimes to lay bare a misfortune or a deficiency of which the general public has been spared the knowledge .

		Nevertheless , the two studies in diplomatic history , though more difficult of nar - ration , should also prove keenly interesting .

		To any with a predilection for a well-constructed detective story , the skill with which the crime of historical mis-statement is unravelled will chal - lenge the closest attention ; while to the histo - rian , these essays have an additional value , being based in all probability on the unpublished diary of the writer 's father .

		This invaluable journal of
America	LOCATION	's ablest representative in
Europe	LOCATION	during the Civil War has been in the keeping of his son , the present essayist , for many years .

		It is undoubtedly a repository of unguessed richness to the historical seeker , and evidence based upon such a source is of unquestioned authenticity .

		The essays further show clearly the fallibility of recollections the unreliability of memory unsupported by exact records , even when the reputation and integrity of the writer are beyond doubt .

		Well within this category should come the '' Recollections of President
Lincoln	PERSON	and his
Administration	ORGANIZATION	, '' published in

L. E. Chittenden	PERSON	, Register of the

1862	DATE	, and the demand then made upon him that he prepare ten million United States five-twenty coupon bonds to be ready for shipment to
Great Britain	LOCATION	in less than three days .

		THE DIAL 281 used by the Confederacy in breaking the block - ade ; Southern agents were busy in
London	LOCATION	, and the need of prompt action by the
United States	LOCATION	government was evident .

		The efforts of the American Minister had succeeded in having a restraining order issued against the Rams , but the order was void unless the
United States	ORGANIZATION	could make an indemnity deposit of 1,000,000 sterling .

		To meet this emergency the bonds were essential .

		Such is the bare skeleton of a story very entertainingly , even convincingly , told by the ex-Register of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, who speaks with the authority of a participant even a star actor in the drama .

		In effect , Mr.
Chit	PERSON	- tenden is the `` only living survivor '' of secret and mysterious happenings ; and in breaking silence after thirty years he omits no vivid detail , recalling clearly the various steps taken , from Minister
Adams	PERSON	's instigation of the plan to his own physical exhaustion in signing the bonds .

		The `` Historical Residuum '' remaining after the present author 's searching investigation has failed to corroborate most of the points of the story , and can be summed up in his own words : `` The amount involved and the number of bonds returned to the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	were alone accurately stated . ''

		The other real facts behind the
Chittenden	PERSON	narrative were brought out in the publication in
1898	DATE	of the letters of
John Murray Forbes	PERSON	, one of two men who , under wholly different instructions and conditions , were in
1863	DATE	-LRB- not
1862	DATE	-RRB- secretly commissioned to go to
England	LOCATION	to buy the Rams .

		Needless to say , the American Minister not only had no part in the matter , but his assistance was neither sought nor offered .

		In '' Queen
Victoria	PERSON	and the Civil War '' the author quotes the personal reminiscence of one of
New York	LOCATION	's first citizens as given at a great public banquet in that city in
1901	DATE	.

		He , the speaker , had in
1862	DATE	been charged by the
Ameri	PERSON	- can Minister in
Paris	LOCATION	with a secret message for Mr.
Adams	PERSON	in
London	LOCATION	.

		He was to inform the American Minister there that
Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		had proposed to
Great Britain	LOCATION	to recognize the Con - federacy at once .

		Upon receipt of this message Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, according to the story , went di - rectly to
Windsor	LOCATION	, was granted an audience with the Queen , and received her assurance that '' Great
Britain	LOCATION	would not recognize the Con - federacy . ''

		Negative evidence again comes to the rescue , not only in regard to this particular utterance of the Queen -LRB- for the author clearly proves that no such audience was ever held -RRB- , but for all that critical period when British in - tervention was looked to or would have been serviceable to the South .

		It has been pleas - ant to Americans to believe that the gracious Queen interested herself in the preservation of the
Union	LOCATION	, but the present study shatters this '' Victorian legend . '' ''

		There is nothing what - ever to indicate that the Queen ever felt any per - sonal interest in the American struggle , or , after the Prince Consort 's death -LRB-
December 1861	DATE	-RRB- , sought to influence in the slightest the policy of the ministry in regard to it . ''

		While Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's conclusions in general are thoroughly convincing , his findings in regard to the final cause of British non-intervention in behalf of the Confederacy lack something in con - firmation .

		Granted
Palmerston	LOCATION	's jealousy of
Gladstone	LOCATION	, and the latter 's indiscretion in assum - ing to foreshadow Cabinet policy , it is still diffi - cult to believe that the cause of the South was so evenly balanced that the accident of personal distrust should determine its fate .

		Doubtless it was a genuine satisfaction to the Prime Min - ister to nullify
Gladstone	PERSON	's vaunted predictions as partial punishment for his temerity , but the facts are as yet not sufficiently well known to permit a final judgment .

		In most respects , how - ever , one must agree with the author 's findings , and must congratulate him upon the skill with which he makes minute historical investigation readable and attractive .

		Meanwhile , students of history await with expectation that larger re - sult of Mr.
Adams	PERSON	's studies for which the Diary of his father should furnish the basis , or it may be an edition of the
Diary	ORGANIZATION	itself .

April 1	DATE	, and heart as they persist in the consciousness of maturer years . ''

		No need had we the world to roam To find new shores , for round our home Our undiscovered lands arose In autumn mists , in winter snows .

		On
summer	DATE
night	TIME	* in whispering trees We heard the wash of Indian seas ; And ripening waves of harvest rolled Over our hills the realms of gold ; And flood-time mapped familiar lands With island shores and foreign strands ; And tidings of unventnred ways We gathered in the darkening days When leafless woods began to moan And twilight opened gates unknown .

		A narrower , homelier world we knew In winter time , and kinder grew The sheltering bounds of landmarks old ; And , gathered within farm and fold , The sound of voices and the stir Of labour seemed the merrier Because so lonely and so wide And homeless was the world outside . ''

		One can not read the '' First Horizons '' from which these lines are taken without recalling '' Snow - bound , '' which , on a larger scale , makes its appeal by the same qualities of simplicity and truth .

		This is the very spirit of childhood , and happy are they who have not wholly lost it with the years : '' We were a part of all that we beheld In those young days : it was our joy that welled Into the sunshine with the mountain rill .

		Our heart that in the rose 's heart lay still , Our wings that held the sea-bird o'er the foam , Our feet that brought the wandering outcast home .

		Earth had no secret that we could not share For everything we saw and loved we were . ''

		Even in those poems which portray the soul freed from the illusions of youth , and face to face with the enigma of existence , the note of wistful reminiscence is heard .

		In '' The Test of Faith , '' Mr.
Lysaght	PERSON	lets us see how his thought has worked out the moral problem of the world , finding the solution which
William James	PERSON	puts forth with persuasive eloquence in his philosophical essays . ''

		We have beheld the evil and the good , And know , ourselves , the strength of wrong withstood .

		May it not be that Qod is everywhere Striving Himself against eternal wrong ?

		May it not be that on that battle-field He needs the help of those His love would shield ?

		May not His arm be bound by our despair ?

		May not our courage help to make it strong ' . ' ''

		Come !

		ere strength fail us , be it ours to guard That good which now can be upheld or marred , Tending , it may be , in our earth-born dust , The mortal seed of some immortal bloom .

		Come !

		can we dare to pause or hesitate When we may be the conquerors of fate , When fighting on God 's side for life 's great trust Our victory may break the bonds of doom ? ''

		And if no hope appears , yet having seen Dreams of what should be and what might have been , If as a crippled battle-ship that Kinks , Flying her fighting colours to the fleet , We face the end , is there no fountain-head Of strength divine from which such strength is fed ?

		Must not our lives be bound with unseen links To some great heart that can not know defeat ? '

		These revelations of the inner life , whether concerned with picturings from the pages of memory or with the vision of the world as revealed to the ripe intel - ligence , constitute a volume of very beautiful v - r - .

		.

		verse of the sort over which one lingers and to which one is tempted to return .

		Mr.
Lysaght	PERSON	's thoughts are not only worth while , but they are also embodied in measures that delight the ear .

		Mr.
Donald J. Overy	PERSON	opens his volume called `` Eidola '' with an `` apologia . '' ''

		I care not though ten thousand have sung Dirinely well .

		I too will sing .

		What though ten thousand have loved Shall my love have no Spring ? ''

		And so he sings , in a thin and not altogether tuneful voice , such strains as the following : `` She sat on the primrose-bank alone , A green-clad maid , and there , In her lap , the wayside flowers were thrown , While daffodils decked her hair . ''

		Was it a lark , or a lake of blue With a silver strand , in the sky , That she held her head so high to view , To drop it , soon , with a sigh ? ''

		Nay ! '

		t was the whisper , the echo , the call ... That none but a woman may hear , In the
spring	DATE	of the year and on to the
fall	DATE	.

		That makes life 's meaning clear . ''

		Mr.
Overy	PERSON	's verse is rather commonplace ; neither in sentiment nor in diction does it have the arrest - ing quality without which all attempted poetry is futile .

		The title-page of Mr.
William Force	PERSON	Stead 's '' Windflowers '' thus appeals to the `` skimming critic '' : '' Read ye either not at all , Or discerningly and well . ''

		We have read Mr.
Stead	PERSON	's lyrics with sufficient discernment to discover in them a most exquisite music and a marked clarity of thought .

		This epi - taph for a young girl , for example , closely approaches perfection : A week since , and I saw her smile In sunlight by the meadow-stile : A day since , and the lilies gave Faint light and fragrance from her grave : And now , with dawn above them spread , She and the lilies both are dead . ''

		It seems to belong in the Greek Anthology , and we could easily imagine it to have been penned by
Landor	ORGANIZATION	.

		And here is a lyric whose wayward move - ment reminds one of Meredith : '' O that I could sing of her , sing of her as she is , Sing the light her spirit scatters , all the aural bliss Round her ever wreathing , In measures of hr breathing `` O that I oonld sing of her , sing of the sunrise darting Brightly from those cloudy rifU that are her eyelids parting ; Mng all her wild March-gladness , And quiet May-noon sadness .

		`` O that I could sing of her , sing of my lovely one !

		I should be as God whose singing shaped the moon and sun , And set the quick herb growing , And rhythmic rivers flowing . ''

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 283 The most ambitious of these lyrics is '' The Song of Bolderwood , '' in the form of an ode , from which we quote this section : '' The Holy Spirit spake to me , Saying : When thou hast ceased to be , Thou shalt at last attain Unto the calm of
middle night	TIME	, And clarity of morning light , And helpfulness of rain .

		In
May	DATE	, the month of hluest flowers , Thy spirit shall be given wholly To shining through the golden hours By hill and meadow lowly .

		This light that was so dim in tliee , That flickered in adversity On sin-dominioned ways , This light that sank amid the gloom Of hollows ridged with peaks of doom , This light , a taper in a tomb , Shall rising trick its rays ; Of it shall be the twilig-ht hue Of pansies , and the morning blue Of wild wood-violets ; Forget-me-not and robin 's eye , And hare-bells , like a placid sky After the red sun sets , Shall own the spirit 's risen light Arid clearly shall it shine In corn-flowers on the windy height And hill-side flower of vine .

		In time of rime and sifting snow , Thy light within the wood shall grow Red holly and white mistletoe : In
spring	DATE	, that radiant orb terrene , The daffodil , that 's ever seen Where grass is longest and most green ; Thy spirit 's risen light shall be Along the washes by the sea Marsh-mallow and marsh-rosmary . ''

		The thought of death becomes gracious in these verses , which stand in sharp contrast to the melancholy mus - ing of most young poets .

		They seem to be a ser - mon upon a text from `` Adonais '' `` He is made one with nature , '' or a new expression of the Meredithian joy of earth .

		Mr.
Gerald Gould	PERSON	is a graceful singer whose work we had the pleasure of noticing two or three years ago .

		He has both imagination and passion , and the power of imparting vivid emotion .

		`` Light Love '' is not , perhaps , as deep as some of his lyrics , but it is one of the most charming . ''

		Give me not passion not the touch Of lips and limbs that yield too much Not the close shuddering shaken kiss That says ' A heart must break for this , ' But laughing kisses , soft and light As these grey moths that cloud the
night	TIME	, And the half - whimsical caress That hints , not masters , happiness . ''

		Sing me not songs that have their source In raptures perilous perforce Not notes that climb the tragic stairs , But delicate and dancing airs , As inconsiderate as those gleams From eyes like star-bewildered streams , Those locks incontinently tossed Round brows too lovely to be lost . ''

		So , when the
summer	DATE
night	TIME	is spent , Take back what you not gave but lent , And lay at some more stable shrine The gift I never claimed for mine .

		Ah !

		come not when the winter weeps , With pallid mouth to haunt my sleeps , Or hands that tremble at my door To ` mind me of what went before . ''

		The two stanzas entitled `` Life and Death '' deserve to be quoted . ''

		I have lived for I have seen afar Upon the silence and the height Cities enkindled where the star Of morning slew the stars of night . ''

		I have died for I have watched the day Be withered as myself must be Slowly , beyond the gathering grey And plangent plunging of the sea . ''

		Miss
Marion Fox	PERSON	's verses entitled `` The Lost Vocation '' are inspired by a mystical idea which is thus stated : `` The idea of a distinct personality re - turning from beyond the unknown to re-inhabit a living human body has been and is often still accepted .

		The soul of a nun returning to a world where for the most part such a vocation is now impossible partakes both of comedy and tragedy comedy to the beholder , tragedy to the actor .

		That this might be the explanation of that mysterious grayness , dulness , which we see in so many of our fellows is a theory I should like to submit , though well aware how hard it were to prove my case . ''

		`` Waiting '' is one of the poems suggested by this idea . ''

		When you and I have come to meet Out of the silent southern land , With longing eyes and hearts that greet Each other , we shall understand How all the walking of wild ways Was but a path to happier days . ''

		From the hot airs and odours sweet , Enfeebling mind , and will , and hand ; From glaring sun , and dust , and heat ; From sights bewildering and grand ; In some dim place where wood-wind plays ` Mongst dew-wet grass shall meet our ways . ''

		The soft , cool trees , all green and old , Wait for the coming of us twain ; The simple birds their hearts unfold In song , for when we meet again .

		Only
Time	ORGANIZATION	waits with laggard feet , And turns his hour-glass passing fleet . ''

		Just how this poem illustrates the thought of the writ - er 's thesis we do not find it easy to understand , and , in fact , we might read the whole collection without suspecting that it was designed for the purpose stated in the introductory note .

		In `` The Human Fantasy , '' Mr.
John Hall Wheelock	PERSON	has aimed to express `` the life of to-day in all its beauty and terrible complexity of joy and sorrow . ''

		The greater part of his volume is made up of a narrative poem a string of episodes describing the experiences of a young man hungry for love , who finds in a shop-girl an object for his devotions .

		He does not carry his passion to the point of seduction , which differentiates the story from most others of its class .

		We quote the section called `` Twilight along the Park . '' ''

		Down the stone valley , carven steps and straight , Into the clouds , the streets of twilight run That blend in molten bars about the sun , Into the sunset and the evening 's gate , J84 THE DIAL , -LSB-
April 1	DATE	. ''

		Reopening on starred heaven .

		The first few Flames of her holy chamber now are seen , Beyond the flickering twilight 's fields of green And the pierced clouds deep in the boundless bine . ''

		The stately mansions loom along the dark , The sombre and dim desert all around ; In the whole world there is one only sound , A cracked old organ wheezing from the Park . ''

		` Mid the starred peace colossal and supreme , Presumptuous , the only human voice , Full of old tunes and ditties that rejoice Half dolefully and die .

		The houses dream . ''

		There are other pictures of this sort , etched quite as strikingly , in the course of the narrative .

		In its human aspect , the story has a wistful pathos that recalls
Ernest Dowson	PERSON	, while its staccato passages remind us , both in substance and form , of
Henley	ORGANIZATION	's
London	LOCATION	Voluntaries . ''

		Mr.
Wheelock	PERSON	adopts swing - ing and unfettered rhythms , and his diction , despite its freedom , falls upon the ear with undeniably poet - ical effect .

		We are informed that he was the Har - vard Class Poet of
1908	DATE	, and his work exhibits precisely the type of vital realism and modernity that has characterized the group of poets
Moody , Lodge	ORGANIZATION	,
Stickney	PERSON	,
Robinson	PERSON	, and MacKaye that
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	has given to our literature during the last score of years .

		The fact that Mr.
John Carter	PERSON	, the author of `` Hard Labor and Other Poems , '' has served a term in the
Minnesota State Prison	LOCATION	, is made use of by his publishers for advertising purposes , but should not occupy the attention of the critic , except in so far as the unfortunate experience is reflected in the verses themselves .

		Mr.
Carter	PERSON	makes no bones of the fact , however , any more than did the author of `` De Profundis '' and -LRB- < The Ballad of Reading Gaol , '' and hence we are not called upon to conceal it .

		He voices the cry of his fellows in a '' Ballade of Misery and Iron . '' ''

		Haggard faces and trembling knees , Eyes that shine with a weakling 's hate , Lips that mutter their blasphemies , Murderous hearts that darkly wait : These are they who were men of late , Fit to hold a plough or a sword .

		If a prayer this wall may penetrate , Have pity on these my comrades , Lord ! ''

		And here is the envoy of the ballade : '' These are pawns that the hand of Fate Careless sweeps from the checker-board .

		Thou that know st if the game be straight , Have pity on these my comrades , Lord ! ''

		A rankling notion that the game is not `` straight '' is doubtless at the heart of the sullen resentment with which the convict endures his punishment , but as a rule the crookedness of the game is evidenced , not by his own fate , but by the fact that it is not shared by all who equally deserve it It is a fate tenfold more bitter to the sensitive spirit than to the stolid , but such differences between individuals the law , with its measure of retribution , can not recog - nize .

		The appeal of these prison poems is rather to sentiment than to the sense of justice ; if the con - sciousness of duress were mingled with something more of the consciousness of soul-cleansing expia - tion , the appeal would be much stronger than it i - .

		Mr.
Carter	PERSON	clearly has the lyric jjift .

		and hi - , poig - nant outpourings offer a real contribution to the science of penology .

		We may describe as average magazine verse the pieces that make up Mr.
N. D. Anderson	PERSON	's `` The Voice of the Infinite , and Other Poems . ''

		The themes are various , and there is imagination in their treatment , but the diction is often painfully prosaic .

		As an example of the best to be found in this volume , we quote from the conclusion of '' The Thin Blue Line . '' ''

		The thin blue line that falters not God 's vengeance on thy Captains be !

		Have they their fathers ' wrongs forgot , To hurt their brothers ' liberty ?

		All men are equal born , those held ; Shall these , the lesser , then in vain Hold all their fathers made so plain , And seek the slaver 's chains to weld ' . '

		God 's vengeance on thy Captains be , If they hold not their murderous hands !

		The wilder race loves liberty , Leave then to them their native lands . ''

		This poem makes anything but a close approach to
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's great Ode upon the shameful chapter of our dealing with the
Philippines	LOCATION	, but we welcome the writer as a sincere and worthy recruit in the moral campaign that is bound sometime to bring the nation to the consciousness of its wrong-doing .

		Mr.
Charles Hanson Towne	PERSON	's `` Youth '' is a long domestic idyl of a young architect and his wife , their friends the poet and the girl from the prairies , and the lady for whom the architect is building a house .

		It is a sentimental novelette in such verse as this : '' There were low lines of shelves to hold their books Volumes they both had long since learned to love Omar and

Shelley	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Marcus Anrelius	PERSON	, and

Donald	PERSON	knew Almost by heart . ''

		Or as this :

		We regret to record that
Donald	PERSON	l > ecame ensnared -LRB- happily for a time only -RRB- by the charms of the lady patron of his art , and that
Lucy	PERSON	did not find her stoic philosophers adequate to console her .

		Of Mr.
Towne	PERSON	's `` Other Poems , '' we particularly like '' Love 's Ritual . ''

		Breathe me the ancient words when I shall find Your spirit mine ; if , seeking you , life wins New wonder , with old splendor let us bind Our hearts when Love 's high sacrament begins . ''

		Exalt my soul with pomp and pageantry , Sing the eternal songs all lovers sing ; Yea , when you come , gold let onr vestments be , And lamps of silver let us softly swing .

		THE DIAL 285 '' But if at last -LRB- hark how I whisper , Love ! -RRB-

		, Yon from my temple and from me should turn , I pray you chant no psalm my grief above , Over the body of Pain let no light burn . ''

		Go forth in silence , quiet as a dove , Drift , with no sign , from our exultant place ; We need no Ite at the death of Love , And none should come to look on Love 's white face . ''

		The late Mr.
Henley	PERSON	turned to impressive poetical account his sojourn as a patient in a
London	LOCATION	hospital .

		In Miss
Grace Fallow Norton	ORGANIZATION	's '' Little Gray Songs from St.
Joseph	PERSON	's '' we are given what purport to be the verses written from time to time by a working girl who spent two years on a bed of pain in a Franciscan hospital , and finally died .

		These `` little letters to herself , '' we are told to imagine , were hidden beneath her pillow , and preserved with loving care after her death by one of the good sisters .

		In these stanzas she tells us of the chance by which she came into the world : '' Because white hands clasped white hands , And white arms wound white arms , I 'm wandering through the wide world , Driven by those same heart-storms . ''

		Because white arms wound white arms Must mine hang quivering , bare , All vain to reach and clasp again White arms again as fair . ''

		Did they that clasped desire me ?

		Oh no , ' t was heart on heart , ' T was lip to lip and life for life Now living is my part . ''

		Did they that loved stand awed at My masked inheritance ?

		They laughed and called the echo ... I am a child of chance . ''

		What a commentary upon the recklessness of passion may be read between the lines of this pathetic plaint !

		And with what soft appealing beauty is the thought of death illuminated by the following song : '' great Allayer of our pain , That some day shuts all eyelids down ,
Wilt	PERSON	thou come softly , like the rain , When he goes through to cleanse the town ? ''

		Wilt thou come singing with the wind , Who shouts and sweeps the dust away , And scatters thus triumphantly The little hoarded heaps of clay ? ''

		Or smiling silent , like the sun Who ripens ere they fall to rest Earth 's flowers and fruits , so one by one , They mellow drop upon her breast ? ''

		great Allayer of our pain , sure Encompasser of all Our woe : O come gently , as rain Doth come ; let not thy terrors call . ''

		There is even a note of joyous anticipation of the re - lief that the end shall bring in such verses as these : '' But if my star of joy should call A call as stars may give ' Awake , O slumbering little soul , Awake , arise , and live ! ' '

		How would a soul reach out to life From silence and the tomb ; How would a soul unfold to light And up through darkness bloom ! ''

		How would a laughing soul scale Heaven And star on star let fall , If o'er the death-song of the worlds My star of joy should call ! ''

		It is their very artlessness that gives to these lyrics the poignant pathos which is their burden , and he would have a dull soul who could read them un - moved .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Japanese painting and its laws .

		Of unusual interest to students of
Far Eastern	ORGANIZATION	art is Mr.
Henry P. Bowie	PERSON	's book , `` On the Laws of Japanese Painting '' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The desirability of a treatise setting forth the psychological considera - tions by which the Japanese painters are guided in the constructive work of picture making , and giving some idea of their practical application , has long been realized .

		As an aid to understanding and appreciation the value of such a book could hardly be overestimated , but the lack of the necessary equip - ment of technical knowledge has hitherto deterred anyone from attempting it .

		Mr.
Bowie	PERSON	lived for more than nine years in
Japan	LOCATION	, studying the lan - guage , learning to write Chinese characters under the tutelage of eminent calligraphers , and receiving daily instruction in painting from some of the best of the modern artists residing in
Kyoto	LOCATION	.

		In this way he gained an insight into the animating spirit of Japanese art , and a working familiarity with its many canons , such as few other foreigners , if any , have ever acquired .

		Of these canons he tells us there are no less than seventy-two that are recog - nized us important .

		Not all of them , however , can strictly speaking be designated as laws .

		The word connotes imperative conformity ; and in attaching it to mere rules , precepts , and methods , there is some danger of producing a false impression .

		For exam - ple , it is obvious that the eight different ways of painting rocks and the eighteen forms of outline used in drawing draped figures are not what we or - dinarily call laws .

		Allowance being made for this peculiar terminology , there can be no doubt that Mr.
Bowie	PERSON	has written an instructive book .

		After a few pages of personal experiences , and a chapter of miscellaneous information about `` Art in
Japan	LOCATION	, '' he takes up `` The Laws for the Use of Brush and Materials , '' `` The Laws Governing the Conception and Execution of a Painting , '' `` The Canons of the ^ Esthetics of Japanese Painting , '' and follows them with a chapter upon `` Subjects for Japanese Paint - ing '' and a brief one upon `` Signatures and Seals . ''

		This enumeration will show the scope of the book .

		Before the opening chapter Mr.
Bowie	PERSON	prints the cardinal exordium , `` Ken wan choku hitsu '' -LRB- `` A firm arm and a perpendicular brush '' -RRB- , which is the keynote in the technic of Japanese painting .

		Not so much is said about some of the laws as could be wished , and from the book alone one could hardly discover how to apply them .

		But one thing Mr. 286 -LSB-
April 1	DATE	.

		Bowie has made very plain .

		The intent of all the laws is to help the artists to produce paintings in which every touch of the brush shall be instinct with life , the only kind of paintings , be it said , that the Japanese recognize as works of art The book is amply illustrated by reproductions of pic - tures by noted artists , and by an excellent series of explanatory plates specially prepared by Mr.
Shimada Sekko	PERSON	to elucidate the text The '' > * & ** `` Barren Grounds '' the \ orthem that stretch to and beyond the Arctic , , - iMrrneu .

		Circle to the northwest of
Hudson	LOCATION	's Bay are , according to Mr.
Ernest Thompson Seton	PERSON	, in reality rich pastures , clothed in verdure and be - decked in the short arctic
summer	DATE	with brilliant flowers .

		The animal life is abundant also , for here ranges the great northern herd of caribou which the author estimates at over thirty million head .

		In his latest book , entitled `` Arctic Prairies '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Mr.
Seton	PERSON	gives in his inimitable style a breezy but withal very succinct account of his canoe-journey of two thousand miles in search of the caribou , of his suc - cessful efforts to find the small remnant of the north - ern bison herd , and of his explorations in the region north of
Aylmer Lake	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a pleasing narrative of travel , with the quarrelsome bickering children of the northern woods for helpers and guides and the good offices of the
Hudson Bay Company	LOCATION	to forward his enterprise .

		Sport and adventure are not lacking , as witness the exciting race down fourteen miles in the canyon of the
Athabasca	LOCATION	, when `` the river showed its teeth '' and wrecked the outfit , sending the pre - cious records , notebooks , and drawings dashing down over icy rocks and amid storm-piled timbers .

		But the book is not merely a record of travel : it is full of notes and incidents relating to the natural history of these northern wilds .

		Not only were the big game , the bison , caribou , and musk-ox , the objects of the author 's search , but the humbler folk in fur and feathers and the trees and flowers as well .

		The pages of the book abound in sketches of bits of scenery , flowers , foot-prints , and bits of aboriginal life , all portrayed with scientific clearness and often with artistic results .

		Appendices setting forth the agricultural possibilities of this great region , lists of the mammals , birds , insects , and plants , and a plan for the introduction of the Thibetan Yak , conclude this best of all accounts of the natural history of the prairies of the remote north .

		Mr.
Rudolph Chambers Lehman n ItoS & u.	ORGANIZATION	haa P eculiar qualifications for the editorship of ``
Charles Dickens	PERSON	as Editor '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the most freshly interesting of the
Dickens	PERSON	books celebrating the centenary of the great novelist 's birth .

		Mr.
Leh	PERSON	- mann is a grand-nephew of
William Henry Wills	PERSON	, to whom the two hundred or more letters in the book were written by his editorial chief of '' House - hold Words '' and '' All the Year Round . ''

		It should be added , for accuracy 's sake , that five letters from
Wills to Dickens	ORGANIZATION	are also included .

		By a curious chance it happens that Mr.
Lrlmiann	PERSON	, in addition to other ties binding him to
Dickens	PERSON	's sub-editor , was himself for one year -LRB-
1901	DATE	-RRB- editor of `` The Daily News , '' the journal started by
Dickens	PERSON	in 1 * 1 with Wills on the editorial staff , but handed over to
John Forster	PERSON	in less than three weeks ; and it also happens that Mr.
Lflnnann	PERSON	lists Wen > iiu-r
1890	DATE	on the staff of `` Punch , ' which Wills helped to found in
1841	DATE	.

		He is , moreover , favorably re - membered in this country as the athletic young Englishman who about ten years ago came over to coach the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	crew and , as it proved , to win an American girl as his wife .

		And now for the book itself .

		After a few pages of introduction , which contain some account of Wills and his pecul - iarities , the substance of the volume is presented in chronological order under the headings , `` Bentley 's Miscellany , '' which
Dickens	PERSON	edited for two years beginning in
January , 1837	DATE	; `` The Daily News , '' his brief connection with which has already been mentioned ; `` Household Words , '' which engaged his editorial attention from
1850	DATE	to
1858	DATE	; and `` All the Year Round , '' which he conducted from
1859	DATE	until his death in
1870	DATE	.

		Mr.
Lehmann	PERSON	has supplied such explanatory matter as is required to knit these letters into a connected and intelligible whole , and he has enriched his volume with por - traits of
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Wills	ORGANIZATION	,
Wilkie Collins	PERSON	, and
Thack	PERSON	- eray .

		A good analytical index closes the book .

		Being new to the public , these letters furnish a fresh as well as an attractive picture of Dickens the indefatigable and resourceful literary worker , ardent and at the same time patient , impulsive but stead - fast , expecting from his subordinates something of his own conscientious industry , and generous in his recognition of loyal service .

		It is a book that will help to a better acquaintance with the brilliant and versatile and amazingly energetic
Dickens	PERSON	.

		THE DIAL 287 and say . ''

		`` Early in life I had great ambitions .

		Since I reached fifty I have begun to hope that I shall get through without scandal . '' ''

		Of all the open - fighting careers politics is the most ruthless and the most exacting .

		It is a fight in which your friend more than your enemy is a competitor for the prize you seek .

		Hence for the ambitious man the society of an opponent is more restful than the society of a friend . ''

		But the following is not what was to have been expected from so cheerful and wise a philoso - pher : '' The worst thing about life is that the worst part comes last .

		In another life the reward of the just man must , surely , be to work backward from old age to youth . ''

		And the writer of this , be it noted , expressly declares that , as life goes on , he has '' less and less time for mere railing against the fixed frame - work of the universe . ''

		The accomplished editor of `` The Westminster Gazette '' has chosen both a handy and an attractive form in which to cast his odds and ends of observation and reflection .

		American `` Social Evolution and Political lectures of mi ^ i _ i i i an English Iheory was the subject chosen by sociologist .

		Mr.
Leonard T. Hobhouse	PERSON	, perhaps the foremost English sociologist of to-day , for his Beer Foundation lectures at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION
last year	DATE	, now issued in book form by the
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		To an American reader the fea - ture of outstanding interest in these lectures is not anything so very novel in the way of sociological theory , but the novel way , to us , in which the lec - turer is enabled to go to contemporary political life for his illustrations , and more than that , for his sup - port in advocating a view of social philosophy as an adequate instrument for harmonizing human life , doing away with its irrational and blindly struggling elements , and moulding it into a self-directing , coop - erative commonwealth where the best impulses of human nature will be at home .

		Evidently
England	LOCATION	is a richer laboratory for the sociologist than Amer - ica .

		The thesis of Professor
Hobhouse	PERSON	is that social progress is a possibility .

		As against the individual - ists , the believers in uncontrolled competition and uncontrolled elimination , he believes that society as a whole can be organized , and can press on toward a fuller life without leaving a line of broken strag - glers along the way .

		The chief argument against this assumption is made by the Eugenists , who claim that social progress defeats itself by preserving in - ferior types and so leading to race deterioration .

		After Professor
Hobhouse	PERSON	has examined the alterna - tive programme of the Eugenists , pointed out the purely relative character of what they call desirable traits , and flatly denied that there is such a thing as wholesale race deterioration in
England	LOCATION	, there seems very little left of the Eugenic platform except the admitted importance of not permitting the breeding of unquestionably defective people .

		Thus the tone of Professor
Hobhouse	PERSON	's book is decidedly optimistic ; and it should have no little inspirational value in
America	LOCATION	, where social emphasis is so badly needed .

		A friend and
M. Xavier Paoli	PERSON	, for twenty-five years preceding his resignation in of kino , .

		1909 a member of the French police force whose special duty it was to watch over the persons of visiting monarchs , has probably enjoyed the personal acquaintance of more kings and queens than has any other man living .

		Shortly after his res - ignation he published a volume of memories , which now appear in an English translation entitled '' Their Majesties asl Knew Them '' -LRB-
Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The English version is by that breezy translator ,
A. Teixera de Mattos	PERSON	, whose work , though not always English or always accurate or always sensible or always strictly logical , is always eminently readable .

		The list of crowned heads discussed is a varied one , from the monkey-like and enthusiastic monarch of
Cambodia	LOCATION	to the sad and quiet Empress Elizabeth of
Austria	LOCATION	, and includes , besides the objects of merely incidental reference , the King of
Spain	LOCATION	, the
Shah	PERSON	of
Persia	LOCATION	, the Czar , the
King	ORGANIZATION	and Queen of
Italy	LOCATION	,
King George	PERSON	of
Greece	LOCATION	, Queen
Wilhelmina	PERSON	, the deceased King of the Belgians , and the last three rulers of
England	LOCATION	.

		The most unassuming of autobiographers ,
M. Paoli	PERSON	suffers no illusions as to the skill and suc - cess with which he discharged his duties as '' the Guardian of Kings '' -LRB- to quote His Majesty George of
Greece	LOCATION	-RRB- , and he is himself by no means the least interesting personality called up before us .

		The most striking single evidence of his tact which the volume records is perhaps contained in the story of the pot of
Marseilles	LOCATION	`` bouillabaisse '' which the Queen of
Holland	LOCATION	and her suite could not appreciate and which
M. Paoli	PERSON	consequently refused to touch , although he was as passionately fond of it as any Provencal could have been .

		These pages from
M. Paoli	PERSON	's official life should meet as cordial a reception in this country as they have already met in
France	LOCATION	.

		Medical '' Old English Libraries '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , precursors of the by Mr.
Ernest A. Savage	PERSON	, concerns public library .

		it se if b u t little with the equipment and management of such libraries , ground which has already been well covered by others , but treats more particularly of `` the making , use , and circu - lation of books considered as a means of literary culture , '' and makes generous use of illustrations and facsimiles to render its meaning clearer .

		A prelim - inary chapter deals briefly with the use of books in early Irish monasteries , after which come chapters on the English monks and their books , libraries of the great abbeys and the dispersal of monkish libra - ries , book-making and book-collecting in the religious houses , cathedral and church libraries , academic libra - ries -LRB-
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	-RRB- and their management , the use of books toward the end of the manuscript period , the book trade , and , finally , the general char - acter of the mediaeval library and the extent to which its books were circulated .

		Appended matter gives information on prices of books and materials for book-making , names of classic authors found in me - diaeval catalogues , a list of mediaeval book-collections , 2 ** THE DIAL -LSB-
April 1	DATE	.

		and a bibliography of the subjects discussed in Mr.
Savage	PERSON	's work .

		Mr.
James Hutt	PERSON	is chiefly respon - sible for the chapter on the libraries of
Oxford	LOCATION	, but his expected collaboration in the rest of the book was prevented by illness .

		Industry and scholarship and enthusiasm have evidently been brought to the pre - paration of the volume , which , despite the unavoid - ably dry-as-dust character of many of the topics dealt with , does nevertheless contrive to include incidents illustrative of human nature , which shows itself to have been much the same in mediaeval as in modern
England	LOCATION	.

		The fewness and the cost of books , and the very restricted privileges of library-users , as described by Mr.
Savage	PERSON	, may well cause the mod - ern reader to feel a renewed thankfulness for his own happier lot in this age of the printing-press and the public library .

		_ The `` jovial Stuart literature is still grow - monarch '' and ing : one of its most recent additions hit court .

		jg a volume by Mr.
A. C. A. Brett	PERSON	on ''
Charles II	PERSON	.

		and his Court '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The author feels that an over-critical world has not done justice to the jovial monarch , too much attention having been given to dubious political policies and to the king 's personal shortcomings in careless word or deliberate action .

		But Mr.
Brett	PERSON	goes to the other extreme : personal matters , trivial and important , are related with much detail ; but we do not find very much of
Charles	PERSON	's activities as a king .

		Of his absolutist schemes and his treasonable negotiations with
Louis XIV.	PERSON	, we are told almost nothing ; of the despotism that played havoc with the English con - stitution during the closing years of the reign , prac - tically nothing .

		Charles II .

		`` was a very pleasant fellow , '' and it is the picture of such a fellow that is sketched in the present work .

		It must not be as - sumed that the author is oblivious to
King Charles	LOCATION	's faults ; these are all produced and properly labeled , but in addition we are shown so much that is attract - ive in the royal character that the dark lines fade to some extent The book also contains valuable chap - ters on
London	LOCATION	in the Restoration period , and the court life of the time .

		Large use is made of quota - tions from the literature of the age , the poems of
Dryden	PERSON	and
Butler	PERSON	, the diaries of
Evelyn	PERSON	and
Pepys	PERSON	, and of other works .

		The style is humorous , easy , and sprightly , in every way in keeping with the theme .

		Students will find the work valuable as supplement - ing older authorities ; but
Osmund Airy	PERSON	's little book still seems to be the most satisfactory biography of Charles II .

		Dr.
William S. Sadler	PERSON	's `` The Physi - ology of Faith and Fear '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is an example of a popularization of a subject at present much in vogue and legiti - mately appealing to general interests .

		It concerns the mind in health and disease .

		Such contribu - tions to mental hygiene are now abundant ; and while indicating a wide interest , the demand sug - gests the application of more critical standards to the additions to the supply .

		Dr.
Sadler	PERSON	's volume The mind in health anil -LRB- lit fair .

		attempts to be popular at any cost , and loses both in effectiveness and system , in the ijuulity of its appeal as well as in taste and good judgment of pre - sentation .

		There are good points both in the t he-l - and in the way in which it is sustained .

		The con - trast of faith as representing the optimistic view of the outcome , with fear as the worrying and depreM - ing attitude of mind , is insisted upon in season and out of season , and is made to account for a larger share of the mental economy than it can legitimately support .

		While commending Dr.
Sadler	PERSON	's purpose and , with greater reservations , his mode of carrying it out , it still remains true that faith and fear ; u not as ultimate or as comprehensive contrasts as appears on the surface .

		They are attitudes con-i-tent with temperament and to be interpreted as such .

		In comparison with many another book on mental hygiene , this volume must be given an inferior rating .

		Moreover , it is affected throughout by a striving for popularity which throws the entire ex - position out of balance , and seriously detracts from its usefulness , particularly from the service which it might otherwise have performed on the shelves of a public library .

		Tlic date * of the documents range from
1630	DATE	to
1707	DATE	.

		Most of this matter , with the exception of
Penn	LOCATION	and 1 ` astorin - .

		is unfamiliar and not easily accessible , this being partic - ularly true of the documents relating to the S \ \ edi > h settlements .

		This volume will be a great help to the student in clearing up what is probably the most oh-cme section of our colonial history .

		In `` The Bible Unveiled '' -LRB- Independent Religion * Society -RRB- Mr.
M. M. Mangasarian	PERSON	, the well-known ration - alist lecturer of
Chicago	LOCATION	, discn > - r * the content - , and the value of the
Bible	ORGANIZATION	from a secularist standpoint .

		Mi
Mangasarian	ORGANIZATION	's book is really a polemic against what has been termed bibliolatry , that is , the tendency to take the Bible as a whole , as if it were a literary unit , and then to worship it as a unit and as a receptacle of magic virtues .

		As examples of this attitude , extracts from Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	's address on the occasion of the Tercentenary of the English Bible , and some recent remarks of Mr
Roosevelt	PERSON	are quoted .

		Having laid this foundation , the author analyses many of the stories of the Old
Testa	PERSON	- ment , and compares the moral side of Old Testament life to the moral aspects of the contemporary pagan life .

		He then considers the teachings of Jesus , and endeavors to show that what has been assumed to be the character - istic content of the Christian ethic < matter of fact , not even unique in its own day , but was born into a world in which pagan morality of the highest and pun > t type was already known to man .

spring	DATE	of next year . ''

		The Financier '' will be the title of Mr.

		My Friendship with Prince
Hohenlohe	PERSON	'' is the title of a volume of memoirs by
Baroness von Hedemann	PERSON	, which Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	will publish this month .

		The
Baroness	PERSON	was for a long period
Prince Hoheulohe	ORGANIZATION	's close friend and adviser .

		The success of the '' Beautiful England '' series issued by
Messrs. Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	has led the same publish - ers to plan a similar series devoted to '' Beautiful Ire - land , '' for which Mr.
Stephen Gwynn	PERSON	will supply the text and Mr.
Alexander Williams	PERSON	the illustrations `` Through the Postern Gate , '' a new novel by Mrs.
Florence L. Barclay	PERSON	, author of '' The Rosary , '' will be published during the present month by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		This has been appearing serially in the '' Ladies ' Home Journal '' with the title , '' Under the Mulberry Tree . ''

		The first instalment of Mr.
John Fox	PERSON	's new novel , '' The Heart of the Hills , '' appears in the
April	DATE	issue of '' Scribner 's Magazine . ''

		Another important serial which makes its initial appearance this month is Mr.
Jeffery Farnol	PERSON	's '' The Amateur Gentleman , '' in ''
McClure	PERSON	's . ''

		A French critic ,
M. Maurice Bourgeois	PERSON	, is writing a study of the life and art of
John Synge	PERSON	, which may be expected later on in the year .

		The Irish literary move - ment received early appreciation from French men of letters , and a good deal of
Synge	PERSON	's journalism took the form of articles and reviews of French books .

		An autobiographical account of '' Two Visits to Den - mark , '' by Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, is an interesting item on Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	's announcement list .

		The visits were made when Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	was a young man , and these im - pressions of the country and many of its greatest men have hitherto been held back for personal reasons .

		A series of handbooks entitled '' Channels of English Literature , '' designed to trace the genesis and evolution of the various branches of English literature and thought , is announced by Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	.

		The first volume , to appear shortly , is Professor
James Seth	PERSON	's '' English Philosophers and Schools of Philosophy . ''

		Two hitherto unannounced volumes , of somewhat dis - similar character , to be published this
spring	DATE	by the Putnams , are ''
Paul the Minstrel	PERSON	, and Other Stories , '' a series of semi-medijeval romances by Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	; and '' Pitching in a Pinch , and Other Stories of the
Big League	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Christy Mathewson	PERSON	of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Giants . ''

		Since completing his life of
Karl Marx	PERSON	, almost all of Mr.

State	ORGANIZATION	, '' which Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	will publish this month .

		It is , in effect , the platform of the pro- gressive Socialist , and presents succinctly his attitude on the important aspects of life under a
Socialist State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The publication of a new and definitive edition of the works of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, to be styled '' The Wessex Edition , '' will be undertaken immediately by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
London	LOCATION	.

		The series will be com - pleted in twenty volumes , and two volumes will be issued monthly .

		Each book will contain a frontispiece in photogravure and a map of the
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	of the novels and poems . ''

		Tess of the d'Urbervilles '' and '' Far from the Maddening Crowd '' will appear first , and the former will contain a general preface which the author has written for the new edition .

		St.
Paul	PERSON	,
Minn.	LOCATION	, seems now to be assured of the new library building it has so long needed .

		A recent news - paper despatch says that Mr.
James J. Hill	PERSON	has an - nounced that he will build and maintain in that city a reference library to cost not less than three hundred and fifty thousand dollars , and that this generosity on his part makes it possible for the city to erect a library building that shall cost half a
million dollars	MONEY	, and further that '' the library will represent an expenditure of
$ 976,000	MONEY	. ''

LOUIS WALLIS	PERSON	Author of u An Examination of Society '' Formerly Instructor in Economics and Sociology in the
Ohio State University	ORGANIZATION	.

		r pHIS WORK will be both interesting and useful to all who are awake to present-day social and religions - * - problems .

		It is a new and remarkable treatise on the delelopment of the fundamental religious idea * of Christian civilization , written in a style which is clear to anyone who is genuinely interested in the subject .

		Strong words of commendation have been spoken by leading scholars who have examined the advance sheets of the book .

		While the modern school of historical criticism has been long committed to the view that the religion of the Bible is in some way the result of an evolutionary process , it has not thus far shown how this religion actually developed .

		Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	puts the evolution itself before us in such a way that we can see the religious ideas of the Bible grad - ually taking shape in response to the pressure of social developments .

		329 THE DRAMA PLAYERS IN
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		After a career checkered with lights and shad - ows , the
Drama Players	ORGANIZATION	, under the direction of Mr.
Donald Robertson	PERSON	, and the joint manage - ment of the
Chicago Theatre Society	ORGANIZATION	and the Messrs.
Shubert	PERSON	, have ended their ten weeks ' season in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and the time has come for a survey of their work as a whole .

		Although the enterprise originated in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and was made possible by the pledges secured here
last summer	DATE	, through Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's personal solicitation , toward a guaranty fund that should provide for the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's share of the expenses , the
Drama Players	ORGANIZATION	opened their season in the
East	LOCATION	, giving performances in
New York	LOCATION	and other cities , for several weeks before their appearance here .

		When they reached
Chicago	LOCATION	, and gave their first performance on the fifth of
February	DATE	, they were equipped with three tested and seasoned pro- ductions .

		Since that time they have rehearsed and produced six more plays , all of which repre - sents an amount of work which , considering the fact that most of the members of the company had been accustomed to go through a whole season with a single part , taxed their energies pretty severely .

		The work was much more diffi - cult than that of the average stock company , which rehearses a new play every week , because the plays given by such companies come to them with all the `` business '' worked out the en - trances and the groupings , and all the matters of stage technique are already indicated in the manuscript .

		But the
Drama Players	ORGANIZATION	had to work with new material , and create from the bare text the living form of the play .

		A pro- duction made under these conditions means a degree of effort , and a confronting of difficult problems , which are never demanded of the ordi - nary stock players .

		There is no tradition to guide , and consequently one must be improvised , which is a more serious matter than the memo - rizing of the parts .

		Nothing but the most har - monious action and the most cordial spirit of cooperation could have made possible the smooth adjustment which has been so striking a feature of these nine productions .

		The following list of the plays will serve to show how much of this pioneer work had to be done : '' The Maternal Instinct , '' by Messrs.
Robert Her	PERSON	rick and
Harrison Rhodes	PERSON	.

Piu Forte	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Giuseppe Giacosa	PERSON	. ''

		La Course du Flambeau , '' by
Paul Hervieu	PERSON	. ''

		Fruen fra Havet , '' by
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	.

		It will be observed that the three plays of Ameri - can authorship which head the list were absol - utely new to the stage , while the five translations from foreign languages were taken up with noth - ing but the indications of the printed text for a guide .

		Whatever stage tradition exists concern - ing them was inaccessible to Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	and his associates , yet in no case was the performance halting or lacking in unity .

		Considering these difficulties , it means a good deal when we say that the performances were in the highest degree sat - isfactory , being characterized by both assurance and finish .

		Such good ensemble acting has not often been seen on any stage , and the artistic triumph of the company has been remarkable , al - though perhaps no greater than we had a right to expect from the fine directive intelligence of Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	and the tested ability of such accom - plished players as those who assumed the heavy responsibilities of the repertoire .

		The names of Miss
Hedwig Reicher	PERSON	,
Miss Effie Shannon	PERSON	,
Miss Charlotte Granville	LOCATION	, Miss
Renee Kelly	PERSON	, Mr.
Herbert Kelcey	PERSON	, Mr.
Sheldon Lewis	PERSON	, Mr.
Lionel Belmore	PERSON	, Mr.
Edward Emery	PERSON	, and Mr.
Hylton Allen	PERSON	are indeed a guaranty of good acting , yet whatever they may be as individual performers , the total of their achievement was something much more than the total of their several abilities , and provided something like a revelation to their audiences .

		Instead of presenting a central figure , artificially forced into prominence , and encircled by inadequate and perfunctory satellites , each of these plays gave us a succession of natural group - ings , in which each character assumed its full value , and from which staginess and the con - ventional trickery of the trade were noticeably absent .

		Such an exhibition of good acting , if given time enough to impress itself upon the public , is sure to win the practical encourage - ment without which no ideal enterprise , unless supported by public or private endowments , can long endure .

		It has been a frequent observation of specta - tors who found the plays , as such , not particu - larly interesting , that almost any kind of a play would be worth seeing in the hands of such actors as these .

		And it must be confessed that the actors have had to struggle with some pretty poor material .

		The glaring fault of the pro- gramme resulted from the determination of the committee of managers to be patriotic at all costs .

		In deciding to produce three plays of American authorship before there were any such plays in sight , they committed themselves to a policy which proved disastrous in its con - sequences , besides being a departure from the fundamental principle of the enterprise .

		The Society was formed , not to take chances with untried material , but to present works of ap - proved merit and unquestionable significance .

		It had the entire literature of the modern drama from
Shakespeare to Shaw	ORGANIZATION	from which to choose , and it deliberately wasted one-third of its energies in a futile attempt to foist three new American plays upon a confiding public .

		Now , broadly speaking , no plays have ever been produced in
America	LOCATION	which are worthy of being included in any list of such masterpieces as it was the avowed intention of the Society to pro- duce ; what , then , was the likelihood of suitable plays turning up among the manuscripts sub - mitted for examination ?

		The management might be taking chances , from the box-office standpoint , with
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	and Goldoni , or with
Ibsen	PERSON	and
Hervieu	PERSON	, or with a score of other playwrights whose place in dramatic literature is too secure to be disputed , but they would have incurred no artistic risk , and would have planted themselves upon entirely safe ground , if they had resolutely eschewed all toying with experimental matter .

		The organization was based upon a definite ideal purpose , and if its professions meant anything at all , they meant an effort to attract the public to approved works of a high literary value .

		They certainly did not mean any attempt to compete with the com - mercial theatre in the exploitation of novelties .

		The actual perversion of the original plan offers a striking illustration of the folly of entrusting its execution to a committee of many minds , and of deciding by vote the plays that should make up the list .

		The result was a departure from the singleness of aim which was absolutely imperative , and all the confusion that comes from compromise , and working at cross - pur - poses , and the effort to reconcile conflicting views .

		Of the three American plays selected , two proved to be dismal failures .

		They were thin , loose - jointed , and amateurish , and the public refused to have them on any terms .

		After the first night of each , when all the supporters of the enterprise rallied to its standard , the audi -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 303 ences dwindled almost to the vanishing point , and they were withdrawn as quite hopeless .

		All the eare expended upon their production , and the remarkably fine acting of which they received the benefit could not make them go , and it became plainly evident that the spark of dramatic vitality was not in them .

		The third , Mr.
Webster	PERSON	's `` June Madness , '' achieved a considerable measure of success .

		It proved to be a good play of the type that attracts audi - ences to the commercial theatre , although we should hardly call it the kind of play which came within the scope of the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's endeavors .

		Its matter was contentious and aroused excited discussion , which was all to the good as far as the box-office receipts were concerned , but it served in no way to emphasize the distinctive character of the enterprise with which it was associated .

		It served rather to indicate that the Drama Players were merely trying to do what the other theatres were doing , and many people were puzzled , by this and by several other productions , to understand how the de - clared objects of the Society were being fur - thered .

		The
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Goldoni	LOCATION	, and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	plays were clearly within its province , as were , some - what less obviously , the plays by
Hervieu	PERSON	,
Gia	ORGANIZATION	- cosa , and
Pinero	PERSON	.

		If , for example , the remaining places in the programme had been filled by works of such dramatists as
Bjornson	LOCATION	,

Sudermann	LOCATION	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Drachmann	PERSON	,
Oehlenschlager	PERSON	, and Echegaray , or even by ex - amples of Elizabethan Drama or old English Comedy , the
Society	ORGANIZATION	would have made a far more definite stand for the principles upon which it rested its claims for public and private support .

		It is , however , gratifying to note that the works of the greatest intrinsic worth , the plays by
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Goldoni	PERSON	, and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, were par - ticularly successful in their appeal , and that the
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	play , indeed , proved to be about the best drawing-card in the entire repertory .

		The les - son from these facts is surely plain , and we trust that it will be heeded in the future .

		The total receipts for the season have been enough to let the guarantors off with the pay - ment of about fifty per cent of the sums pledged by them .

		This is not a bad outcome for the first season of what was confessedly an experimental enterprise .

		The Society had the cordial support of the newspaper press , of the
Drama League	ORGANIZATION	, and of many clubs and other agencies of opinion .

		When we consider the stone wall of apathy and public indifference which stands in the way of any effort for the betterment of a public taste demoralized , as ours has been , in its artistic out - look , it is surprising that so evident a breach was made by this little band of reformers at the first assault .

		As compared with the ill-starred ven - ture of
Chicago	LOCATION	's New Theatre of four years ago , something like a triumph has been scored by the new undertaking , while the losses are insignifi - cant when set beside those of the more recent
New York	LOCATION	enterprise .

		We hope that the work thus inaugurated will go on , winning its way by an unshaken faith in its ideals , and profiting by a realization of its lapses from the straight path .

		The public is always suspicious of being practised upon for its own good , and there is no doubt that the
Chicago Theatre Society	ORGANIZATION	has presented its cause in a way calculated to arouse such sus - picions .

		This feeling has yet to be overcome , and with it the attitude which is influenced by the cynic with his armory of cheap and malicious witticisms .

		Despite all adverse influences , the tide of interest in a rehabilitated stage is steadily rising in this country , and the wave which bears upon its crest the work of the
Drama Players	ORGANIZATION	is moved by the irresistible forces which control the larger movement .

		CAS
UAL	ORGANIZATION	COMMENT .

		ONE OF
STEVENSON	PERSON	'S `` ENCHANTED CIGAR - ETTES '' the books one loves to dream of writing was his autobiography .

		That he did actually begin the enterprise is evidenced by a manuscript now in the possession of Mr.
H. E. Widener	PERSON	, the well-known collector of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		It was writ - ten in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, when
Stevenson	PERSON	was thirty years of age , and covers only the earliest childhood memories .

		The manuscript is in ink on twenty - three pages of an ordinary quarto notebook .

		Ref - erences to the document are found in Mr.
Graham Balfour	PERSON	's
Life of Stevenson	ORGANIZATION	, but it has never before been printed in full .

		This prefatory paragraph has little of the customary Stevensonian ring : '' I have the more interest in beginning these memoirs where and how I do , because I am living absolutely alone in
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and because from two years of anxiety and , according to the doctors , a touch of malaria , I may say I am altogether changed into another character .

		After weeks in this city , I know only a few neighboring streets ; I seem to be cured of all my adventurous whims and even of human curiosity , and am content to sit here by the fire and await the course of fortune .

		Indeed , I know myself no longer , and as I am changed in heart , I hope I have the more chance to look back impartially on all that has come and gone hereto - fore .

		There is , after all , no truer sort of writing than what is to be found in autobiographies , and certainly none more entertaining . ''

		Stevenson tells us that his first introduction to litera - ture was when his uncle ,
David Stevenson	PERSON	, offered a prize of twenty shillings to the family circle for the best history of Moses .

		His own version of the history of Moses , he tells us , `` was copiously illus - trated by the author in a very free style .

		In these 304 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, pictures each Israelite was represented with a pipe in hi - mouth , cheering the desert miles . ''

		The follow - ing is a caustic bit of criticism , evidently inspired by the late Sir
William Gilbert	PERSON	's stage caricatures of elderly unmarried women : '' I think I was bom with a sense of what is dne to age , for the more 1 interrogate my recollections the more traces do I find of that respect struggling with the dislike of what is old and then seemed to me to be ugly .

		Of all the cruel things in life the cruellest , it may be , is the departure of all beauty from those who have been the desired mothers mod mistresses of men in a former generation .

		Pagans like
Horace	PERSON	, derils like
Villon	PERSON	, and yet he was a devil with a dash of the angelic were it only in his wings , and simple crass vulgarians like
Gilbert	PERSON	, so much worse than the worst of the devilish , take an opportunity for some cheap effect of art from these distressing changes .

		I thank God , when I was a child I knew a higher decency . ''

		It is to be hoped that this interesting document in its entirety may some day be made available to all lovers of R. L. 8 .

		Meanwhile , we imagine , each of the forty-five copies of Mr.
Widener	PERSON	's edition would bring something more than its weight in gold in the auction rooms .

		... EXPERIENCES OF A PUBLISHER 'S READER go to fill some of the most entertaining pages of Mr.
J. Henry Harper	PERSON	's historical and reminiscent volume , `` The House of
Harper	PERSON	, '' reviewed at length elsewhere in our last issue .

		It is to be noted , as correcting a preva - lent misapprehension , that the mere typewriting of a manuscript will do little to insure its favorable recep - tion .

		There is a good deal of illegible and illiterate typewriting . ''

		A handwritten manuscript , '' declares Mr.
Harper	PERSON	, `` is in some respects more satisfactory than a typewritten one , for it contains some indication of the author 's character . ''

		Further on he writes : Although the French have a proverb that it is not necessary to eat the whole of an egg to know that it is bad , many amateurs think themselves unfairly used if their manuscript is not read from the first to the last word .

		It is a favorite device to lay traps to catch the reader , and so prove that he has not done his duty by the manuscript .

		The commonest of these is to reverse certain pages in loose-sheet manu - script .

		If these are not turned to their proper posi - tion it follows that they have not been read .

		Other would-be authors will lightly gum together the cor - ners of two pages , or lay pressed leaves or bits of bright-colored worsted between the sheets , which , if undisturbed on the return of the manuscript , are con - vincing evidence to them that the story has not been examined .

		Manuscripts are frequently sent to pub - lishers which have already been declined more than once by them .

		The title may possibly be changed , but even that precaution is not always taken ; these authors evidently assuming that publishers have neither memory nor system . ''

		A particularly daring but unsuccessful fraud is worth citing .

		`` The most extraordinary example of literary imposture that ever came to
Franklin Square	LOCATION	was a manuscript writ - ten in longhand , with numerous erasures and inter - lineations all the earmarks of a genuine piece of work .

		The subject-matter seemed oddly reiuini - cent , although the names and localities were strange .

		Another page or two settled the question ; the book was nothing else than
Mary Shelley	PERSON	's famous ' Frank - enstein . '

		Kvidently the ambitious author had found an old copy of the book tucked away in a dusty corner of some neglected library , and had been im - pressed by the somber power and horror of the tale .

		The book was an old one , and the impostor evidently concluded that it had long since been forgotten .

		with infinite labor , the whole thing had been copied in longhand , with the substitution of American names of persons and places for the originals . ''

		Such are some of the futile devices of those would-be authors whose lack of invention reminds one of Pope 's fam - ous couplet : '' You beat your pate , and fancy wit will come ; Knock as yon please , there 's nobody at home . ''

		LIBRARY BENEFACTIONS IN
1911	DATE	, according to the Bulletin '' of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, assumed unprecedented proportions .

		The total of gifts and bequests in money to American libraries was more than three and
one-third million dollars	MONEY	, which is nearly a million and a half more than was given in the preceding year ; and of this handsome total Mr.
Andrew Carnegie	PERSON	gave nearly two and
one-third million dollars	MONEY	, or more than twice what he gave in
1910	DATE	.

		One hundred and thirty-six towns and cities in this country and twenty-eight in
Canada	LOCATION	were the recipients of his bounty .

		The middle West and the South and the province of
Ontario	LOCATION	profited most largely by his generosity .

		Besides money , the year 's record of gifts includes sixty-five thousand volumes , six sites for library buildings , and seven buildings given for library purposes .

		Prominent men - tion should be made of the splendid gift of Americana from Mr.
Edward E. Ayer	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	to the New - berry Library , whose recently-issued Report says , in part , of this remarkable collection : '' No general statement can do justice to its value , no general de - scription can adequately set forth its importance to historical investigators .

		It may , however , be said with confidence , that no serious student or writer who is concerned with the discovery , colonization , and settlement of
North America	LOCATION	, the history , lan - guages , manners , and customs of the
North Ameri	LOCATION	- can Indians , or the history , etc. , of the Hawaiian and
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	, can afford to overlook the rich store of original materials , printed , manuscript , and pictorial , which the Ayer collection contains . ''

		There are said to be more than thirty-three thousand items in the collection , which has been placed in specially equipped rooms in the
Newberry	LOCATION	library building , there to remain as a visible and useful monument to the giver 's scholarship , public spirit , and generosity .

		.

		THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A `` BOOK '' AND A `` VOLUME '' AND A '' PAMPHLET , '' a rather vague one to most readers , is indicated briefly in an appendix to the current
Newberry Library Report	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- which , by the way , is a brief and hu.-sines .

		s-like and encour - aging record of the year 's progress under Mr.
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 305
William N. C. Carlton	PERSON	's administration -RRB- .

		The defi - nitions to be quoted here were made to meet the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	's needs , and may not commend themselves to every librarian ; but they are at least suggestive and may help toward the general adop - tion of some sort of clear and definite rule that shall do away with certain present ambiguities .

		`` The term ` volume ' is used in the sense of a collection of sheets comprising more than one hundred pages .

		It is distinguished from ' part ' by having a title - page of its own and by being a principal subdivision of a work .

		` Volume ' in the sense of a ` binding , ' enclosing several volumes , pamphlets , numbers , or parts , is called a ` book . '

		Several volumes or pam - phlets may be bound together in one ' book . '

		... An appendix , index , or supplement with an individual title-page is treated like a volume .

		The term ` pam - phlet ' is used in the sense of a collection of sheets com - prising one hundred pages or less -LRB- and not a serial -RRB- , whether bound individually or with others .

		The term ` pamphlet ' is not applied , however , to quarto and folio publications ; these are counted as volumes .

		In its ordinary sense of an unbound collection of a few sheets fastened together , the term ` pamphlet ' has no significance in the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	, be - cause no pamphlets are placed permanently upon the shelves unbound .

		` Pamphlet ' is distinguished from ' number ' -LRB- of a serial -RRB- by being an individual or independent publication . ''

		It is indeed a far cry from this to the etymological meaning of volume -LRB- or parchment roll -RRB- and book -LRB- an inscribed beechen tablet -RRB- and pamphlet -LRB- or palme-fueillet or paume - feuillet , or leaflet to be held in the hand -RRB- a tran - sition for which the printing press is chiefly responsible .

		... PROFESSOR MURRAY ON THE GREEK DRAMA drew a distinguished and an appreciative audience to his
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	lectures .

		To illustrate his scholarly and yet not unpopular style of public lecture , his hu - mor and fancy and graceful wit , let us quote a few words from his opening address on the Greek chorus . ''

		If we do not understand it , we can not understand the three great dramatists .

		Now , what is the diffi - culty ?

		The chorus is completely undramatic , says the average critic ; it breaks the drama .

		When the hero - ine is engaged in some plot , arranging to murder her husband , or taking some such step for the good of the community , then fifteen visitors happen in .

		Some - times they have a reason for coming , sometimes not .

		Usually they are homogeneous : if there is one old gentleman , then there will be fifteen old gentlemen .

		And it does n't help matters if the fifteen visitors begin to dance . ''

		But , after all , the vaudeville per - formance on the part of the venerable gentlemen , or of whomsoever the chorus consists , is not out of harmony with the spirit of the occasion .

		The dance is no mere tripping of the light fantastic toe ; the whole body rhythmically moves to express the over - flow of emotion for which verbal utterance is inade - quate .

		The chorus raises us to the higher world of spiritual beauty and lofty speculation , that '' spiritual world to which lyrical emotion exalts the inward eye , where metaphor is the very stuff of life . ''

		So genial and well-equipped an exponent of `` the glory that was
Greece	LOCATION	'' has not come to us from abroad since Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	's memorable visit .

		ONE TRAINING FOR SUCCESSFUL AUTHORSHIP , notably uncommon and hardly to be commended , was that of Karl
May	DATE	, the German writer of tales of adventure for boys .

		His recent death at Dres - den in his seventieth year calls attention to the fact that his earlier life was devoted to highway robbery and other forms of illegal acquisition of property , and that he was not unfamiliar with the interior aspect of jails and prisons .

		A cave in the vicinity of
Dresden	LOCATION	was the young bandit 's retreat , whence he and a confederate sallied forth to terrorize the neighborhood .

		At last the constituted authorities made this exciting mode of life a little too hazard - ous for
May	DATE	, and he disappeared from view .

		Four years later a gentleman of good looks and distin - guished bearing made his appearance in
Dresden	LOCATION	and applied himself to the writing of such interest - ing stories of adventure for the local newspapers that the great publishing houses solicited the pro- ducts of his pen for book publication .

		The result was that hundreds of tales , both original and translated from the Arabian , Turkish , Persian , and Chinese , were produced by him .

		Our own far West , with its redskin braves , formed the scene of some of
Herr May	ORGANIZATION	's stirring tales .

		In later life he became reli - gious , figured prominently in the Roman Catholic church of
Saxony	LOCATION	, and wrote tracts for the conver - sion of the heathen all the while amassing wealth from his work in fiction , and growing in the respect and good opinion of his community .

		THE FATE OF HIM WHO WILL NOT READ pre - sents itself , rightly enough , to the editor of '' The Newarker '' as something lamentable to contemplate .

		Business failure as well as personal chagrin lies in ambush for the heedless and self-willed person who persists in making the journey down life 's highway with no packet of literature , frequently renewed , in his luggage .

		We are reminded that within the last few years the greatest business corporation in the world has wasted thousands of dollars in costly experiments in steel-making , whereas if the officials concerned had read the text-books and periodicals of their branch of industry they would have found in plain print just the information -LRB- gathered and written down by others -RRB- that they needed .

		They do these things better in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		There the product of the printing-press is valued at something like its true worth ; and your bespectacled German , with his nose in a book , is somehow learning how to get ahead of his competitors in many of the races entered by the nations of the world .

		With the justi - fiable pride of an elert and energetic librarian , Mr.
Dana	PERSON	concludes his editorial on the prime necessity 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, of reading : '' And the world is so full of interesting things in print ; and an index of all of it -LSB- ! -RSB-

		and a good deal of the latest and best of the print itself , are in your own public library ! ''

		Verily , he that being often admonished to read hardeneth his neck , shall suddenly be destroyed , and that without remedy .

		BOOKS , BOOKSHOPS , AND LIBRARIES IN
AUSTRALIA	LOCATION	picture themselves in some imaginations as rivalling the snakes of
Ireland	LOCATION	in scarcity .

		Hence the surprise with which at least a few readers must have learned from an article in the
March	DATE	'' Book Monthly , `` signed by
Katharine S. Prichard	PERSON	, that `` the facilities for reading are not in
England	LOCATION	as great as they are in
Australia	LOCATION	, '' and that `` it is easier to get a classic of English literature in the back blocks of
Australia	LOCATION	than in many a rural district of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Further - more , `` a mining camp scarcely emerges from its canvas coverings before it is demanding books ; and a place for its Town Hall and Free Library , or Me - chanics ' Institute , is marked on the plan of the new town as soon as it has one . ''

		Innumerable smaller circulating libraries and book clubs supplement the activities of the public libraries , and '' the appetite for books , fostered by the public libraries , is in the end appeased by the bookshops . ''


Cole	PERSON	's Book Arcade in
Melbourne	LOCATION	has the name of being the most won - derful bookshop in the world .

		It is a bookshop and a thoroughfare in one , where the book-lover may ramble and loiter and browse from early morn till late at night , and no one importunes him to buy .

		The consuming hunger for books , which only those who have lived in the backwoods and the `` back blocks '' can know in its greatest intensity , and which in not a few instances seems to vary inversely as the square of the population , has evidently been felt by our Australian cousins .

		LITERATURE AND THE STAGE .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Of late years there has been a steady procession of novelists towards the theatre .

		The late Oscar Wilde and Mr.
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	may be said to have started the movement ; but the authors of '' Dorian Gray '' and of ``
Cashel Byron	PERSON	's Profession '' could hardly , perhaps , be classed in the first rank of novelists .

		They belonged to literature as a whole , not to any specific branch of it ; and it is probable that they came to the stage because they were on the look-out for some fresh form more suitable to their qualities than that of fiction .

		But there followed Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	, to the astonishment of the critics , for the historian of Thrums was almost the last man that appeared a likely candidate for high honors on the stage .

		It did not seem possible that he could get that freakish humor of his across the footlights .

		But he did ; and with an astounding success .

		Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	may be said to have given the theatre-goer a new sensation .

		The stalls learned quickly to enjoy his sly Scottish unexpectedness , the sudden stabs of pathos that gave an additional zest to the quaint humor .

		They took
Barrie	PERSON	to their hearts as a dra - matist : at one time he had as many as three plays running in
London	LOCATION	simultaneously to crowded houses ; while his `` Peter Pan '' became a hardy an - nual , regularly expected and as regularly patronized every Christmas season .

		To Mr.
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	succeeded Mr.
Somerset Maugham	PERSON	, a novelist of some eminence , though per - haps of no very great circulation .

		His `` Liza of Lambeth , '' however , had obtained a certain success , at a time when fiction was concerning itself with mean streets and the slums of great cities .

		Mr.
Maugham	PERSON	proved to be a dramatist of the more ordi - nary type , a producer of `` social '' plays , not widely different from the work of such hardened playwrights as
Sutro	ORGANIZATION	or
Henry Arthur Jones	PERSON	.

		But there was a freshness about Mr.
Maugham	PERSON	's work that com - mended it to the public ; and in a short time he , too , had the pleasure of seeing three plays from his pen running simultaneously in
London	LOCATION	.

		For a time man - agers competed eagerly for his work ; now , perhaps , the novelty of the thing has worn off a little , or , possibly , playgoers are become more serious .

		But Mr.
Maugham	PERSON	, like Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	, may now be said to have definitely abandoned fiction for the drama .

		There are a host of others who .

		without entirely deserting their first love , dally with the stage .

		It is a fascinating gamble : even a moderate success means so much more , from the money point of view , than can generally be obtained from the publisher for the mere book rights of a novel .

		The first step is gen - erally taken when some enterprising cobbler of plays approaches the author of a successful novel with an offer to adapt it for theatrical production .

		Commonly the offer is accepted , for it is interesting to see what will happen , and a half share in the proceeds seems good pay for practically no work .

		Even if it is not accepted , the seed is sown : before long the author will find himself attempting an adaptation of his own .

		Once permit the dramatic bacillus to obtain a lodg - ment in the brain , and it multiplies as swiftly as the bacillus of any other known disease .

		Mr.
Anthony Hope Hawkins	PERSON	fell by permitting the late Mr.
Edward Rose	PERSON	to fit '' The Prisoner of Zenda '' to the exigencies of the stage : since that time he has never regarded the writing of fiction with anything more than a toler - ant regard , his real love is the stage , and his work has not improved in consequence .

		Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle	PERSON	underwent , in like fashion , a severe attack of dramatic measles , induced in the first instance by the dramatization of * '
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	. ''

		He is now , happily , almost recovered : he has indeed announced his intention of devoting himself once more to the writing of books which should be good news for all lovers of healthy fiction .

		But while the fever was on him , he contrived to produce at least five plays ; of which one , `` The
House of Temperley	ORGANIZATION	, '' ran for a considerable time .

		Perhaps his best work in this field was ``
Waterloo	LOCATION	, '' the little adaptation that he made
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 307 from one of his short stories for the late Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	.

		This is still revived from time to time .

		It was , I imagine , the example of
J. M. Barrie	PERSON	and
Somerset Maugham	LOCATION	that started so many of our other novelists on the new road to fame and fortune .

		Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	, the author of `` Clementina '' and formerly an actor himself , tried his hand at an adaptation : Mr.
W. W. Jacobs	PERSON	, the darling of so many readers of the `` Strand Magazine , `` produced `` Beauty and the Barge , '' but has not repeated the experiment .

		Mr.
E. W. Hornung	PERSON	, the ingenious founder of a school of burgling fiction , dramatized `` Raffles '' with conspicuous success , and followed it up with ''
Stin	PERSON	- garee , '' which met with no success at all .

		Mr.
F. Anstey Guthrie	PERSON	brought out '' The Man from Blank - ley 's , '' and turned his `` Brass Bottle '' into a play ; while Mr.
H. A. Vachell	PERSON	dramatized one of his pop - ular novels in `` Her Son . ''

		Indeed , so great has been the rush of late that it is impossible to mention all the names that recur to the mind .

		Enterprising managers have drawn the most unlikely customers into their net : even Mr.
Henry James	PERSON	has been mangled for the delectation of the gallery , as well as the late
George Meredith	PERSON	.

		Only the other day Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's `` New Religion '' was produced , and withdrawn ; while Mr.
Eden Philpotts	PERSON	has succeeded in offending the censor with his '' Secret Woman '' thereby , no doubt , sending a new host of readers to the book from which his play was drawn .

		For there is this point about the dramatization of novels , that at the worst the production of your play means a new edition of your book , while those who have read the novel have a certain curiosity to see how it will appear upon the stage .

		There are at the present moment an even larger number than usual of novelists ' plays being per - formed in
London	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
R. S. Hichens	PERSON	has made a successful entry into the theatrical arena with ``
Bella Donna	PERSON	, '' which seems likely to have as long a run as anything now playing .

		The late
George du Maurier	PERSON	's `` Trilby '' is enjoying a revival , in which Sir Herbert Tree is once more proving his strength as an actor of melodrama . ''

		Trilby '' is one of the few instances of a successful novel making an even more successful play : it has two fine characters , and the public like the free and easy Bohemian life of the artists ' quarter .

		But the theatre is a lottery , and it is impossible to tell what will bear transplant - ing .

		`` The Scarlet Pimpernel , '' by the
Baroness Orczy	PERSON	, has been revived again and again ; but there was certainly not much in the book to suggest the remarkable success of the adaptation .

		There is not a character in the piece , with the possible exception of the French spy .

		But there is a sort of bustling liveliness about the action , and there are some pretty dresses in the scene at the court of the
Prince Regent	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	is one of the latest recruits lent by literature to the stage .

		He has one play running now , and another has just been taken off .

		As might be judged from his novels , he shows plenty of cleverness , and his dialogue is as good as need be ; but I doubt whether he really possesses the dra - matic sense .

		Still , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	will no doubt ac - quire this quality , if he does not already quite see his situations from the theatrical standpoint .

		He has confidence in himself , and great perseverance .

		At an early period in his life as an author he had mapped out for himself the course he meant to pur - sue , and he followed it with a single mind until he achieved success .

		He declared his intention of writ - ing a certain number of stories that would sell , inter - spersing with them a few that should make his name as a serious novelist .

		Many of us have had this idea before , but I can recall no other instance of any writer carrying it out with such eminently satisfac - tory results .

		The man who could do this ought to have a good chance of conquering the theatrical world , and I should not be in the least surprised to see Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	become one of our most popular dramatists , when once he has found out what the public really wants .

		Mr.
Rudolf Besier	PERSON	has recently adapted for the stage yet another novel ''
Kipps	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	.

		I do not think Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has made any previous appearance on the stage , and it seems improbable that this venture will give him much encouragement to proceed .

		It is a pity that Mr.
Wells	PERSON	did not try his own hand at the adaptation , instead of employing a trained dramatist for the purpose .

		For the quality that made ''
Kipps	PERSON	'' as a book is entirely absent from the present stage ver - sion .

		The little shop assistant is employed merely as the central figure of a farce : it is his business to be ridiculous , and the humanity , the little sympathetic touches , that gave life to Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's charming novel , are lost .

		The present version is a vulgarization of a fine story .

		But I doubt very much whether the work of this author is suited to the theatre .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has so much to say , and he finds it so difficult to leave anything out . ''

		The
New Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	'' was spoiled as a work of art by the wideness and diversity of its range : it might have been named `` Wells on the World in General . ''

		And the nov - elist has infinitely more latitude than the playwright .

		Yet , on the other hand , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has ideas : he thinks for himself , and is always changing his point of view ; he would indubitably prove an interesting recruit to the theatre .

		It is conceivable that he might , with Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and his brother novelist Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	, form a small band of dramatists who should deal on the stage with some - thing more vital than the trivialities of our customary social comedy .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's latest play , '' The Pigeon , '' was not a success .

		But he has proved his ability to write for the stage , and there is food for thought in everything he writes . ''

		Justice '' was universally acknowledged to be a very fine piece of work : it will certainly be seen again .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	has been attracted to the theatre because he has some - thing to say , not from a mere desire to make money easily .

		He is not of those who seek to produce : ; t8 THE DIAL -LSB-
April	DATE	1C , stage versions of their novels .

		And , so far at any rate , his association with the stage has not spoiled his writing .

		I am inclined to think that this is the worst effect of coquetting with the drama : it is apt to make the novelist write theatrically .

		Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, I remember , once wrote an amusing short story about a man who was ruined by becoming a dra - matic critic .

		The tricks of the trade crept into his daily life : he could not resist the temptation to act : he accentuated his emotions until he became the laughingstock of his friends and an object of amused contempt to the girl he loved .

		The same danger , in a way , hangs over the innocent writer of fiction who is seduced by the figures of the box - office and the undeniable charm of seeing his char - acters tread the boards in actual flesh and blood .

		He begins to see everything from the point of view of the stalls and the dress circle : he can not resist the opportunity of bringing in an effective piece of business , or of concluding a chapter with a dramatic curtain .

		Novelists like Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	, who have acquired the habit of writing with a view to subse - quent production on the stage , have thus a tendency to force the emotional note , to pitch everything in too high a key .

		Certainly Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	can - not be accused of this fault ; but then he keeps his fiction and his drama separate .

		And this , to my mind , should always be done .

		I am glad to see that Mr.
H. A. VachelPs	PERSON	new play , soon to be produced , is a new work and not , like his former effort in this direction , a dramatized version of a novel .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		A WORD FOR MAGAZINE VERSE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A
Philadelphia	LOCATION	newspaper editor once asked the ques - tion , '' What 's the use of poetry , anyhow ? ''

		Doubtless many could enlighten the enquirer ; yet in the process of enlightenment , if we are to believe certain critics , magazine verse would be dispensed with .

		According to these critics , magazine verse is just good enough for its obvious purpose : to `` justify '' pages , to fill up the flunks , the nooks .

		This attitude of good-natured toler - ance seems to be a general one among reviewers .

		It is certainly true that magazine verse plays a small part on the literary stage .

		Editors aver that there is little or no demand for it among their readers ; magazines certainly prosper without it ; and in collected book form it rewards only the printer .

		Indeed , the situation looks bad for our poets and for magazine verse .

		But we have heard from the critic , the reviewer , the editors , and the poets themselves .

		Now why not have a word from a lover of verse , one who buys certain magazines simply for the poetry they contain , and for no other reason ?

		Frankly , a lover of verse the present writer claims to be ; and his ideas muy be interesting if not enlightening .

		Where are the lovers of verse ?

		One would expect the echoes to answer , `` Where ? ''

		The true answer is , nevertheless , that they are everywhere .

		By way of proof it can be suggested to the doubter that be note the deluge of inquiries for facts concerning jmcin - .

		\ s Im-Ii flood the offices of such newspapers as maintain a depart - ment to answer such inquiries .

		Let him note , also , the poems that are re-copied over tin - country iu the news - papers not the cheap doggerel of the daily `` joke '' column , but serious and thoughtful verse from the best magazines .

		Then , too , the doubter might try to discover the home without its scrap-book of verse .

		Personal observation has shown that there are many who buy magazines not because of the fiction writer whose name glories on the cover , but because on the contents page was listed in small type the name of a favorite poet or a goodly array of poems .

		To the immediate query , If there is such an array of poetry lovers , why are they not more often heard from ?

		there is an answer .

		Those who read and enjoy magazine verse are not the kind who make much of the fact ; the popularity of a poem can not be tested by the number of letters of commendation that come into the editor 's office .

		The reason lies in the fact that magazine verse is essentially lyrical , and therefore of a very intimate nature ; it deals with individual thought and feeling , and is effective in just so far as it touches the individual mind and heart of the reader .

		The result is that a reader is not likely to reveal to an editor bis deep appreciation of a poem , he does not bare his intimacies to a stranger in this way .

		The poem that frames in expressive words the longing of a heart for a loved one will never bring a letter of gratitude to an editor , though it may have touched and been treasured by thousands of hearts .

		A fact which critics and reviewers never seem to take into consideration in their criticism of our magazine poets is that the lyrical nature of their work limits its appeal .

		Most magazine poems consist of only three or four stanzas ; and within such limits verse must be essen - tially subjective in thought , mode , and treatment .

		So a reader whose life is wholly or largely objective can never be interested by a lyric , though it were written by Israfel himself ; such a person has nothing in him to respond to the intimate and tender beauty of a lyric poem : the wood of which he is made will not resound to the throb of the strings .

		The narrow confines of the lyric do not give the breadth and depth which great themes of large imagina - tive and intellectual character require ; but the quality of the lyrical matter may be just as high in a poetic sense as that of greater import .

		A
spring	DATE	may be as perfect in purity and beauty as a lake .

		From a long and loving familiarity with the lyric writers of the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan , Romantic , and Victorian Periods of our litera - ture , I can turn to some of our current niHgazine poets and feel that I am reading work which ranks with that of the sweetest singers of the song-filled days of the past .

		I would even venture to mention the names of these poets , did I not feel that in doing so I were cross - ing the Bridge of the Open Heart into the critic 's
House of Ancient Conceptions	ORGANIZATION	.

		And so we who are lovers of verse will continue to read on , silent save for a voice out of the wilderness like mine , content to listen to the lutes that are singing clearly and sweetly from the '' nooks in the magazines , '' heanng , above the honk of automobiles , the blasts of mills , the grind of wheels , and the frenzied babblings of factions , the still small voice of Song .

		THE DIAL 309 | Ufaj jhwhs .

		CARDINAL , Some years ago , an able Protestant writer .

		Professor
Charles Sarolea	PERSON	, warned us that we were not to expect too much from Mr.
Wilfrid Ward	PERSON	's promised life of
Newman	PERSON	.

		It would be , he assured us , '' only an ' official ' and expur - gated life '' ; and he inquired , in italics , whether it was not a fact that at least one important letter of
Newman	PERSON	's had been deliberately destroyed .

		We can not know , of course , to how drastic a process of revision Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's pages have been subjected by authority , but it seems unlikely that anything has been suppressed more `` com - promising '' than many things that have been included .

		There is no attempt whatever to con - ceal
Newman	PERSON	's almost continuous unhappiness from the time he entered the Catholic Church until
1878	DATE	, nor to gloss over the neglect with which he was treated by his superiors and its effect upon him .

		So far the most unsympa - thetic critic of his career may enjoy an easy triumph .

		But nothing , on the other hand , can be plainer than that , in spite of the agitations , much more than superficial , of almost his whole Catholic life , in spite of the waves and billows that , one after another , went over him , in the depths there was peace the peace , to be sure , of Purgatory , rather than that of
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	, as he once intimates ; but peace nevertheless , deep - based and unshakable .

		Almost from the beginning , his Catholicism was suspected by Catholics and Protestants alike .

		Not until he had written a sharp and rather uncivil letter to the newspapers did the rumor cease to recur that he was about to re - turn to the Anglican communion .

		He deplores his friend
William George Ward	PERSON	's '' never dying misgiving '' that they were '' in some substan - tial matter at variance , '' and `` the vague , deep suspicions '' that
Ward	PERSON	had long cherished con - cerning him .

		These suspicions and misgivings were shared by great numbers of Catholics who were , unfortunately , in positions of authority , and they account very largely for the cloud under which
Newman	PERSON	lived for long and weary years .

		Such an attitude on the part of timid men of commonplace minds -LRB- though it should be said in passing that Ward was neither timid nor commonplace -RRB- is intelligible enough towards a man of
Newman	PERSON	's temper , who could walk * THE LIFE OF JOHN HENKY CARDINAL
NEWMAN	PERSON	.

Wilfrid Ward	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated .

Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		securely on giddy intellectual heights , with abysses of error yawning on either side of him , and who could so walk precisely because he per - ceived the abysses and their peril .

		Such men thought him headstrong , venturesome , scornful of the safe and beaten way .

		He thought them blind to the necessity of striking out a path that should allure more daring spirits than theirs to the heights which he , as firmly as they , believed to be the dwelling-place of Truth .

		There are many passages in these volumes that show how deeply
Newman	PERSON	felt the disapproval of his fellow-Catholics .

		The pathetic letter in which he resumed his intercourse with
Keble	ORGANIZATION	after seventeen years , the eagerness with which he renewed his Anglican friendships , show to what a degree he felt himself alone .

		In the midst of the suspicion and misunderstanding to which he was subjected , he wistfully looked back to his early home and his own people , away from the cheerless and alien world in which , for conscience ' sake , he had taken up his abode .

		Not that he had not there also friendships of the utmost tenderness and intimacy .

		The touching close of the '' Apologia '' tells us how tender and how intimate those friendships were .

		But at best the atmosphere of his new home was not the warm , kindling atmosphere of Oxford days , when heart spoke indeed to heart , when all were `` of one heart and of one soul , '' and had all intellectual things in common .

		Of one of these renewed friendships he writes : `` It was a sad pleasure to me to find how very closely we agreed on a number of matters which have happened since we met .

		It was almost like two clocks keeping time . ''

		This isolation , this atmosphere of misunder - standing and suspicion , not to say hostility , this entire want of sympathy with his deepest hopes , make up the tragedy of
Newman	ORGANIZATION	's Catholic life .

		And `` tragedy '' is not too strong a name to ap - ply to it .

		Intentionally or not , Mr.
Ward	PERSON	has made him the hero of what is , considering the great importance of its issues , a tragic drama , in which his antagonist is the embodied suspicion of his superiors in the Church .

		Mr.
Ward	PERSON	explicitly affirms that
Newman	PERSON	's temperament , difficult as it was , does not account for the small success of his Catholic undertakings small , that is to say , in proportion to his effort and his powers .

		The cause , he says , '' is to be sought rather in the action of his countrymen who op - posed him and in the circumstances of the time which gave them their opportunity . ''

		Here evidently is the very stuff of tragedy : a temper - ament unduly sensitive and perhaps impatient 310 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, compelled to collaborate for great ends with a body of men timid , suspicious , and even jealously hostile , in circumstances such as to make their hostility in the highest degree effective .

		His antagonists , be it understood , were not villains of melodrama .

		They were , almost without ex - ception , men of exalted aims and holy lives .

		It was a conflict of temperaments , a true psycho - logical tragedy .

		One by one , great undertak - ings into which he had put his highest hope and best effort were thwarted , sometimes by what seemed like harsh and arbitrary intervention , sometimes by an equally wounding neglect ; until at last , when he had all but ceased to strug - gle or to hope , he received that sudden and ample justification which , in the case of the suf - fering -LRB- Edipus at
Colonus	LOCATION	,
Jebb	PERSON	finely calls tlit - divine amends . ''

		This is the true subject of these volumes , for Mr.
Ward	PERSON	very properly gives little space to the events of
Newman	ORGANIZATION	's life before
1845	DATE	.

		They have been sufficiently dealt with in the '' Apo - logia '' and the Letters and Correspondence .

		Those who care for richer detail may seek it in the chroniques scandaleuses of
Abbott	LOCATION	.

		It is the
Catholic Newman	ORGANIZATION	about whom , in spite of his Catholic writings , we were ignorant , and whom Mr.
Ward	PERSON	has candidly and admirably unveiled .

		We are quite sure that the main interest of these memorable volumes will be the light which they throw on the question that will not down in the mind of any non-Catholic student and admirer of
Newman	PERSON	: how far did his conversion prevent him from independent thought ?

		What was his real attitude from within towards that authority which , from without , so imposed it - self upon his imagination ?

		No one at this time of day is likely to accuse
Newman	PERSON	of obscurant - ism or timidity .

		But how , practically , did he accommodate himself to the restrictions which , he firmly believed , it is the right of the Church to impose in intellectual matters ?

		This is evi - dently the question which Mr.
Ward	PERSON	has set himself to answer , and which he has answered with candor and completeness . ''

		The mystery of
Newman	PERSON	, '' so far as a minute knowledge of his inner and outer life can clear it up , is no longer a mystery .

		We think it not too much to say that Mr.
Ward	PERSON	has made
Newman	PERSON	's atti - tude entirely intelligible and reasonable , unless perhaps it should seem unreasonable for such a man loyally to share the faith and hope of men in whose conduct reason apparently had so small a place .

		The signs of suspicion are manifest from the first .

		The hereditary Catholics of
England	LOCATION	, whose spirit had been well-nigh crushed out of them by the long oppression uinlcr which they had suffered , naturally regarded the aggressive enterprises of the distinguished convert with `` jealous inertia . ''

		They perceived , moreover .

		as did others later , that his thinking did not run in familiar grooves , that while his results might be sound , his methods of arriving at them were unexpected .

		Or , as
Perrone	PERSON	, the leading theologian at
Rome	LOCATION	, once phrased it ,
Newman	PERSON	looked at certain doctrinal questions not as we who have been brought up in the Catholic Faith from our childhood . '' ''

		He meant , I think , '' writes
Ambrose St. John to Newman	PERSON	, that u you viewed them -LRB- though with the best intentions -RRB- historically , as a person not wholly in the secret would do . ''

		Well , those who were '' in the secret , '' whether by birth or initiation , first the '' old Catholics '' of En - gland , then the Irish bishops , then
Manning	PERSON	,
Ward	PERSON	, and
Vaughan	PERSON	, then Propaganda saw to it that the thought and activity of this unac - countable mind should be confined within as nar - row limits as possible .

		Even in the matter of the cardinalate , which put an end to the long period of hostility , it is fairly clear , in spite of Mr.
Ward	PERSON	's discretion , that
Manning	PERSON	did little or nothing to further
Newman	PERSON	's elevation , and , so far as passive resistance could do so , opposed it .

		Criticized and thwarted on every hand , it is little wonder that a man of
Newman	PERSON	's tem - per became all but disheartened , ami that caustic comments escaped his tongue and pen .

		These comments Mr.
Ward	PERSON	does right to print as a guarantee of good faith ; but , once read , they need not be repeated and may well be forgotten .

		No man ought to bear forever the burden of his own impatient speech , especially when that speech is so abundantly warranted .

		It proves neither that he was a bad Catholic nor a bad Christian , but only that he was a suffering , much-baffled man , whose personal dignity could be offended and whose anger could be roused .

		There is nothing very edifying about this part of the story , but then , except to persons who have no proper conception of '' such a being as man in such a world as this , '' it is neither shocking nor surprising .

		The treasure of the
Catholic Faith	ORGANIZATION	has been undoubtedly often con - tained in vessels of very ordinary clay ; but it is a treasure , for all that , and in
Newman	PERSON	it had a vessel almost wholly worthy of it .

		One thing , too , should never be forgotten in reading these volumes .

		Beneath all the misunderstand - ings and resentments , there is a genuine desire
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 311 to do the will of God , to check the advance , not of free thought , but of infidelity , and to keep pure and whole in the hearts of men , in these distressful days , the `` Faith once delivered to the Saints . ''

		It was
Newman	PERSON	's supposed `` liberalism , '' no doubt , that was the root of his troubles , his liberalism coupled with his attractiveness .

		The terror of his power is almost ludicrous .

		He himself , in his last days , said with a smile : '' I think -LSB-
Ward	PERSON	's -RSB- theory was that I was all the more dangerous because I was so attractive that I was a sort of siren of whose fascination all should beware . ''

		Talbot considered him `` the most dangerous man in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		He was forbidden to establish the Oratory at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	because his presence would be sure to attract to that nursery of error the best Catholic youth of the three kingdoms .

		When such powers of fasci - nation were allied to such opinions , it was little wonder that he was feared by the Irish bishops , who , as he said , regarded '' any intellectual man as being on the road to perdition . ''

		He wrote in
1864	DATE	that the great obstacle to setting on foot a historical review was that , '' unless one doctored all one 's facts , one would be thought a bad Cath - olic . ''

		He severed his connection with `` The Rambler '' at the request of his bishop , who , by the way , was his staunch ally , and who based his request on the ground that '' Catholics never had a doubt , '' and that it therefore '' pained them to know that things could be considered doubtful which they had ever implicitly believed . ''

		In circumstances like these , a man of
Newman	ORGANIZATION	's mental energy and intellectual conscience could hardly escape calumny .

		Yet his aims were mod - erate , his `` liberalism , '' according to modern Protestant standards , very mild indeed .

		He feared to have the Church left behind in the march of thought .

		He wished her , in the per - son of her accredited teachers , to face the facts of the day .

		He believed that '' the great prob - lem of the hour '' was `` to promote the influence of Catholic Christianity on modern civilization '' ; and to have any such influence the Church must at least perceive whither modern civilization is tending and fairly face its problems and its perils .

		In
1886	DATE	, he sent to his biographer a memoran - dum in which he urged the necessity of drawing up a systematic statement of the chief points at issue between scientists and the Church , so that these points might be '' candidly discussed among Catholic theologians and men of science with the sanction of
Rome	LOCATION	itself . '' ''

		Such frank debate , '' he thought , '' would result in the erection of an authority on the subjects in question which would inspire general confidence . ''

		But all that he in - sists upon is free and intelligent discussion .

		He is ready to submit absolutely and loyally to the decision of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is not a Modernist , though , by a singular fate , he is one of the fathers of Modernism , in both
France	LOCATION	and En - gland .

		There is , he wisely thought , a time to speak and a time to keep silence .

		The truth is dependent on no one man 's advocacy .

		It can wait , for truth out of season is practically no truth at all .

		`` I have always preached , '' he writes , '' that things which are really useful , still are done , according to God 's will , at one time , not at another ; and that , if you attempt at a wrong time , what in itself is right , you may per - haps become a heretic or schismatic . ''

		And so , in concluding the
Dublin University	ORGANIZATION	lectures , he urges his hearers to '' trust the Church of God implicitly , '' to remember the difficulties of her task , the length of her experience , the greatness of her achievement .

		He begs them , in a word , to be patient like her , and to await the slow re - vealing of the mind of God .

		He was , in the best sense of the word , an opportunist , and this was the reason for his valiant opposition to the
Vati	PERSON	- can decrees of
1870	DATE	.

		He regarded the new definition of Infallibility as unnecessary and inopportune , and the means by which it was brought about as inviting '' a stern Nemesis '' upon the Church for the deeds of an `` insolent and aggressive faction . ''

		He had long held the doctrine in a sane and moderate form , as the later pages of the `` Apologia '' testify .

		But he feared the effect of defining it , of making it de fide , upon the fortunes of the Church at so critical a juncture .

		He was stirred to anger and dismay at the flippant shortsightedness of
Ward	PERSON	, who was quoted as saying that he `` should like a new Papal Bull '' he meant an '' infallible '' one `` every morning with his Times at breakfast . ''

		On this extreme view , that the Pope could hardly speak except infallibly , one of the Fathers of the Oratory wittily observed that
Ward	PERSON	and men like him ascribed to the Pope `` a gift ` like that of Midas ' touch of gold , ' very wonderful , but very inconvenient . ''

		While the dogma was not affirmed in any such extreme form as
Newman	PERSON	at first feared , the best he could say of it was that he was `` pleased at its moderation that is , if the doctrine in question is to be defined at all . ''

		Thereafter he was silent , but his position was probably that of the Psalmist : '' I held my tongue and spake nothing : I kept silence , yea , even from good words ; but it was pain and grief to me . ''

		It should , however , be remembered that in this instance it was only his sense of 812 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, expediency that he was obliged to submit , not his faith .

		Some of his unhappiness was due , it is evident , to unfortunate personal qualities , un - fortunate , that is , in the circumstances .

		From his childhood , he was cursed with an almost morbid sensitiveness to praise and blame , and this , Mr.
Ward	PERSON	points out , often stood in his way .

		Where another man would have claimed his rights and insisted upon a hearing ,
Newman	PERSON	took refuge in a dignified , not a sulky , silence , when be found himself misunderstood or treated with discourtesy .

		He found it hard , as he said , '' to wait at Episcopal doors '' and to endure Episcopal manners . ''

		I suppose it is what he learned at
Rome	LOCATION	, '' he says of one of the Irish bishops , alluding to the abrupt manners and high-handed ways that prevailed at the Curia and at Propaganda .

		For
Pius IX	ORGANIZATION	.

		he felt the love as well as the loyalty of a son , but he found him surrounded by '' second-rate people '' who were not subjects of that supernatural guid - ance which is his prerogative . ''

		He viewed '' with equanimity the prospect of a thorough routing-out of things at
Rome	LOCATION	, '' and he cherished the hope that '' the Latin race will not always have a monopoly of the magisterium of Cathol - icism . ''

		He writes in his journal of
1860	DATE	that , next to the praise of God , he has sought the praise of his superiors , but that he has been '' treated only with slight and unkindness '' ; he has been '' misrepresented , backbitten , and scorned '' ; and he concludes that though they have a claim upon his obedience , they have none upon his '' admiration or inward trust . ''

		This state of mind is the result not of thwarted ambition or of injured self-love , but of his eager desire to be of use to the Church for which he had sacrificed everything but his conscience and his love of the Truth .

		Often in his letters and journals the mournful reflection occurs that
Rome	LOCATION	is throwing him away . ''

		When I am gone , '' he writes in
1859	DATE	, '' it will be seen per - haps that persons stopped me from doing a '' ' / / / which I might have done . ''

		His small success was no doubt due in part also to a certain in - capacity for managing men .

		With all his fas - cination he was perhaps unfitted by nature to control others .

		One of his friends explains this on the ground that '' he had too keen a sympathy for individuality to enforce the necessary drill . ''

		And indeed his results were always gained by quite other than party methods by the seminal method , rather ; and more than one profound and far-reaching tendency in both the Anglican and Roman communions to-day testifies to the efficacy of his seed-sowing . ''

		Paucorum num sum '' he wrote , and if you choose your '' few '' with care , there is , in the long run , no better way .

		At last the tide of official favor turned .

		The cloud of neglect and misunderstanding was lifted .

		He passed , almost in an instant , from the posi - tion of '' a nobody , '' as he sorrowfully said , to the rank of a prince of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		He had not sought high place , and no man ever consid - ered himself less competent to fill it .

		He had desired only to work , to be useful , and he had been `` laid aside , '' apparently `` thrown away . ''

		And then , when he could work no more , he sud - denly found that what he had accomplished against baffling obstacles , though so much less than he wished , though as nothing in his eyes , was valued and honored by those whom , umK-r God , he most wished to please .

		He found , in - deed , that it was he that was honored and valued , that his life was his work , and that the Church to which it had been devoted accepted and crowned it .

		Little wonder that he exclaimed when he was informed of the cardinalate , '' The cloud is lifted from me forever . ''

		The twelve years that re - mained to him were years of peace .

		Surrounded by the love and devotion of his sons of the Ora - tory , by the admiration and respect of his coun - trymen , by the veneration of the Catholic world , he lived out his appointed days . ''

		The weight of years , '' he had written long before , '' falls on me as snow , gently though surely . ''

		His bond with life was loosened link by link , while he watched the process with clear mind and peace - ful acquiescent heart .

		When he died , it seemed to many , as Mr.
R. W. Hutton	PERSON	said , that `` a white star was extinguished in their mental hori - He was not a saint .

		To an admirer who / on .

		desired to canonize him in his lifetime , he wrote : '' Saints are not literary men , they do not love the classics , they do not write Tales .

		I may be well enough in my way , but it is not ' the high line . ' ''

		But if not a saint , he was a religious genius of the very highest order , of the race and lineage of
Pascal	LOCATION	.

		A large part of his charm and a very large part of his helpfulness , both personally and in his writings , lie in the fact j that all his life long he did what he once gently rebuked a friend for not doing : '' with a reso - lute heart and with earnestness , '' he '' fought the battle of his soul . ''

		It is for this reason that these words of the Abbe *
Bremond	PERSON	, his most subtle and sympathetic critic , strike us as so profoundly adequate : '' Artist of the first rank , the best part of his art con - sists in making palpable and transparent the realities of
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 313 the invisible world .

		Religious philosopher , all his doc - trine may be reduced to making the expectation , the desire , and the need of God the foundation of all apolo - getic and the very basis of the act of faith .

		Too much like men in general to be canonized , he nevertheless keeps and will keep the glory of being one of those men , rare and predestinate , who impose on everyone that approaches them the thought of God . ''

		Not only does the public library open wide its doors to all that care to enter , but every person not absolutely a pauper can at little expense acquire a library of his own , even if it be of only five-foot-shelf size or smaller .

		Of all the many modern publishing enterprises that have helped to make possible to everyone this ownership of a private library , the series of standard works bearing the imprint of
J. M. Dent & Sons	ORGANIZATION	in
London	LOCATION	, and of
E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, and known as '' Everyman 's Library , '' deserves mention among the foremost , if not as the very foremost .

		Be - gun a few years ago under the able editorship of Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	, and with the design of cov - ering so wide a field that not fewer than a thou - sand volumes would be required to complete the set , this splendid -LRB- but remarkably inexpensive -RRB- library already numbers nearly six hundred volumes , and is rapidly increasing .

		A few passages from the publishers ' preface to their descriptive list will best explain the purpose and scope of the undertaking . ''

		It has not expected him -LSB- the reader -RSB- to be a serious student only , and it has given with a free hand the lighter reading he has asked for .

		But it has tried to make even the novel , whose claim hangs on its story , the pilot to literature at large ; and it has stretched the English stage to touch that of
Athens	LOCATION	, and set JSschylus by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the achievements it counts , which have brought the hitherto unattainable big things to book , may be noted its eight volumes of Hakluyt 's Travels , the
Koran	LOCATION	in
Rodwell	ORGANIZATION	's fine version , its reprint of
Rawlinson	ORGANIZATION	's
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	, its new edition of Sir

		Other works which have required special enterprise are

		Since then signs of the personal interest taken in it by people all the world over have reached the pub - lishers daily ... '' The Fiction section is large in proportion ; but your novel is the best of all inductors to other and graver works .

		Besides , who can vouch that he has learnt as much of
London	LOCATION	from any history-book as from the gay , grave , witty , and poignant pages of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	? ''

		Among those who have given generously of their time and scholarship toward the perfecting of this series , may be noted , in the list of later volumes alone , the names of Professor Saints - bury , who furnishes introductions to Fielding 's ''
Joseph Andrews	PERSON	'' and '' Lives of the Nov - elists '' ; Dr.
Charles W. Eliot	PERSON	, who prefaces
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	's '' Essays on Education and Kindred Subjects '' ; Professor Trent of Co -
lumbia	LOCATION	, who introduces
Byron	PERSON	to the reader ; Professor
Schelling	PERSON	of the
University of Penn	ORGANIZATION	- sylvania , who does the same for
Ben Jonson	PERSON	; Professor
George P. Baker	PERSON	of

Lewis Melville	PERSON	, Sir
W. Eobertson Nicoll	PERSON	, Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	-
Dunton	PERSON	, Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, and many more of equal repute .

		And now , to whet the appetite to a still keener edge for this rich and varied banquet , let us quote at random from the Introduction to the first volume that comes to hand .

		Here is our amiable old
Pepys	PERSON	's incom - parable '' Diary , '' in two compact but legibly printed parts , and prefaced by Dr.
Richard Garnett	PERSON	, with a publishers ' note to show that this is the fourth reprinting of the work in this edition .

		Of those two perennially diverting betrayers of their own weaknesses ,
Pepys	PERSON	and
Boswell	PERSON	, Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	takes occasion to say : '' Their special distinction consists in this , that here , and here only , men whose considerable intellectual en - dowments included a lively perception of the humorous , lose all sense of humour when their own deportment is m question , and continually represent themselves in an absurd light , with an unconsciousness more diverting than the most sparkling wit or the most refined satire .

		The capital humour of the situation lies in the circum - stance that the men who thus give themselves away are by no means fools , and are keen to remark anything absurd in the behaviour of others ... The marvel in
Pepys	PERSON	's case is not lessened by the fact that he certainly did not intend or expect his Diary to be read .

		A man of sense , and
Pepys	PERSON	was a man of great good sense , would never even in that case have knowingly exhibited himself in a series of ludicrous positions .

		He is evidently quite unconscious that there is anything laughable in his behaviour when he accepts a bribe without looking at it , ' that I might say that I did not know what there was in the bag ' ; or when , finding the venison which his 814 THE DIAL -LSB- Aj.ril 16 , patron has sent him to be tainted , he forthwith despatches it to his mother .

		Thousands of men would have done the like , no one but
Pepys	PERSON	would have written it down . ''

		Among the more noteworthy issues of this Library if comparisons are admissible where such uniform high excellence prevails it is natural to point out , in this
Dickens	PERSON	centennial year , the editions of his novels prefaced -LRB- with a single exception -RRB- by that inveterate Dickensian , Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	.

		Let us here snatch at least a fragment from his highly characteristic foreword to ''
Nicholas Nickleby	PERSON	. ''

		His writings may not be gospel to us , but they have a way of arresting the attention . ''

		All romance consists of three characters .

		Other characters may be introduced ; but those other characters are certainly mere scenery as far as the romance is con - cerned .

		They are bushes that wave rather excitedly ; they are posts that stand up with a certain pride ; they are correctly painted rocks that frown very correctly ; but they are all landscape they are all a background .

		In every pure romance there are three living and mov - ing characters .

		For the sake of argument they may be called St.
George	PERSON	and the
Dragon	ORGANIZATION	and the Princess .

		In every romance there must be the twin elements of loving and fighting .

		In every romance there must be the three characters : there must be the Princess , who is a thing to be loved ; there must be the Dragon , who is a thing to be fought ; and there must be St.
George	PERSON	, who is a thing that both loves and fights .

		There have been many symptoms of cynicism and decay in our modern civilization ; there have been many indications of an idle morality cutting up life to please itself , and an idle philosophy doubting first whether truth is accepted and then doubting whether it is truth at all .

		But of all the signs of modern feeble - ness , of lack of grasp on morals as they actually must be , there has been none quite so silly or so dangerous as this : that the philosophers of to-day have started to divide lov - ing from fighting and to put them into opposite camps . ''

		The high character of the Library and of its editorship being thus sufficiently established , it may be interesting to note that of the first five hundred volumes published the number in each different class of literature is as follows -LRB- we quote from the publishers ' statistical statement -RRB- : '' Biography , 35 ; classical , 21 ; essays and belles - lettres , 62 ; fiction , 155 ; history , 56 ; oratory , 5 ; poetry and drama , 39 ; reference books , 4 ; romance , 15 ; science , 10 ; theology and philo - sophy , 28 ; travel and topography , 26 ; young people 's books , 44 . ''

		In the cloth binding the volumes are also bound in flexible leather dif - ferent colors and shades are used to distinguish the different classes of literature .

		For example , fiction glows in a warm crimson ; history clothes itself in scarlet , perhaps thus symbolizing the bloody battle-fields that inevitably stain its pages ; poetry and drama appear in olive green ; the oriental classics in dark blue ; biography in lavender ; and reference books in maroon .

		The binding , print , and paper are all that could be asked for in such a series .

		Where the length of a work is considerable , very thin l > ut opaque paper has been used .

		``
Nicholas Nickleby	PERSON	'' i > thus compivss.-d within tin - limits of a volume less than an inch thick , but having nearly nine hundred clearly-printed pages .

		How so much of worth for so small a price is made , or is hoped to be made , a commercial possibility , will appear from the following further quotation from the publishers ' explanatory foreword : To close this preamble , we can hardly do better than repeat , with no loss of emphasis , what we said
two years ago	DATE	of our ambition , and our difficulties in bringing it liberally to its aim .

		The grand idea of Everyman 's Library , then , is to offer to Everyman , to every Knglish reader in any country , the choice of every great author that exists , who can be brought into the literature in a compact and comely form .

		But this is a vast undertak - ing ; and it can be accomplished only if the public in
England	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	, the Colonies , and elsewhere learn to look upon it at their own affair , and cooperate with the edi - tors and publishers stage by stage .

		If the publishers can depend on their audience in this way , then Everyman 's Library will continue to keep an open house , where -LRB- as
Philemon Holland	PERSON	says , paraphrasing Plutarch -RRB- ` there is a Grace and
Muse	PERSON	met together that is to say de - light conjoined with some knowledge and learning . ' ''

		A word of hearty commendation is due to the expertly compiled '' Dictionary Catalogue of the First 505 Volumes of Everyman 's Library , '' which is issued in uniform style with the series itself .

		Miss
Isabella M. Cooper	PERSON	and Miss
Margaret A. McVety	PERSON	, librarians of experience in cataloguing , are chiefly responsible for this well - annotated and cross-referenced list .

		No marks of classification , Dewey or other , have been set opposite the titles ; but there is space enough to fill them in if it be desired to use this printed catalogue for working purposes in either public or private library .

		The only regret is that it will need revision and enlargement as succeed - ing volumes in the second half of the series are published .

		THE POETRY OF INSECT LIFE .

		* '' Do you know this
Halicti	PERSON	?

		Perhaps not .

		There is no great harm done : it is quite possible to enjoy the few pleasures of life without knowing the Italic ti .

		N theless , when questioned with persistence , those humble creatures with no history can tell us some very singular things ; and their acquaintance is not to be disdained if we desire to enlarge our ideas a little upon the bewilder - ing rabble of this world .

		Since we have nothing better to do , let us look into these Halicti . ''

		Thus does
Fabre	PERSON	introduce us to the burrowing bees , which are as common in this country as THE LIFE AND LOVE or THE INSECT .

J. Henri Fabre	PERSON	.

		Translated by
Alexander Teixeira de Mattos	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL 315 in his own
South of France	LOCATION	.

		Anyone may know the
Halicti	PERSON	, with pleasure and advantage ; yet as a matter of fact there are probably not a dozen people in
America	LOCATION	who have made their acquaint - ance , in the intimate Fabrian sense .

		There is a certain absurdity in reviewing the writings of Fabre at this late date .

		The '' Souvenirs Ento - mologiques '' are classical , and have been quoted in every work on general entomology or psy - chology for many years past .

		Nevertheless , as
Maeterlinck	PERSON	justly wrote , '' the crowd is almost ignorant of the name of
J. H. Fabre	PERSON	, who is one of the most profound and inventive scholars and also one of the purest writers , and , I was going to add , one of the finest poets , of the century that is just past . ''

		Scientific writings may be divided into three groups : technical works in - tended for scientific men , popular compilations for general use , and works which contribute to literature and science at the same time .

		Of the first two there is no lack , but our third division is so poorly represented as to have led to the say - ing that those who can write on scientific subjects have no original ideas , while those who have ideas can not write .

		It is even true that popular works by eminent investigators are usually to be de - scribed as critical compilations , taking no high rank as science or literature .

		Nothing of this sort could be said of
Fabre	PERSON	, who errs , if at all , on the side of excessive originality .

		The Fab - rian doctrine in science is like that of
Auguste Sabatier	PERSON	in religion : away from authority , away from institutionalism , toward the source of light itself , approached naively and with confidence .

		Entomology , with
Fabre	PERSON	, is a matter strictly between the observer and the insect .

		In one of his chapters , after describing how he was misled by placing reliance on what he had read , he gives an account of a visit from
Pasteur	LOCATION	, in illustration of his point . ''

		Pasteur 's tour through the
Avignon	LOCATION	region had seri - culture for its object .

		For some years , the silk-worm nurseries had been in confusion , ravaged by unknown plagues .

		The worms , for no appreciable reason , were falling into a putrid deliquescence , -LSB- or -RSB- hardening , so to speak , into plaster sugar-plums .

		The downcast peasant saw one of his chief crops disappearing ; after much care and trouble , he had to fling his nurseries on the dung - heap . ''

		A few words were exchanged on the prevailing blight ; and then , without further preamble , my visitor said : ' I should like to see some cocoons .

		I have never seen any ; I know them only by name .

		Could you get me some ? ' '' '

		Nothing easier .

		My landlord happens to sell co - coons , and he lives in the next house .

		If you will wait a moment , I will bring you what you want . ' ''

		Four steps took me to my neighbour 's , where I crammed my pockets with cocoons .

		I came back and handed them to the savant .

		He took one , turned and turned it between his fingers ; he examined it curiously , as one would a strange object from the other end of the world .

		He put it to his ear and shook it : `` Why , it makes a noise ! '

		he said , quite surprised . '' '

		There 's something inside ! ' '' '

		Of course there is . ' ''

		< What is it ? ' ''

		The chrysalis . ' '' '

		How do you mean , the chrysalis ? ' '' '

		I mean the sort of mummy into which the cater - piller changes before becoming a moth . ' '' '

		And has every cocoon one of those things inside it ? ' '' '

		Obviously .

		It is to protect the chrysalis that the caterpiller spins . ' ''

		` Really ! ' ''

		And , without more words , the cocoons passed into the pocket of the savant , who was to instruct himself at his leisure touching that great novelty , the chrysalis .

		I was struck by this magnificent assurance .

		Pasteur had come to regenerate the silk-worm , while knowing nothing about caterpillars , cocoons , chrysalises or meta - morphoses .

		The ancient gymnasts came naked to the fight .

		The talented combatant of the plague of our silk - worm nurseries hastened to the battle likewise naked , that is to say , destitute of the slightest notions about the insect which he was to deliver from danger ... This novice , whose artless questions surprised me so greatly , is about to revolutionize the hygiene of the silk - worm nurseries .

		In the same way , he will revolutionize medicine and general hygiene . ''

		This amusing description requires a little explanation .

		Little as Pasteur may have known of entomology , he did know about bacteria , and was a learned chemist .

		Of
Fabre	PERSON	himself it is equally true that he approached his problems with a mind well stored with knowledge and trained in judgment .

		These advantages , com - bined with a high degree of native ability , produced the results we so much admire .

		Nev - ertheless , it was equally true of Pasteur and
Fabre	PERSON	, that they sought direct contact with na - ture , and it was certainly due to their freedom from the shackles of tradition that they made many of their important discoveries .

		One re - members how Pasteur was solemnly assured by the best authorities that it was useless to attack the question of spontaneous generation , and how even
Darwin	PERSON	used to surprise his friends by start - ing all sorts of apparently crazy experiments .

		The impression one has , on reading
Fabre	PERSON	's charming essays , is that since the materials are everywhere abundant , one has only to go out - of-doors and watch , to see things as he saw them .

		This is not precisely the truth , and yet it is possible to learn .

		Beginning with insects of the same kinds as those studied by
Fabre	PERSON	, one may first substantially repeat his observa - tions , and when more experienced , go on to others never yet observed .

		There is indeed an excellent field for original work in every part THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, of this country , and perhaps when the oppor - tunities are better understood there will be more workers .

		There are , however , difficulties other than intellectual .

		The work consumes a great deal of time , and is often physically ex - hausting .

		Dr. and Mrs.
Peckham	PERSON	of
Milwaukee	LOCATION	, who better than any others represent
Fabre	PERSON	in
America	LOCATION	, thus write of their experiences when watching wasps : '' For a whole week of scorching
summer	DATE	weather we lived in the bean patch , scorning fatigue .

		We quoted to each other the example of
Fabre	PERSON	's daughter
Claire	PERSON	, whose determination to solve the problem of Odynenu led to a sun-stroke .

		We followed scores of wasps as they hunted ; we ran , we threw ourselves upon the ground , we scrambled along on our hands and knees in our desperate endeavors to keep them in view , and yet they escaped us .

		After we had kept one in sight for an hour or more some sudden flight would carry her far away and all our labor was lost . ''

		This is quoted from `` The Instincts and Habits of the Solitary Wasps , '' a book which will de - light all those who care for the works of Fabre .

		No doubt it is for the younger generation , some of whom may have more leisure for intel - lectual pursuits than their parents , that the mes - sage of
Fabre	PERSON	is chiefly of value .

		We would suggest to those who have children of high school age , that a copy of the work now reviewed might in many cases be an acceptable present .

		The work is of course only a translation of a selection from the `` Souvenirs . ''

		The translation is a good one in some respects , pleasant to read and retaining much of the lively style of the French ; but it greatly needs revising in detail .

		It is to be hoped that before long a new edition will be called for , and that it will be thoroughly gone over by an expert before publication .

		PROBLEMS OF HUMANITY AND PROPERTY .

		* That the labor problem is a serious one in the
United States	LOCATION	, as well as in
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, is a fact which students of public affairs must admit .

		That it can not be understood with - out a knowledge of certain underlying forces is another fact equally patent , and one which is a sufficient justification of the ever-increasing amount of literature dealing with the subject .

		The student of history can not help recalling the mass of literature which deluged
France	LOCATION	before the Revolution , and wondering if the present flood will help us to a saner solution than was the immediate result in that country .

		By
Frank Tracy Carlton	PERSON	, Ph.D. .


Boston	LOCATION	:

		it .

		an be said that much of the present litera - ture is sane .

		To this class belongs Professor
Carlton	PERSON	's book , '' The History and Problems of Organ ized Labor . ''

		But while the book is sane , it is not exactly what one would expect from the title .

		The history of the conditions which drove labor almost to desperation , and of the fierce struggles through which it has passed , has been reduced to the minimum ; the purpose of the author being to state the present problems of labor with the barest necessities of historical background .

		The problems are various , beginning with the forms of government and the determination of policies of the labor unions .

		The various coercive meas - ures used by laborers and employers to attain their ends , the methods of remuneration , includ - ing the different kinds of wages , profit-sharing and cooperation , the means of settling disputes , and protective legislation , are all described at length .

		A chapter is devoted to immigration , be - cause of its influence on the labor situation .

		The '' sweated '' industries receive due attention ; as do also the problems of child , woman , and prison labor , unemployment , and industrial education .

		A striking characteristic of the book is its balance .

		It is neither a tirade against capital nor a special plea for labor .

		Apparently the author has attempted to state the facts from a disinterested point of view .

		The facts are so overwhelming , that he , with every open-minded man , inevitably leans to one side the side on which are found life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .

		But it is not the liberty of a century ago , the laissezfaire kind .

		We have changed all that , yes , since fifty , even twenty years ago .

		Sixty years ago ,
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	declared that every attempt to alleviate the suffering of the poor through state intervention only resulted in its exacerbation .

		Speaking of education , he said : '' Taking away a man 's property to educate his own or other people 's children is not needful for the maintenance of his rights , and hence is wrong . ''

		He further declared that no rights of children were violated by a failure to educate them .

		Even if their rights were violated by this neglect , the presumption is that
Spencer	PERSON	would say that it was violating another and greater right to tax a man for their education .

		He even said that it was a '' violation of the moral law '' for the State '' to interpose between quacks and those who patronize them , '' and that it was an inalienable right of the individual to `` buy in-li - cine and advice from whomsoever he pleases . ''

		Such was the despairing effort of a ninrtccntli - century philosopher of the laissez faire school
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 317 to bolster up the claims of the privileged classes under the guise of liberty and rights .

		If anyone should object that such was not his object , it is enough to say that social conditions in
England	LOCATION	were such at that time that any careful observer ought to have been able to see that the carrying out of such teaching would have that result .

		The twentieth-century man is no less jealous of liberty and rights ; but it is a far cry from
Spencer	PERSON	to the present-day conception of what constitutes liberty and rights .

		In
Spencer	PERSON	's day , the world had pretty generally accepted the principle of the freedom of thought , and was beginning to ask , What is that freedom worth if a man is left so ignorant that he can not think ?

		Then it was decided that children had a right to demand of the
State	ORGANIZATION	an opportunity to make this freedom real , that is , an opportunity for an education at public expense ; to-day we have gone beyond that and decided that the
State	ORGANIZATION	has the right to demand that the child shall be educated at its expense for the welfare of the social whole .

		Thus slowly and painfully do we change our conceptions of the content of real liberty .

		The laissez faire philosophy took a strong hold on the imaginations of men , and it is hard for us to get rid of the notion that liberty and equality depend on a `` hands-off '' policy on the part of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		This policy worked at least moder - ately well in this country in the
earlier part of the nineteenth century	DATE	, when land was plentiful and a laborer really had an opportunity to work for himself when he became dissatisfied with his employer .

		But to-day the liberty to quit his job if he does not like the conditions or his wages means little less than the liberty to starve .

		So - ciety , says Professor
Carlton	PERSON	, '' is slowly coming to the realization of the fact that equality of treatment of unequals often results in gross in - justice . ''

		If society is slowly coming to this decision , the courts are coming to it somewhat more slowly .

		Only sixteen years ago
the Supreme Court of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	declared void an eight-hour law for women , on the ground that it was the policy of the
State	ORGANIZATION	to advance the cause of women , where - as this law would relegate her '' back to depen - dence . ''

		Most courts declined to follow
Illinois	LOCATION	in this treatment of women and children , hold - ing that children were the wards of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, and that some favorable legislation was neces - sary in the case of women to put them , in the words of
Justice Holmes	ORGANIZATION	, '' on terms of equality with the more powerful party . ''

		Yet as late as
1907	DATE	the
New York Court of Appeals	ORGANIZATION	declared void a law prohibiting night-work by women wage-earners , on the ground that it was an un - warranted interference with the freedom of con - tract .

		But be it said to the honor of
Illinois	LOCATION	, that in
1910	DATE	her courts sustained a ten-hour law for women .

		But if woman and child workers have made gains , male workers still have much for which to fight .

		There is as yet no recognition of the fact that inequalities exist as between man and man , as well as between men and women ; and that a weak man may need some protective legis - lation '' to put him on terms of equality with the more powerful party . ''

		Neither do the courts , says Professor
Carlton	PERSON	, `` assume the same atti - tude toward an attempt of organized labor to obtain an eight-hour day that they do toward an attempt on the part of aggregate capital a cor - poration to acquire property .

		The right to daily leisure is not legally safeguarded as securely as the right to acquire and hold property . ''

		To - day the
Pittsburg	LOCATION	landlord spends his leisure which is all his time in
Europe	LOCATION	, and collects his rents through an agent from workers in the mills who are given enough leisure out of twelve hours of toil seven days in the week to pay this tribute .

		Some day , perhaps , we shall set hu - manity above property .

		318 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, entire period he suffered the tortures of the damned from his head and his eyes and his stomach .

		Yet hU works , so far as they have been published in -LRB- Jer - many , consist of seventeen volumes aggregating over 8500 pages of solid if repetitive material .

		And there is more to come .

		Small wonder , then , that
George Brandes	PERSON	, in one of the very first trustworthy essays on Nietzsche -LRB- 1888 -RRB- , should have said in his just and divinatory way : `` Of modern German writers ,
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	is to me the most interesting .

		He deserves to be studied , interpreted , refuted , and assimilated . ''

		Nietzsche was a philologist -LRB- 1869-76 -RRB- , a philoso - pher -LRB- 1876-83 -RRB- , aprophet -LRB- 1883-89 -RRB- , apsycholojjist at times , and always a poet .

		He abounded in afflic - tion , aspiration , courtesy , family pride , fortitude , individualism , intelligence , lyricism , melancholy , paradoxes , and receptivity .

		He lacked balance , com - mon sense , humor , modesty , originality , patriotism , and sympathy .

		He liked aphorisms , chloral , Dionysos ,
Greece	LOCATION	, big-sounding words , music , solitude , strength , the Old Testament , and war .

		He disliked alchohol , anarchism , anti-Semitism , Apollo , constraint ,
Chris	PERSON	- tianity , the crowd , history ,
Prussia	LOCATION	, romanticism , socialism , specialists , the New Testament , tobacco , and women .

		That is to say , it seems as though he did .

		But to take only one case ,
Nietzsche	PERSON	possessed such a huge amount of common sense that we are apt to be prejudiced as to the quality in the face of such an overwhelming quantity .

		More so than in the case of Prince
Paul Troubet	PERSON	- zkoy ,
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's works constitute his life .

		He thought much , he read little , he acted less .

		Nor do the few conspicuous features of his life add mate - rially to an explanation of his works .

		He came of a long line of long-lived Protestant preachers .

		He never spoke a word until he was two and a half years old , and his first spoken word was `` grandma . ''

		He blushed , as a child , when he broke anything and then spent his adult years trying to break things .

		He heard , as a mere boy ,
Handel	ORGANIZATION	's '' Messiah , '' and went straight home and began to compose another Messiah . ''

		If he found a girl apparently as clever as a boy , he attributed the equality to some supernat - ural power and this before reading
Schopenhauer	PERSON	.

		He wrote out a complete invoice of his life every time he took a decisive step .

		He matriculated at
the University of Leipzig	ORGANIZATION	,
October 18 , 1865	DATE	, just one century after
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's matriculation at the same institution , and laughed in his sleeve when Rector Kahnis advised the fellows not to follow
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's example as a student .

		He sat through many lectures , took almost no notes , and became a very wise man .

		Leipzig gave him a doctor 's degree , when he was twenty-four years old , without dissertation or exami - nation .

		Since he spent the major part of his life writ - ing dissertations , one can pardon this feature of his unique degree , but he should have been obliged to pass the examinations , for he just barely passed those at
Pforta	LOCATION	.

		He was a Professor of Philology who advised his students not to become philologists .

		He himself did some glaringly inaccurate etymologizing .

		He is the author of more puns than any man who ever wrote the German language .

		Sensitive himself as an anemone , he felt it his mission to despise the weak , crush the mediocre , and refute the strong .

		All of which is more interesting than explanatory .

		Although
Nietzsche	PERSON	had but one contemporary disciple ,
Heinrich Koselitz	PERSON	, he has been followed up by legions of posthumous ones .

		Mr.
M. A. Mllgge	PERSON	makes the statement in his life of Nietzsche -LRB-

		But we are concerned here with Nietzschean students .

		What has been their attitude toward their hero ?

		Those who have studied him but little , or not at all , condemn his works on the ground that he was revolutionary , and cynical , and contradictory , and insane .

		Those who have studied him most , and who knew him longest and best , deny the charge of insanity previous to
January 4 , 1889	DATE	, and look upon the other unenvi - able characteristics as being as irrelevant to a discus - sion of his works as would Da
Vinci	PERSON	's hobnobbing with
Caesar Borgia	PERSON	be to an appreciation of his '' La Gioconda . ''


Lessing	PERSON	said once , that in order to understand any single sentence of
Aristotle	LOCATION	, it was necessary to read all of Aristotle .

		It is just so with
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		And to the student who has read all of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	, the case presents itself about as follows : We have to do here with a man of imaginative intel - lectuality , who believed in the will to power , the eternal return of the same , the relativity of all things , and that the existence of the world is justified only as an aesthetic phenomenon .

		Equip a man with such faith , and then let him always be thinking , and poeti / .

		- ing , and writing while awake , and so arrange his health that he has to take chloral in order to sleep , and we get those seventeen volumes that provoked the seven studies with which we have to deal in this review .

		Mr.
Orage	PERSON	's booklet on
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	is just half as long as the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In the very first sentence , he refers to his hero as `` the greatest European event since Goethe , '' thus ruling out of court
Victor Hugo	PERSON	, whom Nietzsche dubbed '' the light-house on the sea of nonsense . ''

		A little later ,
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	is referred to as `` the brightest intel - lectual light that
Europe	LOCATION	knew . ''

		So this is no unin - spired study .

		And yet , what Mr.
Orage	PERSON	has actually done is this : After giving the few facts of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's life in the first chapter , he has analyzed his first work , `` The Birth of Tragedy , '' in which
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	set up the famous doctrine of Apollo against Dionysos .

		Nietzsche always claimed that he was the first to formulate this principle .

		Yet
Friedrich Schlegel	PERSON	did it before him , in so many words , and
Schiller	PERSON	did
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 319 it before him , in other words , in
Die Wiirde der Frauen	ORGANIZATION	, which poem might have been entitled
Die Unwilrde der Manner	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the doctrine : Just as procreation is dependent on the duality of the sexes , so is the continuous development of art bound up with the duplexity of the Apollonian and the Dionysian .

		Apollo is the good and manly god of shape , restraint , boundaries of justice , light , sweet reasonableness , individualization , beauty , the harp , the epic , the god of Homer , of sooth-saying , and of dreams .

		Dionysos is the bad god of formlessness , lack of restraint , loss of the individual , the dithyram - bic god of romanticism , of the tragedy , of Archilochus , of drunkenness , and of music .

		Mr.
Orage	PERSON	has , to be sure , a chapter on '' Beyond Good and Evil , '' and one on `` The Superman , '' but they do not get far beyond
Nietzsche	LOCATION	's first work .

		The most interesting page in the whole treatise is the one containing the list of dead and living Dionysian writers , of the former , twenty-four , of the latter , eight , as follows :
Brandes	PERSON	,
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	,
W. H. Hudson	PERSON	,
R. B. Cunninghame Graham	PERSON	,
Gorki	LOCATION	,
H. G. Wells	PERSON	,
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	, and
W. B. Yeats	PERSON	.

		Of the former list ,
Blake	PERSON	is pos - sibly the most interesting , since Mr.
Orage	PERSON	says elsewhere that `` he who has read the
Marriage of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	and Hell , and grasped its significance , will have little to learn from the apostle of Zarathustra '' Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	began his study of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	`` with a feeling of repulsion for the man , '' and laid it down with `` pity for his tragic failures and admira - tion for his reckless devotion to ideas '' another case of tout comprendre , c'est tout pardonner , si non tout admirer .

		He attempts to define
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's attitude toward sympathy and egotism .

		The book is very small , the point of view very comprehensive .

		Beginning with the pure egotism of the seventeenth century moralists , as preached by Hobbes and
La Rochefoucauld	ORGANIZATION	, we pass on to the faintly sympathetic naturalism of
Locke	PERSON	and
Mandeville	LOCATION	, then to
Hume	PERSON	who made a more or less altruistic naturalism cur - rent , and
Adam Smith	PERSON	who gave it sentiment , next we hear of
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	and
Henry Brooke	PERSON	who added the touch of sentimentality , which touch pre - pares us for
Rousseau	PERSON	who taught that self-interest is sure to work injustice , and
Schleiermacher	PERSON	, who preached the universal sympathy of German Roman - ticism all of which takes us two centuries away from
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, who admired La Rochefoucauld and anathematized `` sympathy with the lowly and the suffering as a standard for the elevation of the soul . ''

		After this long but legitimate digression , Mr.
More	PERSON	returns to Nietzsche the arch-egotist , the prophet who made some highly provocative remarks concern - ing his self-interested efforts to reach a superhuman goal .

		The work stimulates .

		Yet this book , like all of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's own books , shows that he is a very wise man who can fly in the face of the relativity of all things and determine , with stop-watch accuracy , just where egotism ends and altruism begins , or the other way around .

		Miss
Emily Hamblen	PERSON	made her study of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	for
America	LOCATION	.

		She believes , namely , that our ten - dencies are directly away from our enunciated ideals , and that
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's penetrating thought will there - fore help us to discover our actual minds hence the New Gospel .

		But with the best of intentions it can not be said that hers is a new exegesis of
Nietz	PERSON	- sche 's old message unless it be the one chapter on style , where she points out that
Nietzsche	PERSON	gave new meanings to such terms as `` will , '' `` free spirit , '' `` sympathy , '' `` logic , '' `` reason , '' `` knowledge , '' and `` necessity . ''


Webster	PERSON	and his whole fraternity walk on a bottomless quag in this chapter , hut life re - mains the same .

		To explain , for example , `` neces - sity '' biologically will neither lower the cost of provisions nor clarify our aspirations .

		The fact of the whole business is this :
Nietzsche	PERSON	was an untir - ing attacker .

		In the seventh aphorism of '' Why I am so wise , '' he tells us that he attacked only the triumphant , and that he did this alone , imperson - ally , and unreminiscentially .

		It is healthy to have a select number of this sort of men around .

		They nerve ; but they do not found a new gospel .

		Evan - gels , like constitutions , need occasional amendments , but complete supplantation never !

		Of the seven studies considered in the present review , Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	's ''
Nietzsche	PERSON	and Art '' is the most remarkable , partly because the writer ap - proaches
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	from the aesthetic side .

		Despite the fact that
Nietzsche	PERSON	was essentially a man of letters , and not a student of science -LRB- which he loathed as something that only produces ugliness -RRB- , the book on `` Nietzsche the Litterateur , '' though it is being cared for , has not yet been written .

		Nietzsche bore about the same relation to German letters that
Emerson	PERSON	-LRB- whom he read and adored and imitated -RRB- hore to American letters .

		This , in substance , is Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	's thesis : The highest Art , or Ruler - Art , in which culture is opposed to chaos can be the product only of an aristocratic society .

		Nietzsche preached the highest type , the Superman .

		But with mob at the top and mob at the bottom , the multitude feel it their privilege , if not their duty , to smear and smatter in art , so we get mob and medley in art .

		If we had , however , such a faith in a worthy Ruler - Type as existed in the
Egypt	LOCATION	that produced the diorite statue of
King Khephren	PERSON	, the huilder of the second pyramid of
Gizeh	LOCATION	, then art would be blessed with the symmetry that denotes balance , the sobriety that reveals restraint , the simplicity that proves the power of the mind , the transfiguration that betrays elation , the repetition that connotes obedience , and the variety that characterizes all hortatory art .

		The spirits of
Winckelmann	PERSON	and
Lessing	PERSON	and Goethe at their best are here conjured up .

		There are 236 pages in the book , but he who does not read it straight through at once has either weak eyes or slight appreciation of edle Einfalt und stille
Grosse	ORGANIZATION	.

		And he who reads it but once is artistically impious .

		It requires haloed patience to read Mr.
J. M. Ken	PERSON	- nedy 's book on `` The Quintessence of Nietzsche . ''

		The English language has no subjunctive of indirect discourse .

		In this book , master and disciple speak on the same page .

		They speak in turns .

		And with 320 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, no change of type , and with only an almost imper - ceptible indentation of the line - , how is one to tell who is speaking ?

		Also , one quotation will prove that tin - book is not only explanatory , but decidedly apolo - getic and justificatory .

		Nietzsche delivered in 18 7 L * a series of lectures on `` The Future of our Educational Institutions . ''

		Of these Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	says : '' If the lectures are applicable to both
Germany	LOCATION	and En - gland , they are even more applicable to the
United State	ORGANIZATION	* of
America	LOCATION	, probably the most Philistine country in the world .

		This heterogeneous agglomeration of eighty million
Philis	PERSON	- tines stand * badly in need of a Nietzsche at the present moment , and as the country is not likely to produce one its schools and colleges turn out mere standardised money - making machines we can only hope that these lectures will be thoroughly studied there by the few who have not been drawn into the commercial vortex . ''

		Though grieved at our deplorable condition , we smile , and hope , and worry on !

		And this is not the only passage where Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	falls into similar tone .

		In the conclusion , we hear of `` the malign influence of Christianity , '' of the '' superiority of the Italian beggar-boy with the instinctive good taste in art to the American millionaire whose thoughts can not raise themselves above the fluctuations of the
Stock Exchange	ORGANIZATION	, '' and so on .

		It sounds like
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	himself .

		It makes us stop and think .

		But now that the quintessence of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	has been given , we suddenly recall that
Nietzsche	PERSON	did not have to stop to think , so that many of his thoughts are flighty and errant .

		And when
Nietzsche	PERSON	did stop , he consumed his time writing down his thoughts instead of asso - ciating with his fellow-men ; as a result of which he said many commonplace things , not knowing that many others had also said them .

		Translations are contestable evidence of merit , done , as they sometimes are , more out of curiosity than admiration .

		Sudermann 's worst work found a translator almost without delay ;
Fontane	ORGANIZATION	's best re - mains untranslated .

		Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	has met a demand by his excellent rendering of ''
Ecce Homo	PERSON	, '' thus completing the seventeenth volume of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	in English .

		He and
Helen Zimmern	PERSON	are among the best translators in the series .

		One can only admire the great faith with which he approached his task .

		!

		> .

		Homo '' was begun by its author
October 15 , 1888	DATE	, and finished
November 4	DATE	of the same year , though it was not published in
Germany	LOCATION	until
1908	DATE	.

		There are those who consider that during this period
Nietzsche	PERSON	was an insane man .

		But Mr.
Ludovici	PERSON	not only denies this , but he contends that his hero was then enjoying what the physicians call euphoria the state of highest well-being .

		He ad - mires the whole work of `` Ecce
Homo	PERSON	. ''

		Even such headings as , `` Why I am so clever , '' he defends by
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's remark :
Nur Lumpe	PERSON	find bescheiden .

		Whenever there is call for this sort of work , that is just the spirit in which it should be done .

		Yet it would have been a great boon to the German lan - guage had Nietzsche never been translated . ''

		Ecce Homo '' will be welcomed in English , however , especially for
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's account of `` inspiration . '

		But when we come to a discussion of
M. Hale	PERSON	` vy 's
Life of Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	, we cheerfully overlook the many typographical errors in the quotations from the German , and the author 's peculiar habit of referring to the exact day of the month without giving the year , and jubilantly proclaim the charm of the book as a whole .

		It gives a grand picture of the spiritual struggles of this last , lofty , German idealist .

		Mr.
Kettle	PERSON	's introduction is also delightfully written .

		His reference to
Nietzsche	PERSON	as '' a man of ecstasies , rather than of sequent thought '' is happy .

		Then there is an added charm by reason of the fact that
Richard Wagner	PERSON	comes in for much discussion .

		Wagner is as conspicuous in these pages by his presence , as
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	is by his absence in
Wagner	PERSON	's Autobiog - raphy .

		The apparently unconscious purpose of Mr.
Hale	PERSON	` vy has been to show that it was
Wagner	PERSON	who deprived Nietzsche of those three things after which he so ardently strove friendship , love , and fame .

		And though
Frau Cosima	PERSON	has never seen fit to allow the publication of the letters
Nietzsche	PERSON	wrote to
Wagner	PERSON	,
Wagner	PERSON	's part of the correspondence has been published and is here wisely utilized .

		It is extremely doubtful if there has ever been such a peculiar friendship as existed between these two peculiar geniuses .

		Nietzsche is to be pitied .

		He thought -LRB- we are perplexed to know why -RRB- from the days of `` Parsifal '' and
Bayreuth	LOCATION	on that he hated
Wagner	PERSON	.

		But
M. Hale	PERSON	` vy makes it clear that the hatred , though not fictitious , was not unalloyed .

		Nietzsche loved , and therefore hated , the man who deprived him of friendship , love , and fame .

		One of the last coherent sentences he uttered in th < > - e last dark moments was , ``
Wagner	PERSON	, den hab ' ich sehr geliebt ! ''

		And here we must unreservedly laud the fine taste with which the whole book is written , especially the part that deals with the mindless hero .

		German biographers have something to learn in this respect .

		M.
Hale	PERSON	` vy passes over
Nietzsche	LOCATION	's last years with charity : he tells a few fascinating little stories , and then closes with the sentence , ``
Friedrich Nietzsche	PERSON	died at
Weimar	LOCATION	, on the ~ ~ > th of
August , 1900	DATE	. ''

		So
Nietzsche	PERSON	has been much discussed .

		He has passed through the whole gamut of comment , from ecstatic laudation to complete repudiation .

		No won - der !

		He wrote the very best of German prose though not always , as is currently believed , in short sentences .

		But he was a master of punctuation , of motionless gestures .

		His form was invariably good , his content infinitely varied .

		He had an opinion on every subject .

		Nothing to him was sacred ; everything was relative , liable to change , and eter - nally recurring .

		His case might be visualized as follows : He said more on the general topic of religion , in the broad sense , than on any other one theme .

		Now , let an intelligent college student go to his country home at
Christmas	LOCATION	.

		They have a Christmas service in the church of his childhood .

		They ask him to make an address .

		He accepts .

		He speaks on the beauty of celebrating
Christ	ORGANIZATION	's hiitli .

		even as a mere tradition .

		In the course of his re - marks he says that the one thing we know about
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 321 Christ 's birth is that it did not take place on the 25th of
December	DATE	, so and so many years ago .

		His audience at once divides itself into four camps .

		There will be some who knew that fact long before this student was born .

		And a whole host of the ap - parently novel things that
Nietzsche	PERSON	said were self - evident truths two thousand years ago .

		Others will be asleep , and will not hear .

		These Nietzsche would have liked to crush .

		But they deserve the sympathy that he condemned , they are tired , they have worked hard growing the wheat that
Nietz	PERSON	- scheans eat .

		Others will say , '' Ah , the city and the college have robbed him of his faith . ''

		But these deserve the patience that
Nietzsche	PERSON	did not have .

		And another small party will say , `` That is not very important , but I did not know it before , and I am grateful for the information . ''

		Zarathustra spoke `` for all and for none . ''

		It was
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's business to set thoughts in motion .

		And peace to the ashes and honor to the name of any man who can do just this thing !

		RECENT FICTION .

		* The title of Mr.
John Oxenham	PERSON	's `` The High Adventure '' is to be taken literally , for the tale is , in very truth , one of adventure in the '' high '' Alps .

		It tells of a young English diplomat who , on his vaca - tion in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, meets a damsel in distress , and becomes her protector .

		She is a Russian damsel , and she has a sister in a Swiss prison , incarcerated for her successful assassination of a high Russian official who had made her the object of his unwelcome atten - tions .

		Plans have been made for her escape , and to aid her in this attempt , the fair
Sonia	PERSON	enlists
Charles Verney	PERSON	, her accidental acquaintance .

		The attempt succeeds , whereupon the man and the two girls be - come fugitives from justice , and endeavor to reach the frontier undiscovered .

		In their wanderings , an avalanche overwhelms them , killing the sister -LRB- which is perhaps quite as well -RRB- , and burying the other two in the mountain hut which is conveniently at hand when the snow slides down the mountain side .

		A pretty romance develops , and by the time the two are rescued , is ripe for the inevitable conclusion .

		This is not one of Mr.
Oxenham	PERSON	's best stories , and * THE HIGH ADVENTURE .

		THE MYSTERY OF NUMBER 47 .

		By
J. Storer Clouston	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		has many of the marks of the pot-boiler , but it is readable .

		A source of constant irritation is found in the fact that , whenever German words are intro - duced and this is quite frequently they are almost invariably misspelled .

		Once in a great while , the reviewer has the good fortune to come upon a novel which is not merely well-constructed and interesting , but whose every page exemplifies the artistic conscience of the writer .

		Such a novel is the '' Christopher '' of Mr.
Richard Pryce	PERSON	.

		It is not a novel of heroics or of impossible idealities , and it is concerned only with ordinary people , but its characters are all authentic human beings , and their delineation gives evidence of the most painstaking and loving thought .

		The story of Christopher begins with his infancy .

		His widowed mother , returning from
India	LOCATION	, gives birth to him at sea , and his early years are spent in an English country home .

		Presently , the family circumstances become straitened , and the necessity for economy causes the family grandmother , mother , child , and devoted maid to take up their residence at
Boulogne	LOCATION	, and there
Christopher	PERSON	lives through his boyhood years .

		He is distinctly a child who sees things , and early gives evidence of the possession of a sensitive artistic nature .

		One day he is in danger , and is rescued by an Englishman who henceforth becomes his hero and the pattern of all that seems admirable to his childish consciousness .

		Now this Englishman is a former sweetheart of
Christopher	PERSON	's mother , and is just then in the train of a lady whose indiscretions -LRB- to put it mildly -RRB- have made her an outcast from English society , and the colony at Boulogne does not recognize her .

		All this is im - portant , because afterwards , when
Christopher	PERSON	's family returns to
England	LOCATION	, the man , freed from his entanglement which had been the outcome of chivalry rather than of passion , succeeds in winning the love which had earlier been denied him , and becomes
Christopher	PERSON	's step-father .

		Also , the lady with the shady past has a daughter who , after a chance encounter in
England	LOCATION	some years later , be - comes the object of Christopher 's worship .

		The chapters that follow exhibit the psychology of a young man in love with marvellous penetration and sympathy , but the girl is not for him , as becomes evident when the inherited taint in her character is revealed .

		We take leave of Christopher as he is mastering the agony of disappointment , and seeking solace in his work .

		This is the whole story , a story for the most part of commonplace people , told in a way that is suggestive of
Thackeray	PERSON	, with tender sentiment and rich appreciation of the values of ordinary human existence .

		It is a very beautiful and pathetic story , of the kind not to be hastily read without serious loss .

		A familar type of the Anglo-Indian novel is repro - duced in Mr.
E. M. Dell	PERSON	's `` The Way of an Eagle . ''

		First , there is the handful of British soldiers , sur - rounded by hostile natives in an isolated mountain post , too far from the main body to hope for succor , and maintaining a forlorn hope to the desperate 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
April 16	DATE	, end .

		Then there is the daughter of the commanding officer , who must somehow be saved from a drea < iful fate .

		Then there is the daring soldier who loves IUT , and who charges himself with the responsibility of either rescuing her or of seeing that she is not taken alive .

		Being a resourceful man ,
Nick Ratcliffe	PERSON	carries her through the lines of the besiegers and brings her to safety in the advancing relief column .

		Gratitude would seem to dictate that
Nick	PERSON	should have his reward , but
Muriel Roscoe	PERSON	does not know her own mind , and a little malicious gossip , coupled with the feeling of horror with which she has witnessed the scene in which
Nick	PERSON	had choked to death a native who was seeking her life , cause her to break off their engagement , and make it possible to prolong the story to the required length .

		Returning to
England	LOCATION	, she drifts into an engagement with the very Englishman whose nerve had failed him in the horrible crisis of her life in
India	LOCATION	, and who is now philandering with the wife of one of his friends in the Indian service .

		Nick puts the matter to both the man and the woman somewhat bluntly and breaks up this arrangement , whereupon
Muriel	PERSON	gradually comes to the conclusion that she loves her rescuer after all .

		The fact that
Nick	PERSON	's manner somehow suggests that of an eagle watching his prey and finally swooping down upon it is the explanation of the title given by Mr.
Dell	PERSON	to his story .

		But we are not convinced that the heroine was worthy of the hero , despite all the au - thor 's efforts to persuade us . ''


Bob Hardwick	PERSON	: The Story of his Life and Ex - periences , '' by Mr.
Henry Howard Harper	PERSON	, is a book that comes to us in sumptuous guise , privately printed , and issued under the auspices of the Bibliophile Soci - ety .

		It is the story , told in the first person , of a boy 's life from the age of five to the years of early manhood .

		The boy 's father is a district school teacher , a wid - ower , who treats his child with unnatural harshness , although we occasionally get glimpses of a streak of sentiment somewhere in his composition .

		Early in the narrative , he breaks up his humble home , packs the meagre household equipment in a covered wagon , and starts upon a long odyssey , broken now and then by a school term , through the states lying west of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	.

		The boy gets a certain amount of schooling , by which he evidently profits , but most of his experiences relate to the periods during which he is hired out to various forms of service .

		About midway in the story , the father disappears from view , leaving his son in the clutches of an incredibly mean old farmer , who makes him do the work of two men for his board and clothes .

		Then comes a change in his fortunes , for it is discovered that he is the heir , through his mother , to a fair fortune .

		He then gives himself a real education , studies law , seeks out the girl whom he has held in secret adoration from the days when he was an unconsidered waif , and per - suades her to share his life .

		This is the outline of what we should take to be a literal transcript from the writer 's memory of his own childhood experi - ences , were it not for the fact that the later chapters show some signs of contrivance .

		Still , boys do some - times inherit unsuspected fortunes , and do sometimes win the objects of their childish devotion , and there is no reason why we should not take the whole story to be a true one , as the larger part of it unquestionably i - .

		Its poignancy , its minute realism , and ita art - lessness , are things that we can not ascribe wholly to imagination , and we have little doubt that the writer is , for the most part , copying from the book of his own life .

		This gives the book a documentary value which it could not well have if it were the product of artifice , and we get from it a vivid idea of the hard and prosaic conditions of frontier life a generation ago , as transmitted through the medium of a sensi - tive mind .

		Almost any commonplace person who has grown up under such conditions could tell as good a story as this , but it is only now and then that one is found who thinks the effort worth making .

		We have read the book from cover to cover with an inter - est aroused and sustained by its evident fidelity to fact , and it was only in those passages which led us to suspect an element of invention that our interest flagged .

		Mr.
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	has heretofore been known as a novelist of plot and incident , and , as such , has won many friends , and achieved a high position among our entertainers .

		But in '' A Hoo - sier Chronicle '' he has done something much bigger , and given us a work of fiction of a richly human sort , creating real characters rather than puppets , and giving us a penetrating study of political life and domestic relations in the commonwealth of
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		The period is that of the now dying generation , and we catch the ideals of the newer time in the very act of replacing the old ones .

		The story is aptly named , for it is a '' chronicle '' in the sense that it pursues a leisurely course , building up its interest by recording occurrences in their natural order , and revealing the Zeitgeist by many subtle suggestions .

		There is a plot , of course , but it is subordinated to the demands of the composition considered as a pic - ture , and is not accentuated by strikingly dramatic situations or climaxes .

		Even when the central mys - tery , that of the heroine 's parentage , is cleared up , the disclosure is made quietly , and an opportunity which would be to most novelists the occasion for a startling denouement , with recrimination and self - reproach and tearful reparation , is handled with severe restraint .

		There is no surprise in the dis - closure , for we have been prepared for it all along , and it comes as the sequence of no dramatic trick , nor is it accompanied by any elaborate stage-setting .

		The appetite accustomed to literary condiments will find it all rather tasteless , but to the unspoiled pal - ate it will give wholesome satisfaction .

		The figure of
Morton Bassett	PERSON	, about which the interest of the novel is centered , is a full-length portrait of the poli - tician who wins success by the means at hand , and is no more scrupulous in his methods than the pre - vailing standard of political morality seems to re - quire .

		But that standard is insensibly changing , and when the change is finally borne in upon his consciousness , he withdraws from the game .

		He is
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL by no means a bad man , but he realizes that his suc - cess has been due to practices that public opinion no longer regards with approval , and he heeds the lesson .

		This revulsion of feeling is largely brought about by the influence of his daughter
Sylvia	PERSON	, who , by a series of seemingly trifling and unrelated reve - lations , learns of her parentage , and makes use of the knowledge , not to exact any personal reparation , but to persuade
Bassett	PERSON	to make the atonement to society which his aroused conscience dictates .

		Something like a dozen important characters are involved in the action of the story , and every one of them is naturally and convincingly drawn .

		In such sober and conscientious workmanship we may find a real hope for the future of American literature .

		A remarkable study of the artistic temperament is given us in the '' Tante '' of
Anne Douglas Sedg	PERSON	- wick -LRB- Mrs. Basil de Selincourt -RRB- .

		Madame Okraska , in whom several racial strains are blended , is a pianist of world-wide fame , who is called Tante -LRB- in German pronunciation -RRB- by her intimates .

		She is a woman of genius , and , as is too frequently the case with such persons , finds in that fact a sufficient war - rant for despising ordinary mortals , and for treat - ing with scant courtesy those who , in simple kindness of heart , bestow upon her their attentions , and seek to knit with her those sympathetic human relations which sweeten life .

		She lives in such an atmo - sphere of adulation that it becomes a necessity of her existence , and whoever fails to do her instant and unmeasured homage , and patiently submit to being snubbed by her if caprice so prompts her , incurs her deepest displeasure .

		She is , moreover , intensely passionate , and becomes positively malig - nant if her whims are opposed .

		She has an inmost nature which is simply devilish , and yet , such is the spell cast by her genius upon her entourage , that her character is not suspected by her circle of ad - mirers .

		Particularly is she the object of the devotion of a young girl whom she has adopted in childhood , and who is her constant companion .

		Presently there appears upon the scene a well-bred young English - man of the philistine type , who falls in love with the young girl .

		He has wealth , position , and all the solid virtues imaginable , but he refuses to bow down to
Madame Okraska	ORGANIZATION	's genius , and finds intolerable her associations and her manner of life .

		This does not become fully apparent until after the marriage , and when it does , the wife is distressed beyond meas - ure to know that her husband does not adore the woman who has hitherto been everything to her .

		Skilfully working upon the girl 's emotions ,
Madame Okraska	ORGANIZATION	subtly seeks to wreck the menage , and in consequence ,
Karen	PERSON	deserts
Gregory	PERSON	, and seeks ref - uge with her beloved guardian .

		Unfortunately , the moment is ill-chosen , for just then
Madame Okraska	ORGANIZATION	is at her country home in
Wales	LOCATION	, philandering with a decadent poet whom she has taken up , and
Karen	PERSON	's unexpected appearance interrupts the idyl .

		When the poet is discovered making love to
Karen	PERSON	, there is a scene indeed , for the mask is thrown off , and the woman , in a fury of passion , reveals her real nature .

		Karen again takes flight , anywhere , to bury herself with the grief of her shattered ideal , and when
Gregory	PERSON	unearths her , she realizes that he has been right all along .

		Even then , the desperate woman , by simulated contrition , tries to regain
Karen	PERSON	's affec - tion , and to keep her apart from her husband , but her power for evil is broken forever .

		This makes a rather disagreeable story , which is saved by its style and its extraordinary powers of characteriza - tion .

		All three of the principal figures are made very real , as well as that of the old American woman who has been
Madame Okraska	ORGANIZATION	's companion and caretaker from infancy , and who knows her through and through .

		When this shrewd
New Englander	LOCATION	, with her blunt homely speech and her practical com - mon sense , takes a hand in the game , the complica - tion is soon straightened out , and husband and wife are restored to each other 's confidence .

		Miss
Zuleika Dobson	PERSON	is a young lady who does conjuring turns in the music halls , and who irresisti - bly wins all masculine hearts who come within the range of her fatal influence .

		She is also a grand - daughter of the
Warden of Judas	ORGANIZATION	, and comes down to Oxford as a self-invited guest in his household .

		Her devastating influence is felt at once , and all the undergraduates who catch a glimpse of her on the day of her arrival succumb to her fascination .

		Among them is the Duke of
Dorset	LOCATION	, a very paragon of accomplishment and aristocratic desirability .

		Un - fortunately , he does not dissemble his love , but boldly declares it , which is the worst thing he could have done , for
Zuleika	PERSON	numbers her captives of all degrees by the thousands , and the only man she can love is the one who shall be quite indifferent to her charms .

		She spurns all that he offers her wealth , social position , titles of most sorts of nobility , and ancestral castles in half a dozen countries .

		Whereupon * he announces that he has resolved to die for her .

		When she sees that he means it , she half relents , but it is too late .

		She exacts from him , however , the promise that when he takes the plunge into the

		The remain - ing students of Judas , and of several other colleges , having been permitted to gaze upon the adorable
Zuleika	PERSON	, and knowing that it is quite hopeless to live without her , when they learn of their leader 's resolve , vow to do likewise , and so , when the appointed hour arrives , all the flower of young Oxford seeks -LRB- and finds -RRB- a watery grave .

		Then the lovely
Zuleika	LOCATION	, find - ing no other reason for remaining , packs her boxes , and orders a special train for
Cambridge	LOCATION	which it is to be presumed she will depopulate in due course of time , although we are left to imagine the details .

		When Zuleika drives past the Sheldonian the day of her arrival in
Oxford	LOCATION	great beads of perspiration come out on the brows of the Roman Emperors whose busts intersperse the railings of that edifice .

		He persisted that he had seen what he had described .

		It was not until two days had elapsed that some credence was accorded to him . ''

		This witty burlesque of th * language and action of high-flown romance is carried out with a wealth of invention , aided by a fantastic vocabulary , of which we can imagine no one b?M > l < ~ Mr.
Max Beerbohm	PERSON	as being capable .

		His
Zuleika Dobson	PERSON	'' is assuredly a masterpiece of parody and satirical caricature of many forms of sentimental ism .

		If it does not succeed in smiling
Spain	LOCATION	's chivalry away altogether , it should at least prove a solemn warning to our ultra-romantic young writers .

		Upon a much lower plane of wit and literary distinction is the nevertheless vastly amusing tale , '' The Mystery of Number 47 , '' in which Mr.
J. Storer Clouston	PERSON	parodies the popular detective story .

		It all comes about from the fact that the Molyneux household , in
St. John	LOCATION	's Wood , has been abandoned by the cook , and that the Bishop chooses just that time to notify Mr.
Molyneux	PERSON	-LRB- a relative -RRB- that he is about to honor him with a visit The only way out of it seems to be for Mrs.
Molyneux	PERSON	to retire into the kitchen , and for her husband to inform the Bishop upon his arrival that she has been unexpectedly called away .

		There is something strained about his reception , for
Molyneux	PERSON	, being a simple-minded scholar and man of letters , does not lie with convic - tion , and his guest becomes suspicious .

		As the wife 's absence is prolonged , and as the husband 's explanations reveal noticeable discrepancies , suspi - cion ripens into a dark certainty , and the Bishop , resolved to get at the truth , communicates with
Scotland	LOCATION	Yard .

		Molyneux must have murdered his wife , and in the exceedingly attractive young woman -LRB- the cook -RRB- who is known to have been about the premises of late , the Bishop finds an adequate motive for the crime .

		Then the newspapers make a sen - sation of it , and No. 47 becomes a house of mys - tery , surrounded day and night by curious crowds .

		Molyneux disappears from the scene , and the hue and cry is raised .

		Now one of his youthful indis - cretions had been the writing of a detective story under the assumed name of ''
Felix Chapel	PERSON	. ''

		His publishers communicate with him under that name , and commission him to work up the mystery and make up another story out of it .

		To get the '' atmos - phere '' he must become acquainted with the house , and so , disguising himself , he obtains permission to go back to his own house , which is under police guard , and take up his residence there .

		The house has been ransacked from top to bottom without results , and it is up to the supposed novelist to pro- duce some incriminating evidence .

		Bones are the thing , and he obtains a supply from an accommo - dating butcher , has them buried in the garden , and discovered the next day .

		Then the horror is com - plete , and the gruesome details , elaborated by reporto - rial ingenuity , make the house an object of renewed public interest Some amateur sleuths join in the effort to probe the mystery , and to hunt down the dastardly murderer .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Miss
Winifred Stephens	PERSON	, tin - author of an interesting volume on French Novelists of To -
Day	DATE	, '' published two or three years ago , has just brought out through the same publishers -LRB- Lane -RRB- a valuable life of
Margaret	PERSON	of
France	LOCATION	, daughter of
Francis I.	PERSON	, sister of
Henry II.	PERSON	, and wife of
Emmanuel Philibert Duke of Savoy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is more a rapid review of the history of the time than a personal biography in the narrower sense .

		The author is curiously inclined to stray off into a detailed account of events in which
Margaret	PERSON	herself had the slightest possible part ; and the same tendency is apparent even in the discussions that make up the appendix .

		The fact that the
Seymour	PERSON	sisters wrote some Latin poems on the death of Mar - garet 's aunt is considered sufficient warrant for add - inga chapter dealingwith their lives ; and
Margaret	PERSON	's acquaintance with the
Duke of Nemours	ORGANIZATION	is made the occasion for a twenty-page discussion of a famous breach of promise suit with which
Margaret	PERSON	had not the slightest connection .

		But this inclination to wan - der from the main theme is by no means a fatal defect We owe to it the breathlessly interesting ac - count of the `` coup de
Jarnac	LOCATION	, '' and a hundred other matters which , whether they belong to this book or not , are decidedly worth while .

		Margaret 's real historical importance is due principally to the skil - ful way in which she helped build up her adopted nation at the expense of the land of her birth ; and the most serious criticism which the book deserves is that the period after her marriage is dismissed so curtly and almost hurriedly , while three-fourths of the space is given to her comparatively unimportant girlhood in
France	LOCATION	.

		Margaret of
Savoy	ORGANIZATION	, the ances - tor of
Victor Emmanuel II	PERSON	.

		by political policy and political fortune as well as by blood , deserves more attention than she has received here or elsewhere .

		There is an unusually accurate and exhaustive index , and the careful make-up of the book deserves high praise .

		A ton of Another reverberation of the glad
Africa	LOCATION	in the shout of triumph with which the Arctic region , , attainment of the
North Pole	LOCATION	was proclaimed to an admiring public reaches us in the shape of a well-made little book entitled `` A Negro Explorer at the North Pole '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Com - mander
Peary	PERSON	's only companion from the civilized world in that last bold dash to `` ninety North , '' Mr.
Matthew Alexander Henson	PERSON	.

		This is the third of the noteworthy publications begotten of that menior -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 325 able expedition of three years ago , the other two being the chief explorer 's own full account , `` The North Pole , '' and the rollicking narrative -LRB- `` A Ten - derfoot with Peary '' -RRB- by the `` kid '' of the party , Mr.
George Borup	PERSON	.

		A foreword expressing warm appre - ciation of Mr.
Henson	PERSON	's ability as an Arctic explorer is contributed by Captain
Peary	PERSON	to the present work , and there is also an introduction by Dr.
Booker T. Washington	PERSON	, dwelling with justifiable pride on the part played by those of his race , and particularly by Mr.
Henson	PERSON	, in enlarging the bounds of our geograph - ical knowledge .

		The author begins his narrative with a sketch of his own life of his birth in
Charles County	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	, in
1866	DATE	, of his early going to sea , and of his attaching himself , twenty-three years ago , to the man whom he has so acceptably served nearly ever since and then in a score of brief and brisk chapters tells the story of the famous final North - Polar expedition from his point of view .

		Enthusiasm and local color and high spirits are not wanting in his pages .

		With characteristic exultation he chroni - cles the fact that `` the ages of the wild misgiving mystery of the
North Pole	LOCATION	are over , to-day , and for - ever it stands under the folds of Old Glory . ''

		With some pardonable hyperbole he declares elsewhere : '' From the building of the pyramids and the journey to the
Cross	ORGANIZATION	, to the discovery of the new world and the discovery of the
North Pole	LOCATION	, the Negro had been the faithful and constant companion of the Caucasian , and I felt all that it was possible for me to feel , that it was I , a lowly member of my race , who had been chosen by fate to represent it , at this , almost the last of the world 's great work . ''

		The brief passage de - voted to Dr.
Cook	PERSON	and his alleged exploits will be read with interest .

		The book is excellently printed and suitably illustrated .

		The history ^ e a l reac ty have some admirable of classical books in English , French , and Ger - studies .

		man , dealing with the history of classical studies ; but there was room for a work of moderate length that should give essential features in readable form , and apparently this was the thought in the mind of Dr.
Harry Thurston Peck	PERSON	in preparing his `` History of Classical Philology '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In less than five hundred well-printed pages , the author carries the reader from `` The Genesis of Philological Studies in
Greece	LOCATION	'' to '' The
Cosmo	ORGANIZATION	- politan Period , '' wherein the subject now finds itself .

		Although he does not claim to do much more than criticize and organize material already available , the technical journals will record not a few serious criti - cisms and many differences of opinion ; but they will doubtless conclude by saying that the author has achieved success in his modest aims .

		To the reader who is not primarily a classical student we may hint that he will not find the book nearly as dreary as the title might suggest .

		Whatever may become of Latin and Greek in modern education , the influence of classical studies on the development of occidental life will long continue to be important ; and it is very possible to be interested in many phases of the subject .

		Moreover , as one turns the leaves of such a book as this , one will find interspersed in the pages of information an occasional paragraph that is quietly joyous .

		For instance , in view of the con - troversy about abolishing `` the stern door of com - pulsory Greek '' at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	, it is gladsome to learn that the Latinists of the
Isis	ORGANIZATION	once opposed the study of the nobler tongue so bitterly , and the animosity of `` Greeks '' and `` Trojans '' became so rampant , that parties of them took to fighting in the streets .

		Almost equally pleasing is this forcible declaration of Gregory the Great : `` The place of prepositions and the case of nouns I utterly despise ; for I consider it indecent to confine the words of the heavenly prophets within the rules of Donatus . ''

		The volume closes felicitously with the famous credo of
Gaston Paris	PERSON	, beginning : `` I profess absolutely and without reserve this doctrine , that science has no other aim than truth , and truth for its own sake , with - out care for the consequences , good or ill , regrettable or happy , which that truth might have in practice . ''

		We regret to note many slips in presentation that should not have been missed in the proof ; but it may be that such faults are more distressing to reviewers than to other readers .

		The religion I always pictured the Christ at col - of the apostle to , t .

		- , , - , , - , .

		the Labrador le g e as captain of the football team , fishermen .

		or stroke of the ` Varsity boat , or one of the honor men , because these were what I wanted to be myself . ''

		Thus declares Dr.
Wilfred T. Gren	PERSON	- fell in the course of his recent
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	lectures on the
William Belden Noble	ORGANIZATION	foundation .

		`` The Ad - venture of Life '' is the stimulating title given to the lectures as now published in book form by the
Hough	PERSON	- ton
Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The general purpose of the lecture - ship , as expressed by its founder , is `` To extend the influence of Jesus as the way , the truth , and the life , '' and `` beyond a sympathy with the purpose of the Lectures , as thus defined , no restriction is placed upon the lecturer . ''

		With the freedom thus allowed him , Dr.
Grenfell	PERSON	has drawn largely and with ex - cellent effect upon his own rich and varied experi - ence as minister to the bodies and souls of suffering humanity on the Labrador coast , and it is only natural that so practical and energetic a Christian worker should emphasize the importance of works as compared with faith , of the will to believe and to prove one 's belief in deeds as compared with mere passive intellectual conviction .

		`` If there is iniquity , '' he says , `` in accepting a course for true , the axioms of which can not be demonstrated by mathematics , this is the reason why I rejoice in my iniquity -LRB- in accepting the Christian faith -RRB- .

		My choice has given me much fun in life , and still promises to do so , for no capacities need go unused in the field of Christian adventure . ''

		A little later he says , with a touch of the humor and the shrewdness that so delightfully relieve his discourse of any musty academic flavor : `` Without question unfaith is too often a synonym for ` do n't want . '

		It is like the farmer who , when urged to give up whiskey , re - THE DIAL -LSB- AprU 16 , marked , Prove I do n't like an , and I '11 give un up . ' ''

		The substance of the book is grouped under four heads , `` Life and Faith , '' `` Christ and the Individual , '' u Christ and Society , '' and `` Christ and the Daily Life . ''

England	LOCATION	.

		It was notable for the number of important paintings by celebrated artists that had not been previously exhibited .

		No less than thirty-two out of a total of one hundred and seventeen not counting draw - ings and water colors were shown for the first time .

		Among these , the two beautiful paintings by
Filippino Lippi	PERSON	, owned by Sir
Henry B. Samuelson	PERSON	,

A. F. Sutton	PERSON	's superb -

		Of even greater inter - est to students are a number of canvases attributed to various masters , such as Lady
Jekyll	ORGANIZATION	's Giotto , Lord
Walsingham	PERSON	's reputed Titian -LRB- which Sir
Claude Phillips	PERSON	and other critics regard as by another hand -RRB- , and the Portrait of a Young Man , owned by Mrs.
Alfred Morrison	PERSON	, which though traditionally ascribed to
Lucas Van Leyden	PERSON	is now thought to be a work by his follower and imitator ,
Bartholomaus de Bruyn of Cologne	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Catalogue of this exhibition -LRB- Lon - don :
Phillip Lee Warner	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has been prepared by Messrs.
Roger E. Fry	PERSON	and
Maurice W. Brock	PERSON	well , who have made it a work of permanent value .

		A concise verbal description of each of the pictures is given , followed by the history of the picture as far as it is known , by a list of the times and places where it had been previously exhibited together with the catalogue numbers assigned to it , and by refer - ences to critical mention of it in books and periodicals .

		In many instances , also , the opinions of well-known authorities are cited in brief quotations from their writings .

		The book is a quarto , handsomely printed by the
Ballantyne Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` The Colonel '' wears a
Victoria Cross	PERSON	, but '' thinks nothing of the deed that won him fame , and I do not suppose it ever strikes him that his action on the battlefield was in any way brave or remarkable .

		He is modest , like all true heroes , and like a child he is simple .

		He is a boy among boys , there never was a heart so young as his , and few young men can appreciate the smaller joys of life as he can . ''

		The book concerns itself with the Dornell country house and its surroundings , with its inmates , especially its children , servants , and dogs , and with some of its visiting kinsfolk and friends .

		Quaint descriptive appellations are given to some of the characters , as `` The Kind One , '' `` The Baa-lamb , '' `` The Beloved , '' a 1 1 .

		1 * The Scratches '' The supposed teller of the tale , which is not a tale , but rather a series of humorous character-sketches , is apparently an amiable idler with a great fondness for children and simple things , who says of himself and his juvenile friends : `` It tickles my conceit , too , that they should choose me for a friend , and the honour of being one is worth a few sore ribs .

		The mystic realm called the child - world is no foreign land to me , because three of my best comrades dwell there , comrades I would not ex - change for the dozen wisest heads that ever wagged . ''

		Lovers of what is genuine and unspoilt in human character , and of what is simple and spontaneous and kindly in human relations , will take pleasure in the book .

		Here is Mr.
Ernest P. A. Law	PERSON	, with a volume of eighty pages on '' Some Supposed Shakespeare Forgeries '' -LRB- Macniillan -RRB- , de - claring that certain leaves in the Revels Books of the period of James the
First	ORGANIZATION	, long bninded as for - geries , are unmistakably genuine .

		The contents of these books were published by their discoverer ,
Peter Cunningham	PERSON	, in the publications of the Shake - speare Society for
1842	DATE	, when they were accepted as genuine .

		But when , twenty-six years later , Cun - ningham attempted to sell several of the documents to the British Museum , they were seized and turned over to the
Record Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the same time the pages for 1604-1605 and 1611-1612 , the former containing a record of the presentation of `` The Moor of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' `` Measure for Measure '' -LRB- by `` Shaxberd '' -RRB- , etc. , and the latter `` The Tempest , '' `` The
Winter	DATE	's Night 's Tale , '' etc. , were declared to be palpable forgeries , and this judgment ha * !

		> f-n all but universally acquiesced in ever since .

		The matter was of great interest , especially because of its bearing on the long-standing controversy over tin - date of `` Othello , '' which it effectually settled and unsettled in turn .

		Meantime that controversy was once more practically settled by the discovery of
Malone	PERSON	's memorandum , made a century ago , which now appears to have been a transcript of these very pages .

		The proof that the pages are after all genuine would appear to be the last and of course the most desirable link in the entire chain of evidence .

		Mr.
Law	PERSON	has printed a facsimile of two of the pages , accompanied by a convincing array of arguments and proofs ; and his entire story , in spite of a lawyer - like style , adds a most interesting chapter to the his - tory of Shakespeare controversy .

		THE DIAL 327 Platitudes When the Spanish Infanta Eulalia of a royal published not long ago a collection philosopher .

		o f philosophical essays over the nom de plume of '' Comtesse d'Avila , '' her royal nephew became highly indignant , reprimanded her severely , and even threatened to suppress the book .

		This method of advertising proved so successful that the volume has not only enjoyed a large sale in its orig - inal French , but now appears in an English trans - lation , bearing the title `` The Thread of Life '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There are twenty-six short essays in the collection , preceded by a preface in which the author informs her prospective readers that it is `` a senti - ment of modesty '' that prompts her to maintain an incognito on the cover of the book , whereas the preface itself is very carefully signed with her name .

		Then she proceeds to discuss , `` with the sincere con - viction that I have always shown in the expression of my ideas and opinions , '' such subjects as divorce , of which she heartily approves ; the family , which she regards , without any apparent regret , as in pro- cess of disintegration ; the complete independence of woman , which she favors ; religion , which she ranks among the useful superstitions that may in time become unnecessary ; morality , an arbitrary set of rules which are in constant process of amendment ; honesty , friendship , moral courage , judgment , and other edifying themes for rather purposeless plati - tudinizing .

		It was no more than natural that King Alfonso should have been troubled at catching his outspoken aunt publicly deriding the `` divine right '' theory , attacking the

		A perusal of some of the Reports of the
Bureau of American Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	on the cliff dwellings of the
Colorado	LOCATION	region , and some of the magazine articles which have grown out of those reports , have revived in his mind memories of troglodytes in
Europe	LOCATION	; and with a thorough knowl - edge of the subject , he has written a book on `` Cliff Castles and Cave Dwellings of
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- in which he describes the use of cliffs and caves as habitation for protective and economic reasons not only in pre-historic and early historic times , but even in modern and present times .

		He writes of these modern cave-dwellings , and of the remains of many of the others , at first hand , and furnishes some of the illustrations for the book .

		His style is characteris - tically popular , though he seems in some instances to descend to trivialities .

		Professor
Curtis Hidden	PERSON	Page 's admirable transla - tions from
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	are re-issued by the Messrs. Put - nam in four small volumes `` Tartuffe '' in one , '' Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme '' in another , '' Les Femmes Savantes '' in a third , and '' Les Pre `` cieuses Ridicules '' and '' Le Medecin Malgre * Lui '' in the fourth .

		Plays -LRB- even the classics -RRB- have a chance of getting read now - a-days , and the recent performances in
Chicago	LOCATION	and elsewhere of '' Les Femmes Savantes '' by the
Drama Players	ORGANIZATION	have made many people realize that the author is by no means dead , and that he makes a genuine appeal to a modern audience .

		A book for which there was decided need is Mr.
Bol	PERSON	- ton Hall 's '' What
Tolstoy Taught	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	.

		It is made up of extracts from
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's own writings , arranged under various headings so as to present in orderly sequence the views and teachings of the great Russian reformer .

		The contents are divided into two main sections , '' On Life '' and `` On Action '' ; with various sub-divisions bearing such titles as '' The Selfish Love , '' `` The Pursuit of Happiness , '' `` The Fear of Death , '' '' The Balm for Suffering , '' '' Women and Men , '' `` Alcohol and Tobacco , '' and `` The Great In - iquity . ''

		As a convenient summary of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's essential doctrine , the book should find a wide field of usefulness .

		The
American Institute of Criminal Law	ORGANIZATION	and
Crimi	PERSON	- nology has rendered a great service by publishing -LRB- through Messrs. Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- an excellent translation of `` The Individualization of Punishment '' by
R. Saleilles	PERSON	, Professor in the
University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is a keen criticism of the classic doctrine that the '' punishment should fit the crime '' without much regard to effects on the criminal and the perma - nent welfare of the community .

		The agreement with the main tendencies of the reformers in
America	LOCATION	is remarkable and encouraging , and the criticism of those tendencies is wholesome .

		One serious error of the orig - inal has not been corrected , the statement -LRB- p. 300 -RRB- that
Elmira	LOCATION	Reformatory is a '' private '' and not a state institution .

		However near at hand the millenium may actually be , the plain man of to-day is apt to feel that his own personal stake in the goods of a Golden Age is still re - mote and hypothetical .

		Mr.
Ritter Brown	PERSON	, in discussing `` Man 's Birthright '' -LRB-
Desmond FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , sees this fact very clearly , and so does what he can for the indi - vidual of the present day as well as for the society of to-morrow in his construction of an ideal society .

		The main point of Mr.
Brown	PERSON	's argument is that the chief source of our social evils is the divorce of man from the land , and that in keeping up the present undesirable state of affairs an important part is played by repre - sentative government .

		In lieu of these things , he advo - cates equal access to land and the relegation of the representative form of government to secondary affairs , all matters of the first magnitude to be decided by the votes of the whole people instead of by the more partisan and prejudiced decisions of their representatives .

		The author 's interest in the man of to-day as an individual appears in an appendix , in which are gathered from many sources a number of hints on various out-of-the - way kinds of farming and horticultural pursuits , to the end that the man who does not want to await political and constitutional changes to better his condition may seek the land at once and be happy and prosperous .

		370 SCHOOL AND COLLEGE .

		The college has had to bear the brunt of many assaults during recent years , from the rude thrusts of the weaver 's beam in the hands of the philistine to the volleys that come from the ranks of a purblind democracy that resents anything like distinction in education just as it resents the distinctions of wealth and social position .

		The firing along this latter line is somewhat irritating in its persistence , and it has weakened not a little the work of higher educa - tion .

		It finds a shining mark in every form of educational endeavor that is not obviously cor - related with the day 's work of securing a liveli - hood , although the activities with which it seeks to displace the tested and approved forms of edu - cational discipline have by no means been shown to be justified by their fruits .

		These material objects look well to the '' practical '' vision , they give a business-like appearance to college cata - logues , and they provide the pedagogical dem - agogue with an unlimited opportunity for the outlet of his rhetorical energy in the newspaper , the political gathering , and the educational con - ference .

		But those who urge them are content when their adoption has been secured , and do not care to investigate their application .

		In - deed , the searching analysis which would be re - quired to determine the extent to which these educational prescriptions were actually fitting young people for life is a task far beyond the powers of those who are so noisy in their ad - vocacy .

		Most of our current popular discussion of edu - cational problems is superficial or empty because it has catch-phrases rather than ideas for its subject-matter .

		It sounds plausible to say that the schools should fit boys and girls for the practi - cal work of life , and that knowledge of the world of to-day is more useful to them than all the lore of the past .

		And it is always easy to raise a cheap laugh about little
Johnny	PERSON	's father , suc - cessful man of affairs , who is quite unable to help his puzzled offspring solve a geometrical problem .

		A
California	LOCATION	educator was horrified the other day when it appeared that the students in the high schools of the
State	ORGANIZATION	knew more about Eoman history than they did about current events . ''

		Are our American schools preparing THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, Roman citizens ? ''

		was his indignant outcry , and the sympathy evoked by a protest of this sort is quite as cheap as the laughter with which we greet the lamentable case of little
Johnny	PERSON	's father .

		All these complaints about the '' unprac - tical '' character of our teaching are made in almost total ignorance of education in its deeper nature and underlying purpose , and in entire misapprehension of the argument by which any education at public expense is to be justified .

		It is , to put it brutally , of vital consequence to the State that little Johnny should be prepared to exercise the duties of intelligent citizenship , but of no particular consequence -LRB- to the State -RRB- that he should be fitted to earn a living .

		That is clearly his personal affair , and his self-interest may safely be left to deal with it .

		It is not the hungry man , but the illiterate man , whose exist - ence is a menace to the social organization , and whom it is the bounden duty of society to extir - pate as a condition of self-preservation .

		A great plaint now goes up all over the land to the effect that the colleges are tyrannizing over the schools , restraining their generous impulse to let children have what they want -LRB- or what their uninformed parents would like them to have -RRB- , and forcing their work along fruitless ways into narrow channels .

		These arrogant institutions , it is urged , close their eyes to the conditions of modern life , with its increasing multiplicity of interests , and fail to frame their programmes with an eye to the main chance , that is , with reference to the demands of the labor-market .

		The voice that makes this plea is so plainly the voice of unwisdom that it is diffi - cult to be patient with it .

		In a rational view of the matter , the colleges are engaged in a desper - ate effort to maintain any sort of an educational standard in the face of an opposition that cares nothing for standards , that is debasing them in every direction , and that wishes boys and girls to be passed through college with a minimum of exertion .

		Throughout the years that precede the college , the minds of young people are encour - aged to develop along the paths of least resist - ance , and then , when they would further pursue the path , they are pained to discover that the col - leges require them to exhibit some evidences of fitness for the serious work of education .

		For years they have been free to select the safest courses , have taken bookkeeping instead of physics and domestic science instead of geome - try , for years they have dawdled along , under conditions that make for mental flabbiness or worse , and then a halt is called , and they realize that most of their school life has been wasted , and that they have not been preparing themselves for college at all , but merely marking time .

		They have IM-VT ar < | iiiiv t '' accuracy , and they have never l > een forced to buckle down to stiff problems and work them out by sheer dogged determination .

		Our sentimentalized and emasculated school systems have put them through a mere travesty of the educational process , and they find themselves helpless in the face of the demands which any self-respecting college must make upon the students whom it admits within its precincts .

		All honor , we say , to those institutions which refuse to serve the time , but which serve instead that ideal of intellectual attainment which it is the sacred duty of the college to keep alive .

		Too many of our colleges are ignominiously betraying their cause , and weakening under the pressure of an unenlightened public demand for easier entrance requirements and a more liberal variety of the credits that may be offered .

		Some of our largest institutions are willing to receive untested any student who brings the certificate of a high school even of a high school that reduces to a disgraceful minimum its specific requirements for a diploma .

		A boy or girl may gain entrance into one of these colleges without algebra or geometry , without physics , or without knowledge of any foreign language whatsoever .

		All he need offer is a miscellaneous assortment of credits suf - ficient to make up the required total ; and in this democracy of interests , a course in blacksmith - work counts for as much as a course in Greek .

		No wonder the colleges that thus throw wide open their doors are swollen in numbers , for the car In t of a college education is still held to be of value , even if the substance bear no relation to what the term has hitherto been supposed to connote .

		Education , as it was conceived in this country a generation ago , was a reasonably solid struc - ture , honestly built up from foundation-stone to coping .

		What lias been going on of recent years has been a steady undermining of the masonry , substituting rubble and clay and other unfitting material for the lower courses , and then demanding that the superstructure should be determined by the needs of the material upon which it rests .

		It is jerry-building gone mad .

		Only here and there do we find colleges -LRB- and in them is our educational hope -RRB- that maintain a firm stand for the humanities and the disci - plines , that refuse to admit students without real preparation , that refuse to keep them unless they do real work , and that do not fritter away their energies by multiplying courses of dubious value , but place their main reliance upon the subjects
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 343 that have proved their power to strengthen the mind and mould the character .

		Little
Johnny	PERSON	, who `` never could understand algebra , '' and who did not `` take '' physics because the hard work would be `` bad for his health , '' and who passed Latin by because he did not expect to `` need it in his business , '' would be excluded from such a college , for the all-sufficient reason that it had better work to do than licking boys like him into shape .

		Such a college would make but a poor showing in the competition for numbers , and might be hard put to it for endowments ; but its graduates would be likely to give a good account of themselves , and it would be as a light set upon a hill in the educational landscape .

		DO WE KNOW WHAT WE WANT IN EDUCATION ?

		The proof of the pudding is the eating thereof .

		For two or three generations in
America	LOCATION	we have been engaged in the most extensive and expensive educational concoction ever known .

		What is the re - sult ?

		What is the flavor and taste of our product ?

		Will it gain us a prize in the country fair of the world ?

		Will we get a blue ribbon for intellect , for manners , or for morals ?

		These are questions which would require an expert commission to investigate .

		They can not be settled offhand by an essayist .

		But one may offer some considerations which tend to throw our success into doubt .

		Education ought to mean civilization , and civiliza - tion largely consists in conserving and honoring the best that mankind has known or done .

		Is there any such reverence in
America	LOCATION	for what the race has pro- nounced good ?

		Or is not our attitude towards the past typified by one of our most popular books Mark Twain 's '' Innocents Abroad '' ?

		But it is not only the actual deeds of the ages that we despise ; it is the tone , air , and sentiment of what is greatest and highest in human thought and action .

		Speak to the average educated American about poetry , and he will turn upon you with an idiotic laugh .

		Speak to him of romance or devotion or self-sacrifice , and he will regard you with a lack-lustre eye .

		Very likely this same self-satisfied citizen has in him the elements of poetry and devotion .

		But surely education ought to educe and bring them to the surface .

		We have paid enough to have our diamonds polished , and ought not to be obliged to wear them in the rough .

		Humor is a great asset for a people .

		It makes for cheerfulness , sanity , and endurance .

		But it may be questioned whether we have not too strong a strain of it in our character .

		The Broad Grin overspreads all our part of the
American Continent	ORGANIZATION	.

		Pretty nearly everything is viewed from a humorous stand - point .

		In our best authors this is called irony .

		If all distinction , beauty , profundity , and power are to be delivered over to the domination of the
Comic Muse	ORGANIZATION	, there is bound to ensue a vast and deep vul - garization of life itself .

		Let us turn to our morals , for there we proclaim ourselves strong .

		Well , there is an immense amount of preaching amongst us .

		Everybody preaches , so I suppose everybody performs .

		One of the most curious features of this didactic set is our passion for maxims , axioms , precepts .

		Every newspaper keeps a Solomon on tap to pour these forth in a steady stream .

		There never was anything like it before .

		English literature has always run to concrete exam - ple rather than to precept .

		Chesterfield and
Samuel Smiles	ORGANIZATION	are almost the only authors who occur to us as purely givers of advice .

		Of course all such work denotes a primitive state of mind in those who accept it .

		It is like the chairs and stools by aid of which a child learns to walk .

		As soon as people can trust themselves they disdain all such half truths or whole falsities .

		Have we any settled ideal in this country towards which we direct our education ?

		Other peoples have known what they wanted from education .

		The Greeks wanted to produce a race of athletes and artists to attain to harmonious perfection of body and mind .

		They did attain to that : they made humanity statu - esque and reached a hegemony in some of the arts which they still hold .

		The Romans educated for war and domination .

		The churchmen , into whose hands education fell in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, educated for the other world .

		They produced a race of spirit - ual enthusiasts who swayed the world with their vis - ions , and who brought something of heaven down to earth in their architecture , painting , music , and sculpture .

		The French have educated mainly for manners , for social charm ; the Spanish for the cul - tivation of a stately personal pride .

		Bismarck 's jest that as
England	LOCATION	owned the sea and
Russia	LOCATION	owned the land , there was nothing left for the Germans but the sky , is borne out by
Germany	LOCATION	's greatest achievements metaphysics and music .

		England is perhaps the only country which has educated for literature .

		I do not mean by this that it has not educated for other things , war , domination , science , but that through its whole educational system , and through the common thought of its people , runs a feeling , an acknowledgement that literature is the best work that men can do .

		As a result English literature is the greatest in existence .

		Is there any single thing that American education has aimed at ?

		Faith , I can not think of any , unless it is Big Business .


Leigh Hunt	PERSON	, who lived during his boyhood in this country , said that he never thought of the
United States	LOCATION	without seeing a great counter extending the whole length of our
Atlantic	LOCATION	seaboard .

		I am afraid that this counter still exists , and branches off in all directions over our domain .

		In very truth we have educated mainly for practical ends , and to that effect have accepted Science as our guide .

		We have the excuse that it was ours to break in and subdue a 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, continent We need strong tools to do this , and the incitement of gain to keep us at our work .

		The present writer spent a good section of his life in this sort of thing railroad building and he has the utmost sympathy and admiration for the men who pioneer material existence .

		But the finest flower of civilization is not born amid such men or such scenes .

		It is not born amid any people who accept business and science as the '' be all '' and the '' end all '' here .

		Religion and art are ends in themselves .

		They are finalities , lasting satisfactions .

		But Science is only a means .

		The word of Science always is , `` and then , and then , and then . ''

		We do not build bridges or railroads to sit down and look at them with ec - static joy , we build them to get somewhere .

		Even when radium is isolated or the spectrum of a nebula established , these successes are only steps in utili - tarian progress .

		We have built our faith on Science , and the foun - dations are giving beneath us .

		Many of the greatest men of science of the day are harking back to the old tracks of metaphysics and religion .

		Not only that , but Science is betraying us in a material way .

		It promised to make life easier and happier for us .

		Well , in the past year or so the whole world has known the pinch of hunger .

		We have felt it par - ticularly in
America	LOCATION	, and have savagely resented it .

		If
Big Business and Science	ORGANIZATION	together can not fill our stomachs , what good are they ?

		We have boasted of our unparalleled prosperity in
America	LOCATION	.

		We forgot that other ages and places have also been prosper - ous .

		There is a legend of ''
Merrie England	PERSON	, '' where everyone had enough to eat and plenty of time for sport and recreation .

		There were ages when the pleasant country of
France	LOCATION	, or
Italy	LOCATION	the beautiful , were paradises .

		And all this was before the time of
Big Business or Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		Obviously no single formula of education will answer even for material perfection .

		Probably there is no better test of the results of a nation 's education than the way in which success - ful people of all kinds rank in public estimation the off-hand precedence which is accorded them .

		In
America	LOCATION	to-day the men who are most and first in the public mind , who are the objects of general envy and emulation , are the wielders of vast wealth , the masters of finance .

		Then , perhaps , come the statesmen , though they win their places as by an ordeal of fire .

		Then rank the men of science of all kinds , inventors , investigators , engineers , educators , physicians , and the like .

		Far down on the roll rank the soldiers , and at the bottom of the list come the clergy , the poets , and the artists .

		Surely this is a spectacle of a world upside down , of a world waving its useful but humble locomotive members in the air while its head `` and features , the great soul 's apparent seat '' grovel in the dust .

		From the beginning of time , in nearly all places , two orders of men have been dominant , have absorbed the interest and attention of mankind .

		These have been the poets and the soldiers using those terms .

		of course , in a generic , in the widest allowable sense .

		The records of Hindoo life are largely devoted to the strife between these two classes , with all the other castes of men trailing on behind , unregarded .

		Similarly the old Celtic literature knew only two kinds of personages , warriors and bards .

		And of course every great epoch in European history is made glorious by a circle of heads belonging to these two orders of men .

		Of all the vast accumula - tion of the biographical literature of the world , prob - ably nine-tenths is devoted to men of the sword and the pen .

		The settled judgment of the world seems to be that anybody can be useful but that only these are interesting .

		All of us who read for love rove like bees from the accounts of battles to the records of literary and artistic struggles and triumphs .

		Somehow we feel that the great in these fields express , incarnate , life more fully than any others .

		Who takes an interest in the ledgers of Venetian merchants or the records of German guilds .

		Yet in
America	LOCATION	we are trying to reverse this decision of all time , we are trying to place financiers , busi - ness men , and scientists on the thrones of the world .

		Now no one doubts the power , the utility , or the i n < 1 1 - pensableness of such men .

		Doubtless their similars have always had their share of contemporary regard .

		Money talks , even if it rarely says anything worth listening to .

		But I think the dazzled eye with which we regard such potentates is a new thing .

		Probably the spirit of a nation dictates its system of education , and to tell it to change that system is equivalent to telling it to be born again .

		But we must make some change in our ideas and ideals if we want to cut the figure in the world which we have a right to do .

		Perhaps we might take a hint from the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, which is perhaps the wisest organi - zation ever known , and , in a way , the most democratic .

		It has never evinced an overwhelming desire for a general intellectual education .

		It has preferred to train the great mass of its people in manners and morals , and to reserve its treasures of culture for the most promising pupils .

		We fight against the idea , in
America	LOCATION	, that there is any inequality in natural gifts , and we try to give everybody an even chance .

		This is praiseworthy of course , but it is impossible .

		The texture of men 's minds differs more than the grain of wood in the forest * .

		As a corollary to our democratic endeavors in this way , we come to the conclusion that one kind of gift , one kind of success , one kind of achievement , is as good as any other .

		But it is not .

		There are hierarchies of talents : there are some kinds of genius so rare that they outvalue all the rest .

		We must recognize this or our education will be a muddle .

		We must recognize too that there are limitations to physical and material endeavor , that we can not all be rich , or even comparatively well off ; and that we had best try to lay up treasures of emotion , intellect , and spirit which will endure and console .

		MAKING THE FULLEST USE OF AN EDUCATIONAL PLANT -LRB- to apply an industrial term to what may be regarded as a great intellectual industry -RRB- obviously requires that the plant shall not stand idle any great part of the time .

		An all-the-year-round use of public school buildings for the good of the public is com - ing more and more to be looked upon with favor , although the proposal , as made by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	some years ago in `` The Independent , '' evoked at first vigorous protest and little or no encouraging response .

		To say nothing of the benefits to accrue from longer school terms and shorter
summer	DATE	vaca - tions , one obvious way of making the schoolhouse publicly useful throughout the year is to connect it , wherever practicable , with the public library system and cause it to shelter a branch library , or perhaps even the main library itself where a separate build - ing can not yet be provided .

		The town of
Pomfret	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	, has adopted the suggestion of its progres - sive librarian , Mrs.
Abba Do ton Chamberlin	PERSON	, and constituted each of its schoolhouses a branch library , numbered as is the school district it serves .

		Grand Rapids ,
Michigan	LOCATION	, is another town -LRB- or city in this instance -RRB- that has successfully met the need of addi - tional branch library buildings by utilizing its school - houses for the purpose .

		One of the Grand Rapids teachers admirably expounded the advantages result - ing from this coordination of educational effort in an address before thelibrary section of
the'Michigan State Teachers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Detroit	LOCATION
last November	DATE	.

		-LRB- See this paper , '' The Use of the Library in the Grades , '' in `` The Library Journal '' for
April	DATE	. -RRB-

		In the South , school libraries are abundant , and are increasing , as interestingly set forth by Mr.
Louis R. Wilson	PERSON	, libra - rian of
the University of North Carolina	ORGANIZATION	, in a paper read before the
Southern Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	last
December	DATE	and now printed in the above-named issue of `` The Library Journal . ''

		The school library is of course not to be confused with the branch estab - lished in the school building as an offshoot of the main library .

		Each has its uses and its reason of being , though the control and direction of library activity by the library authorities rather than by the school board would seem in general to yield the bet - ter results .


New York State	ORGANIZATION	long ago tried the system of district school libraries , and was glad to discard it in favor of a more economical and fruitful plan .

		But unquestionably the school library has often proved itself far better than no library at all , and has often , especially in our
Southern States	LOCATION	, pre - pared the way for a full-fledged public library .

		In this connection it is to be noted that some few local attempts , as at
Minneapolis	LOCATION	and in
New York City	LOCATION	, have been made to put the public library system under the control of the school authorities as a part of the general educational system .

		Probably most if not all library workers will maintain , and with reason , that the public library is too distinctive and important an institution to be made a subordinate part of any general system , even though a cordial cooperation of school and library is always desirable and is more and more becoming the rule rather than the exception .

		Those interested in this whole ques - tion of affiliating the two will do well to read , if they have not already done so , those numbers of Mr.
Dana	PERSON	's `` Modern American Library Economy Series '' that treat of school work in the library and library work in the school , and also the various papers and editorials on the subject in the `` School Number '' -LRB-
April	DATE	-RRB- of `` The Library Journal . ''

		How THE AMERICAN PUBLIC LIBRARY STRIKES AN IMMIGRANT , or at least how it struck one immi - grant from
Russia	LOCATION	eager to enjoy the blessings of American citizenship , may be gathered from a passage in the penultimate chapter of Miss
Mary Antin	PERSON	's autobiography , parts of which have been appearing in the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' as a preliminary to its recent publication in book form under the title of `` The Promised Land . ''

		Of the book-hungry little alien we read in her own glowing words : '' Off toward the northwest , in the direction of
Harvard Bridge	ORGANIZATION	, which some day I should cross on my way to
Radcliffe College	ORGANIZATION	, was one of my favorite palaces , whither I resorted every day after school .

		A low , wide-spreading building with a dignified granite front it was , flanked on all sides by noble old churches , museums , and schoolhouses , harmoniously disposed around a spacious triangle called
Copley Square	ORGANIZATION	.

		Two thoroughfares that came straight from the green suburbs swept by my palace , one on either side , converged at the apex of the triangle , and pointed off , across the
Public Garden	ORGANIZATION	, across the historic Common , to the domed
State House	ORGANIZATION	sitting on a height .

		It was my habit to go very slowly up the broad steps to the palace entrance , pleasing my eyes with the majestic lines of the building , and lingering to read again the carved inscriptions : Public Library Built by the
People Free	ORGANIZATION	to All ... Here is where I liked to remind myself of
Polotzk	LOCATION	, the better to bring out the wonder of my life .

		That I who was born in the prison of the Pale should roam at will in the land of freedom , was a marvel that it did me good to realize .

		That I who was brought up to my teens almost without a book should be set down in the midst of all the books that ever were written , was a miracle as great as any on record .

		That an outcast should become a privileged citizen , that a beggar should dwell in a palace this was a romance more thrilling than poet ever sung .

		Surely I was rocked in an enchanted cradle . ''

		Even the world-weary and the blase will catch something of the enthusiasm , of the exultant joy of living , that breathe in every page of `` The Promised Land . ''

		... EDUCATIONAL CHAOS , from which it is hoped that something like educational kosmos is now beginning to emerge in this country , forms the subject of some interesting observations and suggestions from Dr.
Henry S. Pritchett	PERSON	in an article entitled `` Education and the Nation '' in the
April	DATE	`` Atlantic Monthly . ''

		Like many another before him , Dr.
Pritchett	PERSON	deplores THE DIAJL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, the lack of unity and system in American education .

		a lack far more conspicuous than in the other great nations of the world ; and this defect becomes more pronounced the higher we go in our seminaries of learning .

		Even our largest universities have a dis - tinctly local or provincial character , and pursue their course with too little regard to any one common ideal and aim .

		But of late years a hopeful coordination of college and university with the high school has been effected , and this seems likely to lead to a better unification of higher education itself throughout the country .

		A valuable contributing agency to this end should be found in our national bureau of education , which has hitherto concerned itself almost exclusively with the elementary and secondary schools , but which , under its new head , Dr.
Pritchett	PERSON	hopes may advance to larger undertakings . ''

		Every state system of edu - cation , '' he believes , `` every college , every university which is doing honest and sincere work , has every - thing to hope and nothing to fear from such a na - tional scrutinizing agency .

		No one can doubt that the influence of a bureau so administered would make not only for educational efficiency , but for a larger patriotism .

		The college which best serves the nation will in the long run serve best its state and its com - munity . ''

		Standardization can be carried to regret - table extremes , in education as elsewhere ; but there is no immediate danger of any tame and tiresome monotony in our widely scattered and abundantly diversified institutions of higher learning .

		THE HIGH SCHOOL AND THE PUBLIC LIBRARY seem in general admirably fitted to work together in harmony and for the common good .

		Yet there is sometimes a remarkable lack of hearty and intel - ligent cooperation in their activities .

		Mr.
Thomas Lloyd	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	, principal of the Madison -LRB-
Wis.	LOCATION	-RRB- High School , calls attention , in the current ''
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin , '' to a striking instance of this lack .

		He says , in part : - In the high school building -LSB- at Madison -RSB- no provision had been made for a library room because the public library was supposed to adequately minister to our needs .

		There was no one person whose duty it was to see that these hundreds of young people were encouraged in their quest for knowledge not absolutely required by the teachers .

		Many good books and magazines were in the public library spoiling from lack of use .

		As a rule , the high school teachers did not use the facilities at hand .

		Teachers would send pupils to the library for reference work without knowing that the desired information was available ... This unscientific , haphazard , inefficient method produced dissatisfac - tion on the part of pupils , overwrought nerves on the part of librarians , and the blues on the part of the teacher , who was disappointed again and again because pupils came to class with poorly prepared lessons . ''

		How this vexatious situation was changed for the better is explained in the latter part of Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	's interesting article , his own agency in the transformation being notunapparent though mod - estly kept in the background .

		Other matter of inter - est to teachers as well as to librarians is to be found in the same issue of the `` Bulletin . ''

		Kt iciriDK.s AM > MK .

		HKKNAKH SHAW were rival candidates for popular favor , some yearn ago , on the
London	LOCATION	stage .

		The distinguished Grecian , Professor
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	, who is now visiting us , had a word of interest to say to the inevitable and ineluctable interviewer when the latter asked him about the production of his translations from the Greek tragic poets .

		`` There was an unexpected interest in them , '' he replied . ''

		And the crowds were in the pit , '' he added , with manifest satisfaction .

		`` You know ,
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and Euripides were alternating then in Mr.
Barker	PERSON	's theatre , and as to receipts were run - ning neck and neck ; but I think I rather beat him in the pit . ''

		Among other remarks attributed to the interviewed scholar at this time , it is encouraging to read this : `` Greek is forging ahead in
England	LOCATION	.

		Compulsory Greek is , of course , dying out in most places , though it will probably always be kept for a good many of the courses at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		But the general interest in Greek thought and Greek literature has increased enormously during the last fifteen years or so .

		... And there 's another inter - esting thing .

		I believe there 's no country in the world where the political leaders are such scholars as they are in
England	LOCATION	.

		Take Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	.

		He 's a first-rate Greek scholar , and two of his sons are .

		Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	is another , and Lord
Milner	PERSON	and Lord
Morley	PERSON	. ''

		Dr.
Murray	PERSON	goes so far as to maintain that `` the number of people who can translate a piece of Greek is larger than ever , '' and he eloquently and well explains why the love of Greek should continue and will continue .

		Cheering words are these of Dr.
Murray	PERSON	's , even after all allowance for enthusiasm has been made .

		... THE AVERAGE READER is the subject of a recent bright and entertaining contribution to ''
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly '' from the pen of Miss Olivia Howard I -RRB- un - bar ; but the average reader , if anyone can be found to acknowledge himself such , may well fail to recog - nize his portrait in the flattering picture drawn by
Miss Dunbar	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` His desires , '' affirms the writer , `` are mainly three : first , to know what life is , which leads him to read science ; second , to know what life means , which takes him to religion and philo - sophy ; and third , to know how life may be intensi - fied , wherefore he reads romance . ''

		Surely , this is , in part , at least , what the average reader ought , for his own good , to read ; and it is what public libraries gently and unobtrusively encourage him to read ; but if the whole number of books on science and philosophy and religion read in a year were divided by the number of readers of that year , it is safe to assert that no more than a small fraction of a book in those serious classes would stand to the credit of each reader .

		In this calculation both sexes are to be included , and every person whose indulgence in reading is not confined to the newspaper .

		Any con - siderable experience in public library work or in miscellaneous bookselling must compel the candid
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 347 person to admit , however reluctantly , that science and philosophy and religion do not constitute two - thirds or even one-third of the reading matter de - manded by fifty out of every hundred readers , or , in other words , by the average reader .

		INDIVIDUALISM IN EDUCATION has been the ten '' dency ever since '' the three R 's '' ceased to be the un '' varying curriculum of the schools , and Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, and mathematics the sum and substance of a college training .

		The ramifications and reticulations of a complicated elective system , with its attempted pro- vision for all conceivable tastes and bents on the col - lege student 's part , the modern schemes of university extension , and the various vocational and industrial schools , schools for backward pupils , schools for ex - ceptionally forward pupils , institutions for the blind , the deaf , the deaf-and-dumb , for the weak-minded , and so on , are certainly calculated to meet the wants of the individual in a manner undreamt-of in the days when the little red schoolhouse , the village academy , and the college were the only known agencies for teaching the young idea and rounding out the accom - plishments of the adolescent youth and the budding maiden .

		In no fewer than fifty-four of our cities there are now reported to be special schools or school - rooms for those brighter or more precocious children who in the olden time were compelled to fret their hearts out in checking their eager pace to something like the slowness of the leaden-footed and wooden - headed tail-enders of the class .

		The stereotyping or standardizing of education is apparently something one need not lie awake nights to worry over just at present .

		...
WILLIAM T. STEAD	PERSON	, man of ideas and ideals , militant champion of the cause of peace , confident advocate of a wonderful scheme for inoculating bar - ren soil with the bacillus of fertility , philanthropic propounder of a plan for providing homes for unfor - tunate infants , ardent enthusiast for psychic research , and incidentally a writer of books and founder of `` The Review of Reviews '' and other less successful periodical publications , was among the victims of the late awful shipwreck off Cape Race .

		Among the many works of his pen are '' Truths about the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, '' '' Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon , '' for which he suffered three months ' imprisonment , `` The Truth about
Russia	LOCATION	, '' '' If Christ Came to
Chicago	LOCATION	, '' '' Satan 's Invisible World , '' `` The United States of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' `` Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's Conundrum , '' and `` The Despised Sex . ''

		Born in
1849	DATE	, the son of a dissenting min - ister , Mr.
Stead	PERSON	came honestly by his bent for non - conformity , and it is cause for deep regret that so vigorous a protestant against all manner of intrenched iniquity and hoary prejudice should have been cut off in the ripeness of his powers .

		BRET HABTE AND DICKENS AS ESTIMATED AND COMPARED BY
CARLYLE	LOCATION	, in a letter of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's dated
1872	DATE	, that someone has unearthed and made public , seem to stand very nearly on the same dead level of mediocrity .

		``
Bret Harte	PERSON	, '' says the letter , '' is a notable kind of object , a man altogether mod - elled upon
Dickens	PERSON	; like
Dickens	PERSON	seeking his heroes in the region of blackguardism and the gutters , where heroic magnanimities and benevolences , I believe , were never found ; and delineating them , like him , by ell-deep mimicry instead of penetration to the real root of them and their affairs which indeed lies much further down !

		Like
Dickens	PERSON	, however , he does the feat generally well ; and I suppose will con - tinue at the same moderate workmanship , though a man of more weight of metal than
Dickens	PERSON	was . ''

		Carlyle goes on to despair of
Bret Harte	PERSON	's mending his ways , his forty years counting too heavily against any such reform .

		But to be reckoned as possessing `` more weight of metal '' than the foremost novelist of his time is surely glory enough , and
Bret Harte	PERSON	might well have been content to keep on with his `` ell-deep mimicry , '' wherein few have surpassed him .

		BROWNING 'S TACT AND COURTESY shone conspic - uous as the poet moved , a prominent figure , in the social and literary world of his day .

		In Hon.
George W. E. Russell	PERSON	's latest volume of personal recollec - tions , '' One Look Back , '' an anecdote is told showing how the adroit author of `` Asolando '' could relieve himself of a bore with the air of conferring a favor .

		Mr.
Russell	PERSON	had assembled a group of
Browning	PERSON	enthusiasts to meet the master at a dinner which he , the narrator , was giving in the poet 's honor .

		`` As soon as dinner was over , '' he says , `` one of these en - thusiasts led the great man into a corner and began cross-examining him about the identity of ` The Lost Leader ' and the meaning of ` Sordello . '

		For a space
Browning	PERSON	bore the catechism with admirable patience ; and then , laying his hand on the question - er 's shoulder , he exclaimed : ' But , my dear fellow , this is too bad ; I am monopolizing you ! '

		and skipped out of the corner . ''

		The not infrequent disinclination of writers , as of other craftsmen , to talk shop , is a thing the literary-hero-worshipper is slow to learn .

		.

		JOURNALISM AT THE UNIVERSITY OF
ILLINOIS	LOCATION	is assuming large proportions , both as an academic course and as a practical industry .

		The new build - ing now in process of construction for the
School of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	will furnish commodious quarters for the work in journalism , whose magnitude and im - portance in the university life may be inferred from the many publications issued by the students .

		These include `` The Daily Illini , '' `` The
Illinois Maga	PERSON	- zine , '' `` The Illinois Agriculturist , '' `` The Illio , '' `` The Technograph , '' and the humorous monthly magazine , `` The Siren . ''

		The young men in training at
Urbana	LOCATION	for the regeneration of the nation 's news - papers maintain a fraternity which appropriately calls itself `` The Fourth Estate . ''

		AL FRESCO READING-ROOMS increase apace among our public libraries , even though the pace is slow .

		Cleveland 's new public library building is to have a roof-garden reading-room , thus falling in line with the praiseworthy movement which began in the mild 148 THE DIAL -LSB- Mayl , and equable climate of
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, under the mem - orable administration of Librarian Liimmis , and which has found favor in at least one of the branch libraries in less salubrious
New York	LOCATION	, and has even been favorably considered in bleak
Boston	LOCATION	, of east - windy renown .

		When to open-air schools and dor - mitories and play-grounds there shall have been added open-air reading-rooms in any number , we shall feel that we have taken a long step toward the simple and the natural and the healthful life .

		CAVOUR AND A FAMOUS PHRASE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL . -RRB-

		In his interesting letter in
THK	ORGANIZATION	DIAL of
April 1	DATE	, on `` D'Annunzio as a National Poet , '' Mr.
Melville B. Anderson	PERSON	falls into the common error of attributing to Cavour the historic expression `` L'ltalia fara da se , '' and then piles Ossa on Pelion by interpreting the phrase as a prophecy that
United Italy	LOCATION	'' will not exist ... by the sufferance of her neighbors '' or , to put it more forcibly , that she would exist without need of this snffer - ance .

		Now , it is hardly fair to
Cavour	LOCATION	to burden him with the authorship of so unthinking a boast or so ab - surd a prophecy .

		The plan by which
Italy	LOCATION	, alone and unaided , was to realize independence and unity broke down utterly in 1848-9 , with the failure of
Piedmont	LOCATION	to expel the Austrians ; and when
Cavour	PERSON	came to power in
November , 1852	DATE	, he brought into office the convic - tion that only with the assistance of a foreign state could the independence of
Italy	LOCATION	be won .

		This convic - tion was the very basis of his policy ; and , acting upon it , he gained the indispensable aid of Napoleon III .

		Only a superficial knowledge of the times is necessary to make it clear that
Cavour	PERSON	would not , indeed could not , have voiced this bit of patriotic bombast .

		The author of the phrase was the king ,
Charles Albert	PERSON	.

		In
1843	DATE	, there had been a dispute between
Piedmont	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	over the salt trade with the
Canton	LOCATION	of
Ticino	LOCATION	.

		There had been further friction as to the Treaty of
Florence	LOCATION	; and in
April , 1846	DATE	,
Austria	LOCATION	placed a pro- hibitive tariff on Piedmontese wines .

		The attempt to cow
Piedmont	LOCATION	failed .

		To quote Mr.
Bolton King	PERSON	, ``
Charles Albert	PERSON	... told his reactionary councillors that if
Piedmont	LOCATION	lost
Austria	LOCATION	she would gain
Italy	LOCATION	, and then
Italy	LOCATION	would be able to act for herself . ' ''

		Again , in his proclamation of
March 23 , 1848	DATE	, to the people of
Lombardy	LOCATION	and
Venetia	PERSON	, the king said that
Piedmont	LOCATION	was `` trusting in the aid of that God who ... enables
Italy	LOCATION	to work out her own salvation '' -LRB- pose 1 ' Italia in grado di fare da se -RRB- .

		Mr.
W. R. Thayer	PERSON	points out in his '' Dawn of Italian Independence '' -LRB- vol .

		ii , p. 131 , Note -RRB- , that the expression '' L' Italia fara da se , '' which the proclamation echoes , originated in the disputes with
Austria	LOCATION	; it is probable that its repetition by the king in this manifesto gave it wider currency and made it the battle-cry of his unsuccessful campaigns .

		As Mr.
Thayei	PERSON	- says , it '' was the national watchword until the disaster of 1848-9 proved it to be fallacious . ''

		Cavour , as a statesman , inherited the les - son , as well as the hope , which lay in the king 's noble failure .

		HOAV 0 \ i : IM MH.lt \ NT GlKL DISCOVERED Something new and distinctive marks the style of the young Russian Jewess whose recent contributions to `` The Atlantic Monthly , '' over the signature ``
Mary Antin	PERSON	, '' have attracted more than usual attention .

		The abbreviated and simplified form of her Russian patronymic .

		adopted by the immigrant family after consult - ation with a self-constituted committee for the Americanization of impossible foreign names , is no longer that by which the gifted writer is known among her friends , since she is now the wife of a
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	professor ; but to her admiring readers she will continue to be
Mary Antin	PERSON	, and thus the reviewer will call her . ''

		The Promised Land , '' now published complete , in book form , after the appearance of the greater part in the above-named magazine , is the life - story of an eager , observant , reflective , aspiring , and always original young woman whose fun na - tive years have been divided between the stifling restrictions of the `` Pale '' and the glorious free - dom of
America	LOCATION	.

		Polotzk , in the government of
Vitebsk	LOCATION	, was the scene of her infancy and early childhood ;
Boston	LOCATION	and its suburbs that of her maidenhood and young womanhood with the broad
Atlantic	LOCATION	separating as by a chasm none too wide the amazingly disparate halves of this growing period .

		She is still under thirty , and she had to learn our language at an age when the ac - quisition of a new tongue is not exactly like the imbibing of mother 's milk ; and yet note the idio - matic raciness of her style as illustrated by the following random passage out of her book : '' Grandma
Rachael	PERSON	meant to be very strict with us children , and accordingly was prompt to disclipme us ; but we discovered early in our acquaintance with her that the child who got a spanking was sure to get a hot cookie or the jam pot to lick , so we did not stand in great awe of her punishments .

		Even if it came to a spanking it was only a farce .

		Grandma generally inter - posed a pillow between the palm of her hand and the area of moral stimulation . ''

		The Polotzk of the narrative is , of course , not to be confused with
Plotzk	PERSON	-LRB- also written Plock -RRB- of Russian
Poland	LOCATION	, some four hundred miles to the southwest ; nor is the
Dvina River	LOCATION	that flows within a few miles of Polotzk to be mistaken for the mighty Dwina that empties into the
White Sea	LOCATION	.

		THE DIAL 349 and intellectual hunger , let us hear her relate the cruel disappointment of her infant hopes to be allowed to drink at the fountain of knowledge even as the boys drank .

		Word had gone abroad that
Pinchus	PERSON	, son-in-law of Raphael the Russian , had two bright little girls whose talents were going to waste for lack of training , and Rabbi Lozhe became interested and sent for them , to see what truth there might be in the report . ''

		They tell me how the rav lifted me up on a table iu front of him , and asked me many questions , and en - couraged me to ask questions in my turn .

		Reb ' Lozhe came to the conclusion , as a result of this interview , that I ought by all means to be put to school .

		There was no public school for girls , as we know , but a few pupils were maintained in a certain private school by irregular contributions from city funds .

		Reb ' Lozhe enlisted in my cause the influence of his son , who , by virttie of some municipal office which he held , had a vote in fixing this appropriation .

		But although he pleaded eloquently for my admission as a city pupil , the rav 's son failed to win the consent of his colleagues , and my little crack of opportunity was tightly stopped . ''

		The bitter lot of the Russian Jew is depicted by the author in a way to wring the heart , but the gloom and horror of it all are relieved by irresistible touches of humor , while the charity and largeness of view displayed by this daughter of a hated and ill-used race are beyond praise .

		A paragraph or two from the opening chapter , '' Within the Pale , '' will present a picture of hardship , cruelty , and injustice strikingly in contrast with the large opportunity and blessed freedom beckoning the poor victims to the land of promise across the seas . ''

		Many bitter sayings came to your ears if you were a Jewish little girl in
Polotzk	LOCATION	. '

		It is a false world , ' you heard , and you knew it was so , looking at the Czar 's portrait , and at the flags . '

		Never tell a police officer the truth , ' was another saying , and you knew it was good advice .

		... It was not easy to live , with such bitter competition as the congestion of population made inevit - able .

		^ There were ten times as many stores as there should have been , ten times as many tailors , cobblers , barbers , tinsmiths .

		A
Gentile	LOCATION	, if he failed in
Polotzk	LOCATION	, could go elsewhere , where there was less competition .

		A Jew could make the circle of the Pale , only to find the same conditions as at home .

		Outside the Pale he could only go to certain designated localities , on pay - ment of prohibitive fees , augmented by a constant stream of bribes ; and even then he lived at the mercy of the local chief of police .

		... It was easier to be friends with the beasts in the barn than with some of the Gen - tiles .

		The cow and the goat and the cat responded to kindness , and remembered which of the housemaids was generous and which was cross .

		The Gentiles made no distinctions .

		A Jew was a Jew , to be hated and spat upon and used spitefully . ''

		Turning now to
America	LOCATION	and emancipation and limitless opportunity , with hope new every morning and attaining its sure fulfilment with each passing week and month and year , we find the wonder and delight of the young immigrant thus portrayed : '' Education was free .

		That subject my father had written about repeatedly , as comprising his chief hope for us children , the essence of American opportunity , the treasure that no thief could touch , not even misfor - tune or poverty .

		It was the one thing he was able to promise us when he sent for us ; surer , safer than bread or shelter .

		On our second day I was thrilled with the realization of what this freedom of education meant .

		A little girl from across the alley came and offered to conduct us to school ... No application made , no questions asked , no examinations , rulings , exclusions ; no machinations , no fees .

		The doors stood open for every one of us .

		The smallest child could show us the way . ''

		Again , in a later chapter , this emphasis on the educational advantages enjoyed by the children of new-comers to our free land is repeated .

		Far too few are the immigrant foreigners who are thus dazzled by the brightness of intellectual and spiritual opportunities , rather than by the gleam of gold , luring them to the land of prom - ise .

		But it is cheering to find even one of them writing in the following strain : '' The public school has done its best for us foreigners , and for the country , when it has made us into good Americans .

		I am glad it is mine to tell how the miracle was wrought in one case .

		You should be glad to hear of it , you born Americans ; for it is the story of the growth of your country ; of the flocking of your brothers and sisters from the far ends of the earth to the flag you love ; of the recruiting of your armies of workers , thinkers , and leaders .

		And you will be glad to hear of it , my comrades in adoption ; for it is a rehearsal of your own experience , the thrill and wonder of which your own hearts have felt . ''

		Not even the depressing atmosphere of Bos - ton 's slums could lower the high spirits of little
Mary Antin	PERSON	.

		She held a draft on the bank of good fortune and was on her way to the paying - teller 's window to have it cashed .

		`` My days in the slums , '' she says , '' were pregnant with possibilities ; it only needed the ripeness of events to make them bring forth fruit in reali - ties .

		Steadily as I worked to win
America	LOCATION	,
America	LOCATION	advanced to lie at my feet .

		I was an heir , on
Dover Street	ORGANIZATION	, awaiting maturity .

		I was a princess waiting to be led to the throne . ''

		A few details in regard to
Dover	LOCATION	Street , which all unconsciously was housing this royal person - age in disguise , may be of interest here .

		The migration to that unlovely thoroughfare , after a number of similar movings from one scene of squalid poverty to another , is thus referred to : '' What happened next was Dover Street .

		And what was Dover Street ?

		And rather , what was it not ?

		Dover Street was my fairest garden of girlhood , a gate of para - dise , a window facing on a broad avenue of life .

		Dover Street was a prison , a school of discipline , a battlefield of sordid strife .

		The air in
Dover	LOCATION	Street was heavy 350 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, with evil odors of degradation , but a breath from the uppermost heavens , rippled through , whispering of infi - nite things .

		In
Dover	LOCATION	Street the dragon poverty gripped me for a last fight , but I overthrew the hideous creature .

		and sat on his neck as on a throne .

		In
Dover	LOCATION	Street I was shackled with a hundred chains of disadvantage , but with one free hand I planted little seeds , right there in the mud of shame , that blossomed into the honeyed rose of widest freedom .

		In
Dover	LOCATION	Street there was often no loaf on the table , but the hand of some noble friend was ever in mine .

		The night in
Dover	LOCATION	Street was rent with the cries of wrong , but the thunders of truth crashed through the pitiful clamor and died out in prophetic silences . ''

		That the writer of the foregoing is a poet will be plain to the appreciative reader .

		The story of her early essays in verse , of her first appear - ance in print as the veritable author of some real poetry , rhymed and divided into stanzas , and every line beginning with a capital , and of her father 's emptying his till in the purchase of copies of the daily paper containing the wonder - ful poem , forms one of the most enlivening chapters of the book .

		Poetry was expected to be the key unlocking the treasure-chamber that should enrich and make forever happy the entire
Antin	PERSON	family ; and what reader of this fairy tale from real life shall say that it was not poetry that in the end wrought deliverance from poverty and opened the way to a larger and richer and more soul-satisfying existence ?

		One further quota - tion , from the book 's closing chapter , must find space for itself .

		And is this really to be the hut word ?

		Yes , though a long chapter of the romance of
Dover	LOCATION	Street is left untold .

		I could fill another book with anecdotes , telling how I took possession of Beacon Street , and learned to distinguish the lord of the manor from the butler in full dress .

		I might trace my steps from my bare room overlooking the lumber-yard to the satin drawing-rooms of the
Back Bay	LOCATION	, where I drank afternoon tea with gentle ladies whose hands were as delicate as their porcelain cups .

		My journal of those days is full of comments on the contrasts of life , that I copied from my busy thoughts in the
evening	TIME	, after a visit to my aristocratic friends .

		Coming straight from the cushioned refinement of Beacon Street , where the maid who brought my hostess her slippers spoke in softer accents than the finest people in
Dover	LOCATION	Street , I sometimes stumbled over poor Mr.
Casey	PERSON	lying asleep in the corridor ; and the shock of the con - trast was like a searchlight turned suddenly on my life , and I pondered over the revelation , and wrote touching poems , in which I figured as a heroine of two worlds . ''

		No want of confidence in her powers and her destiny seems ever to have brought despondency to this high-hearted young woman ; and the con - tagion of her belief in herself was caught by others .

		Dr.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	became in - terested in her , and many were the happy half - hours she spent with him or with members of his family in the old
Roxbury	LOCATION	homestead .

		Bar - nard College gave her the higher education she felt herself predestined to obtain , though KadclitTf , arross tin -
Charles	PERSON	, had In-fii tin - ilivain of her Dover Street girlhood .

		The
Boston	LOCATION	Pub - lic Library became her palace of delight as soon as she got her bearings in the splendid .

		\ MHT - ican city , and some of her pages glow with ad - miring praise of that abode of the muses .

		The infectious optimism and high courage of the book , as well as the vigor and picturesqueness of its style , with its frequent touches of humor .

		gleams of mirth , and suggestions of poetry , win the reader at the outset and hold him enthralled to the final page .

		Illustrations from photographs help one to follow the course of the writer from poverty-stricken Polotzk to the wonders and the riches of Beacon Street and Copley Squai : and a glossary of Yiddish and other alien terms used in the book follows the narrative .

		THE DIAL 351 of variations and clashes of racial opinion , whether in politics or literature , is a task which liberates that irresistible passion for social en - lightenment now permeating the entire civilized world .

		The system of international exchange of professors inaugurated some years ago between this and other countries , notably
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	, has already produced momentous results , in projecting for foreign contemplation a more rational perspective for American life , literature , and ideals , and correcting many mis - apprehensions arising from the more or less con - ventional and superficial impressions recorded by foreign observers .

		One of the most sug - gestive , and certainly the most broadly based and closely integrated , of all the interpretative projections of American nationalism , as em - bodied in her literature , which have yet appeared is the volume of lectures on American Litera - ture , by Dr.
C. Alphonso Smith	PERSON	,
Roosevelt Exchange	ORGANIZATION	Professor at the
University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1910-1911 -RRB- , and
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	Professor of English Literature at the
University of Vir	ORGANIZATION	- ginia .

		Scholarship alone , though an indispensable requisite , is inadequate equipment for the inter - pretation of American national temperament and genius .

		To scholarship must be superadded a full-blooded national spirit , a comprehensive knowledge of American life , and the talent for expressing sympathetic intuition with clarity , force , and the sort of inspired conviction which induces conviction in the foreign auditor .

		This rare union of qualities , indispensable for the highest effectiveness , has not always been found in the American representative .

		It is this very union of qualities in the person of Dr.
Smith	PERSON	which gave him his distinction as an academic ambassador at
Berlin	LOCATION	, and which , as expressed in the volume under consideration , constitutes it the most important interpretation of American literature from the international point of view thus far contributed by American criticism .

		In executing his delicate and complex task , it is clear that the author has been animated by two shaping principles the one a principle of interpretation , the other a principle of method .

		His primary purpose was to write , not a con - secutive and exhaustive history of American lit - erature a task manifestly precluded by the character and scope of the lectures , but an interpretation of American national life , ideals , and genius as bodied forth in our literature .

		His secondary purpose was , not only to exhibit American literature as an expression of Ameri - can temperament , but also to show the cultural interactions between the literature of
America	LOCATION	, and European in particular , German liter - ature .

		The successful accomplishment of his primary purpose is effected through the mainte - nance of a broad nationalism in his interpreta - tions , the exclusion of all sectional controversy , and the appreciation of the cardinal figures and dominant movements in our literature as expres - sions of national , rather than of provincial , of international rather than of insular , conscious - ness .

		Even when his interpretation might ap - pear to reflect bias or predilection , its sincere forthrightness argues in the author concern for the fundamental principles of literature and never any trace of sectional prejudice or pre - possession .

		The accomplishment of his second - ary purpose , if less successful , is effected by liberal quotation of the best foreign , especially German , interpretations of American life and literature , and a constant indication of the streams of cultural influence flowing between
America	LOCATION	and
Europe	LOCATION	throughout the history of American literature .

		It should be pointed out that the purpose of the book is to inspire in the German public a vital interest in
America	LOCATION	and her literature .

		In devoting himself to this purpose , the author has integrated his materials in a masterly way .

		Translation of the book into English would , how - ever , show that Dr.
Smith	PERSON	wrote his lectures primarily for a German audience , and in so doing deliberately employed the compact and synthetic methods of German scholarship methods not always wholly congenial to the American tem - perament .

		This survey of Dr.
Smith	PERSON	's , by reason of its enforced scope and aim , lacks the superficial unity and chronological sequence of the conven - tional catalogue of American literature .

		The problem of selecting the figures , movements , and streams of cultural influence which bulk largest in our literature , was a problem of great deli - cacy and tact .

		It must be said that , in this re - spect , Dr.
Smith	PERSON	has exhibited both liberality of view and discrimination in judgment .

		In the first place , there is an examination of certain individual figures , which are generally acknowledged to be summits in our literature
Franklin	PERSON	,
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
Irving	LOCATION	,
Cooper	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and Whitman .

		The inclusion of
Jefferson	ORGANIZATION	in a list that excludes
Hawthorne	PERSON	and
Lanier	PERSON	is doubly explained : first , on the ground that
Jefferson	PERSON	, though not a distinctively liter - ary figure , definitely pointed the way to the in - dividualism and the idealism which constitute 862 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, the leading factors in American literature ; and second , because to
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and to
Lanier	PERSON	in lesser degree , is devoted particular consideration in the surveys of the American short-story and of American idealism .

		In the second place , the author has studied other dominant figures in connection with dis - tinct contributions of
America	LOCATION	to world-literature
Poe	PERSON	as the incarnation of the structural and technical genius of
America	LOCATION	;
Mark Twain	PERSON	as the embodiment of American humor ;
Joel Chand	PERSON	- ler
Harris	PERSON	in vindication of his pre-eminence in utilizing the negro as literary material ; and
Cooper	PERSON	, in the chapter above mentioned , prim - arily for his achievement in bodying forth the romance and the sociological tragedy of the In - dian , the primitive man in contrast with our highly institutionalized civilization .

		In the third place , the author has studied cer - tain signal aspects and phases of our literature , surveying that literature in retrospect at differ - ent periods in its history , and throwing into sharp outline those unquestioned contributions to world-literature in which
America	LOCATION	has won inter - national acknowledgement .

		This philosophical treatment , which gives the book its warrant to be ranked as distinctly Kulturgeschichte ^ re - veals itself in the Introduction and the Gen - eral Survey '' ; in the chapter , '' American Poetry up to the Year
1832	DATE	, '' '' Idealism in American Literature , '' '' The Influence of Transcendental - ism upon American Literature , '' '' The Ameri - can Short-Story '' ; and the continual advertence to individualism as the force hitherto dominant in American literature and in American life .

		Every informed reader will doubtless disagree with Dr.
Smith	PERSON	in his deliberate '' sins of omis - sion and commission , '' his individual preferences , exclusions , and inclusions , and his analysis of certain literary figures .

		Slight as is
America	LOCATION	's contribution in the field of the drama , at least it would seem entitled to a word in any treatment of American literature .

		The name of
William James	PERSON	, a great stylist as well as a great philoso - pher , is missing from the index ; and the contri - butions of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	to American fiction go unconsidered .

		Mention of the names and best work of Miss
Ellen Glasgow	PERSON	and Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	goes along with omission of the name of Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	, the author of the greatest American novel of the last decade -LRB- `` The House of Mirth '' -RRB- , and the name of
Frank Norris	PERSON	, whose novel '' The Pit '' won world - wide recogni - tion .

		Citation of the conversations at the tomb of
Adam	PERSON	and before the bust of
Columbus	LOCATION	, as being in
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's best vein and excelled by nothing he subsequently wrote , argues undue appreciation of the horse - play humor of the great humorist in his earlier period .

		The whole chapter , one of the best in the book , accentuat - ing Mark Twain 's '' humor with a purpose , '' his genius for effective contrast , especially social - political contrast , and his inherent idiosyncrasy for colossal exaggeration , nevertheless leaves in the main unstressed those deeper elements in his work of philosophical , ethical , and sociological import which imparted humanitarian character to the less boisterous productions of bis later period .

		The chapter on
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, while largely devoted to recurrence to the fundamental principles of poetry , gives the effect of being both inadequate and one-sided throwing undue em - phasis upon the enumerative quality of Whit - man 's production , and leaving unrevealed the colossal imaginative idealism of Whitman 's spirit and his indubitably great faculty of interpreta - tion of literature in terms of democracy and human brotherhood .

		Omission , from both the index and the bibliography , of the names of
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	, the greatest living apostle of Whitmanism , and of
Horace Traubel	PERSON	, the high - est authority on Whitman , appears as an un - doubted defect .

		The most brilliant and original chapters in the book are those devoted to
Poe	PERSON	and
Harris	PERSON	.

		The treatment of
Poe	PERSON	as a structural genius , who thereby revealed his fundamental Americanism as a national interpreter of our genius , is a re - freshing novelty after the long years of unin - spired rating of
Poe	PERSON	as a declasse of literature , an artistic exotic .

		Brilliant and original as is the treatment , it is open to serious question whether Dr.
Smith	PERSON	has validated his contention .

		I have shown elsewhere that , as structural ar - tists ,
Ibsen	PERSON	as a dramatist was the precise ana - logue of
Poe	PERSON	as a short-shory writer .

		Each was that rarest of phenomena in literature , a compo - site of scientific worker and artistic thinker .

		If the scientific and structural genius of
Poe	PERSON	argues his Americanism , by the same token may
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, on the structural side , be rated as essentially representative of the American , not of the Dano - Norwegian-Germanic , genius .

		So little critical attention has hitherto been devoted to
Harris	PERSON	that the enthusiastic tone of Dr.
Smith	PERSON	's chap - ter may seem excessive to those not reared on the Uncle Remus folk-lore .

		In many respects , this chapter is the most suggestive in the book , calling attention , as it strongly does , to
Harris	PERSON	's two-fold contribution to American literature : his masterly utilization of the negro as literary material , and the exceptional philological value
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 353 of that contribution .

		This chapter is the work of a true critic of literature and of a master philologist .

		Emerson is lauded as the rarest type of genius the symmetric , the harmonic genius ; and it was his supreme distinction to be an '' idealist of idealists , an optimist of opti - mists . ''

		Longfellow is given full meed of praise for extending and deepening the sources of American culture , and widening the American horizon .

		Hawthorne is accorded unique emi - nence in our literature as an analyst of conscience and a supreme symbolist .

		New England litera - ture , judged by its masterpieces , is rated by Dr.
Smith	PERSON	as '' the highest and noblest expression which the American spirit has yet found '' ; but that does not blind the author of that phrase to the gently myopic absurdities of certain phases of Transcendentalism .

		The lectures most popular in
Germany	LOCATION	, according to my impression at the time , were , curiously enough , not those on Long - fellow , the missionary of German culture to
America	LOCATION	, or
Emerson	LOCATION	, reputed to be the most widely read author in
Germany	LOCATION	to-day , but those on
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	,
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	,
Joel Chand	PERSON	- ler
Harris	PERSON	,
James Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	, and the American short-story .

		The final chapter in the volume , on the American short-story , though unmarked by any unusual originality , is the most compact and scholarly treatment ever de - voted to that fascinating phase of American literature .

		This lecture created a genuine stir in
Berlin	LOCATION	, led to the publication of the chapter in separate form , and was immediately followed by the appearance in German periodicals , in Ger - man translation , of a number of the short-stories of the
North Carolina	LOCATION	genius , the late ''
O. Henry	PERSON	. ''

		The bibliography , including titles of the most important books and magazine articles , both foreign and American , dealing with Amer - ican literature , is a most valuable adjunct to the text -

Minnesota	LOCATION	; and yet , while apparently wrapped up heart and soul in this great work , he at times broke away from his university duties to render signally effective service to the nation in its relations with other powers .

		Every time that a man of culture and refinement en - ters successfully and acceptably into the public service , and then drops back again quietly into his former walk in Jife , an added proof is given of the possibility of an efficient democracy .

		Dr.
Angell	PERSON	's remotest American ancestor reached
Massachusetts	LOCATION	with
Roger Williams	PERSON	in
1631	DATE	, and went with
Williams	ORGANIZATION
five years later	DATE	to the spot where the latter founded the city of
Providence	LOCATION	.

		Descendants of this
Thomas Angell	PERSON	are numerous in
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, where most of the family have remained . ''

		They have been found chiefly in the ranks of plain farmers , mechanics , and tradesmen , gaining by industry and integrity an honest living , but winning no particular dis - tinction .

		Living on a thoroughfare , the parents of President
Angell	PERSON	combined tavern-keeping with farming , and the number of travellers en - tertained during his boyhood was considerable .

		The town meetings , too , were held at his father 's tavern , together with occasional political meet - ings of a less official character , and now and then a justice 's court . ''

		I have always felt , '' he says , '' that the knowledge of men I gained by the ob - servations and experiences of my boyhood in the country tavern has been of the greatest service .

		Human nature could be studied in every variety , from that of the common farm labourer to travel - ers of the highest breeding and refinement ... If , as I have sometimes been assured , I have any power of adaptation to the society of different classes of men , I owe it in no small degree to these varied associations of my boyhood . ''

		With the aid of an uncle , he picked up the alphabet from the capital initials at the heads of chapters of an old law book .

		At a very early age he was sent to a district school , learning to write with a goose-quill pen , in a copy-book made by his own hands and ruled with a leaden plum - met .

		Later he was placed in the private school of a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	,
Isaac Fiske	PERSON	, to whose accuracy of instruction in arithmetic and surveying he ex - presses himself as under deep obligations .

		From this school he went for one term to a seminary at
Seekonk	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and then to
Smith	PERSON	- ville Seminary , a new school only five miles from his home , where under good classical instruction he `` caught the swing and flow of the Virgilian verse , so that we read with genuine delight in the last six books of the ^ Eneid at the rate of three hundred lines a day . ''

		His college educa - THE DIAL -LSB-

Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, where he studied under
James R. Boise	PERSON	and
Henry S. Frieze	PERSON	, both of whom preceded him at
Ann Arbor	PERSON	and helped to lay the foundation of thoroughness which the
Brown	PERSON
of the first half of the last century	DATE	imparted to so many pioneer Western institutions .

		For some time after graduation he held a position of minor importance in the
Brown	PERSON	li - brary , and in the autumn of the next year ,
1850	DATE	, set out on a horseback journey through the South , in company with his college classmate ,
Rowland Hazard	ORGANIZATION	, who made the trip in quest of relief for diseased lungs .

		After returning in the
spring	DATE	, he took up work with the
City Engineer of Bos	ORGANIZATION	- ton , but in the following
December	DATE	he received from Mr.
Hazard	PERSON	, who was again in trouble with his lungs , an urgent request to accompany him to southern
Europe	LOCATION	for the winter .

		Of a portion of this trip he says : The visit to
Rome	LOCATION	brought to me the first real reve - lation of the arts of sculpture and painting .

		The gal - leries and churches opened to me a new world .

		One can not describe what it was to a person who had no con - ception of art except what he had derived from the sight of Powers ' Greek Slave and copies in private houses of two or three classical masterpieces of painting , to have suddenly spread before him the immeasurable artistic wealth of
Rome	LOCATION	, with full liberty to gaze upon it at will , and to attain to some worthy appreciation of its wealth .

		Life could never again be quite what it was before .

		Of all the gifts of
Rome	LOCATION	to me , that was the greatest . ''

		Perhaps there is here some genetic relation to the fact that for a
State University	ORGANIZATION	, where the materializing influences of the time are supposed to fall with especial weight , the institution at
Ann Arbor	PERSON	has maintained exceptionally effec - tive departments of classical studies .

		In
Vienna	LOCATION	be received a letter from President
Wayland	LOCATION	, offering him his choice between the chair of
Civil Engineering	ORGANIZATION	and that of Modern Languages in
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	, with the privilege of remain - ing abroad a year and a half for study .

		He chose the latter , and after studying in
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	took up the duties of his professor - ship in
1853	DATE	, at the age of twenty-four .

		Here he soon drifted into editorial work , with the
Providence	LOCATION	`` Journal , '' and in
1860	DATE	resigned his university chair and took editorial charge of that paper , conducting it with vigor through the period of the Civil War .

		In
1866	DATE	he was called to the Presidency of
the University of Vermont	ORGANIZATION	, and from there to the
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	, in
1870	DATE	.

		Such was the training for the great presiden - tial work at

		THE DIAL 355 him to write are of such urbanity that their charm of manner has no small part in the con - vincing quality of their content .

		With a few exceptions , among which may be mentioned one more addition to the already long list of none too successful attempts to give a satisfactory topographical setting to the rendering of Hor - ace 's ''
Carmen Saeculare	PERSON	, '' and what seems a little too much insistence , in the fine chapter on
Virgil	PERSON	, on the poet 's conscious development of the character of .

		< 3neas , there is nothing which savors of forcing .

		A comparison of
Warde Fowler	ORGANIZATION	with Wis - sowa is inevitable , though the latter 's usefulness is rather increased than diminished by the for - mer .

		The monumental German work is divis - ible into two parts : a highly concentrated historical sketch , and a series of minutely de - tailed accounts of individual deities and their cult organizations .

		The English work blends these two kinds of material into a single unified whole , with the effect of a narrative which is orderly , well knit , and appreciative to the highest degree .

		It is not a thesaurus , though its thorough appa - ratus of notes , appendices , and index make it a specialist 's book as well as a work which will be illuminating to the average cultivated reader .

		The scope of the two books is not identical .

		Wis - sowa begins with the earliest period for which there is direct evidence ;
Warde Fowler	PERSON	's book , as might be expected of a work coming from the land of anthropologists , begins with '' The Threshold of Religion , '' two admirably self - restrained chapters in which survivals of taboo and magic are made the indirect evidence of the more remotely primitive religion .

		The German work closes with the death and disappearance of paganism in the sixth century ; the English with the Augustan Reform and some well-chosen words on the legacy of paganism to the new order of religion .

		This is disappointing ; we miss an account of the movements of the Empire which helped make straight the way for Christianity .

		Fortunately , however , our regret at the loss of so agreeable a guide is tempered by the avail - ability of another work , now in
English M. Franz Cumont	ORGANIZATION	's book on '' The Oriental Relig - ions in Roman Paganism . ''

		In these most pene - trating studies we may find clearly traced the advent , development , influence , and final contri - bution to the
Christian Church	ORGANIZATION	, of the deities from
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	, chief among them the
Magna Mater	ORGANIZATION	,
Isis	ORGANIZATION	, and Mithras .

		The great merit of
M. Cumont	PERSON	's work is the acuteness of vision with which he sees in a great array of evi - dence from widely scattered sources the founda - tions that underlay the success of these religions .

		The appearance of his book arouses all the more interest because of its author 's recent lecture - tour to the principal cities and universities of the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	, where the charm of his personal qualities has increased the admi - ration already felt for his scholarship .

		The lectures of this tour have also recently issued from the press under the title of `` Astrology and Religion among the Greeks and Romans . ''

		They were first delivered in this country under the auspices of the
American Committee for Lectures	ORGANIZATION	on the
History of Religions	ORGANIZATION	.

		Their contribution is the light they throw upon the relations between faith , superstition , and science in the astral worship of the Babylonians relations which kept astrology alive and power - ful for over a thousand years .

		The work of Director
Carter	PERSON	differs from all four of those above mentioned in presenting no critical apparatus , and in aiming not so much at the communication of facts as the grounding of an impression the impression of the continuity and the cumulation of the Roman religious ex - perience . ''

		What we are to do now , '' he says , `` is to study not so much a religion in itself , but rather the effect of the impact of a specific religion upon the psychological consciousness of a people .

		Our interest is , therefore , not pri - marily in the content of the religion , but in the reaction which this content has called forth . ''

		The scope of the book may be indicated by these words from its concluding chapter : '' During the millennium and a half , from the founda - tion of
Rome	LOCATION	until the death of Gregory the Great , we have observed the presence of two factors : a permanent religious need , and a permanent religious supply ... We have seen the great role which religion of necessity plays in human life . ''

		Mr.
Carter	PERSON	's first chapters are the least suc - cessful partly because Roman paganism can not in four chapters be satisfactorily presented even to a reader who is fairly well prepared to listen , and partly because he is hampered by already having written a book covering the period he treats in them .

		Beginning with the third chap - ter , in which Christianity enters into the story , the work finds the reader possessed of a more extensive background .

		Here the author 's pur - pose leads him to sketch with rapid hand the his - tory of the times and of some of their great men .

		The figures of Constantine ,
Julian	PERSON	,
Augustine	LOCATION	,
Benedict	LOCATION	, and
Gregory	PERSON	give this part a fine bio - graphical interest .

		The whole is written with a vigorous , direct , and unhesitating movement , which will put Mr.

May 1	DATE	, The lover of justice will applaud the sane conclusion of all three of these scholars , that Roman religion was not the wholly dead and lifeless thing it is so often said to have been .

		They do not , indeed , credit paganism with the warmth of the Christian faith , but they do condemn though somewhat too conservatively the fashion which has prevailed of dismissing Roman religion as of a purely formal , contract - ual nature , having no relation to morality and no power to uplift . ''

		That the formalized reli - gion of later times had become almost divorced from morality , '' says Mr.
Warde Fowler	PERSON	, `` there is indeed no doubt ; but in the earliest times , in the old Roman family and then in the budding State , the whole life of the Roman seems to me so inextricably bound up with his religion that I can not possibly see how that religion can have been distinguishable from his simple idea of duty and discipline . ''

		In the life of the family , and especially in the unchanging rural
Italy	LOCATION	, he sees the same quality of religious life through all the centuries .

		Even the
State	ORGANIZATION	reli - gion , in its most degenerate phase , he credits with having been in a state of suspended ani - mation rather than death , and looks upon its continued service after the Augustan Reform as proof of its vitality .

		M. Cumont reinforces him .

		The religions of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, especially the Oriental faiths , were of still greater spiritual effect , rising as they did in an age of individual longing for salvation . ''

		The religious and mystical spirit of the Orient , '' says
M. Cumont	PERSON	's last sentence in the '' Oriental Religions / ' `` had slowly overcome the whole social organism , and had prepared all nations to unite in the bosom of a universal church . ''

New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The newspapers and the magazines are devoting much space to the subject , and educational topics are found on the programmes of all sorts of associa - tions and clubs .

		As an outcome of this interest , one may hear and read extraordinary and contradictory statements regarding the value of any phase of present-day teaching .

		Some writers and speakers commend the tendencies in modern education , hut say we are not moving rapidly enough in the direction of making our school work from start to finish prac - tical , which means for them industrial and voca - tional ; others say that we are drifting toward im i commercialism and materialism in the schools , car - ing no longer for genuine discipline and training , but only for something which will be of advantage in money-making .

		Partisans in either cam -RSB- -RRB- will do well to read Professor Graves 's new book , '' Great Educators of Three Centuries , '' which should help the layman to understand contemporary educational aims and practices .

		The volume presents in a simple way some of the more important views of a number of classic writers on education .

		It is designed for those who are not familiar with the history of edu - cation , but who would be pleased to learn that many , if not all , of the ideals which educators are striving for to-day have been suggested by every student of education from
Milton	LOCATION	to our own times .

		Some of those who are complaining about present-day teach - ing have not the slightest notion of the origins of modern practice ; and they permit themselves to be - come greatly worked up about the imaginary dangers ahead of us .

		Such persons are likely to do some harm , since they may cause the layman , who has no opportunity to trace the course of events in educa - tional practice , to fear that we are likely to go on il it - rocks unless we drop anchor or tack in an opposite direction .

		Professor Graves introduces the reader first to
Milton	LOCATION	: in about two thousand words he pre - sents and comments upon certain of
Milton	PERSON	' > views on teaching as they relate to present-day movements .

		The theories and experiments of thirteen other t-iiu - cators , ending with
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, are treated in substantially the same way ; although more space is given to several who played a more important role in determining educational theory .

		The book is designed wholly for those persons who have not had previous study in the history of education , and who can not be expected to go deeply into the philosophy of educational questions .

		A good bibliography is given at the close of each chapter , so that the reader may pursue any topic further if he chooses .

		It would be well if such writers as Dr.
A. A. Berle	PERSON	could read a book like that of Professor Graves 's before proceeding to instruct parents and teachers regarding the education of their children .

		Dr.
Berle	PERSON	shows in his volume that he has a serious interest in education , and that he is eager to find the most economical and effective ways of training the young mi iid ; but some of the methods he advocates have been condemned by every capable student of educa - tion from
Milton	LOCATION	to our own day .

		I n reading `` The
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 357 School in the Home , '' one is constantly asking oneself whether Dr.
Berle	PERSON	could be familiar with the views of
Locke	PERSON	or
Rousseau	PERSON	or Spencer .

		Some parts of his book are strikingly like
Rousseau	PERSON	's `` Emile . ''

		Rousseau thought that the young would be intellectually and morally maimed if they should be put under teachers before the beginning of their teens , and Dr.
Berle	PERSON	appears to hold the same opinion .

		He is even more extreme in his condemnation of teachers and schools than was
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		He says , for instance , -LRB- p. 56 -RRB- : '' Almost all the so-called horrors of the adolescent period show conclusively that the natural processes of childhood have become perverted by what we call ' education , ' and the whole miserable muddle in which civilization finds itself on the sex question is almost directly due to this artificial and obfuscating interference , together with inability and ignor - ance in properly fertilizing the child mind on the significance of knowledge , which it is not only perfectly capable of receiv - ing but which having , it will automatically apply . ''

		In his chapter on `` Language , the Instrument of Knowledge , '' Dr.
Berle	PERSON	says that children ought to learn words before they can understand them , they ought to master long and difficult words .

		He main - tains that for a young child to repeat fifty lines of Virgil or an entire Hebrew psalm , even though he does not understand a word of what he recites , creates `` traditions and mind stuff . ''

		It has taken three or four hundred years of constant pounding to drive that notion out of the heads of mechanical teachers .

		It is a very old trick to teach children to pronounce words which they do not understand .

		It is in no sense a discovery .

		But every educational writer from
Milton	LOCATION	down has condemned the practice as wasteful , and as inimical to sound intellectual development .

		Dr.
Berle	PERSON	maintains that the learning of foreign lan - guages has always been the chief means of building intellect ; but strange to say he does not appreciate that the people who developed the language he praises most highly for this purpose learned no other tongue than their own .

		Everything he says about the value of linguistic learning has been said hundreds of times in the past , and most of what he claims for it has been shown to be fundamentally unsound .

		Certain of his chapters , for instance those on `` Questions and An - swers , '' ' `` The Elimination of Waste , '' `` Harnessing the Imagination , '' and `` Mental Self-Organization , '' contain much that is interesting and sound , presented in a picturesque and dynamic style ; but it has all been acknowledged by educators for centuries , though of course it is not all practised by teachers .

		The problem of modern education is not to get newer and sounder theories about education , but to get those that are already universally accepted wrought out into practice under the conditions which exist in a country where there is free and compulsory education for at least eight years of every child 's life .

		This problem writ - ers like Dr.
Berle	PERSON	seem to shy off from most carefully .

		Throughout the world teachers seem to be gaining the conception that the school is a social institution .

		We hear it said on all sides now that the chief prob - lem of education is to socialize the individual , and that the chief concern of modern society is to develop the school as the institution best adapted to conserve and promote its ideals .

		Professor
King	PERSON	's '' Social Aspects of Education '' is designed to bring together some of the more important literature relating to the social aspects of education , and the methods of training the individual for social adjustment .

		It is a rather novel plan to have a source-book of literature , all of which has been written within the past few years , and some of which has come very recently from the press ; but the plan commends itself from one stand - point , at least , in that many persons who are interested in social pr & blems , particularly as such problems relate to the school , have been heretofore unable to gain access to the mass of valuable litera - ture scattered through various books and magazines .

		But brought together in this form , it is easily ac - cessible , and enables the reader to gain a fair con - ception of the trend of modern thought regarding the attitude of society toward the school , and the curriculum and methods of teaching in relation to the development of the child as a social being .

		The first half of the book treats such questions as the social origin of educational agencies , the social responsibility of the school , the relations of the home and the school , the school as a social centre , the need of continuation schools , playgrounds , school gardens , industrial and vocational education , the duty of the school to promote social progress and social reform .

		The second half treats of the internal social aspects of education , including the spontaneous social life of children , social life of the school , social aspects of mental development , and the social aspect of the learning process .

		While it may seem to some readers that the scope of social education as presented in this book is too broad , in - cluding too many relations of the school to society , and too many of the activities of teaching ; still it appears to the present reviewer that it is possible and profitable to view all the relations and activities of the school from the social standpoint .

		At the end of each chapter a number of problems are proposed for discussion , and there is a bibliography which covers all the more important book and magazine literature relating to the particular topics considered .

		The book as a whole ought to be very acceptable to teachers , and to others who have a serious interest in the trend of modern educational development toward making the school the centre of social life , and the chief means of promoting social ideals and securing social progress .

		There is a current tendency among teachers to read only such educational literature as relates spe - cifically to definite problems concerning studies , methods of teaching , or plans of organization and managing a school .

		Formerly teachers were expected to read something concerning the philosophy of edu - cation ; but now many of them fail to acquire the larger view of the nature of the educational process , and its function in the social organism and in the development of the individual .

		In these days people are interested primarily in the results of experimen - tation in education .

		They hanker after facts that have been carefully observed or worked out experi - 358 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, mentally .

		They like the biological , psychological , and sociological methods of discussing educational questions ; and practically all modern educational books that make a strong appeal to American teachers are written from one or another , or from all , of these standpoints .

		But Professor
John A. MacVannel	PERSON	has resisted the prevailing fashion , and has put forth a book written from the philosophical point of view .

		His purpose is to deal with the sub - ject of education in its largest aspects .

		His work does not pretend to be a conmbution to the science of education , or to the art of teaching .

		What it does aim at is to make the serious student of education see what the educative process is in relation to the whole range of human life and activities .

		The book comprises the lectures which Professor
MacVannel	PERSON	has been giving to his students in
Teachers College	ORGANIZATION	,
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	.

		One can not doubt that for ad - vanced students the point of view taken is exceedingly helpful ; but it would not be possible for a novice to get anything out of the book , simply because it deals with the largest conceptions regarding education , and these conceptions can not be grasped until one has come widely and intimately into contact with the concrete aspects of education , and until one has made some progress in organizing the phenomena of society in order to gain certain fundamental notions regard - ing its nature , its aims , and the conditions essential for its perpetuity and prosperity .

		Throughout the book runs the conception that the supreme purpose of education is to help the individual in attaining proper adaptation to his social and physical environ - ments .

		In human life the long period of infancy makes it necessary that there should be some guid - ance of the individual in the adaptive process .

		If there were no period of infancy , there would be no education , because the individual could not adapt himself progressively to his environments ; but with a long period of infancy , education is not only possible but it is imperative . ''

		The doctrine of evolution is accepted , and is made the basis for the presupposi - tions and implications of education .

		The treatment throughout is in accord with contemporary thought , not only philosophical , but also biological , sociolog - ical , and psychological .

		He who has completed the reading of this book feels that he has gained a view of education which enables him to see its relation to the sum total of human activities , and the role it plays or should play , in shaping the life of the indi - vidual and of the social organism .

		American educational theory and practice are being based ever more largely upon accurate psy - chological observation and experimentation .

		Many of the processes of the schoolroom are now being subjected to laboratory tests in the effort to discover how the child learns most economically and effec - tively .

		`` The Learning Process , '' by Professor Col - vin , sums up effectively the results of experimental studies which have been made at home and abroad on the learning processes .

		The point of view of the book is in line with modern psychological writing in
America	LOCATION	; that is to say , it is based on the bio - logical and functional view of the mind .

		In an ear - lier day psychologists discussed mental processes as though they occurred without reference to tin - nreil.s of adjustment to the world in which the individual lived ; but this method of treating psychology is being abandoned in
America	LOCATION	.

		This is particularly true of psychologists who are interested in educa - tion , and who are writing for the purpose of deter - mining educational theory and practice .

		Professor Cul \ in 's book is throughout based on the conception that the purpose of mental activity is to secure ad - justment .

		The way in which the mental functions occur , and the combinations among them , are deter - mined by the purpose or end to be attained in the process of adjustment .

		This is the point of view which will be of service to the teacher , because he is always concerned with a reacting being .

		Tin - teacher , as such , can not have much interest in a static psychology which treats sensation , perception .

		memory , reason , and the like , as formal processes unrelated to behavior .

		The teacher is interested in shaping his children 's conduct or adjustment ; and in order to be of help to him any discussion of the learning processes must deal with the child 's responses to stimulations .

		It really makes no difference what happens within only as this deter - mines behavior .

		One might easily develop a psy - chology of conduct , adequate for the teacher 's needs , without saying anything about sensation , perception , and the like .

		While Professor
Colvin	PERSON	's book is writ - ten from the functional standpoint , and while he con - stantly interprets psychological processes with respect to the needs of the teacher , still his treatment is to a certain extent formal and logical , iu that he does not start from the viewpoint of the novice in discussing the learning processes , but rather from that of one who has reached large generalizations , and who has classified all the mental functions .

		A novice will not be interested in sensation , say , at the beginning of an inquiry into the learning process .

		He will not be interested in reflex action or instinct .

		He might , in an analysis of the learning process , finally reach the most elementary processes , but he ought to arrive at them last rather than first in his study of the methods of learning .

		If Professor
Colvin	PERSON	had in his own book followed the method which he ex - pounds so effectively , he would have put sensation , reflex action , and instinct as the last topics in his book rather than as the first .

		The chief value of thin volume lies in the fact that it sums up authoritatively a great deal of experimentation on the various pro- cesses involved in the learning of different sorts of material , and makes educational interpretations of the conclusions reached from those experiment .

		There are no educational doctrines presented in the book that may not be found in educational writings familiar to American teachers of educational theory , though most other writers have deduced their principles from their observation and experience rather than from accurate psychological experimentation .

		It may safely be said that any teacher who becomes familiar
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 359 with the contents of this book will have gained in an agreeable form the best that has been accomplished up to date in the experimental study of the learning process .

		This does not mean that one can endorse every interpretation of experimental data made by Professor
Colvin	PERSON	; but still the present reviewer has found very little that he would take exception to ; and he considers that the book , as a whole , is thoroughly sound , and that it ought to prove of distinct service in solidifying American educational theory .

		Professor
Strayer	PERSON	's `` A Brief Course in the Teaching Process '' is written from the same general standpoint as Professor
Colvin	PERSON	's book , although the method of treatment is altogether different .

		Pro- fessor Stray er regards adjustment as the end of teaching .

		He considers that for economy and effi - ciency in learning , the pupil must have a motive before him in all that he does , a purpose , or an end to attain .

		This is entirely in accord with Pro- fessor
Colvin	PERSON	's point of view , and with modern American psychology .

		Professor
Strayer	PERSON	discusses , first , the end of education ; then the factors condi - tioning the teaching process ; and then the teaching process itself .

		Not until he reaches his fourth chapter does he come to the problem which would constitute a motive for the novice to study the teaching process , namely , to learn how to conduct a lesson so that pupils would get the points to be presented , retain them , and be able to utilize them .

		To the mind of the reviewer , it would be more effective in discussing practical problems of teaching to strike at once at actual , concrete , every-day situa - tions , and work out principles and generalizations therefrom .

		The large conceptions ought to come last and not first in any psychological method of presentation of material to a novice ; and presum - ably the persons for whom this book is designed are not familiar with the principles of teaching .

		The strongest phase of Professor
Strayer	PERSON	's book is to be found in the excellent questions , problems , and exercises given at the end of each chapter .

		These are , for the most part , vital and intensely interesting ; and they illustrate the principle enunciated above , that the proper thing to do is to drive straight at actual , every-day problems , requiring the pupil to deal with them and to get his principles out of them .

		The questions and problems in Professor
Strayer	PERSON	's book are more concrete and vital than the text .

		The chapters are very brief , necessitating a rather abstract and monotonous method of treatment .

		The principles all seem to be sound and of worth , but they are not presented in as stimulating and attention - catching a manner as they might be .

		There is too great a tendency for classification in the text to suit the taste of the present reviewer , and occasionally one finds a problem which suggests the same tendency .

		But on the whole , the book exhibits a sane interest in concrete , effective teaching , and no teacher can go through it and get its point of view , and espe - cially work out the problems , without being helped immensely thereby .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The decline of That republicanism , after serving a republicanism distinctly useful purpose in the lib - in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		eralizing of the modern European world , has virtually completed its work and is at present clearly on the wane , is the interesting and well-sustained thesis of Mr.
H. A. L. Fisher	PERSON	's volume , `` The Republican Tradition in
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		With some slight emendations , this book comprises a course of lectures delivered by Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	before the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	early in
1910	DATE	.

		It does not purport to be history , but rather a com - mentary upon history .

		Inasmuch , however , as no one save the Spanish publicist ,
Emilio Castelar	PERSON	, has at any time undertaken a systematic history of European republicanism -LRB- and he with indifferent success -RRB- , there is clearly a place for even so meagre an out - line as that which Mr.
Fisher	PERSON	gives .

		Starting from the collapse of republicanism with the rise of the
Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	, the author undertakes to outline against the predominantly monarchical background of mediaeval and modern
Europe	LOCATION	the survivals and revivals of the republican spirit , through successive stages marked especially by the sporadic Italian re - publics of the twelfth , thirteenth , and fourteenth centuries ; the rise of the Dutch republic ; English experiments with republicanism in the era of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	and Protectorate ; the first French republic , with its brood of tributary republics of the earlier Napoleonic period ; the second and third republics in
France	LOCATION	; the republican movements in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	at the middle of the past cen - tury ; and the failure of the republican regime in
Spain	LOCATION	during the seventies .

		The republican move - ment in
Europe	LOCATION	, in the author 's opinion , reached its height in
1848	DATE	.

		The creation of the third republic in
France	LOCATION	, in
1870-75	DATE	, took place under conditions such that the political atmosphere of even the adja - cent portions of
Europe	LOCATION	was not perceptibly affected .

		The recent substitution of republicanism for mon - archy in
Portugal	LOCATION	occasioned a mild stir in
Spain	LOCATION	, but nothing more .

		Aside from
France	LOCATION	and
Portu	PERSON	- gal ,
Switzerland	LOCATION	alone among European states main - tains a republican form of government , and the influence of Swiss political ideas is not large .

		In
1905	DATE	the Norwegians were in a position to establish a republic had they cared to do so ; but the repub - lican programme never enlisted many adherents .

		Throughout
Europe	LOCATION	as a whole , and especially Teu - tonic , Scandinavian , and
Slavic Europe	LOCATION	, monarchy , of the enlightened and constitutional type , is firmly entrenched .

		To this situation a variety of circum - stances have contributed , to mention but two , the improved personnel of present-day rulers as compared with many of their predecessors of two or three gen - erations ago , and the growth of imperialism and of a world policy which seems to require the personal leadership of monarchs .

		The most fundamental stronghold of enlightened monarchy to-day , how - ever , appears clearly to be the growing recognition of the fact that the precise form assumed by the THE DIAL , -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, executive in a government is no measure of the amount of political and civil liberty which a people may enjoy under that government , that , in con - junction with parliamentary institutions , responsible ministers , and a broad franchise , the institution of monarchy may easily contribute to , rather than detract from , the real interests of liberalism and progress .

		Problem , of th < Dr - J - Adam8 Paffer > in his excellent voungineitv book on `` The Boy and his Gang '' ami country .

		-LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , discusses a subject that not many people a few years ago would have regarded as even worthy of investigation .

		It has always been known that there were boys ' gangs ; but they were explained as being the natural outgrowth of original sin , and so dismissed without further inquiry .

		But now comes a writer , who , in a concrete and dynamic way , discusses the boy and his general problems ; the nature of the gang , and the way in which it is organized ; the activities of the gang , including group games , stealing , hectoring people , truancy , fighting , and the like .

		Then he goes on to consider the an - thropology and psychology of the gang ; the control of primitive and predatory impulses ; the love of adven - ture and of truancy ; the virtues of the gang ; the gang in constructive social work ; the gang in the school ; and the like .

		This book should arouse an in - terest among people who know boys , who would like to help them to develop in a wholesome way , and who appreciate the tremendous problems arising out of the rapid development of urban life in
America	LOCATION	.

		No civilization has yet solved the problem of city life , mainly because no civilization has been able to con - trol the disastrous influences exerted upon the young , mainly the boys , who have to grow up in the streets of the city .

		The gang is a product of urban civili - zation which takes little or no account of the needs of immature as contrasted with mature individuals .

		The experience of older civilizations has taught us that the thing of primary importance in any city is to make provision for the proper activities of the young , so that their energies may not be turned into evil channels .

		The reading of this book by Dr.
Puffer	PERSON	should be of distinct service to those who have anything to do with developing boys , or determining the conditions under which they must live in cities .

		Of course , the country boy has his problems too , and the country girl as well .

		We have perhaps assumed too much in regard to the opportunities of the coun - try for the proper occupation and development of the young .

		Professor
William A. McKeever	PERSON	's `` Farm Boys and Girls '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- should be of as great interest and importance to men and women in rural life as Dr.
Puffer	PERSON	's book should be to people in the city .

		Professor
McKeever	PERSON	discusses many aspects of rural life in relation to the occupation and training of the young , such as juvenile literature in the farm home , the rural church and young people , the making of a new rural school , the country mother and the children , the country Young Men 's Christian Associ - ation , the work which should be done by the country boy and the country girl , the farmer and his wife as leaders of the young , the social training of boys and girls in the country , the business training of the boy and the girl , and the choice of vocation for both the boy and the girl .

		The discussion of these various topics appears to be sound , and based on first-hand acquaintance with actual conditions .

		Minor Enoiith m * nor seventeenth century En - pottt of the glish poets offer , one would think , ex - t ; th centurv .

		ceptional opportunities to editor and commentator .

		The title of Mr.
Carl Holliday	PERSON	's book , `` The Cavalier Poets : Their Lives , their Day , and their Poetry '' -LRB- Neale -RRB- , sounds attractive , and the volume looks inviting ; but its contents are dis - appointing , for only 130 of its 300 pages are given to selections from a bare score of poets , and the special chapters on the ten more important of these men are not nearly as satisfying as more selections would have been .

		A book of this kind should justify itself either by special fulness of selection , or by the character and quality of its critical comment .

		Only four of the poets represented here are missing from the second volume of
Ward	PERSON	's `` English Poets '' ; and for the other seventeen ,
Ward	ORGANIZATION	has 136 poems against the 104 given here .

		In one or two instances , Mr.
Holliday	PERSON	's book improves on Ward : it includes Her - bert 's `` Sweet day , so cool , so calm , so bright , '' and
Waller	PERSON	's `` When we for age could neither read nor write , `` and has a better as well as a slightly fuller selec - tion from
Lovelace	LOCATION	.

		On the other hand , it omits
Carew	PERSON	's `` He that loves a rosy cheek '' and Her - rick 's `` Litany '' ; and at the end of the selections from
Herrick	PERSON	there was blank space enough to print '' Fair pledges of a fruitful tree , '' and either `` Here a little child I stand '' or `` In this little urn is laid . ''

		Moreover ,
Denham	PERSON	,
Randolph	PERSON	,
Cleveland	LOCATION	, and
Butler	PERSON	would seem to demand some mention among the `` Cavalier '' poets , even if Benlowes , and
Shakerley Marmion	PERSON	, and
Patrick Hannay	PERSON	, and
Chamberlayne	LOCATION	, and
Philip Ayres	PERSON	, and a dozen others are to be omitted .

		The editor 's comments are disappointing , for in spite of a manner which reminds one faintly of that critic in whom chiefly the Tory spirit is now incarnate , they are neither especially acute nor particularly informed .

		For example , he says of
Waller	PERSON	's '' Last Verses '' only this : `` Here we may see how closely the poet has approached the couplet form , soon to be used so successfully in the ` classical ' period . ''

		In the list of `` Works by the Cavalier Poets '' there should have been noted :
J. M. Berdan	PERSON	's edition of
Cleveland	LOCATION	;
G. H. Palmer	PERSON	's edition of
Herbert	LOCATION	; the
1702	DATE	edition of

		A light-hearted attitude is betrayed in the words of the Preface , to the effect that when the interpreter has done his best , or worst , with the alle - gory , this last `` is in no more parlous state than it was before . ''

		One does not specially care for such a tone in the serious study of literature ; but at all events we can see how times have changed in this country since the days when the first of American scholars in English ,
Francis J. Child	PERSON	, allowed himself to say that his purpose in his '' Observations '' on the `` Faerie Queene '' had been `` to give a very general view of the allegory '' even in Book I. `` and not to pursue , into any minuteness of detail , the parallel between what is told and what is meant . ''

		Examples of Couched in modern phraseology , humor from dashed with an occasional colloquial - manv lands .

		igm -LRB- w hi cn is a more polite term than `` sjang '' -RRB- , and making free use of allusions which would have meant nothing twenty or even ten years ago , Mr.
Charles Johnston	PERSON	's illustrative -LRB- and also illustrated -RRB- review of the humor of the world from the most ancient times is something very different from a jest-book , as the term is commonly understood .

		A rapid survey of the humor of ancient
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	, of
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, of
Turkey	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and other countries known to us as not un - friendly to mirth , including of course our own jocund republic , yields material , not too hackneyed in fact , agreeably fresh in most instances for a Volume of nearly four hundred pages , entitled '' Why the World Laughs '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It makes clear , not by
Bergson	PERSON	- ian reasoning , but by apt example , why laughing is as easy as lying , if not easier .

		The author 's readers of the fair sex may take umbrage at this sentence from an early page : ``
Japan	LOCATION	contributes to the mirth of the world one of the rarest of all things , a lady humorist . ''

		To be told that one has no sense of hu - mor is a thing unbearable to any man or woman of proper spirit .

		Mr.
Johnston	PERSON	's considerable acquaint - ance with various parts of the world qualifies him to write understandingly on his chosen theme .

		He was born in
Ireland	LOCATION	, educated for the
Bengal	LOCATION	civil service , and spent several years in
India	LOCATION	, whence he returned home as an invalid , and later wandered to this coun - try , of which he became a citizen nine years ago .

		He is a member of the
Royal Asiatic Society	ORGANIZATION	and of the
Irish Society of America	ORGANIZATION	.

		Naturally his chapter on Hibernian humor is among the best and most original in the book .

		A dozen good pictures are contributed by Mr.
Peter Newell	PERSON	and other artists .

		Renaissance architecture in
France	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
W. H. Ward	PERSON	's `` Architecture of the Renaissance in
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- will be welcomed alike by architects and by lovers of the fine arts .

		Until now , no work dealing exhaustively with the whole subject has ap - peared in English or even in French , says the author ; the student has been restricted to the necessarily scanty accounts of the style in the general histories of architecture .

		A more extended treatment was there - fore a desideratum ; and did we need any such justifi - cation of his two handsome octavo volumes , Mr.
Ward	PERSON	might point to the closely-printed index , covering twenty-eight double-columned pages , which reveals the scope of the work as much as the range of his carefully selected illustrations .

		Four hundred and sixty - five altogether , many of them measured draw - ings , and all of them most beautifully printed , they give in themselves a vivid history of French Renais - sance architecture , reproductions of old prints and plans lending a keener interest to the modern sketch or half-tone or brilliant photogravure .

		Nor is the text itself less clear , in spite of its compact array of facts and details ; it is not too technical for the gen - eral student of art .

		Starting with the reign of
Louis XII	ORGANIZATION	.

		and the beginnings of the Italian influ - ence -LRB- to which Mr.
Ward	PERSON	, following Seymiiller , gives full credit -RRB- , the narrative is brought down to
1830	DATE	, when , with the advent of Romanticism and the Gothic revival , the varied but unbroken sequence of Renais - sance styles came to an end or merged into eclec - ticism .

		Eight chapters , each prefaced by a brief historical introduction , discuss these various styles ; the division of the subject by reigns being adopted for its utility , and because it is the best classification in a country wherein the court exerted a dominant influence on the evolution of design .

		tea THE DIAL -LSB-
May 1	DATE	, Thought * on Huxley has rendered no trifling service to the educational
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		wor id by collecting , in a volume of some 300 pages , almost as many -LRB- 240 -RRB- excerpts , entitled `` Thoughts on Education from Matthew Arnold '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book owed its incep - tion , '' and not its inception only , but a host of prac - tical suggestions , '' to Mr.
Theodore Reunert	PERSON	of the
Johannesburg Council of Education	ORGANIZATION	; but it reveals the care and taste of the editor in every part .

		Un - like his distinguished father ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	did not succeed in evolving his general theory of culture and education from an experience partly gained by thorough investigation in a special field of human knowledge ; for his survey of instruction upon the Continent did not pierce deeply enough into histor - ical origins to be accounted a form of research ; in fact , as his essay `` On Translating Homer '' shows , the son on occasion had no particular sympathy with detailed scholarly procedure .

		As they were travelling together in a railway carriage ,
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	observed a pile of books at
Arnold	LOCATION	's side .

		`` These , '' said
Matthew	PERSON	, with a gay air , `` are Celtic books which they send me .

		Because I have written on Celtic literature , they fancy I must know some - thing of the language . '' ''

		His ideas , '' added
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, in relating the incident , '' had been formed by a few weeks at a Welsh watering-place . ''

		His duties as Inspector of Schools , however , afforded him a wide acquaintance with contemporary methods of instruc - tion in
England	LOCATION	, and in
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	; and he brought to the solution of educational problems the native insight and sympathy of a poet , together with a large measure of refined common sense .

		The present volume makes good reading .

		The qualities of lucidity and proportion which characterize his lit - erary essays are not absent from the reports which Arnold made to various commissioners .

		Accord - ingly , if we are not ready to challenge the admission of so much material from the more popular works , we gladly welcome the many passages from less accessible sources , which , but for this interesting col - lection , probably never would have met our eyes .

		``
Turkey	LOCATION	and Its People , '' by Sir
Edwin Pears	PERSON	, may be unhesitatingly recommended to readers desiring a serious , trustworthy , and well-written treatment of the subjects naturally implied in such a title .

		The author has published a number of historical books and many scholarly articles , but is probably best known to the general public for his stirring contribu - tions to the
London	LOCATION	' Daily News '' on the Moslem atrocities in
Bulgaria	LOCATION	during
1876	DATE	.

		By these letters he kindled a flame of indignation against
Turkey	LOCATION	that swept over the whole of the
Western	LOCATION	world .

		Re - calling the date of these events , and realizing that in the interval the distinguished writer has been adding knowledge to knowledge and judgment to judgment , one looks for an admirable treatise in the present work , and is not disappointed .

		In fact , the volume proves a constant source of pleasure .

		Perhaps from Sir
Edwin	PERSON	's legal training , perhaps from natural fit - ness , he can give both sides of a case with singular fairness , and can decry a particular fault without condemning a whole nation .

		These qualities are noticeable through all the four hundred pages , but are especially prominent in the illuminating final chapter , which deals with `` Signs of Improvement in
Turkey	LOCATION	. ''

		Misprints are rare ; but on page 288 we are confronted with thirty cans of ''
Kerosim	PERSON	- '' ; and on page 11 , `` incapable '' raises the question whether it ought not to be '' capable . ''

		The type is easily legi - ble , and there is a serviceable index .

		There should be a good map ; and its omission from such a work is a serious defect .

George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Having already told us in a previous : * < > f the
Royal North-West Mounted Police	ORGANIZATION	of
Canada	LOCATION	, Mr.
A. L. Haydon	PERSON	now gives us an excellent account of `` The Trooper Police of
Australia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		In spite of differences in details , the two forces have in com - mon an exceptional efficiency , a wide range of duties , and a brave record of adventurous deeds .

		In Aus - tralia each
State	ORGANIZATION	has its own force , which in turn is divided into foot and mounted police .

		Only the latter are considered by Mr.
Haydon	PERSON	, but he does more than merely chronicle the exploits of his heroes .

		His volume contains a brief narrative of the history of the Australian colonies ; and much of the social his - tory of the times may be read in the record of the police force .

		The first body was established in
1825	DATE	in
New South Wales	LOCATION	; and on this force , as it de - veloped , the other troops were modelled .

		Five chap - ters telling of the work of the police during the bush - ranging days are filled with exciting incident .

		Other chapters describe the rush for gold , the police ex - plorations , the problem of the aborigines , and the work of the Mark trackers .

		The police work in each of the
Continental States	ORGANIZATION	and in the Northern Ter - ritory is treated in special chapters , from which may be gathered some idea of the manifold duties of these highly-trained , centrally-administered forces , and some idea also of the magnificent distances over which they operate on one case a Western Aus - tralian trooper rode 1700 miles during six months .

		The volume contains fifty-one excellent illustrations and three maps .

Frederik	PERSON	_ , TT __ .

		Van
Krdrii	PERSON	- `` Happy Humanity -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- who question the ap - propriateness of the title will not , on that account , lose any of the enjoyment of an unusually interest - ing autobiography .

		Favored by heredity and early opportunity , Dr.
Van Eeden	PERSON	's scientific aptitude introduced him to the world of nature , even before his poetical talent turned his interest to the dra - matic struggle for human happiness .

		He was a successful dramatist before completing his medical studies .

		With a colleague he established the first '' hypnotic '' clinic at
Amsterdam	LOCATION	, and practised successfully the cure of mental ills that block the way to happiness .

		The story of his literary diffi - A Au of a Dutch idealitt .

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 363 culties with his antagonistic colleagues -LRB- whom he beguiled into praising a work of his own , submitted under a false name -RRB- must be read in the full to secure its flavor .

		The same impulse that made the acceptance of medical fees distasteful , and the earn - ing of a living by one 's pen injurious to high ideals , turned Van Eeden more and more to the career of social reformer ; and a discussion of social coopera - tive projects occupies the larger part , of the book .

		Despite the usual financial failure of these ventures , he maintains his belief in this road to human happiness , and describes his cooperative colony in
North Carolina	LOCATION	as a success .

		Quite apart from the interest in this social experiment and the addresses which set forth its purpose and methods , the volume records the attractive life of a modern idealist .

		Two hand-books Mr ''
Frederic J. Haskin	PERSON	has shown on American himself to be a newspaper writer of government .

		considerable versatility , ranging in topics from insecticides to tyrannicides .

		His series on `` The American Government , '' which appeared in the newspapers last year , has now been collected in book form -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , and proves to be a very good popular treatment of the subject .

		Naturally it lacks the profundity to be found in the more serious treatises , but it contains a good deal of useful infor - mation about the activities of our government which college professors and others will be glad to have in this handy form .

		Not only are the executive , leg - islative , and judicial departments and the various cabinet positions dealt with , but a good deal of infor - mation is given about the actual work of the various bureaus and even the
Pan-American Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		In `` The United States Government '' -LRB- Neale -RRB- , a book of less than half the size of Mr.
Haskin	PERSON	's , Mr.
Victor P. Hammer	PERSON	has dealt with the same general subject , contenting himself , for the most part , with a bare statement of facts regarding the various departments of the government and the cabinet positions .

		The list of persons who have held office in the cabinet will be serviceable to those who are interested in that subject .

		A wide reading by the general public of such books as these two would go far toward raising the standard of intelligence regarding public affairs .

		The legend `` third impression '' on the title-page of Mr.
Edmond Holmes	PERSON	's `` What Is and What Might Be : A Study of Education in General and Elementary Edu - cation in Particular '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	: Constable -RRB- may be taken as an encouraging sign of open-mindedness on the part of those Englishmen who are interested in education and life .

		Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	's work is by no means , as its title might imply , a mere critique of pedagogy in the narrow sense .

		It is , on the contrary , a revolutionary plea for a trans valuation of all West - ern values .

		The author 's criticism of the schools of
Britain	LOCATION	is but a criticism of both English and
Ameri	PERSON	- can life in general that its aim is results , and me - chanical drill and praise of externals and conformity its method .

		As against this he sets an ideal , largely A handbook to the
Berlin	LOCATION	art galleries .

		drawn from Buddhistic inspiration , in which the evocation of individuality is the end sought .

		This may sound fantastic , but when it is remembered that the essence of Buddhism is self-realization as opposed to the externalism of the West , and that even our Western religious teachers are beginning to see that the development of the `` inner life '' of the individual is the necessary antecedent to all true social growth , Mr.
Holmes	PERSON	will perhaps not be considered too far off the track .

		While his chapters on a school in
Utopia	LOCATION	will interest teachers , his book as a whole will appeal to all to whom the inner life is a reality or an aspir - ation , and over whose souls Mammon does not hold undisputed sway .

		Outside of
Italy	LOCATION	, the best place to study Italian art is
Berlin	LOCATION	; also , to study German , Dutch , and Flemish art the best place is
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		Many other cities exhibit greater single masterpieces and larger collec - tions , but no other furnishes us so complete an oppor - tunity to trace the history of art chronologically and comprehensively .

		Therefore the
Berlin	LOCATION	galleries have come to be recognized as the best student gal - leries in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In the five buildings that con - stitute what is known as the museum group , the re-arrangement of the art-collections is so compara - tively recent that the old guide-books are quite out of date .

		Hence , Mr.
David C. Preyer	PERSON	's volume on `` The Art of the
Berlin	LOCATION	Galleries '' -LRB- Page -RRB- is sure of the warm welcome that it deserves .

		It is enter - tainingly and sympathetically written , and its forty - seven illustrations are well chosen and well executed .

		A little more caution on the part of the author , how - ever , would have made the book even better .

		For example , he should not have attributed seven pic - tures to
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	, when only two have the warrant of the best authorities ; he should have avoided re - peating certain traditions which modern inquiry rejects .

		But in general , both in its method and its matter , the book deserves a place in the admirable series of which it forms the twelfth volume '' The Art Galleries of
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Schiller 's ''
Don Carlos	PERSON	'' has been most elaborately edited by Dr.
Frederick W. C. Lieder	PERSON	for the '' Oxford German Series '' of Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	.

		Upwards of three hundred pages of editorial matter accompany the text , considerably outweighing it in volume .

		Mr.
S. E. Forman	PERSON	's '' Advanced Civics '' is one of the best text-books with which we are acquainted , a fact which creates a favorable presumption for his new work , '' The American Republic '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , prepared for somewhat younger students .

		The plan of the two works is the same , although the new one has the advantage of being illustrated .

		As a by-product of the system of exchange profes - sorships between American and German universities , we now have the beginnings of a '' Bibliothek der Amerikanischen Kulturgeschichte , '' under the joint editorship of President
Nicholas Murray Butler	PERSON	and TILE DIAL -LSB-

		The first issues of this series -LRB-
Berlin	LOCATION	:

Washington	LOCATION	, '' in two volumes , and '' Die Amerikanische Literatur , '' being the course of sixteen lectures given by Professor
C. Alpbonso Smith	PERSON	a year ago at
the University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	.

		The series of booklets called '' New Tracts for the Times '' -LRB-
Moffat	PERSON	-RRB- seem to concern themselves mainly with the problems of eugenics .

		We note the receipt of the folio wing issues : `` The Declining Birth - Rate , '' by l > r.
Arthur Newsholme	PERSON	; `` The Method of Race -
Regenera	PERSON	- tion , '' by Dr.
C. W. Saleeby	PERSON	; and `` The Problem of Race-Regeneration , '' by Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	.

		The selection of `` Early English Poems '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , made by Messrs.
Henry S. Pancoast	PERSON	and
John Duncan Spaeth	PERSON	, provides the student with a large amount of material antedating the seventeenth century .

		It sup - plements Mr.
Pancoast	PERSON	's `` Standard English Poems , '' which begins with
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	.

		The selections from Old English are translated , and those from Middle English modernized .

		The demand for Spanish texts seems to be on the increase , and the supply keeps pace with it .

		Messrs.
Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have just published these three volumes : '' La Coja y el Encogido , '' by
Juan Eugenio Hartzenbusch	PERSON	, edited by Dr.
J. Geddes	PERSON	, Jr. ; `` Consuelo , '' by
Adelardo Lopez de Ayala	PERSON	, edited by Dr.
Aurelio M. Espinosa	PERSON	; and a volume of `` Romances Escogidos , '' edited by Dr.
S. Griswold Morley	PERSON	.

		Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's book on '' Shakespeare : His Mind and Art , '' though written nearly forty years ago , when the author was comparatively a very young man , took from the first a high place among works of Shakes - pearean criticism , and repeated editions testify to its soundness and vitality .

		A reprint of the latest edition is now issued by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	under the name of the '' Author 's American and Colonial Edition . ''

		The late
Miss E. F. A. Baumgartner	PERSON	, a Swiss lady living in
England	LOCATION	and devoting herself to many philan - thropic works , amused her old age with the compilation of a birthday book , which is now published by
Messrs. W. Heifer & Sons	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, under the title `` A Medley of Birthdays . ''

		A dace to a page is the rule , and each page gives quotations from one or more famous people who were born upon the day assigned to it It is a good idea , and intelligently carried out .

		The '' Lyrical Ballads '' of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	, reprinted in type facsimile from the original edition of
1798	DATE	, and edited by Dr.
Harold Littledale	PERSON	, is published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	, and is one of the most desirable volumes of the
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	reprints .

		Another new volume in this collection contains '' Hurd 's Letters on Chivalry and Romance '' -LRB- 1757 -RRB- and his '' Third Elizabethan Dia - logue '' -LRB- 1759 -RRB- , edited by Miss
Edith J. Morley	PERSON	.

		Hurd was one of the heralds of the romantic revival in criti - cism , but his work has become wellnigh forgotten .

		During the past year or two a number of texts for class-room use have been contributed by the younger group of American psychologists . ''

		A System of Psy - chology , '' by Professor
Knight Dunlap	PERSON	of Johns Hop - kins
University	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- Scribner -RRB- , is the most recent .

		Like its predecessors , it adds little to the vitality or to the extent of resources available to the instructor .

		It shows independence of treatment and definiteness of view ; yet it lacks the larger grasp of the field of mind and of the conditions of approach thereto set by the student 's own psychology .

		In addition , this text suffers from its cavalier treatment of the views of others , and from a neglect of perspective that transforms a critical defect into a practical obstacle .

		Yet its moderate merits give it a creditable place among books in its field .

		The titles in this instalment are those of books issued in the latter part of
1910	DATE	and the
first half of 1911	DATE	, and are given rather by way of suggestion than unqualified recommendation .

		The list follows the Dewey classification , gives publishers ' names and prices , and contains about six hundred entries .

		It is intended especially for smaller libraries , but could hardly fail to be of service in the order department of any library .

		Recent reactionary movements in
Mexico	LOCATION	have neces - sitated a revision of the numerous books on that country published during the past twenty years .

		The first of these revised surveys to appear is Mr.
N. O. Winter	PERSON	's ``
Mexico	LOCATION	and her People of To-day '' -LRB-
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , originally published in
1907	DATE	.

		To the matter in the orig - inal edition the author has added a very conservative account of the passing of the
Diaz	PERSON	regime , together with chapters on a hitherto neglected region in and beyond the
Sierras	LOCATION	; and the entire book has been reused to bring it into accord with present conditions .

		Its wealth of illustrations has been considerably increased ; and altogether it now forms an admirable survey of an ex - ceedingly interesting country .

		The author is wisely reticent upon the political future of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		`` The Education of Self '' -LRB-
Funk & Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a new translation of Dr.
Paul Dubois	PERSON	's book formerly issued under the title , '' Self Control and How to Secure It . ''

		The work has no high intrinsic merit of special appeal to English readers to justify this reissue .

		It is a readable but discursive survey of the moral grounds of self-control , and the attitudes through which it may be facilitated .

		It is far inferior to
Payot	ORGANIZATION	's '' Education of the Will , '' with which it invites comparison .

		Works of this kind are conditioned by subtle relations of author and public that make the vernacular address and range of illustrations much more effective than the transferred medium of an alien mental environment .

		In the present instance the original is a creditable but not a notable contribution .

		There has been much speculation as to the authorship of '' The Autobiography of an Elderly Woman '' which was published anonymously by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	last autumn .

		The publishers have just announced that the author is Mrs.

		Dr.

		He was born at
Clifton	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	,
Sept. 10 , 1839	DATE	, and was educated at
Wittenberg College	ORGANIZATION	, where also he took his course in theology .

		From
1867	DATE	to 1872 he held various pastorates in the Lutheran church , but in
1876	DATE	gave up the cure of souls for the publishing of books .

		The other member of the now well-known partnership , Mr.
A. W. Wagnalls	PERSON	, joined him in
1878	DATE	, and under Dr.
Funk	PERSON	's editorship the house erelong be - came prominent as the originator of the '' Jewish En - cyclopsedia , '' '' The Voice , '' '' The Homiletic Review , '' '' The Missionary Review , '' '' The Literary Digest , '' and , foremost of all , '' The Standard Dictionary . ''

		Dr.
Funk	PERSON	did a great deal of useful work as editor , author , and publisher .

		His own writings include '' The Next Step in Evolution , '' `` The Widow 's Mite and Other Psychic Phenomena , '' and '' The Psychic Riddle . ''

		Sir
Charles Dilke	PERSON	's forthcoming biography should be one of the most interesting works of its kind - when it appears , which may not be for some time , as the announce - ment is just made that publication will be postponed until after Mr.
Joseph Chamberlain	PERSON	shall himself have become a fit subject for a complete biography .

		In other words , the life and letters of Sir
Charles	PERSON	, now in prepar - ation , will contain correspondence , said to be voluminous and piquant , between Sir
Charles	PERSON	and Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	, as also between Sir
Charles	PERSON	and Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, which it is deemed inadvisable to publish within the lifetime of any one of the persons concerned .

		Announcement has been made at the

		books already issued by the
Riccardi Press	ORGANIZATION	are sufficient to show that the best oj our printers have a serious rival in this new enterprise .

		Mr.
Home	PERSON	's type is one of extraordinary brilliance and legibility ... There is no doubt that this fount of type is one of the best ever cut ; and we congratulate designer , engraver , and publisher on a notable achievement ... We have nothing but praise for paper , ink , composition , and presswork ... We have so often spoken of the merits of the Medici process , by which Mr.
Flint	PERSON	* s water-colours have been reproduced , that it is needless to repeat our praise of the results obtained ... The handling of this book brings to mind forcibly the pious remark of Dr.
Butler	PERSON	, rtcorded by
Izaak Walton	PERSON	in his '' Compleat Angler , '' on the strawberry .

		There might conceivably have been a more perfect book of its kind doubtless ; but doubtless there never has been one ... A wonderfully complete piece of work , wfach will be a pure joy to any into whose hands it may fall ... The
Riccardi Press	ORGANIZATION	books stand on our shelves beside the
Doves Press	ORGANIZATION	books and those of the
Kelmscott Press	ORGANIZATION	each of them with its own peculiar beauty emphasized by that of its fellows .

		THE DIAL 381 Cartoon by
Davenport	PERSON	made at the time
Geer	PERSON	ivas elected Governor .

		Fifty Years in
Oregon	LOCATION	By Governor
T. T. GEER	PERSON	TN this book Mr.
Geer	PERSON	, formerly Governor of J -
Oregon	LOCATION	, and one of her notable figures , gives the wonderful story of that
State	ORGANIZATION	in rapidly moving pictures , in pictures of the experiences of the pioneer , of forceful men , of brave women , of abundant land , of picturesque scenery .

		He stretches before us a panorama of
Oregon	LOCATION	from the early
' 40	DATE	's to the pres - ent time .

		And a marvelously interesting panorama it is , exquisite in color , clear in detail , wonderful in variety and extent , glowing in the forces that produce prosperity .

		Mr.
Geer	PERSON	's style is inimitable .

		The personality , the genial , wholesome , delight - ful personality of the man , is in every line that he writes .

		Whether discussing the expedition of
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	, or
Jefferson	PERSON	's diplomatic somersault in connection with the
Louisiana	LOCATION	purchase , or the religious denominations that strove for supremacy in the new territory , or the building of schools and colleges , or births , marriages , and deaths , the man behind the pen illumines his work with much heartiness and sym - pathy .

		Under his touch the most trivial subject becomes interesting .

		Out of a life full of interesting experiences and of that warm contact with his fellow-man that is known only to the pioneer , he intersperses his narrative with enough wit , humor , wisdom , phil - osophy , and anecdote to beguile the most blase person into wishing to while away many a moment under his friendly and optimistic influence .

		Pittsburgh Post : '' If all histories were written in as con - versational a style as ex-Governor
Geer	PERSON	has written ' Fifty Years in
Oregon	LOCATION	, ' there would be more history read .

		Mr.
Geer	PERSON	does not claim that his book is strictly an historical document .

		Rather does it consist of a series of reminiscences .

		Yet in these reminis - cences may be found practically all the lead - ing historical events which have transpired in
Oregon	LOCATION	during the
last half century	DATE	.

		There is also a graphic description of the early days in
Oregon	LOCATION	, those days long before Mr.
Geer	PERSON	's time , when the country was being settled by the whites . ''

		Oregon was settled by people who went there to establish homes and not by such adventurers as went by the thousands to
California	LOCATION	, ' to settle down there because they could n't settle up where they came from . '

		Yet the very heterogeneousness of its early population provided
California	LOCATION	with material for merchants , bankers , sailors , steamboat men , miners , farmers , stock - raisers , etc. , while
Oregon	LOCATION	, on the other hand , was retarded in growth because nearly all its early population was of one class .

		But while the early growth of
Oregon	LOCATION	was slow in comparison with the brilliant progress of
California	LOCATION	this is now proving an advantage to the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		This entire book is interesting , even the portions dealing with political events -LRB- and there are many such -RRB- being irradiated with the author 's genial style and optimism . ''

		403 THE
BROWNING	PERSON	CENTENARY .

		The centenary of
Kobert Browning	PERSON	's birth has come upon us almost unawares , for it seems only yesterday that he was alive , a help and an inspiration , sound of faculty , and still answer - ing to
Lander	ORGANIZATION	's description written in
Florence	LOCATION	as long ago as
1846	DATE	: '' Since Chaucer was alive and hale , No man hath walk 'd along our roads with step So active , so inquiring eye , or tongue So varied in discourse . ''

		And as we think of that powerful personality , so recently a real presence among us , we are impelled to echo the question put by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	concerning the spirit of his father : '' O strong soul , by what shore Tarriest thou now ?

		For that force , Surely , has not been left vain !

		Somewhere , surely , afar , In the sounding labor-house vast Of being , is practised that strength , Zealous , beneficent , firm ! ''

		If there be in the cosmic scheme such a thing as the conservation of spiritual energy , the heat and light which had their source in
Browning	LOCATION	's brain must be forces with which the world will long have to reckon .

		And yet how ruthlessly the products of a man 's intellect are consigned to the rubbish-heap after his body is laid in the grave !

		How quickly is the grain winnowed from the chaff , and the precious metal `` cradled '' from the detritus !

		The small volume of selections from
Browning	PERSON	's poems , put forth by his publishers while he was still alive , and sold for a shilling , has for more than a score of years served nearly all our purposes for quota - tion and reference , while several complete editions have stood almost untouched on the neighboring shelves , the dust collecting upon them in eloquent testimony to the vanity of a great poetical ambi - tion .

		Who now is eager to explore , or ever will be again , the secrets of
Red-Cotton-Nightcap Country	ORGANIZATION	, or to read of Pacchiarotto , how he worked in distemper ? ''

		Sordello '' may now and again find a curious investigator -LRB- who will by no means go unrewarded -RRB- , and '' The Ring and the Book '' provide intellectual gymnastics for a few students here and there , or furnish them with material for academic theses upon poetical crafts - manship ; but the vast bulk of
Browning	PERSON	's work THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, has been withdrawn from general circulation , and appeals only to the ever-lessening inner circle of his adepts .

		The shilling volume , however , or some similar anthology , will remain a constant companion of all who love poetry , and they will hold it precious beyond most of the treasures brought back from their various journeyings in the realms of gold .

		We imagine that
Browning	PERSON	's second cente - nary will awaken more interest than his first .

		I f the world cares for poetry at all in the
year 2012	DATE	, it will look back upon the Victorian age much as we now look back upon the Elizabethan , and will realize , more fully than we who have been of it can realize , how fine a flowering of the hu - man spirit it witnessed .

		It will see our poets in better perspective than we can see them , and it will do them more even justice .

		It will be able to envisage
Browning	PERSON	, not as the object of a special cult , and , as such , open to suspicion , but as a great buoyant human figure , having its frail - ties and imperfections , but working with deep insight and whole-souled sympathy at the task of expressing life .

		It will not delude itself with the notion that his rugged style and cacophonous phrasing were the marks of a genius too lofty to be trammelled by the rules of art , nor will it so overestimate his powers of thought as to think they justified his impatience of formal restraint ; it will see that he was not so much an intellectual as an emotional force , and it will recognize as unfortunate the fact that his superb energy was permitted to display itself in so undisciplined a fashion .

		When it compares him with
Tennyson	PERSON	, as it inevitably must , it will see that the elder poet not only outdistanced him in the command of artistic expression but was more than his match in the power of philosophical thought .

		But this is not the occasion for a critical esti - mate of
Browning	LOCATION	, or for invidious comparisons , or for any form of dispraise .

		When a great man 's anniversary comes around , our prevailing impulse is to join in reverent thanksgiving for his services to mankind , and to express our gratitude for his gifts .

		And this poet had a power not possessed by many of his fellow - craftsmen to draw men 's hearts to him , and make them feel that his words were only a heightened form of their common speech .

		He asserted , moreover , with all the emphasis at his command , the validity of passion , which is a more acceptable gospel to average humanity than the precepts of renunciation and asceticism .

		One could always go to him with the assurance of getting counsel that was kindly , sympathetic , and helpful .

		And men will always be grateful to one whose outlook is cheerful , who raises them out of their dej * | xmUnt moods , and who insists in and out of season that ik all 's ri ^ ht with the world , '' however questionable that proposition may actually be .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE PROCEEDS OF THE HOE BOOK-SALES at which parts one , two , and three of the late
Robert Hoe	ORGANIZATION	's splendid collection passed under the auctioneer 's hammer and became the property of the highest hid - den , are now -LRB- at the close of the sale of part three -RRB- found to be more than a million and a half dollars , or , in precise figures ,
$ 1,669,132.75	MONEY	.

		One more part , and perhaps two , will be disposed of next sea - son , these unsold portions including the valuable reference library used by Mr.
Hoe	PERSON	in getting together his vast collection of literary treasures and objects of art As illustrating the more or less whimsical predilections of bibliophiles , some of the prices paid in the last days of the sale recently closed are sig - nificant .

		For example ,
Whitfield	PERSON	's tract , `` The Light Appearing More and More , '' brought five hundred dollars , while an edition of Tasso 's ''
Gerusa	PERSON	- 1 cm me Liberate '' -LRB-
Paris	LOCATION	, 177 1 -RRB- , with plates by Grave - lot , went as an unconsidered trifle for
seventeen dollars	MONEY	and
fifty cents	MONEY	; and even a copy of the first Aldine edition of Terence -LRB-
Venice	LOCATION	, 1517 -RRB- , printed on vellum , and described as `` the only one known , '' failed by nearly two hundred dollars to reach the price paid for the
Whitfield	ORGANIZATION	tract .

		The first edi - tion of Oscar Wilde 's '' Picture of Dorian Gray '' -LRB- a presentation copy -RRB- sold for one hundred dollars ; while Sir
Kenelm Digby	PERSON	's copy of
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	's `` An - nals , '' with Sir
Kenelm	PERSON	's arms and autograph , was knocked down at
fifteen dollars	MONEY	.

		`` EVERYMAN 'S LIBRARY '' AS A TRAVELLING LIBRARY possesses merits that the
Iowa Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	and other committees and individuals have not been slow to recognize .

		The recent issue of a dictionary catalogue of the first five hundred volumes of this admirable as well as inexpensive collection of standard works has greatly facilitated its use for such purposes as that indicated above .

		The books may be bought in reinforced cloth bind - ing , and , with one or more copies of the publishers ' printed catalogue to accompany each set , no more readily serviceable travelling library could be de - vised .

		The smallness and flexibility of the volumes , with their good print and authoritative editorship and prefaces , peculiarly fit them for use in `` t la - people 's university . ''

		Expert assistance has evi - dently been employed by the publishers in preparing their catalogue .

		Miss
Isabella M. Cooper	PERSON	, formerly instructor in the
Iowa Summer Library School	ORGANIZATION	, and now teacher of library science at
Simmons College	ORGANIZATION	, was one of the compilers , and Miss
Margaret A. Me Vety	PERSON	, of the
Newark Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, collaborated with her .

		Study clubs , book clubs , small libr ; i
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 385 and large ones , too , for that matter , might spend their money far less wisely than in purchasing a complete '' Everyman 's Library . ''

		The
Iowa Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, as we started to say , buys the volumes in reinforced bindings and sends them out in the travelling library boxes , with the publishers ' ready - made catalogue , to carry sweetness and light to the rural solitudes .

		THE SHAKESPEAREAN LIBRARY OF A SHAKE - SPEAREAN SCHOLAR , especially rich in the texts and commentaries which the editor of a variorum edition of the poet 's works must have at his elbow , and housed in so substantial a manner as to fear nothing from fire or burglary such is the famous collection got together in half a century of Shakespeare study and editorship by Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	, of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		The room holding this precious de - posit forms a wing of the Furness homestead at Wal - lingford , on the outskirts of the city , and its access from the body of the house is guarded by iron doors concealed in the thickness of the walls , but ready to be drawn out on their wheels and runways at a mo - ment 's notice .

		The walls of the library are of brick and iron , the floor is laid on cement , and a thick layer of asbestos intervenes between the ceiling and the roof .

		These safeguards will not seem excessive when it is remembered that this collection of
Shakespear	PERSON	- eana is probably the second finest in the world , its only rival being the memorial library of the poet 's birthplace .

		Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's long connection , as trustee , with the semi-public library founded by
Franklin	PERSON	-LRB- the Library Company of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	-RRB- speaks for his expert knowledge of the care of such a collection as his own , which is really a museum as well as a library , and is by no means confined in its range of literature to works by or about the
Stratford	LOCATION	poet .

		That it will pass on its owner 's death into hands sure to care for it tenderly will not be doubted by those who know of the younger
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	's cooperation with his father in the completion of the famous variorum edition of Shakespeare designed and begun by the elder scholar .

		BATH 'S TRIBUTE TO
JANE AUSTEN	PERSON	, in the form of a bronze portrait bust in the pump-room , on a richly decorated pedestal of jasper , with an inscription com - memorating the admirable pictures of old Bath life and manners to be found in her novels , is both de - served and appropriate .

		In `` Northanger Abbey '' and '' Persuasion '' the reader gets especially pleasing glimpses of the famous watering-place as it was in
Miss Austen	LOCATION	's day .

		Many will remember the earlier chapters of `` Northanger Abbey '' as containing fre - quent references to the Pump-room -LRB- always capital - ized -RRB- , the Pump-yard , the Upper Rooms , and the Lower Rooms , where all the transitory Bath world of fashion was to be seen .

		In the opening of chapter four , for example , one recalls this passage : `` With more than usual eagerness did
Catherine	PERSON	hasten to the Pump-room the next day , secure within herself of seeing Mr.
Tilney	PERSON	there before the morning was over , and ready to meet him with a smile ; but no smile was demanded , Mr.
Tilney	PERSON	did not appear , '' though everyone else did , in the constant procession of comers and goers , as
Catherine	PERSON	sat and waited near the great clock , after walking the room till she was tired .

		Miss
Austen	PERSON	's bust will henceforth fur - nish an additional motive for visiting the famous Pump-room .

		... A CITY 'S PROPORTION OF LIBRARY-USERS , as com - pared with the total population , is for obvious reasons hard to determine ; but registration and census figures sometimes furnish a little help in making the com - putation .

		Of course every loyal librarian wishes to make the best possible showing in this respect , and for this as well as other reasons the registration sta - tistics may be not quite guiltless of including dor - mant or totally defunct card-holders in the annual summing-up .

		However that may be , it is gratifying to note in the
Leavenworth	LOCATION	Public Library Report for the year
1911	DATE	a registration indicating that about one person in every five of the city 's population holds -LRB- and presumably uses to some extent -RRB- a library card .

		And
Leavenworth	PERSON	's library is only twelve years old , but has in its brief history accumulated nearly twenty thousand volumes , on the strength of a rather meagre annual appropriation for books .

		Going east to Bos - ton and its far-famed public library , we find only about one person in seven drawing books .

		In
Jersey City	LOCATION	the proportion works out , from available figures , as one in four .


Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, furnishes a record seemingly too good to be true , one in three .

		In the South ,
Atlanta	LOCATION	appears to enjoy the possession of a remarkable book-reading population , about one person in every four being a card-holder , unless the figures prevaricate .

		Nearer home ,
Peoria	LOCATION	claims one card-holder to every six inhabitants , which is credit - able and also within the bounds of probability .

		But statistics have long had a bad reputation , and we will not here cultivate their further acquaintance .

		... PAGES FROM THE LIFE OF A WANDERING WORK -
INGMAN	ORGANIZATION	, namely , Mr.
James O. Fagan	PERSON	, well known for his '' Confessions of a Railroad Signalman '' and his '' Labor and the Railroads , '' will constitute a very readable part of `` The Atlantic Monthly '' for some months to come .

		The
May	DATE	number begins this `` Autobiography of an Individualist , '' as the author entitles his life-story , and sees the Scottish youth as far on his wanderings as
South America	LOCATION	, whither he goes in the service of a newly-organized cable company .

		But more interesting than this cable en - terprise is Mr.
Fagan	PERSON	's account of his early educa - tion , religious and secular .

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	, Free
Kirk	PERSON	minister , was the one to take in hand his instruc - tion in godly learning .

		`` One day , coming across the expression , ` The Scarlet Woman , ' I asked Mr.
Brown	PERSON	to explain it to me .

		I remember his answer : ' My boy , at your age curiosity will do you a great deal more harm than enlightenment will do you good .

		Study the
Paradise Lost	ORGANIZATION	and beware of the popular craving for the novels of Dickens . ' ''

		THE BUSIEST PUBLIC LIBRARY IN THE COUNTRY , with reference to the number of volumes circulated from a single building , appears to be that of
Buffalo	LOCATION	.

		The librarian , Mr.
Walter L. Brown	PERSON	, says in his current Report that '' while every department in the
Main Library	ORGANIZATION	has shown a falling off in the number of books circulated , the total is still the largest number of books that is sent out from any library building in the country . ''

		But no unseemly pride is mani - fested by the author of this statement Rather is it felt as a reproach to the prosperous city of
Buffalo	LOCATION	that it should have provided so few branch libraries as to compel most of its book-borrowing citizens to go long distances for their reading matter .

		Outside distributing agencies are being established , so that in the
last three years	DATE	the circulation from the main building has diminished by about one hundred thou - sand volumes , and of this decrease nine-tenths was fiction .

		We learn , in this connection , that the real property of the Jubilee Water System is in process of being converted into cash , one-half of which is to be used in buying a tract of land and erect - ing thereou a building for public library purposes .

		When this is effected there should be jubilation in
Black Rock	LOCATION	, the quarter of the city to receive the benefit of the transaction .

Dumas	PERSON	grandpere , present a rather interesting study in heredity .

		The grandfather , the valiant Mestizo general , born in
San Domingo	LOCATION	of a French father and a native half-breed mother , needed only to have come into the world
twenty years later	DATE	to become one of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's most famous lieutenants .

		Even as it was , he became a brigadier-general before he was thirty , after marvellous exploits not inferior to those of his son 's Three Musketeers .

		His escape from an ambuscade of sixty Tyrolese , thirteen of whom he actually drove to his own camp as prisoners , was an adventure worthy of the father of the gifted romancer .

		A statue of this man who lived his ro - mances instead of writing them is about to be erected in the
Place Malesherbes	LOCATION	,

		KENTUCKY 'S
NEW LIBRARY COMMISSION	ORGANIZATION	has issued its `` First Biennial Report , '' a well-printed , well-illustrated pamphlet of fifty-five pages , present - ing succinctly the history of library organization and library laws in the
Blue-Grass State	ORGANIZATION	, the number and condition of its existing public libraries , the purpose of the commission and its work , with other related matter .

		Statistical tables at the end give a list of thirty-one public libraries , of which thirteen are more or less indebted to Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	's generosity , and also a list of twelve other libraries , including the
State Library	ORGANIZATION	and various college and school libraries , two of them beneficiaries of the millionaire ironmaster .

		The
Kentucky Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	was created by a legislative enactment that took effect
June 13 , 1910	DATE	, and credit for this none too prompt legislation is to be largely given to the
Kentucky Federation of Women 's Clubs	ORGANIZATION	.

		By organizing a system of travelling libraries covering thirty-two counties , these pul > lic - > j > irited women created so urgent a demand for books and aroused such an interest in library extension that the passage of a library commission bill became , sooner or later , inevitable ... THE CLUE TO
BROWNING	PERSON	'S MIND , asserts Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	in a timely contribution to the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' `` is a vivid and inexhaustible curiosity , dominated by a strangely steady optimism . ''

		And further : `` It is a mistake to say that
Brown	PERSON	- ing is a metaphysician : he is a psychologist . ''

		This well expresses the strength and the weakness of the author of '' Sordello . ''

		If ever a poet had the defects of his qualities defects which to some impatient readers seem to overshadow the qualities that poet is
Browning	PERSON	.

		Psychological subtleties with difficulty lend themselves to the service of verse that sings itself into the heart and soul of the hearer .

		Versified psychology ^ from the gifted pen of a
Browning	PERSON	, must be called poetry , indeed , rather than -LRB- in Pope 's phrase -RRB- prose run mad , but it is surely a poetry sui generis , not the '' simple , sensu - ous , and passionate '' thing referred to by
Milton	PERSON	as being `` less suttle and fine '' than rhetoric .

		THE `` SUFFRAGETTE '' IN ANCIENT
GREECE	LOCATION	appears to have made her presence known as early as 392
B.C.	LOCATION	, the date of the performance of Aristophanes 's comedy , '' Ecclesiazusie , '' or , as one might freely render it in English , `` The Female Suffragists , '' or `` The Women in Town-Meeting . ''

		This laughable picture of a feminized republic should be just now the timeliest sort of play for amateur presentation on the part of young ladies ' dramatic associations .

		A recent meeting of the classical and archaeological clubs of
Mount Holyoke College	ORGANIZATION	was enlivened by the performance of this comedy by members of the senior and junior classes , under the direction of Dr.
Mary G. Williams	PERSON	, the professor of Greek .

		So successful was this Aris - tophanic revival that the project is now favorably considered of producing a Greek play every year .

		THE APPEAL OF THE '' BEST SELLER . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Reading recently Mr.
II	PERSON	.

		< i. Wells 's opinions upon '' The Contemporary Novel , '' I was struck by his flat - tering pronouncement that `` women have never quite succumbed to the
Weary Giant	ORGANIZATION	attitude in their reading .

		... Among readers , women , girls , and young men at least insist upon having their novels significant and real . ''

		I wondered if Mr.
Wells	PERSON	was thinking only of his well -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 387 informed country women , with their alertness to current affairs ; or may we , the `` women and girls '' of
America	LOCATION	, fairly take to ourselves a share of the compliment ?

		Reluctantly I doubted our share in it .

		To solve my doubts , I sought to test the question by my class of undergraduate women .

		Asking what recent novels the students felt were of permanent value , I received an earnest endorsement of one of the recent `` Best-Sellers . ''

		Inquiry as to the essential qualities of this novel called forth answers interestingly similar to Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's opinions : it was the characterization , and the importance of the problem , with , in this case , an additional interest in scene , or `` descriptions '' which marked the novel 's distinctive value and claim to immortality .

		A belligerent but hope - less minority , however , caused me to accept the verdict with reservations , and drove me to a
Sunday	DATE	's perusal of the book .

		The reading brought to me an interesting revelation of the nature of the attraction in the '' Best Seller . ''

		This one was a novel with the realistic interest of the present time , and the romantic charm of a remote place .

		In a story of western life , the author was apparently try - ing to do for the American Desert what
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	had done for
Egdon Heath	PERSON	; comparison showed striking similarities in intention , with vastly different results !

		Yet my students , feeling the intention , perceiving the amount of space given to crudely colored atmospheric descriptive passages , had not stopped to judge results .

		Though they felt that the book contained `` beautiful descriptions , '' it is possible that they skipped most of them , for one can scarcely conceive what contribution to interest or understanding they could have found in so meaningless a sentence as , for example , this : `` And the desert , receiving that flood from the wide hot sky , mys - teriously wove with it soft scarfs of lilac , misty veils of purple , and filmy curtains of rose and pearl and gold ; strangely formed with it wide lakes of blue rimmed with phantom hills of red and violet constantly changing , shifting , scene on scene , as dream pictures shift and change . ''

		A plot made up of conventional situations of love and valor , with the climax centering around the well-worn theme of concealed identity ; characters , un - realized , playing their familiar roles like stage heroes and villains of an ancient type , decked out with modern accoutrements and the specific paraphernalia of the western plains ; the style , a fearful abuse of the English language , alternating between a conscious straining for elevated effects , and an unconscious progress along the deadest levels of colloquialism , were these the ele - ments in the novel which won from young women of average educational training their interest and applause ?

		Feeling personally sensitive about the nature of that training , I comfort myself by believing that these ele - ments in themselves could not have been pleasing had they been observed ; but that in truth neither character - ization , plot , nor description per se was the real object of interest .

		The book as a whole presented the strong , crude coloring and rapid action of the melodrama of an up-town theatre ; or perhaps its breathless vividness might be aptly compared to the technique of a moving - picture show .

		And therein lay its power , in the vivid - ness of the human appeal , in the portrayal of the elemental human passions , the simple compelling strug - gles of the spirit with self and circumstance .

		This human struggle swept along from one intense moment to another , accelerating the emotional reaction of the susceptible reader , bya grand crescendo of melodramatic incident equally remote in simplicity and in vividness from the dull drab complexity of real life .

		6 ** y It is undeniable that these pictures of the lure of the beautiful , the power of the good , and the triumph of the strong appeal to the unjaded idealism of our uncrit - ical reading public , particularly `` women , girls , and young men . ''

		We are so constructed , thank Heaven !

		as to be easily moved by love , suffering , self-sacrifice , and the struggle of the tempted ; but so ready are we to give sympathetic applause to any expression of our ideals , that a poor story , harping stridently upon these themes , will rouse our interest and carry us along , ob - livious to the lack of truth to life in all other elements of the story , and unmindful of the feeble artistry of the story-teller .

		Perhaps , after all , then , this surrender to the Best - Seller does not prove Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's '' Weary Giant '' theory as applicable to women ; my students ' adolescent inter - est in love and valor does not indicate `` that lounging defensive stupidity '' which Mr.
Wells	PERSON	condemns .

		May it not rather be an evidence of his other statement that women and girls insist upon having their novels '' sig - nificant '' at least ; and if they do not demand a signifi - cance closely bound to reality , may it not be that , to many of them , life has not yet brought the sense of the close relationship between the significant , the real , and the ideal ?

		The object of the
American Council	ORGANIZATION	is to strengthen the work of the
Society	ORGANIZATION	, and to secure additional members in this country .

		Members pay
two dollars	MONEY	a year , and are entitled to receive the annual volume .

		The thir - teen volumes thus far issued are handsome books , hav - ing a Gaelic text and a complete English translation on opposite pages .

		The books have been selected chiefly from the
seventeenth century	DATE	and onward , and afford English as well as Gaelic readers access to the genuine products of the Celtic mind at a time when it expressed itself naturally in the language in which the main body of Celtic literature is composed .

		\ MEMORIES OF AN ILLUSTRIOUS IRISHMAN .

		*
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	's volume of '' Irish Recol - lections '' makes its appearance almost simultane - ously with his death at the age of eighty-one years and five months , and helps to give some - thing like completeness to the autobiographical series comprising his `` Irishman 's Story '' and his two volumes of `` Reminiscences . ''

		Born at
Cork	ORGANIZATION	,
November 22 , 1830	DATE	, the son of
Michael Francis McCarthy	PERSON	, chief clerk to the local magistrates , the future parliamentarian and historian of his own times was debarred by the then existing restrictions imposed upon Ro - man Catholics from certain educational and other privileges that he would have liked to enjoy .

		Private instruction and miscellaneous reading seem to have constituted his education after the first school of his boyhood was left behind ; then came , at the age of eighteen , his entrance upon journalism , a calling pursued by him success - ively , and successfully , in
Cork	ORGANIZATION	,
Liverpool	LOCATION	, and
London	LOCATION	.

		After serving '' The Morning Star , '' of
London	LOCATION	, as parliamentary reporter for a few years , he became editor of that journal in
1864	DATE	, and held the position until
1868	DATE	, when he yielded to a desire to visit this country and made the first of those three lecture tours which gave him so familiar an acquaintance with
America	LOCATION	.

		His two other visits were in 1870-71 and 1886-87 .

		He became a leader-writer to the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily News '' in
1870	DATE	, and entered Parliament as mem - ber for County Longford in
1879	DATE	.

		He was re - turned by
North Longford	LOCATION	in
1885	DATE	, by
London	LOCATION	- derry in
1886	DATE	, and by
North Longford	LOCATION	again in
1892	DATE	, closing his parliamentary service in
1900	DATE	.

		As is well known , he was a Liberal in politics , and a Home Ruler , and held the chairmanship of the
Irish Parliamentary Party	ORGANIZATION	from
1890	DATE	to
1896	DATE	, though he could hardly be regarded as the political leader of that party , his bent being far more literary than political .

		His Nationalism was of a temperate and orderly kind , and it was probably his distinction as a writer and public speaker that brought him into prominence in the councils of his party .

		This brief account of his life and work , prompted by his recent death , would lack com - pleteness even as a summary outline without men - tion of his contributions to literature .

		His most considerable work , `` A History of Our Own IRISH RECOLLECTIONS .

		By
Justin McCarthy	PERSON	.

		Illus - trated .


New York	LOCATION	:
George H. Doran Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Times , '' in five volumes , is really a history of
Kn	ORGANIZATION	- gland in our own times -LRB- from
Queen Victoria	LOCATION	's accession to her diamond jubiW j. and is an able and interesting piece of narrative writing front the Liberal standpoint .

		His history of the reigns of the first four
Georges	PERSON	and of
William the Fourth	ORGANIZATION	, the latter half of which was written by his son , and his '' Reign of Queen
Anne	PERSON	, '' with his biographies of Peel ,
Gladstone	PERSON	, and Pope
Leo XIII.	PERSON	, his '' England in the Nineteenth Cen - tury , '' `` The Epoch of Reform , '' `` British Polit - ical Portraits , '' and '' Modern Leaders , '' about complete the list of his more serious and scholarly works .

		In rather lighter vein are his ''
Kniiini	PERSON	- cences '' and `` An Irishman 's Story , '' already mentioned , `` From Charing Cross to St.
Paul	PERSON	's , '' and `` Portraits of the Sixties , '' and , finally , the '' Irish Recollections '' now fresh from the press .

		As a novelist , Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	has written rather copiously and always with a graceful facility and a ready fund of invention .

		His pictures of society life are produced with something like
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	's unfailing ease , and , like
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	's Barchester portraits , they have brought gratifying monetary returns without lifting their author to the pin - nacle of fame .

		Among his best-known novels are '' The Comet of a Season , '' '' The
Waterdale Neighbours	PERSON	, '' `` Red Diamonds , '' `` Miss Misan - thrope , '' '' A Fair
Saxon	PERSON	, '' '' Dear Lady Disdain , '' ``
Donna Quixote	PERSON	, '' `` Maid of
Athens	LOCATION	, '' `` The Dictator , '' and `` Mononia . ''

		These and other stories of his present the passing show of human - ity as viewed by a good-humored on-looker who has no intention of boring his readers with phil - osophical abstractions , moral reflections , or the niceties of psychological analysis .

		Coming now to the final work of this unus - ually productive writer , we find it composed of a dozen chapters of such more vivid or more fondly-cherished recollections of boyhood and youth as not unnaturally occupy the mind of one preparing , in ripe old age , to bid farewell to the warm precincts of the cheerful day .

		Cork ways and
Cork	ORGANIZATION	characters , with many a pleas - ing glimpse of the writer 's family circle in the old home at the southern extremity of the city .

		and with considerable disquisition on Irish traits in general , make up the substance of the book .

		Incidentally something of politics , of Irish his - tory , of economic conditions in
Ireland	LOCATION	, and of the manifold benefits to accrue from Home Rule , is woven into the texture of the various chapters .

		The claims of
Cork	ORGANIZATION	, too , as a seat of literary culture and connoisseurship in art are agreeably voiced by the writer .

		Probably hundreds of others would loyally assert of their native towns
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 389 what Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	takes pride in saying of his birthplace ; but it is none the less worth quoting . ''

		I have seen many countries since those days of my youth in
Cork City	LOCATION	, but I have never been in any place where the love of literature was more warm , more sin - cere , and more general than in that community amid which I was brought up .

		I have sometimes felt tempted to describe my native city as another
Weimar	LOCATION	, but then I have always remembered that it had no Goethe and no
Schiller	PERSON	, and that fact would certainly suggest to the minds of my listeners a considerable difference be - tween the two towns .

		However , I venture on making the remark here , because it will in itself be to the credit of my Cork abode that anyone could even for a moment have thought of venturing on such a comparison . ''

		He questions whether in
England	LOCATION	itself such authors as
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, Mil - ton ,
Scott	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and
Thackeray	PERSON	had a larger proportion of enthusiastic admirers than in Ire - land ; and with something of the large charity that marks his reflections on the English people in general , he .

		adds : '' I feel quite sure that such appreciation and admira - tion of great English authors helped us much towards a recognition of the fact that
England	LOCATION	's ill-treatment of
Ireland	LOCATION	was the work mainly of
England	LOCATION	's privileged and ruling classes , and not in any sense of the English as a people . ''

		Every member of the author 's social circle in those golden days seems to have been something of a poet and romancer , as well as a musician and a person of polite accomplishments gener - ally .

		But these instances of early promise somehow failed in the end to result in any uncomfortable congestion on the heights of Par - nassus .

		Some few modest contributions to news - paper verse , and perhaps a few volumes of creditable prose , were commonly the utmost outcome of such proudly confident assumption of the literary role .

		Of course the author of the `` Eecollections '' had his fling , with the rest , as a composer of rhymes .

		Possibly the reason why he did not ultimately become famous as a poet may be discovered in the following stanza from his '' Poor
Charlie Gray	PERSON	, '' an effusion com - memorating the melancholy fate of a boyhood friend , and printed in full by Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	for the entertainment of his readers : `` Poor Charlie Gray !

		The heavy tears Fell from these lids , I must acknowledge ; I knew him well in earlier years , And we were steady friends at college .

		We parted when I met him here He had grown yellow , thin , despondent , A Garibaldian volunteer , And I a Special Correspondent . ''

		It is interesting to note , from specimens of his father 's verse reproduced by Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	, how much more of a poet the magistrate 's clerk was than the future novelist and historian .

		It had been
Michael McCarthy	PERSON	's early ambition to become a barrister , but the vexatious restrictions imposed upon those of his faith seeking admis - sion to the bar rendered the gratification of his desire too difficult and too costly .

		But nothing could quench his passion for the best literature , especially Greek literature .

		His son says of him : '' He was a man of highly cultured literary tastes , a very accomplished Greek and Latin scholar , and espe - cially given to the study of Greek .

		I have heard him say more than once that on some occasions , when alone and not occupied by any thoughts of official work , he found himself almost coming to think in Greek .

		He was a great lover of English literature , and especially of that which belonged to his own time . ''

		Among the famous Irishmen of the author 's youth , or a little earlier , of whom he gives rem - iniscences , at first or second hand , are to be noted
Thomas Moore	PERSON	,
Daniel O'Connell	PERSON	,
Isaac Butt	PERSON	,
Thomas Crosbie	PERSON	,
John Mitchell	PERSON	, Sir
John Pope Hennessy	PERSON	, and Father
Matthew	PERSON	.

		These and other names of national celebrity furnish the writer occasion , now and then , to consider the political and social and economic conditions of his native country , and to dwell on some of the more glaring instances of unwise administration of her affairs .

		In a chapter lauding the many good qualities of the sons and daughters of
Erin	PERSON	, he writes : `` I have met with many and many an Englishman in
Ireland	LOCATION	during the early fifties , who expressed to me his perfect amazement at the fatuity with which English statesmen , accepted as qualified makers of laws , could have persisted so long in the maintenance of penal codes and religious disqualification for a country like
Ireland	LOCATION	, which could have been so easily ruled and made so peace - ful , prosperous , and happy by a system of civil and relig - ious equality for all orders and denominations and classes .

		I always remember , with much satisfaction , how many Englishmen I used to know in those far-off days who had become from their own observation and experience convinced believers in the principle that
Ireland	LOCATION	's one great want was merely such an enlightened system of government as
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	were then enjoying . ''

		The book as a whole is of the richly reminis - cent , kindly , mellow , anecdotal , wisely reflective sort that might have been expected , and was certainly desired , from its octogenarian author .

		Our earliest memories are our fondest ones in old age , and over these recollections of his life 's beginning Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	has delighted to linger as that life drew to its close .

		* ft The `` Oxford Book of German Verse '' worthily supplements its English , French , and Italian predecessors in the same compact and dignified series .

		The whole work breathes that distinction which is academic '' in the best sense .

		It offers a considerable volume of lyric verse : 536 selections , covering 532 pages of thin but opaque paper .

		Professor
Fiedler	PERSON	has a fine sense of the typical and significant ; and if all the numbers be not '' household words , '' they have all some meaning and place in this anthology .

		The editor has happily liberated himself from that super-discreet timidity which so often inhibits freedom of choice in British collections .

		It is most gratifying to bear witness to Pro- fessor
Fiedler	PERSON	's careful and scholarly piety toward the texts .

		a trust which many com - pilers of popular anthologies have treated with an almost criminal levity .

		The plan is chrono - logical , and the grouping is entirely by authors .

		We have a fair view of some eight centuries of varied poetry , from `` Him of Kurenberg '' to
Richard Schaukal	PERSON	, presenting a large variety of backgrounds , epochs , and colorings .

		The poems of the Middle High German period have been felicitiously rendered into modern verse by Dr.
Fiedler	PERSON	.

		The excerpts from the great treas - ury of the German Volkslied , from different periods , are fresh and typical of its many-sided content ; nor must we omit mention of the race - old gnomic verse , of which German poetry pre - serves a much larger store than our own , represented by many names , from Freidank to
Heyse	LOCATION	, and including
Logau	LOCATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Schiller	PERSON	,
Kiickert	LOCATION	,
Hebbel	PERSON	, and
Geibel	ORGANIZATION	.

		The compact notes , covering forty-five pages , are all in German in fact the only English about the book is found in the title on the out - side cover .

		Professor
Fiedler	PERSON	's residence and labors at the centre of English civilization have fitted him to supply just such brief comments as are most needed by cultivated English - speaking readers .

		Much general intelligence is assumed : the book is no vade-mecum for analphabetes .

		The notes are concerned with sources , occasions of writing , and the explana - tion of difficult matters of detail , while especial place is given to musical compositions -LRB- only three are mentioned for the Lorelei J -RRB- .

		metrical note upon exotic lyric forms would have proved helpful even to cultured readers .

		One naturally compares this collection with Professor Manly 's admirable anthology of ''
Kn	ORGANIZATION	- glish Poetry , '' which covers almost precisely the same period of time .

		The Oxford Book holds not more than one-third the material , but it surpasses the '' English Poetry '' in tastefulness and grace of form .

		It contains by no means so large a proportion of `` winged words , '' which is in itself a strong testimony to the force and constancy of English poetic tradition .

		We are , however , very forcibly struck by the compara - tive crudity of English poetry before
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, by its deadly saturation with sterile theology ; while the lyric sun of mediaeval
Germany	LOCATION	is at its glorious zenith in the thirteenth century : what spontaneity , eloquence , grace , heartiness , depth of meaning , intensity of feeling !

		What brave brocade of chivalry , what flowers of fairy fancy !

		In Tudor times the tables are turned , for
Germany	LOCATION	, long since settled down to a deadly bourgeois level , is torn by doctrinal and political cataclysms ; while
England	LOCATION	, in joyful ebullience , is warbling native wood-notes wild , soon to be succeeded by the exuberant outburst of the full renaissance under
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	, with its sweeping plenitude of life , its noble eloquence , and its grandiose sense of form a period whu-h fixed our English ars poetica upon a base which has never been removed , in spice of the stiffening of verse into rigid classicism , and the conformity of art to the demands of polite society .

		Fortunately for
Germany	LOCATION	, the Volkslieder , those fresh flowers of nature , continued to blossom in humble places .

		The Renaissance came late , and to a poorly-prepared soil .

		There was a painful lack of noble content to life : war , vulgar luxury , pompous orthodoxy , the decline of spirituality and native feeling these com - bined to bring in the most barren period of mod - ern German letters .

		The French mode , itself artificial and sophisticated , led to an aridly self - conscious art , in the midst of which a few true native tones assert themselves in the heart in .

		- of
Dach	PERSON	, the heart-felt piety of
Gerhardt	PERSON	, the searching wit of
Logau	LOCATION	.

		First in the unhappy Giinther do we discover the assertion of a simple , glowing passionateness ; the great birth of Ger - man poetry begins with the rediscovery of the quickening value of ancient art , the first-hand understanding of the essentially religious import of letters to the Greeks .

		From this soil of a sincere study of classical antiquity sprang the revival which led directly to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, into whom entered those myriad elements that made him
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 391 the height of modern letters : noble eloquence , clarity , sincerity , mastery of form and content ; and
Schiller	PERSON	, rhetorical , full of energy and motion and youthful eloquence , the untiring student of philosophy and antiquity .

		Then comes the chap - ter of German romanticism , with its background of castle , forest , and legend ;
Uhland	LOCATION	and
Eichen	PERSON	- dorff , the highly - wrought delicacy of
Holderlin	LOCATION	,
Riickert	PERSON	's wealth of thought and language ,
Miiller	ORGANIZATION	's pure lyric and gift of dramatic person - ification ,
Heine	PERSON	's ironic melody and sensitive responsiveness ,
Lenau	PERSON	's reserved melancholy ,
Morike	ORGANIZATION	's Attic distinction ,
Geibel	ORGANIZATION	's serenity and culture ,
Meyer	PERSON	's grandiose depth , and the rest , down to the representative verse of our own times , noticeable for its fastidiousness and its implacable craving for the gratification of the senses .

		All of this , and much beside , is faithfully illus - trated in this well-chosen treasury of German lyrics , whose fanciful , heart-felt music sings and charms , soothes and stirs .

		The collection opens with an appreciative in - troduction by
Gerhart Hauptmann	PERSON	,
Germany	LOCATION	's first man of letters , the first German poet , by the way , who was ever given the honorary degree of Doctor of Letters by an English university .


Hauptmann	PERSON	discovers a close resemblance be - tween this collection and that which Goethe called for in
1808	DATE	, in his '' Plan for a Chap-Book of Lyrical Verse . ''

		The hardest thing to find , '' wrote
Goethe	PERSON	, `` is the Excellent -LRB- in whatever field -RRB- that shall be popular at the same time .

		One should search this material out , first of all , and make it the foundation of such a collection . '' ''

		The present book , ''
Hauptmann	PERSON	goes on to say , '' is ' popular and German ' in the noblest sense of both words .

		Such a truly catholic and national collection will make the most direct appeal to a kindred nation , and more particularly to that element in the nation which cherishes most loyally its own great stock of poetry . ''

		All these flowers , culled from the gardens of many centuries , make their appeal not merely by their indi - vidual form , fragrance , and color ; they fill the mind with visions of bygone ages , of those broad domains out of which they grew , and of which they remain the last sur - viving witnesses ; or they are linked with names of per - sonages , each of whom has become by himself a theme of never-ending interest and importance . ''

		This collection , which is brought down to our own day , also contains more recent , and most recent examples .

		... Only an age which teems with a fulness of native energy , which grows and presses on to the light , is worthy of a great historic past , and is really able to take pos - session of it .

		Here it is precisely as in nature : harvest follows seed , and seed harvest , and all by means of the vital power inherent in the basal soil ... '' Who should presume to make definite appraisal of such a fund of culture as is hoarded up in this book ?

		... This great treasure , by its very nature , resists being coined .

		With all its reality , the very best part of such a collection can not be made tangible , and least of all by those who have really entered into its domain . ''

		As for all the rest , one can only hope that the book may find for its judges such warm friends as the great
George Meredith	PERSON	, akin and susceptible to the German temperament ; good spirits to whom it is given to unlock the inspired content of these manifold creations , to pene - trate to their very roots and to reach up into the atmos - phere which envelops them .

		With such sponsors , these children of the German soil , even though separated from their native earth , will not be uprooted , but in the midst of a kindred people will enjoy , as it were , the rights of those native to the soil . ''

		Judgment upon matters of detail in such a collection is almost sure to be warped by sub - jective presumptions , and no conceivable an - thology could possibly include all the poems which any given reader would desire to find .

		Admitting the danger of personal bias , there are still some considerations which may be fairly presented .

		One of Luther 's simpler , more spon - taneous hymns -LRB- particularly Nun freut euch , lieben Christen g ` mein -RRB- would be very wel - come .

		The scanty fragments of Giinther 's verse do not fairly represent the forerunner of the modern German lyric of passion ; Klop - stock 's An Fanny and
Haller	PERSON	's Doris surely deserve a place , both for their intrinsic worth and for their historic interest .

		Some of the dry bones of poetry -LRB- notably , in this sense , Zed - litz 's J \ ` dchtliche Heerschau -RRB- , and certain of the feebler productions of
Schiller	PERSON	's muse , might well have been spared to give place to
Uhland	LOCATION	's gallant Taillefer ,
Heine	ORGANIZATION	's Ein Jungling liebt ein M'ddchen , and Und wiissten 's die Blumen , die kleinen .

		In admitting some of the newest poets , whose vital air is essentially that of the cabaret , the editor has emphatically not reported that elemental atmosphere ; nor can one content - edly forego some representation of the Harts ,
Conradi	PERSON	,
Busse	PERSON	,
Hartleben	PERSON	, and
George	PERSON	.

		The fine scholarly accuracy and purity of text displayed throughout the work are worthy of all praise , and make one the more regret cer - tain indefensible arbitrary liberties : two-thirds of
Walther	PERSON	's short ffalmorakel are sacrificed , without any intimation , and with decided detri - ment to the text .

		The poem representing the work of Friedrich von Spe suffers the omission of a very significant title , and appears -LRB- with no hint to this effect -RRB- only as a fragment , in such a way as completely to change its essential char - acter ; a similar result is achieved by dropping off -LRB- with Herder -RRB- the significant closing verses of
Dach	PERSON	's Aennchen von Tharau , which Long - fellow had the courage to reinstate .

Schiller	PERSON	's Burgsc -RRB- itt has come off particularly ill in lapses from the standard text : in stanza 8 , am Mittay for im Mittag ; stanza 12 , R'dnberhand for Raubershand ; stanza 14 , Laufs for Laufes ; and in the seventh stanza the unfortunate sub - stitution of
Fischer	PERSON	for
Schiffer	PERSON	.

		In the Graf von Habsburg the editor alters the overwhelm - ingly attested glaubigem into the everyday form glaubigem ; similarly , in
Morike	LOCATION	's Sckon - Rohtraut the good old characteristic einsmals must be salonized into einstmals .

		The form geringe in No. 271 differs only by one syllable from ' / '' '' . '

		/ ' but the hitter is the only reading in any original text , and such a syllabic dif - ference is not altogether a negligible quantity in
Heine	LOCATION	's art .

		Geibel 's Der Mai ist gekom - men appears according to an earlier text , in - ferior to the author 's final revision .

		In No. 519
Ahren	PERSON	appears in place of Aehren , and on page 533 , iibersetzt for iibersetzt .

		The Gothic form adopted for the '' s-z '' character does not har - monize perfectly with the Latin letters of the text ; and in spite of the great technical beauty of the little volume , there is occasionally an unevenness in the printing which is a keen disappointment .

		Heine 's reference to
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's Mignon in the Reisebilder -LRB- note to No. 123 -RRB- is not in chapter '' xxi , '' but in chapter xxvi .

		The possible in - fluence of Bun van 's '' Pilgrim 's Progress '' on
Schiller	PERSON	seems more than problematical .

		It would be most desirable , for practical reasons , to incorporate the titles of the poems into the alphabetical index of first lines .

		Most grateful thanks are due from all lovers of German poetry for this precious , accurate , and beautiful book .

		THE MoNTEssoui METHOD or TEACHING .

		* American newspapers and magazines have recently shown great interest in the
Montessori	ORGANIZATION	method in education .

		Many writers have given the impression that
Maria Montessori	PERSON	has made a discovery which will revolutionize the teaching of young children .

		American teachers have Tux MOMTEMORI METHOD .

Anne E. Qeorge	PERSON	.

		With an introduction by Professor
Henry W. Holmes	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Frederick A. Stokes Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		gone to
Koine	PERSON	for the purpose of observing the Montessori method in the
Casa dei # < / / /	ORGANIZATION	/ A / ' / / / , and some of them have returned to their native land convinced that they have observed work with children which has never been attempted before in any country .

		These American observers have been describing in the magazines what they saw in
Rome	LOCATION	; but now we have from
Madame Mon	ORGANIZATION	- tessori herself an account of her system .

		She first gives a critical discussion of the relation of modern science to education .

		She has been trained as a physician , and she has had a practical interest in anthropological studies .

		For some time she was engaged in teaching feeble-minded children ; and while in this work she made a study of the methods of
Seguin	LOCATION	,
Lombroso	PERSON	,
Sergi	ORGANIZATION	, and others , all of whose work is well known in
America	LOCATION	.

		These studies prepared
Madame Montessori	ORGANIZATION	for '' natural '' or '' rational '' methods of dealing with normal children .

		Wherever she went in her own country she saw the pupils in the schools sitting in hard and fast seats , learn - ing words , being deprived of freedom of move - ment , and restrained and restricted in every way .

		So she started a school of her own for poor children in
Rome	LOCATION	, and it was in this < '' - / .

		> < / ' / < /
Bambini	PERSON	that she applied her scientific knowl - edge of child nature to early work in education .

		The fundamental principles upon which the Montessori method is based are , -LRB- 1 -RRB- individual training ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- freedom of action and of initiative on the part of the children ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the training of the senses ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- physical training in connection with intellectual education ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- social train - ing as a part of regular school activities .

		A special set of apparatus has been devised for training the senses , and for teaching reading and writing .

		This consists of dressing frames , color boxes , cloth boxes , and formal geometrical insets and designs , resembling in a way the Frobelian gifts , and based upon the same con - ception of child nature and education .

		As one reads
Madame Montessori	ORGANIZATION	's exposi - tion ef her method , one wonders why Americans should have become so interested in it , except as an evidence of new life in the educational work of a people whose schools have continued down to our own day to be almost medieval in character .

		But that any American teacher , ac - quainted with the history of our own methods , should think the Montessori system offered much if anything of value to us seems remarkable .

		In this country we have IODLT reeo-ni / .

		- .

		l that the child should take the initiative in his work , as far as this is possible under the limitations of group education .

		We have long been struggling
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 393 against the evils of education en masse , and we have been endeavoring to give prominence to individual needs .

		But we have been compelled to educate all the children ; and our methods have been determined partly by our ideals , and partly by the actual conditions of free , universal education .

		We long ago passed the point where we thought there was particular value in mere formal sense-training with conventional objects .

		This sort of thing was in vogue years and years ago ; but we have progressed to the point where we now aim to give children sense-experience , not in a formal and conventional way , but in direct contact with the natural objects which are of in - terest and concern to the individual .

		We now think that the typical child who has contact with nature gets vastly better sense-training , even if wholly undirected , than he could ever get in the formal way adopted by the Montessori system .

		Of course , this latter method is a great improve - ment upon sitting in seats and learning words , and so it is to be praised as an advance upon prevailing Italian methods ; but American edu - cation has grown through and beyond this static method of teaching .

		To illustrate with a quota - tion ,
Madame Montessori	ORGANIZATION	says -LRB- p. 173 -RRB- : '' The education of the senses has , as its aim , the refine - ment of the differential perception of stimuli by means of repeated exercises . ''

		Now , modern American psychology maintains that the differ - entiation of stimuli is made possible , not through mere repeated stimulations , which have no sig - nificance , but only when the objects affording the stimulations are of interest to the individual , and in order to learn them it is necessary that he should discriminate the stimuli received there - from .

		He must have vital relations with them before he can effectively discriminate them , and sound teaching will always try to establish such relations .

		The Montessori system proposes to teach children to read and write at the age of four .

		In times past , American education taught the child in the very beginning of his school life to read and to write ; but through years of trial and struggle , we have developed a method which puts emphasis upon concrete and motor expe - rience in the first years of schooling , and defers reading and writing until the child is six , seven , or eight years old .

		Anyone could teach a child to read and to write at four if he thought it desir - able ; but we now think it is not wise to do so .

		In teaching reading , the
Montessori	ORGANIZATION	method begins with the isolated letters , which method has been discarded in
America	LOCATION	for a generation .

		The Italians excel in minute , analytic work .

		In early teaching they begin with the simplest structural elements in everything .

		This used to be universally the method of teaching reading , writing , spelling , music , and the like ; but in
America	LOCATION	we have grown through that into a synthetic method , in which a beginning is made with the largest unities which the child can grasp and which have definite meaning .

		An isolated letter has no meaning , and is psycho - logically difficult to acquire .

		It has been dem - onstrated in
America	LOCATION	time and again that a child can learn a word , or even a short sentence , when it is directly associated with content , more readily and economically than he can learn an isolated lettter .

		We have several volumes pre - senting the results of elaborate experimental studies in this field , but evidently
Madame Montessori	PERSON	and her American representatives are not aware of what has been accomplished in this direction .

		The whole Montessori method is about where the American system was twenty-five years ago .

		It is a great improvement upon general Italian practice in
Rome	LOCATION	, but it does not give the American teacher a new point of view which will be of service to him in solving his present problems .

		Take one further illustration , a typical one , showing how lessons are given in the Montessori system : '' Let us suppose , for example , that the teacher wishes to teach to a child the two colours , red and blue .

		She desires to attract the attention of the child to the object .

		She says , therefore , ` Look at this . '

		Then , in order to teach the colours , she says , showing him the red , ' This is red , ' raising her voice a little and pronouncing the word ' red ' slowing and clearly ; then showing him the other colour , This is blue . '

		In order to make sure that the child has understood , she says to him , ' Give me the red , ' ' Give me the blue . '

		Let us suppose that the child in following this last direction makes a mistake .

		The teacher does not repeat and does not insist ; she smiles , gives the child a friendly caress and takes away the colours . ''

		Now , in no good American school would a teacher try to develop a difference between two colors merely by holding them up , and giving the names .

		A capable teacher here would not try to teach distinctions between objects of any sort simply by having them looked at , and attaching names to them .

		An American teacher would have an object used until the child gained an appreciation of the nature of the thing through what he could do with it , and how it reacted to his experiments with it .

		Then the name would be attached to it ; and if the child failed to make the right connection between name and object , the teacher would not leave it , but would re - THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, present the thing to him in such a way that he would correct his error .

		It is impossible that a child should make progress simply by drop - ping a subject when he makes an error , and come to it again sometime in the future .

		It should be said that the book is attractively written ; and throughout it reveals an earnest and intelligent seeking for natural and effective methods of training the young .

		Considering the practice and traditions of Madame Mon - tessori 's environment , she has really made a revolutionary advance ; but if she had lived in
America	LOCATION	, she would be thought to be behind the times in advocating some of the methods which are presented in this volume .

		XEW MEMORIALS OF MA / .

		/ IM .

		* In the retrospect of history , certain minor fig - ures of every age stand out with ineffaceable glamour , outshining often their mightiest con - temporaries .

		The saint , the martyr , the de - feated hero seem to speak more eloquently and insistently out of the past than do the states - man and the conqueror .

		Their memory is a heritage which posterity preserves the most zeal - ously from diminution or detraction ; their names serve always to awaken in generous natures the highest enthusiasm and the deepest reverence .

		Whether their actual achievement , as history records it , was great or little , does not greatly matter ; it is in what they were , and what they tried to do , rather than in what they did , that their glory lies .

		Among this shining company ,
Joseph Mazzini	PERSON	holds a conspicuous place .

		When , in
1849	DATE	, the heroic but short-lived de - fence of the Roman Republic came to an end ,
Mazzini	PERSON	, the soul of the defence , and irreconcil - able up to the very last to the idea of surrender , lingered on in the captured city , almost inviting assassination .

		`` One thinks of Gordon , '' says his biographer .

		Indeed , one thinks of
Gordon	PERSON	many times in considering
Mazzini	PERSON	's life .

		In all the main attributes of character the two men were greatly alike ; the hero soul in its most authentic aspects was common to both .

		In each a deep religious faith was the well-spring of ac - tion ; they were both men of the simplest nature , wholly devoid of selfish motives , stainless in pri - vate conduct , scornful of luxury , not to be over - borne in any test of elemental character ; each was a spirit self - dedicated to duty , living the life LKTTKBA AND KKCOLLKCTIONH or MAZZINI .

		of '' wearing , daily stead fastness '' that makes up martyrdom .

		And each went down , finally , to seeming defeat .

		`` Men fight to lose the battle , and tli - tiling they fought for comes about in spite of tln-ir defeat , and when it comes it turns out not to be what they meant . ''

		Wlu-n -LRB- ionlon walked forth to his death in the gray desert dawn at
Khartoum	LOCATION	, it was with the bitter knowledge that for him the battle was indeed lost ; yet the thin ^ he fought for has long since come about .

		With
Mazzini	PERSON	, victory and defeat were strangely blended : his long fight for Italian unity seemed at last successful , but.the actual result was far other than he meant or expected it to be .

		He had dreamed of an
Italy	LOCATION	that should be free as well as united ; and he beheld a Frankenstein creature , a body without a soul , which still en - slaved its subjects .

		With unlessened zeal he again took up the fight , and through a long quarter-century of exile and sickness and ever - increasing discouragements of every sort he labored literally without pause toward the real - ization of his hopes for a free
Italy	LOCATION	.

		With a price upon his head in nearly every European country , he was yet to be found wherever there was work to do now in
Paris	LOCATION	, now in
Swit	PERSON	- zerland , now in
London	LOCATION	, now -LRB- '' like a thief in my own land , '' as he said -RRB- in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		And at the last , a year or so before his death , there is that poignant picture of him , forced in changing trains to pass through the side-streets of
Rome	LOCATION	, yet closing his eyes that he might not see the city of his dreams `` profaned by monarchy . ''

		It is with the
Mazzini	PERSON	of these later years the period from
1864	DATE	to his death in
1872	DATE	that Mrs.
Hamilton King	PERSON	has to do in her volume of `` Letters and Recollections of
Mazzini	PERSON	. ''

		As a young girl , generous and romantic in spite of home surroundings that must have been even more smug and oppressive than the average of those early - Victorian days , the author came strongly under the spell of the '' Young
Italy	LOCATION	'' movement .

		She knew nothing of Italian his - tory , nor had she ever spoken with or even seen any of those to whom the cause of Italian unity was sacred .

		But the nobility of
Mazzini	PERSON	and his followers spoke irresistibly to the nobility in her own nature , and she resolved to dedicate herself to their aims and purposes .

		Letters to
Mazzini	PERSON	brought prompt responses ; but out - raged parental authority placed a ban upon the intercourse almost in its incipiency .

		With tin - young girl 's marriage , a few months later , the correspondence was renewed .

		A visit to
Mazzini	PERSON	in his dingy
London	LOCATION	lodgings was
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 395 arranged ; other visits followed at long intervals , and once
Mazzini	PERSON	stayed overnight with the Kings in their country home in
Essex	LOCATION	.

		But for the most part the intercourse was epistolary .

		In addition to the letters of
Mazzini	PERSON	given in these pages , Mrs.
King	PERSON	includes several of her own , besides some written by
Madame Venturi	PERSON	one of the
Ashurst	PERSON	family of
London	LOCATION	, and
Mazzini	PERSON	's most intimate friend .

		All of these let - ters are of great interest , not least Mrs.
King	PERSON	's .

		If to present-day readers the passionate outpour - ing of devotion in the young girl 's first letter to
Mazzini	PERSON	reads strangely , it is only because the language of nobility has become so largely a foreign tongue . ''

		It seems almost sacrilegious , after nearly fifty years , to expose these letters , warm from living hearts , to the mockery of a sceptical and materialistic world .

		Yet in those days , the world was equally sceptical and materi - alistic , and it was even harder , and pervaded by a vice which has now disappeared hypocrisy .

		But after all , truth is best .

		There are warm hearts still , though not so burning with hope ; all things are greyer ; but it is good to have lived in this experience .

		My own letters are long-winded and perhaps pragmatical ; but they were not written in such a hurrying age , and the passion throbs through , though the phrases are not curtailed .

		But as empty words they are of little value .

		Their value is especially this : they are the testimony of a host of devoted lives .

		They have been sealed with blood in prisons , on scaffolds , and on battlefields .

		These men did not speak : they acted , and fought , and suffered , and died , leaving home and family , comfort and security , for the fatal and glorious cause . ''

		It is that testimony , more than any other , of which our self-centered and self-seeking lives are most in need to-day .

		The record of Mrs.
King	PERSON	's first visit to
Maz	PERSON	- zini , during the
London	LOCATION	exile , is well worth quoting .

		``
Mazzini	PERSON	lived then , and during all the years I knew him , in a house called 18
Fulham Road	ORGANIZATION	.

		It was one of a row of small , three-storied houses , standing a little way back from the road , with , in front , a little iron gate and a small grass plot .

		I believe the whole place has long been demolished .

		He occupied the first floor of two rooms , and his landlady 's name was Mrs.
France	LOCATION	.

		He went by the name of
Signer Ernesti	PERSON	, and his letters were so addressed .

		This was a quite transparent dis - guise , as he was perfectly well known to the police ; but it was probably convenient .

		I do not remember if we had previously announced our visit ; but we found him at home .

		He was in the small front sitting-room , so filled with books and papers there was hardly room to move , and with his little canaries and greenfinches fluttering about the room .

		He had been smoking , but had put away his cigar .

		At last we stood face to face .

		I had a photograph of him , but a small and poor one , and it was with an indescribable emotion that I saw before me the slender emaciated form , the noble face and brow , and the great dark , liquid velvet eyes , with their wonderful fire and depth , and heard the gentle , caressing voice .

		He was dressed , as always , in the deep mourning , the black velvet waistcoat buttoned up to the throat , which was his distinctive costume .

		I have no recollection of what was said .

		I could only utter a few words of de - votion and thankfulness : and though
Mazzini	PERSON	himself was a fluent and eager talker , I do not remember that he said much , nor anything that he said . ''

		Three months later ,
Garibaldi	PERSON	made his brief visit to
England	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
King	PERSON	saw him pass through the
London	LOCATION	streets , standing bareheaded in an open carriage , garbed in the historic red shirt and gray mantle , gravely acknowledging the tumultuous greetings of the people .

		On the evening of the same day she saw him again , at the opera ; and shortly after there was a memo - rable meeting with the old lion at a breakfast party ,
Mazzini	PERSON	also being one of the company . ''

		We were very hospitably received , and presented to
Garibaldi	LOCATION	.

		There was a large gathering , and breakfast was announced almost immediately .

		Garibaldi offered me his arm , and led me to the place of honour , at the head of the table , and seated me beside him on his right hand .

		It was the place properly belonging to the hostess .

		I was young and shy , and I felt much embarrassed by the marked attention and the notice it excited : my atti - tude to
Garibaldi	PERSON	was to admire , not to be admired !

		and his evident homage of gallantry only confused me .

		I do not remember any of our attempts at conversation .

		I could read Italian , but had no practice in speaking it , and I was shy , and did not know what to say , and
Gari	PERSON	- baldi was habitually taciturn , so that it did not amount to much .


Mazzini	PERSON	did not make himself at all conspicuous . ''

		The conception of
Mazzini	PERSON	as a '' pestiferous conspirator , '' ruthlessly sacrificing the lives of his followers jto achieve his own fanatical pur - poses , has long since become obsolete .

		But it is nevertheless good to have Mrs.
King	PERSON	's whole - hearted testimony to the tenderness and gentle - ness and generosity of
Mazzini	PERSON	's nature . ''

		He was the gentlest of human creatures , and the kindest .

		The little birds , that flew about his room , nestled on his shoulder , and fed from his hand , were one proof of this , shut out as he was from the comfort of human relations .

		His love and tenderness to children were also touching and wonderful .

		He could be bitterly indignant against wrong , oppression , and cruelty ; but his indignation itself , though fiery , had never anything violent or cruel .

		He could not be other than gentle in every action , word , and tone .

		In all his gentleness there was a deep note of melancholy ; and this was not merely for the sorrows of his country and of humanity , and for his own deceptions and disappointments ; for those who knew him , there might be perceived a perpetual mourn - ing for those lives which had been sacrificed in following him , and whose martyrdom was a perpetual weight upon his heart ... But through all the storm and sorrow of his life there shone a divine light of childhood .

		Anguish , care , and labour could not dim the essential simplicity , innocence , gaiety , and charm of nature , that made his the radiant presence of a child .

		Joy was his element , and he carried joy ; although he himself was a martyr , suffering in body , heart , and soul . ''

		All lovers of
Italy	LOCATION	and her story are familiar with Mrs.
King	PERSON	's eloquent poem entitled '' The THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, Disciples , '' dealing with Ma / / ini and his follow - ers , and written mainly in the author 's youth .

		She has now placed us under a double debt of gratitude by giving us , in her old age , these let - ters and recollections of her hero .

		It is a volume that will do much to enhance the ever-increasing lustre of
Mazzini	PERSON	's name , and one in which every generous-hearted reader must rejoice .

		In closing , a word may be said concerning
Mazzini	PERSON	's place in history .

		Some of the chron - iclers of the movement for Italian freedom would have us believe that his part in that struggle was a minor one , that the glory of victory belongs rather to the sword of
Garibaldi	PERSON	and the brain of
Cavour	LOCATION	.

		But '' the great achievement of his - tory , '' Lord
Acton	PERSON	has told us , '' is to develop and perfect and arm conscience '' ; and in that faith we prefer to believe that
Cavour	PERSON	and
Gari	PERSON	- baldi were but the devoted reapers of a harvest that
Mazzini	PERSON	had prepared to their hands .


WALDO R. BROWNE	PERSON	.

		VISIONS OF AN IDEAL , DEMOCRACY .

		* As its sub-title indicates , Mr.
Walter E. Weyl	PERSON	's '' The New Democracy '' is a study and an analysis of present-day conditions in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Unlike Mr.
A. M. Simons	PERSON	's book of recent date , this is not based upon a study of American history .

		It is also more optimistic , perhaps for that reason ; for nothing goes further than the study of history to dispel the view that all the ugly problems of a given country at a given time are new and unique .

		In comparison with Mr.
Simons	PERSON	, Mr.
Weyl	PERSON	appears to slight disadvantage , though neither of these social analysts seems to the reviewer to have said the last word on their theme .

		In Mr.
Weyl	PERSON	's first chapters , `` Disenchant - ment of
America	LOCATION	'' and '' Shadow - Democracy of
1776	DATE	, '' the point is raised that there has never been a democracy in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Then follow two or three chapters on the essential individualism of the pioneers and of the sover - eign States of the early decades of the nineteenth century .

		Having cleared the ground , so to speak , the author enters upon his main theme , the portrait of American plutocracy , its organiza - tion in the years following the panic of
1873	DATE	, its social pressures and assumptions , its entering upon the field of politics definitely and finally with the purpose of controlling legislatures ,
THK	ORGANIZATION	NEW DEMOCRACY .

		executives , and courts .

		It is an easy step from the lobby to the editorial sanctum , and .

		Sir .


Weyl	PERSON	contends that it is hardly necessary to prove , at
this late day	TIME	, that plutocracy seized upon the press during the later years of the last cen - tury ; and , wherever it was essential to its pur - poses , succeeded in controlling most of the great daily papers .

		But he admits that this control is uncertain , and is constantly shifting from one group to another of our larger journals .

		This is due to the fact that the reading public soon `` catches on , '' and a new device must be in - vented ; for a paper must have readers , else it can not sell either advertising space or editorials .

		Secure in its power over legislatures , execu - tives , and courts , and reasonably sure of guid - ing the organs of public opinion , plutocracy undertakes to improve the productive powers of the nation it controls , first through the organiza - tion and perfecting of the so-called trusts which regulate output , distribution , and prices ; and , second , through `` business efficiency , '' which has found of late such vogue in all quarters .

		All this is the very negation of democracy , which assumes independent action , waste , inefficiency in a certain economic sense , Finally , this systematic scheme leads to pro- test , to the upbuilding of a new democracy , he '' new democracy '' of the book , which is to be real and not '' on paper , '' as was that of
1776	DATE	and after .

		It is to be a `` plenary , sociali/ed democracy forcing its ideals into industrial and economic affairs . ''

		This is to be done not through class war , nor after
Karl Marx	PERSON	's method of brutal force ; but through universal education , the grad - ual but increasing public control of business , and finally the appropriation of the enormous surplus social product which '' big business '' has taught us is possible .

		Thus will all men rise to economic independence , or at least to equality of opportunity ; and plutocracy is to be driven out of existence .

		Such a democracy , instead of head - ing directly to `` decivilization , '' as did the olden Jeffereonian system , will be lasting and benefi - cent ; under its aegis we shall no longer know the crimes of poverty , but only those of prosperity .

		This is a beautiful scheme .

		It is optimistic , and Americans love an optimist .

		But does it '' square '' with the historic facts ?

		The
Marx	PERSON	theory of an inveterate war of classes waged until one or the other submits and accepts slavery in one form or another , is in accordance with the history of mankind from the lie ^ i lining : this theory of change and perfection which Mr.
Weyl	PERSON	offers rests , to be sure , upon some new factors a higher standard of education for all , and most
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL remarkable proximity of all parts of the civilized world due to recent inventions .

		These new facts may justify the hopes of the `` new democracy , '' but the student of the past , though willingenough , can not readily accept them as realizable .

		One might offer many programmes , many speeches of the days when
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	fought the '' Monster Bank , '' which sounded the same note and portrayed the same ideal state of things here set forth , for example , the appeal of
Silas Wright	PERSON	and his colleagues in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to their constituents in

		Without denying that this book offers much that is interesting , and much that commends itself to legislators and leaders , the reviewer fears that the same old struggle for privilege , the same snobbishness of all classes of society , and the same exploitations of the helpless will continue for countless years .

		The distance be - tween the weaker element and the stronger in each community is likely to remain as great as that between the slums and the `` west sides '' of each of our great cities .

		There will be improve - ment , there will follow reactions in the future as in the past ; but the saying of the great Hebrew teacher that '' the poor ye have with you always '' is likely to be as true in the year 2500 as in the year

		RECENT DISCUSSIONS OF HEREDITY .

		* In a letter to Hooker written in
September , 1864	DATE	,
Darwin	PERSON	said : '' The tendency of hybrids to revert to either parent is part of a wider law -LRB- which I am fully convinced that I can show experimentally -RRB- , namely , that crossing races as well as species tends to bring back characters which existed in progenitors hun - dreds and thousands of generations ago .

		Why this should be so , God knows . ''

		At the very time this letter was written ,
Gregor Mendel	PERSON	, in his monastery garden at
Brtinn	LOCATION	, was actually working out '' experi - mentally '' this '' wider law '' which
Darwin	PERSON	felt must underlie the baffling phenomena of inheritance in hybrids .


Mendel	PERSON	published the account of his most important results in

		The paper was one of the relatively few on matters relating to evolution which never attracted

Eugenio Rignano	PERSON	.

		Authorized English Translation by
Basil C. H. Harvey	PERSON	.

		Chicago :
The Open Court Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		few workers in the history of science who have had so wide an acquaintance with the obscure , out-of-the - beaten-path , literature of their subjects as did
Darwin	PERSON	.

		What a mischance , under such circumstances , that he should have overlooked the one paper that was most important of all !

		Had
Darwin	PERSON	become familiar with
Mendel	PERSON	's work in the late sixties , while he was still active and able to repeat those famous experiments with peas -LRB- as he surely would have done -RRB- , and con - firm
Mendel	PERSON	's results completely , as others did many years later , biological research in the
last quarter	DATE	of the nineteenth century would have been quite differ - ent from what it actually was .

		The story of the `` re-discovery '' of
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	's work by three European investigators at about the same time -LRB-
1900	DATE	-RRB- is familiar to everyone .

		In the twelve years that have passed since that time the study of genetics has developed rapidly .

		It is gaining more and more the attention and interest of biologists all over the world .

		It is a conservative statement to say that in these twelve years a broader comprehension of the meaning of heredity , and a deeper insight into the laws of inheritance , have been gained than from all the previous investigation and speculation about these basic problems .

		Pawlow , the great Russian physiologist , has some - where said that every advance in knowledge rests upon the discovery of a new technique a new way of attacking old problems which everyone thinks of as either solved or insoluble , and certainly quite de - void of untouched sources of knowledge and inspira - tion .

		No better example of the truth of this idea than the recent history of the science of genetics could be found .

		For it is certain that the highest significance of
Mendel	PERSON	's work is to be found , not in his actual con - tributions to knowledge , brilliant as these were , but rather in the fact that he gave to biology a new way of looking and working at a world-old problem .

		The Mendelian method of studying inheritance is vastly more important than the results of
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	's exper - iments with peas .

		With so much professional interest concentrated upon the subject of genetics , and as a consequence of the easily perceived bearing of this study upon hu - man affairs , both directly and in relation to agricul - ture , it is to be expected that non-technical accounts of what is going on in this field of biology will be forthcoming .

		Three of the books here under review -LRB-
Darbishire	ORGANIZATION	's `` Breeding and the Mendelian Discov - ery , '' Castle 's `` Heredity in Relation to Evolution and Animal Breeding , '' and
Doncaster	ORGANIZATION	's `` Heredity in the Light of Recent Research '' -RRB- are popular treatises of this kind .

		Each of the authors has done notable original work in genetics and is qualified to speak with the authority which accompanies first-hand ac - quaintance with the actual phenomena .

		Professor Castle 's book , which is an expansion of a series of lectures before an audience of teachers and investigators in agriculture , explains with ex - treme clearness and simplicity , both of manner and matter , the essential features of Mendelian inheri - 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, tance and the bearing of these facts upon some of the problems of organic evolution and of practical breeding .

		The examples and illustrations are taken largely from the author 's own experiments with guinea pigs , rabbits , and other small mammal - .

		The treatment of the subject is rather broader in Mr.
Doncaster	PERSON	's book .

		The latter includes a discus - sion of the biometric treatment of the problems of inheritance in addition to the Mendelian work .

		Historically the account is much more adequate than Mr.
Castle	PERSON	's .

		Furthermore , the illustrative material which he makes use of includes a greater range of plants and animals .

		Both these books de - serve to be widely read .

		Mr.
Darbishire	PERSON	follows a somewhat different plan than either of the other writers .

		He confines his attention almost entirely to the actual material with which
Mendel	PERSON	worked , the garden pea .

		The simple Mendelian experiments are described and illustrated in great detail and with much skill .

		Mr.
Darbi	PERSON	- shire 's technical papers have demonstrated his clever - ness as a writer .

		The present work can only enhance his reputation in this respect , for it is truly a bril - liant achievement in popular scientific writing .

		A useful feature of the book is a chapter giving de - tailed , but absolutely clear and simple , directions for carrying out a Mendelian experiment on inheritance in peas .

		From these directions any person , however unskilled in biological technicalities , should have no difficulty in repeating in his own garden the experi - ments which marked an epoch in the history of our knowledge of living things .

		Altogether , Mr.
Darbi	PERSON	- shire has given a fitting introduction to a fascinating subject .

		Turning to Rignano 's '' Upon the Inheritance of Acquired Characters , '' we find ourselves in a very different sort of atmosphere .

		The author is by train - ing and profession an engineer .

		What knowledge he possesses in the field of biology is obviously derived from books rather than from living things .

		This leaves him quite free to settle the `` large '' problems of life without being in any way hampered by mean facts .

		Out of his inner consciousness
Rignano	PERSON	has evolved an elaborate and purely metaphysical theory to explain how acquired characters might be in - herited .

		He brings forward no single bit of con - clusive evidence that they ever are inherited , nor has anybody else .

		Now who in the world cares whether such characters may be inherited ?

		If it could once be shown beyond cavil that they are in - herited , it would then be time to speculate as to how such a result was brought about .

		Thirty years ago biologists hotly debated this question in a delightfully Pickwickian manner .

		No damage was done , and happily biology has left this slough of metaphysical despond .

		Rignano should have written his book then .

		It would at least have escaped being an anachronism .

		How far it is from being abreast of biological thought at the present time is indicated by the fact that
Mendel	PERSON	's name is not even mentioned in the book .

		commentt of a nities for gathering material for such man of letter * , * book as his '' Many Celebrities and a Few Others '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- have been abundant .

		A wandering life of journalism and editorship and book-writing has brought him in contact with many men and women distinguished in letters or otherwise prominent and interesting , and a retentive memory -LRB- or notebook , or both -RRB- has made the production of his `` bundle of reminiscences '' an easy and doubtless congenial task .

		Wooed in his boyhood by the con - flicting charms of the stormy sea and the quiet walks of literature , he chose the latter , largely , one gathers , because a very disenchanting parental indifference to his running away to sea took all the romance out of that otherwise tempting career .

		To have one 's father and mother calmly discuss with one the best way to perform the heroic act is certainly contrary to accepted tradition .

		But the wanderlust had to be appeased , and so from
Liverpool	LOCATION	, his birthplace , the youth made his way to
New York	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	and elsewhere .

		Service on the staff of such newspapers as the
Springfield	LOCATION	`` Republican , '' the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times '' and `` Tribune , '' and the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Journal , '' prepared him for more ambitious undertakings in magazine writing and editorship .

		`` The North American Review '' was for eight years under his control , or partial control , immediately after the untimely death of the versatile
Allan Thorn	PERSON	- dike Rice .

		Of his books , such later ones as ''
Thack	PERSON	- eray 's
London	LOCATION	, '' '' At
Hawarden	PERSON	with Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	, '' and In the Land of
Lorna Doone	PERSON	'' are among the best known .

		His long editorial connection with '' The Youth 's Companion , '' a connection still existing , has opened the way to intercourse with many of that periodical 's noted contributors .

		This material is probably the most valuable of the kind in the country , and Dr.
Brad	PERSON	- isher 's careful and thorough study adds much to our knowledge of book-publishing and bookselling in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries .

		The few sample bills , book orders , and letters between authors and publisher are of especial interest The only fault that can be found with this part of the
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 399 work is that there is too little of it .

		Most students would welcome a fuller statement of deductions and more illustrative documents , in exchange , if neces - sary , for the history of copyright compiled from easily-accessible sources which occupies fifteen or twenty pages of the volume .

		There will be less gen - eral agreement as to the value of the comments on
Carey	PERSON	as a man and as an author .

		This versatile Irishman entered upon his life in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	with the same outspoken activity that had led to his exile from his native country .

		He was continually en - gaged in personal controversies and in political and civic movements .

		He fought a duel with a political opponent ; he organized the first
American Sunday School Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		As an author he was eager to rush full tilt into any controversy , and to express opinions on any subject .

		He had much to say on political economy .

		He wrote his
Vindicice Hibernicce	PERSON	in an attempt to prove Dr.
Bradisher	PERSON	says he did prove that there was no Irish massacre in
1641	DATE	.

		He was a master of the art of vituperation , called in his day political sat - ire .

		Dr.
Bradisher	PERSON	prints some cordial letters writ - ten by
William Cobbett	PERSON	to
Carey	PERSON	in 1815-17 , when the two men had come into political agreement .

		To make these effective he might have quoted from
Carey	PERSON	's published attacks of some years earlier , in which , for example , he calls Cobbett '' a wretch ... accursed by God and hated by man , the most tre - mendous scourge that hell ever vomited forth to curse a people , '' and '' a blasted , posted , loathsome coward , '' and adds `` What pride !

		what pleasure !

		I should feel in dragging you reeking from your den , and cow-skinning you till Argus himself should not be able to perceive a hair 's breadth upon your carcase but sore upon sore . ''

		Those who have enjoyed , and in a way admired ,
Carey	PERSON	as a vigorous and pictur - esque fighter , a devoted partisan , and a good hater will be surprised at Dr.
Bradisher	PERSON	's picture of a mild philanthropist , who is praised for his '' candor and fairness , '' `` the judicial cast of his mind , '' and his `` lovable nature . ''

		There are a few slips .

		On p. 7 reference is made to
Noah Webster	PERSON	's '' Progress of Dulness '' ; probably the satire by
Webster	PERSON	's friend ,
John Trumbull	PERSON	, is intended .

		On p. 50 , a slightly obscure passage seems to imply that '' Char - lotte Temple '' was written and first printed in
America	LOCATION	.

		On p. 65 ,
Fessenden	PERSON	is referred to as one of the
Hartford	LOCATION	Wits .

		Dr.
Bradisher	PERSON	shows , how - ever , by many unobtrusive allusions , that he knows the background of his subject better than the aver - age author of a dissertation whose topic lies in an out-of-the-way field .

		Professor
George Herbert Palmer	PERSON	, refusing to be satisfied with that shallow psychology and ethics which agree to shelve the age-long problem of whether man is free or bound , lord of destiny or its slave , has tackled the problem anew , and attacked it front - ally rather than with any pragmatic indirection .

		In `` The Problem of Freedom '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- he dis - cusses the whole question , for and against , in a A study of human freedom .

		thorough but popular fashion , and develops the idea of freedom which he has worked out for himself .

		Freedom of the will in the sense of capricious inde - termination he rejects utterly ; and determinism , in the sense that every action is the lawful result of causes , he accepts .

		But he does not follow his determinism to the extent of becoming a fatalist .

		Briefly stated , Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	's argument for freedom rests on two main grounds .

		The first of these is that there are two kinds of causation .

		The car which moves because a previous cause , the moving engine , pulls it , is an example of sequential causa - tion .

		The man who runs from a burning building acts as the sequential effect of an idea the fear of fire .

		But the man who tells the truth because he holds an idea of moral perfection is not acting from the usual push of causation , because his moral per - fection does not yet exist and so could not be a cause in the usual sense .

		Such causation by a cause which does not yet actually exist , Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	calls antesequential causation .

		As persons , he says , we have the choice of acting from material , sequen - tial causation , or of acting from ideal motives , and the choice of the latter method of acting is what confers freedom .

		There are obvious difficulties in this view , and the author admits them frankly .

		Of one , the translation of sense impressions into conscious motives , he writes at length , and shows how , under the term `` parallelism , '' the unknown mode and place of the transformation from the outer world of sense to the inner world of person - ality is a mystery which all schools of thought ques - tion with equal lack of answer .

		As a complementary to the question of choice by the individual there must be chance in the outer world or else our choice would be meaningless .

		Professor
Palmer	PERSON	devotes a chapter to proving that there is chance in the cosmos a chance made possible by the facts that independent chains of causation intersect at unforeseeable points as when the chain of causa - tion which impels the stone from one 's hand to hurtle toward the mark , and the chain of causation which impels the migrating bird , cross each other with a result which is as chanceful as it is unfor - tunate for the bird .

		In spite of this looseness in his universe , the author avows himself a '' moderate idealist '' and a believer in the view that there is purpose in the universe .

		Ever since the appearance of
Henry D	ORGANIZATION	- L1 y d > s '' Wealth a s ainst Com - monwealth , '' '' Big Business '' has been pretty thoroughly exploited as the source of economic oppression and political corruption .

		That there is another side to the question is the chief burden of Mr.
Charles Norman Fay	PERSON	's book entitled `` Big Business and Government '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co	ORGANIZATION	, -RRB- .

		Mr.
Fay	PERSON	believes that we exaggerate greatly the monopoly element in '' Big Business . ''

		The great enterprise survives on account of its efficiency in competition , and must ever be prepared to fight for its life .

		The really successful trusts produce cheaply 4U THE DIAL -LSB-
May 16	DATE	, and sell cheaply , earning merely good profits on an honest capitalization .

		Trusts that try to earn exces - sive profits , or are burdened down by excessive capitalization , are forced to reform or die .

		What monopoly we have is largely accounted for by tin - tariff , which Mr.
Fay	PERSON	would like to abolish , or by the Sherman law , which prevents enterprising out - siders from developing competition with trusts in the hope of being taken into the combination .

		Mr.
Fay	PERSON	has had practical experience in
Big Business	ORGANIZATION	, both as insider and as outside competitor .

		In the former role his success was only moderate , since , as he explains , a certain squeamishness deterred him from employing all available means bribing of legisla - tures , for example for compassing legitimate ends .

		As an outside competitor he was unmercifully pun - ished .

		Accordingly our respect for him is increased by the fact that he accepts without qualification the doctrine that the proper law of business life is vce victit !

		To Mr.
Fay	PERSON	the great popular movement for the public control of great enterprise is nothing but the envy of the unsuccessful and incompetent , brought to expression under the tutelage of corrupt demagogy .

		The legislatures , the press , even the courts are joined in a conspiracy against ability , which , left untrammeled , would achieve results of vast benefit to all mankind .

		Mr.
Fay	PERSON	flatters him - self that he is a reactionary .

		A careful examination of his work will show , however , that he quite mis - takes his own position .

		What he proposes is strict public regulation of the capitalization of the great corporations , the determination of a minimum rea - sonable profit , and a division between the corporation and
the State	ORGANIZATION	of profits in excess of the minimum .

		This is really the radical position ; in comparison with Mr.
Fay	PERSON	, the Progressives are reactionaries .

		The book makes no pretence of scientific quality ; but it is none the less worthy of reading .

		The work is a compilation from contemporary newspapers , congressional and campaign political speeches , party convention resolutions , and influential books such as Helper 's `` Impending Crisis . ''

		In a series of appendices Mr. Fit * prints the party platforms , and one noted speech by a leading representative of each of the four parties contesting the election .

		He also freely expresses his own judgment of men , their actions , and their arguments in the campaign .

		Douglas stands out as a powerful and fascinating personality , in spite of his inconsistencies and self - seeking ; while the position and influence of
Yancey	PERSON	are emphasized , for
Yancey	ORGANIZATION	's importance as a leading Southern irreconcilable has long been underestimated .

		The moral issues of the controversy are not subor - dinated , but other questions are given their proper im - portance .

		Mr.
Fite	PERSON	's general attitude on the campaign is well stated in the Introduction , when summarizing his view of the Civil War itself .

		`` In the last analysis the one complete justification of secession was the imperative necessity of saving the vast property of slavery from destruction ; secession was a com - mercial necessity , designed to make these billions secure from outside interference .

		Viewed in thi > light , secession was right ; for any people , prompted by the commonest motives of self-n -- pe < - t and > elf - defense , and with no moral scruples against slavery , would have followed the same course ... But the North was no less right in opposing slavery , for theirs was a course springing from the natural promptings of morality .

		History , then , must adjudge that both sides in the controversy were right , and that the war was bound to come when the opposing sides conscientiously held , the one to the wrong , the other to the right , of slavery . ''

		The principal value of the book is that it presents impartially and from a modern viewpoint the essentials to an understand - ing of the campaign of

		A few years of medical practice , six months of European travel , several seasons of public lectur - ing , a short interval of farming , these were some of the miscellaneous activities of this versatile Ver - monter by which he acquired that knowledge of the world and of human nature , and that control of him - self , which contributed to his immediate and increas - ing success as a dealer in

		THE DIAL , 401 Some charming The Uttle V lume entitled `` Leaflets studies from from
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , by M. Nat - italian history .

		a ji ne
Crumpton	PERSON	, contains four essays , of which the last one was completed just before the author 's death ,
last June	DATE	.

		The essays have been edited for the press by the writer 's sister ,
Margaret L. C. Nicola	PERSON	.

		They constitute one of the most fragrant and delightful volumes of foreign studies recently published .

		Particularly charming is the first and most considerable section of the book , an account of the
Roman Empress Galla Placidia	PERSON	, growing out of a mention of her mausoleum in
Ravenna	LOCATION	.

		The skill with which that interesting woman 's part in the wild tangle of fifth century Roman affairs is picked out and set together into a clear and interesting story amounts almost to genius .

		The second essay is an almost equally pleasant account of the life of
Santa Monica	LOCATION	, mother of
St. Augustine	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then comes a scanty history of the worship of Cybele in
Italy	LOCATION	; and last a study of
Genoa	LOCATION	, which savors too much of the guide-book to have the charm of the earlier sketches , but which has its own interest , and which is supplemented by a long list of '' Notable Doorways and Reliefs in
Genoa	LOCATION	. ''

		From first page to last it is vividly evident , for all the quiet restraint of the presentation , that the work is a labor of love and a careful selection from the data of long and rich expe - rience and extensive knowledge .

		Readers who have never seen
Italy	LOCATION	, or who have not even the most ele - mentary knowledge of Italian and Roman history , are not confused or embarrassed by obscure allusions ; and yet there is such a genuinely personal touch in the narrative that the traveller and the scholar will not fail to find pleasure in following through its tantalizingly small number of pages .

		It is a pity that this sympathetic student of things Italian could not have lived to give us many more such volumes .

		` The law 's ^ n one f n ^ s poems Pope has uttered delays and a `` curse on all laws but those which other vexations .

		j Qve hag made .

		Many anot her , both before and since , has felt impelled to deplore the injustice of man-made laws .

		Some of the considera - tions that induce this state of mind in a thoughtful person are well set forth by Mr.
Samuel Beach Chester	PERSON	, of the
Middle Temple	ORGANIZATION	, in a readable book entitled `` Anomalies of the Law , '' published in this country by
Messrs. Little , Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A quota - tion from
Charles Lever	PERSON	, satirizing barristers , serves as introduction to the author 's treatment of legal anomalies connected with divorce , death and burial , wills , libel and slander , imprisonment for debt , the need for the right of property in surnames , literary censorship , capital punishment , murder and suicide , legitimation , criminal appeal , client , solicitor and counsel , the morality bill , accession , and coronation oaths and declarations .

		A pertinent passage for quo - tation at this time is the following , from the chapter on libel and slander : `` To be a popular or a cele - brated figure at the present day is to be the target for every form of foul abuse , criminal concoctions and cruel lies .

		Whether a person 's life is blameless or blameworthy , he only has to reach a certain degree of public attention to be douched with the vile outpour - ings of a cesspool , or blinded by the volcanic lava of jealousy and spite .

		The individual who yearns for fame had better first well calculate his power to en - dure its concomitants ! ''

		The writer 's assertion that , in literary censorship , `` both legal and literary skill '' are needed in order to determine the decency or in - decency of certain problem novels , is a little amusing , at least to a reader not educated in a law school or law office .

		A few pages of the book might well have been devoted to a consideration of the lamentable lot of the innocent man unjustly accused and brought to trial , even though he be acquitted .

		No adequate redress for his grievances has ever been found .

		A critical reviewer must note with surprise that Mr.
Chester	PERSON	, with all his `` legal and literary skill , '' and with his logical habit of mind , does not refrain from using the absurd and indefensible expression , `` equally as good as . ''

		In his opening chapter of `` My Lady .

		Castlemaine '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- Mr.
Philip W. Sergeant	PERSON	says : '' If her bodily loveli - ness was universally recognized in her lifetime and is incontestable to-day , her moral character was a byword while she lived and has never found an apologist since her death '' ; and in closing he says : ``
Barbara Villiers	PERSON	is scarcely likely to be forgotten while the combination of a face of eminent beauty and the heart of an utter rake has any attraction for weak mankind . ''

		Such portion of weak mankind as cares to read the latest and most elaborate account of
Barbara Villiers	PERSON	,
Countess of Castlemaine	ORGANIZATION	and afterward Duchess of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, chiefly renowned as recipient of certain royal attentions from
Charles II.	PERSON	, will find Mr.
Sergeant	PERSON	's book all that could be desired in its way .

		The beautiful
Barbara	PERSON	has already figured in Mr.
Alfred Kalisch	PERSON	's `` Lives of Twelve Bad Women , '' also in Mr.
Allan Fea	PERSON	's `` Some Beau - ties of the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' and more promi - nently in Mr.
G. S. Steinman	PERSON	's privately-printed '' Memoir '' of her ladyship , while the honor has even been accorded her of a place in the `` Dictionary of National Biography . ''

		The gossip-loving
Pepys	PERSON	, too , mentions her frequently in his Diary ; and as he records an instance of kindness on her part toward a child , we must conclude that she was not wholly bad .

		Nine portraits of her , from paintings by
Lely	PERSON	,
Kneller	PERSON	, and others , with ten other portraits , illus - trate the book , which also has a ten-page index and twenty - three pages of bibliographical and explanatory notes .

		On the whole , it is clear that the author be - lieved the biography of even an `` utter rake '' worth doing well , if worth doing at all .

		What substantial good did
Joan	PERSON	of More about 6 the Maid Arc accomplish ?

		Henry VI .

		would of
Orleans	LOCATION	.

		Such is the thesis upheld hy Lieutenant Colonel
Andrew C. P. Haggard	PERSON	in his new book entitled `` The
France	LOCATION	of
Joan	PERSON	of Arc '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		The raising of the siege of
Orleans	LOCATION	, he maintains , would have come of necessity in a few days or weeks , since the English were reduced in numbers till the siege had become a farce , and were losing ground every day .

		Joan , in his opinion , did nothing that can not be adequately explained by the magnetism of a strong and enthusiastic nature , aided by the bound - less superstition of the time .

		Aside from this de - limitation of her work and influence , the book is the conventional eulogistic life of the Maid ; told , it must be admitted , in erratic and sometimes puzzling English , and with little skill in perspective .

		As the title indicates ,
Colonel Haggard	ORGANIZATION	is undertaking to present a general view of conditions in
France	LOCATION	in
Joan	PERSON	's time , and not simply a life of the devoted Maid herself .

		His method of accomplishing this ambitious purpose has been simply to begin with the year
1380	DATE	and chronicle events in somewhat con - fused detail till the day of
Joan	PERSON	's death then to stop abruptly .

		Since
Joan	PERSON	's activities did not begin till
1429	DATE	it follows that the account of her work occupies a small part of the book , somewhat more than one-fourth .

		She is mentioned only once or twice in the narrative that precedes .

		On the whole , it is difficult to see in what sense the book is an ad - dition to the literature of the subject As a his - torical document it has little value ; as a literary work it is extremely defective ; and it is not always either easy or interesting to read .

		The mind ' .

		Dl > -
Geor	ORGANIZATION	g e W -
Jacoby	PERSON	's Sugges - thare in health tion and Psychotherapy '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- < * nddieaic .

		v \ \ \ promptly be assigned a favor - able place among the increasing number of books aiming to enlighten the public upon the theory and practice of the mind 's share in health and disease .

		The writer shows a clear conception of his subject , and takes a judicial yet firm stand in regard to the debatable points in this field .

		For this reason it is the more to be regretted that he has conceived his task so conventionally , and , as a consequence , has produced a book lacking in distinctive traits .

		At best only the last third of the book reflects practical in - sight , and sets forth the problems of close concern to the art of mental therapy .

		The manner of state - ment is clear and convincing , describing the several procedures of hypnosis , suggestion , persuasive en - couragement , the removal of mental obstruction , psycho-analysis , and the place of these in medical therapy , and their use and abuse in faith cure ,
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	, and the like .

		These procedures Dr.
Jacoby	PERSON	discusses , not as a panacea , but as the equipment of an art , possessing , like all arts , the possibility of danger as well as benefit The rest of the volume discusses discursively the psychology of suggestion and the history of mental practice , which , although pertinent enough , is already available in many another volume .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A treasure-bouse of fascinating material for the biblio - maniac is brought together in Mr.
K. M. Leonard	PERSON	's Book-Lover 's Anthology '' -LRB-
Henry Frowde	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Quota - tions from some two hundred authors , dealing with every phase of books and reading , are embodied in the four hundred pages of the collection .

		It forms a worthy suc - cessor to the well-known `` Book-Lover 's Enchiridion '' compiled by
Alexander Ireland	PERSON	many yean ago , and long since out of print .

		Mr.
Robert Haven Schauftler	PERSON	's `` Our American Holi - days '' series is now continued by volumes on '' Flag Day '' and `` Independence Day '' -LRB-
Moffat	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The earlier volumes of this series have been acclaimed with delight by school teachers the country over , and there is no reason to think that the new ones will prove any less popular .

		Nothing is harder than to get up a school celebration without help of this sort ; with such assistance , it becomes an inspiration and a pleasure .

		We can hardly imagine any great demand for a `` Russian Year Book '' among American and English readers , but Dr.
Howard P. Kennard	PERSON	seems to have be - lieved such a demand to exist , since he has compiled a reference work of this type , which now appears for the second year , and bids fair to be continued annually .

		For those who want the sort of information it contains , it will doubtless be found of the highest value .

		The Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	are the publishers .

		Miss
Alice M. Atkinson	PERSON	is the author of a reading - book for children on '' The European Beginnings of American History '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- which deserves hearty com - mendation .

		Most of our young people approach the history of their own country without any background at all , and this volume supplies just what they need .

		It offers a brief and readable survey of European history from the history of
Rome	LOCATION	down to the Elizabethan times which are commonly taken as the starting-point of our own annals .

		A few chapter-titles are as follows : `` The Romans in
Britain	LOCATION	, '' '' The Vikings , '' '' Country People in the Middle Ages , '' The Black Death and the Labor Troubles , '' '' The New World , '' and '' English Seamen . ''

		These will give some slight idea of the richness of in - terest offered by the book .

		The same careful attention to every practical detail that has made so useful the previous issues of the Mod - ern American Library Economy Series '' marks also the latest number published , which bears for its sub-title . ''

		Large Pictures , Educational and Decorative , '' being Section I. of Part VI. , '' Art Department . ''

		The authors of the pamphlet are Miss
Marjary L. Gilson	PERSON	and Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	.

		A previous number of the series , entitled '' The Picture Collection , '' has described these wall pictures used by the
Newark Public Library	ORGANIZATION	in its work and for the ornamentation of its rooms , and the publication now issued is devoted chiefly to a descrip - tion of the routine business of selecting , ordering , mount - ing , storing , and exhibiting the pictures , with a classified list of those owned by the
Newark	LOCATION	library , and also a list of dealers in such pictures .

		Details of size and price , with other useful information , are not lacking , and numer - ous half-tone illustrations supplement the printed mat - ter .

		The
Newark	LOCATION	library is exceptionally well-equipped in its department of lithographs and other inexpensive illustrations for educational work , and is therefore quali - fied to issue a remarkably useful manual for the guid - ance of others in this branch of library activity .

		The
Elm Tree Press	ORGANIZATION	publishes this series .

JUNE	DATE	PERIODICALS 442 LIST OF NEW BOOKS , .

		443 ON EEADING OUT-OF-DOORS , In proportion as people cling to the city , they long for what they call `` God 's out-of-doors . ''

		To-day people are clinging to the city desper - ately , for nowhere else is the flux of life so en - chantingly fluid , nowhere else the elan vital so intoxicatingly urgent .

		But when the force of the current brings weariness and satiety , as it does from time to time , they yearn for the simple joys of the countryside pure air , restful green meadows , cow 's - milk that is still warm , and a book of verses underneath the bough .

		Some of them , indeed , the weariest and the most frivol - ous , would prefer to the book of verses a novel advertised as one of the `` best sellers . ''

		But with the inveterate readers of light fiction those who are unable to read with pleasure any - thing else we have not here to do .

		We shall find it more profitable to consider the case of those who take with them , on week-end journeys and
summer	DATE	vacations , a copy , let us say , of '' Hamlet , '' or '' Pendennis , '' or '' Prometheus Unbound , '' or the '' Oxford Book of English scant Verse . ''

		And let us assume -LRB- what we have warrant for assuming -RRB- that the readers of such books as these are interested , not in having read them , not in attaining a sweet oblivion , but in deriving from them a solid and elevating pleasure .

		To readers of this sort , who are , we trust , more abundant than they seem to be , reading out-of-doors generally means an unfulfilled inten - tion .

		On departing from the city for a ramble in the woods or over the hills , or on leaving the
summer	DATE	hotel for a stroll to a particularly pleasant spot , they thrust into their pockets or perfumed hand-bags the copy of '' Hamlet , '' '' Pendennis , '' or what not ; and they return having read only a few pages or nothing at all ; with the result , finally , that the book is worn , stained , full of four-leaf clovers and little stray insects , and unread .

		Bluntly and in brief , the out-door reader does not read .

		Why ?

		The reason is , I think , not far to seek .

		Books are made by man , who vitalizes them with his sensuous , moral , and intellectual faculties ; and whoever reads a book wisely concentrates upon it his whole experience and aspiration , his sensuous , moral , and intellectual faculties .

		As 4-Jo THE DIAL -LSB- .

		lane 1 , the writer , so the reader .

		In the privacy of the library on a
winter	DATE
evening	TIME	, this concentration is readily attained , and it is accompanied with that glow of full life which
Faust	ORGANIZATION	's Famulus described : Da werden Winteroachte hold und schb ` n , Ein selig Leben warmet alle Glieder . ''

		But in the teeming publicity of outer nature on a
summer	DATE
afternoon	TIME	, this concentration is well - nigh impossible : the moral and intellectual facul - ties are dormant , activating , so to speak ; and the happy glow , if one glows at all , is predom - inantly sensuous , as of a snake luxuriating in the sun .

		The plane of intelligence is lowered from that of man as a human creature to that of man as an animal .

		That side of man which is related with the placidity of nature flourishes at the expense of the side of man which is , so far as we know , peculiar to man .

		It would , of course , be absurd to maintain that this decline in the dignity of man is never desirable : the heal - ing power of nature inherent in her large equa - nimity has been celebrated by countless poets , and is vaguely realized by everyone who seeks recreation out-of-doors .

		The pleasures that na - ture offers are legitimate , even though they are inferior to some of our human pleasures .

		But it must not be forgotten that they are sensuous , that they thrive while the distinctively human faculties slumber ; and surely a good book , in - tended to appeal to the whole of man , can not be read to advantage by a part of man .

		Readers who would resist the sensuous placid - ity of nature meet with varying degrees of suc - cess .

		If you are versed in bird and insect lore , you are utterly lost .

		Just as you turn the page , a red-eyed vireo is sure to come down from the treetop above you to comment on your fool - ishness with a series of peevish triplets : '' What are you doing ?

		Stop it now .

		Close the book .

		Look at me '' ; a cardinal grosbeak or a great - crested flycatcher will break into the fragile melody of your poet with an hilarious and some - what derisive shout ; and a little green bee , bur - nished and flashing in the sunlight as he buries himself in a pretty flower , will put to shame the dryad of your stanzas for is he not real and there ?

		And if your book is Richard De Bury 's little classic , you will no sooner read `` at the sting of the biting flea the sacred book is flung aside '' than a formidable mosquito will alight upon your neck and outrage your ego .

		Nature may , indeed , induce reverie ; but she does not induce contemplation .


Whittier	LOCATION	, who wrote abundantly of woods and waters that minister - the healing of their life , '' was more aware than we seem to be to-day of the treachery of nature 's `` solitudes . ''

		But nature is not solitude : She crowds us with her thronging wood ; Her many hands reach out to ua , She will not leave our senses still , But drags them captive at her will . ''

		You may resist the blandishments of nature , but you can not whether you `` love '' nature or are indifferent to her exclude them alto - gether from your consciousness .

		Reading after a walk in the country is quite another matter .

		Partly as a result of our phy - sical exertion , partly as a result of the poise and the keenness of our faculties that nature 's healing power brings , we find ourselves unus - ually alert and receptive .

		`` It is at night , and after dinner , ''
Stevenson	PERSON	wrote in `` Walking Tours , '' `` that the best hour comes . ''

		Tobacco and grog were never so satisfying , he goes on to say ; and if you read a book , `` you find the language strangely racy and harmonious ; words take on a new meaning ; single sentences possess the ear for half an hour together ; and the writer endears himself to you , at every page , by the nicest coincidence of sentiment . ''

		Al - though our critical judgment may suffer , we read more receptively then than at any other time ; there may be hours when we read more wisely , but there is no hour when we are more responsive , more quick to see the full meaning .

		No doubt it is significant , in this connection , to remember De Quincey 's description of Words - worth after the return of the poet from a long day 's walk , when his eyes had `` an appearance the most solemn and spiritual that it is possible for the human eye to wear . ''

		So difficult and so unsatisfactory is the habit of reading out-of-doors , that we are justified , I think , in calling it a fad .

		If we desire to ex - plain the attractiveness of the fad , it will be difficult , unless we assume the air of apology or charity , to avoid two conclusions : first , that nature woos the sensuous faculties of man , his lower faculties ; second , that nature , unfriendly to our intellectual faculty , reduces the mind to a state of inactivity that we find agreeable .

		In large measure the popularity of nature 's charms is due to our distrust and dislike of the intel - lect ; we become , for better or worse , '' too weak to bear The insupportable fatigue of thought . ''

		Might it not be well to eschew pocket editions especially adapted to superficial reading out-of - doors , and to brood over our `` Pendennis , '' Prometheus Unbound , '' and the rest at home ,
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 421 in our libraries , where we are free to animate our whole self and not merely our sensuous self ?

		Further , if we insist on the delightfulness of reading out-of-doors , let us carry to the stream - side and the pine-grove , not books that require prolonged concentration , but rather anthologies and brief essays , the wafers of the mind rather than the staff of life .

		Then let us munch and ruminate as thoughtfully as the singing birds and buzzing insects will permit .

		NORMAN
FOERSTER	ORGANIZATION	.

		CAS
UAL	ORGANIZATION	COMMENT .

		THE DECLINE OF THE SMALL BOOKSHOP furnished Mayor
Gaynor	PERSON	with a theme for regretful reminis - cence in his recent address before the booksellers ' convention in
New York	LOCATION	.

		His friend Mr.
Simon Brentano	PERSON	calls him `` a great book-knower , '' and be - lieves that his words `` will mean a good deal to the booksellers of this country , and will increase their interest in good books . ''

		Mr.
Gaynor	PERSON	said , in open - ing : '' One of the things that I have observed since I left my country home and came to large cities is the decline of the retail bookstore in the large cities .

		Why , over in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, where I live , and here in
Manhattan	LOCATION	which some people call
New York	LOCATION	, although it is only a little bit of
New York	LOCATION	, you know there used to be any number of small book - stores .

		We used to lounge around in them ... How many happy hours , and sometimes hours of exaltation , have I spent down in
Miller	ORGANIZATION	's bookstore in
Nassau Street	LOCATION	, for instance .

		There I pored over the curious books of the world as well as the choice and ordinary books . ''

		The multiplication of books has not , the speaker feared , correspondingly in - creased the real reading habit , the weighing and pondering of what is worth while in literature .

		His genial remembrance of the book-browser in musty bookshops recalls regretfully the time , not so very long ago , when the Old Corner Bookstore in
Boston	LOCATION	was the daily haunt of both writers and readers of good literature .

		There the young
Lowell	PERSON	offered to
Emerson	PERSON	his tribute of admiration for the
Concord	LOCATION	transcendentalisms verse , and there
Longfellow	PERSON	and
Whittier	LOCATION	and
Holmes	PERSON	were familiar figures in the congested alcoves of the friendly book-dealer .

		But to-day we telephone to the department-store for the latest sensation in fiction , and bookstore book-chat is less and less heard in the land .

		HOW TO READ ONE HUNDRED BOOKS A DAY , which the librarian who wishes to make himself an author - ity on the literature of his own language alone ought , in theory , to do , is a problem to dismay the stoutest heart , or rather the most vigorous intellect .

		Alii - bone 's '' Dictionary of Authors '' estimates the num - ber of books published in the English language up to the
year 1870	DATE	at six hundred and fifty thousand ; and the rapidly increasing annual rate of publication since then would surely bring the present total well up toward the three-quarter-million mark , if not be - yond it .

		Allowing three hundred working days in the year , we find that to go through this stupendous mass of printed matter at the rate of one hundred works -LRB- not volumes -RRB- a day would require twenty - five years of toil ; and meanwhile the accretions of that quarter-century would be piling up as another Hercules-task for the reader .

		But luckily ninety-nine hundredths of what is published in the literature of knowledge soon becomes superseded by later re - searches , and fully forty-nine fiftieths of the litera - ture of power speedily ceases to appeal with any living interest to the great mass of readers , or even to any single reader .

		Therefore the problem of mas - tering the literature of our own tongue reduces itself to comparatively manageable proportions ; otherwise the conscientious librarian would be driven to insanity or suicide , or both .

		The librarian of the
Vancouver Public Library	ORGANIZATION	said in an address at the third annual conference of the
Pacific Northwest Library Associ	ORGANIZATION	- ation , whose proceedings are now published in con - venient pamphlet form : '' There is no doubt that the salvation of the librarian depends upon the depth , the width , and the extent of his reading .

		And he must continue to read , read , and read again , or he is certainly lost . ''

		This is put rather strongly , for rhetorical effect ; but certainly it is in large part by reading that the librarian is to work out his own sal - vation as well as that of those who look to him for intellectual quickening and sustenance .

		PRESIDENT HIBBEN 'S CONCEPTION OF A LIBERAL EDUCATION , as set forth in his inaugural address at
Princeton	LOCATION	, deserves at least a passing comment of approval .

		The time-honored `` humanities , '' in his scheme of education , are not to be slighted in favor of all sorts of new-fangled electives .

		`` The hit-and - miss choice of an immature mind in new surround - ings , '' he well says , `` forms a poor propaedeutic to the serious tasks of free investigation , of original thought , and of practical efficiency . ''

		The student `` must be so led in the way of knowledge that he will come to know something of the human world in which he lives , something also of that world of the past whose achievements are his heritage , something of the form and spirit of its classical languages and literature , something of its history , its art , customs , manners , morals , and institutions in a word , he must know the thought of the world which possesses universal meaning and universal significance . ''

		As to training in his mother tongue , `` certainly the educated man should be able to understand his own language with some appreciation of its power and beauty , be able also to speak it as to the manner born and not as a barbarian , and to express himself by the written word in such a manner as to reveal and not obscure his thought and feeling . ''

		After this grounding in the essentials of liberal culture , some freedom of election may be allowed the student in his choice of studies ; but , emphatically , `` the uni - 4-22 THE DIAXi -LSB- Jun , 1 , versity is not specifically designed for the purpose of fitting a man directly for the daily duties of his future work in life .

		It should attempt to develop the whole man . ''

		Nothing new or startling , to be sure , in all this ; but every word of it sane and rational and never out of season , however often repeated .

		CONTRIBUTORS TO `` THE LYRIC YEAR , '' the forthcoming volume of competitive verse which will appear under the auspices of Mr.
Mitchell Kenner	PERSON	- ley , publisher , and Messrs.
Edward J. Wheeler	PERSON	and
William Stanley Braithwaite	PERSON	, appraisers of poetry , will be selected from the five hundred or more aspi - rants who will have submitted their compositions on or before
the first of June	DATE	, when the competition closes and the three prize-winning poems will be de - cided upon , out of the one hundred that are to be sifted from the two thousand or more manuscripts and published .

		It is reported that every State in the
United States	LOCATION	is represented in this scramble for poetic honors -LRB- and emoluments -RRB- , and that one con - fident competitor has had the hardihood to ask for an immediate partial payment on account If a pecuniary incentive and the excitement of competi - tion can produce immortal verse , `` The Lyric Year '' will be an immense success : and its editors appar - ently believe that
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	will prove splendidly re - sponsive to the spur with which he has been pricked , for they say : '' If anything ails American poetry , it is lack of encouragement and recognition .

		It is sur - prising how cordially both the lowly and the great have responded to every demand for a high stand - ard and for faultless verse .

		It is significant , too , how susceptible the young writers are to enthusiasm and attention . '

		The Lyric Year ' hopes to help the poets to win public attention , and to aid in the struggle that confronts our writers . ''

		If after this there remain any mute inglorious Milton * bashfully shrinking behind their own modesty , it will not be the fault of the projectors of `` The Lyric Year . ''

		THE REHABILITATION OF SOILED LIBRARY BOOKS , were such rehabilitation possible and practicable , would be a heaven-sent blessing to readers of deli - cate sensibilities , and would save much expense now incurred in replacing with new copies the vol - umes that in a too unsightly manner attest their ex - treme popularity .

		Perhaps some inventive genius will before long give us a washing-machine that shall do for begrimed books what certain machines , now being tested at
Washington	LOCATION	by the government , are said to do for the much-thumbed and stained greenbacks and yellowbacks that are daily returned to the treasury department for redemption .

		In two minutes one of these machines will restore a dis - reputable rag of paper money to something like pristine freshness and crispness .

		Another machine , of a slightly different pattern , does it in three min - utes .

		A thousand notes , it is estimated , can be regenerated at an expense of only
twenty cents	MONEY	.

		Water and soap and chemicals and heated cylinders , with more or less employment of brisk whirling motion , cooperate to separate the stamped paper from its accretions of dirt and its invading colonies of germs .

		It is true that a bound book is a very different thing from a simple oblong slip of excep - tionally strong and durable paper .

		But to inven - tive genius all things are possible , and we shall continue to hope that some day every library will possess , as an indispensable part of its equipment , an inexpensive , easily-operated , and thoroughly effective book-cleaning machine .

		THE LITERARY BKXT may be regarded , in some instances , as not so much a positive and conscious leaning toward letters as a disappointed drawing - back from everything else .

		Many a man has been cradled into authorship by disgust with law or med - icine or theology or business or teaching or some other of a thousand occupations uncongenial to him .

		An article having the ring of a real confession ap - peared the other day in a prominent journal .

		It purported to have been written by a woman author who signed herself A. II . ''

		Of her first ill-directed endeavors to find herself and her life-work we read , among other frank confessions , the following : `` Looking back a long way upon my teaching record , I marvel that I was able to hold myself for three years to an occupation that filled my soul not merely with dislike with loathing .

		Perhaps it was because the years were so unbearable that during them I first tried to write . ''

		Literary success by no means came at the first call .

		Various trying experiences followed , and yet , all through that involvement , which shook life to the centre of me , I had remained obsessed by the need of outside expression for inside experience , everything , even the most passionate of human inter - ests , remaining for me subordinate to the will and intention to write . ''

		And after ten weary years of seemingly fruitless striving , of repeated rebuffs from editors and publishers , the first glimmer of success dawned in the shape of an acceptance of a short story ; and after that the path of letters seems to have shone more and more unto the perfect day .

		And yet there are not a few who think it must be so easy to write a book , and so simple to make a fortune out of its sale .

		A POSTSCRIPT TO `` THE PROMISED LAND , '' that notable bit of intimate autobiography which has already passed into a second edition , is furnished by its author in a recent interview .

		`` I want to make the point , '' she is reported as saying , '' since I have an opportunity , that in
Russia	LOCATION	emancipation through a liberal attitude in religion is impossible for the Jew .

		On my recent visit to Polotzk I saw signs of the struggle of the younger generation to put aside all that separates them from the world around them in order to be merged with their neighbors ; but it is all in vain .

		The young men shave , the young wives refuse the wig , they all speak Russian , they join an occasional
Gentile	PERSON	friend at a table that is not kosher they seek to bridge their separation in every possible way , even at the cost of their parents ' broken hearts .

		But what good does it do them ?

		THE DIAL 423 The schools are closed against them as jealously as ever , they are hounded and crippled as mercilessly as before , they have lost the firm anchor of their old faith and have gained no compensating haven .

		A reformed Jew is still a Jew .

		The Russian gov - ernment does not want the Jew in any guise .

		No degree of conformity will save the Jew in
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Not until a successful political revolution has up - rooted all the blind sins of the Russian autocracy will there be any hope of emancipation for the slaves of the Pale . ''

		No wonder
Mary Antin	PERSON	rejoices at her timely escape to the land of promise .

		THE LIMIT OF FORBEARANCE TOWARD BOOK - THIEVES has been reached by the authorities of the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	Public Library , whose branches have for years suffered considerable losses , chiefly it appears at the hands of mischievous or dishonest children .

		Patience and a hope of better things gave way at last to a sorrowful conviction that the kindest thing to be done , for parents and children alike , was `` to give the would-be thieves such a thorough scare as might be the means of restraining them and their associates from getting deep into the habit of steal - ing till they finally ended in becoming full-grown criminals . ''

		Accordingly fifteen little rascals -LRB- ras - cals in the making -RRB- were haled into the Children 's Court , while other cases were handled by the par - ents of the culprits ; and `` the results have been , that in every branch where a boy has been made an example of there has been a decrease in the num - ber of losses , missing books have been slyly returned to tables by children evidently startled by hearing of the arrests , and the effect upon the boys ' habits has been good . ''

		The
Children 's Court	ORGANIZATION	and its wise and humane judges are warmly praised .

		We are glad to infer from the official report that petty thieving has not been practised to any great extent by the girls .

		Perhaps , however , they were more adroit and less easily caught in the act ; at any rate , they seem to have been spared the shame of public prosecution , but doubtless they will take to heart the object lesson given them that the way of trans - gressors is hard .

		... A GOOD WORD FOR AMERICAN JOURNALISM was spoken by our late visitor , the inspiring and gifted Professor
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	.

		Upon his departure from
Amherst	LOCATION	, where his lectures and talks on Greek literature and Greek culture gave unmeasured satis - faction , he expressed himself -LRB- to the ubiquitous in - terviewer -RRB- on sundry other subjects besides .

		Among other things , we are told that he said : `` You have more really good newspapers than we have .

		In fact , we have rather few really good newspapers .

		Our papers used to be penny papers , but now they are most of them sold for a ha ` penny , and they don ' t seem to be able to get out a very high-toned publication for that price .

		I do n't think we could produce so many liberal-minded , well-informed pa - pers as you do , like the
Springfield	LOCATION	` Republican , ' the
Boston	LOCATION	` Transcript , ' and the
New York	LOCATION	` Even - ing Post . '

		The general tone of the papers is better over here , and the standard of your editorials and special articles is very high . ''

		Perilous always is .

		the sweetness of praise , but perhaps not much harm will result in this instance if due allowance is made for our friendly guest 's natural unwillingness to say anything unpleasant to his entertainers as he bows his good-bye .

		Farewell speeches , like after-dinner oratory , are more than likely to contain consider - able `` tail talk , '' and should be subjected to a very liberal discount .

		... THE SALE OF THE SECOND PART OF THE HUTH LIBRARY is set f or
June	DATE	5-7 and 10-14 , at
Sotheby 's	ORGANIZATION	, in
London	LOCATION	.

		The first sale of
last November	DATE	cov - ered only items under A and B in alphabetical or - der , and brought a little over a quarter of a
million dollars	MONEY	.

		This second instalment will be of about equal size and probably of equal or greater market value .

		Early estimates of the
Huth	PERSON	collection 's pecuniary worth , when the will of its late owner be - came the sensation of the day in the book world , placed it at about
one million dollars	MONEY	.

		Since then the prices commanded at public auction by the treas - ures of the Hoe collection have caused a consider - able revision of former estimates , and now the
Huth library	ORGANIZATION	is expected by some connoisseurs to realize more than twice the sum originally named , or even as much as two and one-half millions , even with the deduction of the fifty choicest items given by the testator to the British Museum .

		So rich a collec - tion of unique and of exceedingly rare literary treas - ures has probably never before been offered at public sale .

		The sixty thousand pounds which the collection is said to have cost the
Huth	PERSON	family in the course of its gradual acquisition is not unlikely to be octupled in the total amount finally received at the successive sales .

		AN AUTHORS ' UNION , wearing somewhat the as - pect of the familiar trades-union , is being planned in
New York	LOCATION	by prominent American writers .

		The proposed association or league will resemble the Author 's Society of
England	LOCATION	and the
Gens de Lettres	ORGANIZATION	and the
Soci & t6 des Auteurs Dramatiqites of France	ORGANIZATION	.

		It will be a business organization for the protection of the pecuniary interests of its members and , in a general way , of literary workers as a class .

		The affairs of the society will be managed through bureaus , one of contracts and collections , one of legal ser - vice , one of general information , and so on .

		A lit - erary agency will be established .

		Annual meetings will be held by the association , and its energies will be directed toward such reforms as the improvement of copyright laws and the prevention of various forms of literary piracy that still prevail .

		Playwrights as well as other authors will be represented in this com - prehensive league for mutual defence , and it is to be hoped that women may share equally with men in the benefits to accrue from the new movement .

		Mrs.
Kate Douglas Wiggin	PERSON	is a member of the provisional committee on organization .

		The names of many of 424 THE DIAL -LSB- .

		I une 1 , our leading authors , especially our younger authors , are prominent on the list of those associated with this praiseworthy enterprise .

		* LITKKAKY PARALLELS might be found for certain forms of expression that are just now making them - selves exceedingly familiar all over the country .

		For example , merely as a matter of historical and literary interest , and without regard to other considerations , it is carious to note the resemblance between the fol - lowing two utterances , the first having as its author a prominent American of our own time , and the second occurring in the public papers of the
Comte de Chambord	ORGANIZATION	, Bourbon pretender , a generation ago , to the throne of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		I typify and embody the great cause which can only be furthered by support - ing me . ''

		That is the American way of putting it .

		and this is the French way : `` I am the necessary pilot , the only one capable of guiding the ship to port , because I have for it a mission of authority . ''

		Again , in our native idiom : '' Every man who believes in decency and honesty in politics ... can achieve his purposes only by supporting my candidacy '' ; and in the French style : '' With the cooperation of all honest men and with the grace of God I may save
France	LOCATION	, and I will . ''

		Not without reason did the Preacher affirm that '' the thing that hath been , it is that which shall be : and that which is done is that which shall be done : and there is no new thing under the sun . ''

		A LINGUISTIC PRODIGY who can conceal his thought in twenty-three languages is not met with every day .

		Sir
Charles Eliot	PERSON	, the new head of
Hong Kong University	ORGANIZATION	, has in the forty-seven years of his life shown a remarkable aptitude for acquiring for - eign tongues .

		In his
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	days he won highest distinction in the classics and also captured the Bo - den Sanskrit scholarship and the Syriac prize .

		Sub - sequent service as diplomat in various countries has enabled him to extend his familiarity with strange tongues until now he is credited with the command of twenty-three , not including such acquaintance with the Yankee idiom as he may have acquired during his secretaryship of the
British Embassy	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION
fourteen years ago	DATE	.

		His scholarship is attested by his excellent Finnish grammar , pub - lished in
1890	DATE	.

		He has also held with distinction the vice-chancellorship of
Sheffield University	ORGANIZATION	.

		A GENUINELY AMERICAN LITERARY SHRINE , which should prove a strong attraction to pilgrims , is the house at
Hannibal	LOCATION	,
Missouri	LOCATION	, where the great - est of our humorists was born , and which has re - cently been presented to the city of Hannibal by Mr. and Mrs.
George A. Mahan	PERSON	, themselves natives of the same State that gave to the world
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	.

		At the presentation ceremonies a bas-relief portrait of
Missouri	LOCATION	's most distinguished son and an inscribed tablet were unveiled , and school children as well as older persons of local prominence took part in the proceedings .

		And now , before planning one 's pilgrimage to
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	this

		SOME OUTDOOR PHILOSOPHERS .

		* It is a comfortable philosophy , that which the outdoor enthusiasts arrive at as a result of living with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, and one worthy of being adopted at least for the summer-time by anyone who can believe it . ''

		Leave your office , your books , your cares , and even your friends , '' they say , '' and go live in a tent by yourself , absorbed in the really vital things of life , such as growing grass and falling rain .

		Learn there that even the ques - tions of indoor philosophy are not to be worried about .

		Matter ?

		What does that matter so long as you are sure there is a blue-bird nesting in yonder stub ?

		Soul ?

		Why do you bother about terms , so long as something within you thrills to the cardinal 's whistle and the oriole 's fluting ?

		God ?

		You will never find Him if not in the silent sunrise or the hushed radiance of sunset . ''

		To these philosophers the natural life of roan is life in the open , and cities are the excrescence of a mistaken civilization .

		On this subject Mr.
Stan ton Davis Kirkham	PERSON	, author of `` Mexican Trails , '' `` East and West , '' `` In the Open , '' etc. , has written a thorough - going book which unfolds many wise and some witty conclusions arrived at by the philosophic mind in enjoying Nature .

		The author believes , like
Thoreau	PERSON	, that a person should live in the present rather than in '' a dead yesterday or an unborn tomorrow , '' and like
Stevenson	PERSON	that he can be happy `` just thinking '' ; that the begin - ning of wisdom for any man is to become ac - quainted , in solitude and serenity , with his own character , since `` nothing shall bring him peace but himself '' ; that ; to learn from
Nature	ORGANIZATION	is not to humanize outdoor life , but '' to acquire the bird 's point of view '' ; and that if a person keeps himself open to `` the Cosmic Emotion which is joy in
spring	DATE	and sadness in the autumn ... he may find himeelf in the forties with an unabated relish for
Nature	ORGANIZATION	, the same suscepti - bility to this mysterious magic play that he felt at twenty . ''

		People who love to wander afield and ruminate will find Mr.
Kirkham	PERSON	expressing their point of view very well , especially in such fundamental articles of faith as this : OUTDOOR PHILOSOPHY .

		THE DIAL 425 '' Perhaps it is the very living out-of-doors , the wooing of the silence , that has taken the zest out of the life of being amused ; but if I have sold all my goods for a single pearl , it is with the assurance that this pearl out - weighs the world .

		It has proved a good bargain , yet it was made because the fates compelled it made by one in a dream , only to find he had dreamed the immortal truth .

		When men talk of their beloved trade it would be of no use for me to tell them my business is on a larger scale and is concerned with eternal and universal things ; that I deal in
Truth	LOCATION	and find it more profitable than their feeble ventures .

		As for property of which we hear so much , if I should tell them my estate extends from
Canada	LOCATION	to
Guatemala	LOCATION	and of the satisfaction I have had in familiarizing myself with it they would not in the least understand .

		How poor would I feel if I did not own the mountains and the desert as poor as the rich themselves ! ''

		Of the same tenor , but more given to objective description , is Mr.
W. S. Blatchley	PERSON	's `` Wood - land Idyls , '' the record of some
summer	DATE	outings in western
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		The preface recommends that everyone with a week to spend betake him - self to the woods all alone , and live with a canvas cover for a roof , three bent wires for a cook - stove , fish and berries of his own acquiring for food , and a
spring	DATE	for a hydrant .

		There the sun will be his alarm-clock , and the whip-poor-will his vesper bell .

		Beside
Racoon Creek	PERSON	or
Walnut Creek	ORGANIZATION	the writer has spent his vacations , watch - ing the green heron fish , finding the prunella in its glen , stretching himself on the ground `` with nose deep among the grass-roots '' to inhale the good earthy smell and feel himself `` one of the countless billions of parasites thus rendering homage unto his mother , '' and receiving without complaint the downright visits of ''
J. Pluvius	PERSON	. ''

		He makes such a way of life seem so easy and so alluring that the most hide-bound city-dweller must needs be convinced of its feasibility .

		The same philosophy in the main appears in Mr.
Tickner Edwardes	PERSON	's `` Neighbourhood , '' but modified by the writer 's different experience .

		If you live in the city you must run away to enjoy Nature ; but if you live in a blissful little English village like
Windlecombe	PERSON	, in the midst of the
Sussex	LOCATION	downs , where Mr.
Edwardes	PERSON	has done his work '' for half a life - time back , and may claim fairly to have won his villagership , '' you can love and cultivate Nature and your neighbors at the same time .

		`` Neighbourhood , the daily interchange of thought and word and kindly deed , is a necessity for all healthy human life , and the natural medium of all true advancement . ''

		So Mr.
Edwardes	PERSON	writes about his sturdy , hard - working , quaint-mannered neighbors , as well as about the downs , the starlings , the bees , and the sheep , and produces a most delightful book .

		There is an engaging chapter in which
Daniel Dray	PERSON	, the old wheelwright ,
Tom Clemmer	PERSON	, father of the village blacksmith of the same name , and other ancients drop into reminiscence of their sweet-hearting days .

		One of them bears this unconscious witness to the fact that
Ann White	PERSON	- field has her prototype : '' ' Eighteen thousand happy days , ' said he triumph - antly , ' agen six weeks o ' rough and tumble pore

		Lor ' bless ye !

		Iknowed then what a ' meant , I did !

		I wur allers th ' sort as could see through a brick wall fur as most folk : never warnted no more 'n an ` int . ' ''

		Many of the author 's walks are taken with '' Reverend , '' the blind rector of the parish who sees so much through his other senses and his memory that he almost betters his companion 's observation .

		All the traditional beauty of the '' shy , still '' English country is theirs to enjoy the wood-carpet of anemones and primroses in
spring	DATE	, the nightingale 's song in
June	DATE	, the glow of poppies in the wheat in
summer	DATE	, the rich green of the ivy in the autumn when other color is gone .

		These are described with a vividness which makes it seem that the writer has added his blind friend 's sensibility to his own keen vision .

		Besides the human element , such things as hiving the bees , sheep-washing , and harvest have their place in his regard .

		This is his report of the close of a threshing day : '' As the sun went down behind the hills , and left the world afloat in wine-colored mist , every sound of work ceased in the village save this rich throbbing voice of the threshing mill up at the farm .

		I went out into the dreaming light to listen to it .

		From where I sat on the church-yard wall , I could make out that they were prolonging the work into the dusk , so that the last rick might be finished now , and the threshing gang move on tonight to the next farm .

		There was the deep sound of the mill itself , one tremendous baritone note succeeding another , each held for a moment , and then suddenly changing to one higher or lower in the sonorous clef .

		Apart from this , I could distinguish the fuss and fume of the engine , as it drove its white breath in little un - steady gusts up against the violet calm of the sky .

		And there was another sound the flapping song of the driv - ing belt a note that punctuated everything , as though some invisible conductor were beating time to the gen - THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, eral symphony .

		Hut the combined effect of all was infinitely harmonious and restful .

		Yet I had come out , in the main , to hear , not this familiar part of the music , but something about it that I loved most of all ; and this was the stopping of the machine .

		It was almost dark before the last sheaf went to the mill , and steam was shut off .

		And then the won - derful note began .

		The machine took an appreciable time to run down .

		But now there was uo upward inflec - tion of its voice .

		Note by note , each note more drawn out and quieter , the rich tones fell through every stage of an octave , until they died away in the profoundest , softest bass .

		Even then I fancied I could feel the solid earth still shuddering with a music too deep for human ear . ''

		One can venture without fear the prediction that this will become a classic among Nature books , since it considers Nature , as it should be con - sidered , the setting and enhancement of human life .

		Some very charming illustrations supple - ment the text .

		Assuredly the weak point of most Nature books is their lack of humor .

		They are subdued in tone and pensive , so that they do not .

		take the strongest hold on us .

		Not so `` The Jonathan Papers . ''

		These essays by
Elisabeth Wood	ORGANIZATION	- bridge , which have appeared from time to time in the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' or the `` Outlook , '' go well together in a book , and one can not take them up without thanking the Lord for humor .

		On a slight stretch they may be considered as form - ing a Nature book Nature with
Jonathan	PERSON	thrown in ; but they so objectify and vivify the experiences of these two people on their '' unpro - gressive farm '' that they are first of all a human document .

		The writer is one of the outdoor philosophers , and not only believes in getting her fill of beauty but in '' taking dessert first '' and dessert means to her `` to go out into the green beauty of the world , to fling myself down in some sloping meadow and feel the sunshine envelope me and the warm winds pass over me . ''

		She and
Jonathan	PERSON	run away from the city to go fishing a
spring	DATE	day when neither of them '' can get away '' ; they visit their
Yellow Valley	ORGANIZATION	in
March	DATE	in spite of wind and mud , shoot ducks in the salt marshes at ten above zero , and in various other ways prove themselves worthy of the happiness of living on a farm each year , from
April	DATE	until
December	DATE	.

		On the subject of grooming this farm they differ . '' '

		Do you remember
Jack Mason	PERSON	when he was mar - ried ?

		Face and neck the color of raw beef from sun - burn , and hair cropped so close it made his head look like a drab egg I ' '' ' I did n't notice , ' said
Jonathan	PERSON	. '' '

		No , I suppose not .

		Yon would have done the same thing you 're all alike .

		Look at hones !

		When men want to make a horse look stylish , why , chop off his tail , of course !

		And they are only beginning to learn better .

		When a man builds a house , what doe * he do ?

		Cuts down every tree , every bush and twig , and makes it '' ship shape , '' as you call it .

		And then the women have to come along and plant everything all over again . ' '

		But things need cutting now and then , ' said
Jona	PERSON	- than .

		` You would n't like it , you know , if a man never went to the barber 's .

		He 'd look like a woodchuck . ' '' '

		There are worse-looking things than woodchucks .

		Still , of course , there 's a medium .

		Possibly the wood - chuck carries neglect to excess . ' ''

		On other occasions , also ,
Elisabeth	PERSON	appears as the champion of the natural .

		``
Jonathan	PERSON	has nothing to do with my hens except to give advice .

		One of his hobbies is the establishing of a breed of hens marked by intelligence , which he maintains might be done by careful selection of the mothers .

		Accordingly , whenever he goes to the roost to pick out a victim for the sacrificial hatchet , he first gently pulls the tail of each candidate in turn , and by the dim light of the lantern carefully observes the na - ture of their reaction , choosing for destruction the one whose deportment seems to him most foolish .

		In this way , by weeding out the extremely silly , he hopes in time to raise the general intellectual standard of the barnyard .

		But he urges that much more might be done if my heart were in it .

		Very likely .

		But my heart id not .

		Intelligence is all very well , but the barnyard , I am convinced , is no place for it .

		Give me my pretty , silly hens , with all their aimless , silly ways .

		I will seek intelligence , when I want it , elsewhere . ''

		Such an one , we must echo , is a natural phil - osopher .

		And in justice we must add that she is also a very charming writer , since her essays not only sparkle with wit , but are full of de - scriptions of great delicacy and beauty .

		The general character of books on gardens and gardening seems to vary from year to year , doubtless to conform with variations of interest in those for whom such books are written .

		One year the garden-Jover may be in search of prac - tical help on the subject of hardy perennials or of hollyhock blights ; and in the next , his per - ennials may be doing so well , and his hollyhocks may be so thrifty , that he has time to turn to the history of the garden craft , or to the fillip that his fancy finds in the beautiful thoughts of GARDEN DESIGN IN THEORY AND PRACTICE .

England	LOCATION	, '' or Miss Jekyll may have found time to share her boundless store of garden - wisdom with an eager world .

		They are all good books , the alert and practical handbooks or the leisurely and scholarly histories : since no book can lack in interest in which the processes by which a plant has been , or may be , brought from seed to seed are faithfully recounted , and no page can be utterly dull on which are printed those flower names which have always meant so much to mankind .

		America will never equal
England	LOCATION	in the prac - tice of gardening .

		The advantages of soil and climate are all with the mother-country ; and our own land , with its long hot summers and long cold winters , offers many new gardening prob - lems which we are yet too young to solve intel - ligently .

		Among English garden books of the present season , the one which seems to offer the most help is Miss
Madeline Agar	PERSON	's '' Garden De - sign in Theory and Practice . ''

		Had she signed her work ''
M. Agar	PERSON	, '' no critic would have hesi - tated to refer to the author as being one of the sons of that
Adam	PERSON	who , in spite of his faults and of the '' endless woe '' he is accused of having brought upon his luckless descendants , is still the patron-saint of gardeners .

		An immense amount of knowledge concerning all that lies at the root of good gardening is evident in Miss
Agar	PERSON	's pre - liminary chapters on sites , aspects , soils , fertili - zers , drainage , road-building , walls , hedges , water-supplies , etc. .

		Then follows the more in - teresting section of the book , in which the good growing things which are to adorn the finished grounds are set forth in all their ageless beauty .

		Written primarily for English owners of estates of more or less magnitude , the book is neverthe - less full of helpfulness for the American owner of a mere fragment of an acre , since it will in - spire him to do his best with what he has , and to add field to field .

		About once a year Mr.
Eben E. Rexford	PERSON	gathers together a sheaf of the notes which he writes for the various journals to which he is a constant contributor , and sends them forth in book form .

		`` Amateur Gardencraft '' is the title of his latest volume , which is concerned with lawn and field no less than with the garden .

		Mr.
Rexford	PERSON	's advice is always sound and al - ways clearly written , and this new volume `` for the home-maker and garden lover '' should find a wide field of usefulness .

		Miss
Hanna Rion	PERSON	gives a pleasant indication of her attitude toward the garden in the im - pulsive title she has chosen for her cheerful book , `` Let 's Make a Flower Garden . ''

		She reveals herself on one of the first pages , where she says : '' In all the world 's classics none con - tain the inexhaustible lure , the enchantment , the dream material , to be found in seed cata - logues . ''

		After such an introduction , one has a right to look for all sorts of happy-go-lucky experiences and experiments ; nor is one dis - appointed .

		Who ever before thought of sowing the freshly-spaded strips of earth between the blossoming rows of the strawberry-bed with
Drummond	ORGANIZATION	's phlox ?

		Yet who , reading of
Miss Rion	ORGANIZATION	's success in this experiment , does not long to imitate her venture ?

		What delver in the dirt can withhold sympathy with her assertion that `` a garden planned for you by someone else would as little fit your needs as a friend 's ad - vice would solve your own private life-riddles '' ?

		And how pretty to call the plot devoted to iris and lilies , '' Kingdom Come '' ! ''

		Let 's Make a Flower Garden '' is an uncommonly pleasant and valuable little book , full of good sense and practical helpfulness .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's '' Popular Garden Flowers '' is the third of a trilogy of garden books to the making of which the author has brought much experience and much devotion .

		In this latest volume , he has arranged the familiar garden - flowers alphabetically , giving each one a chap - ter , in which he outlines its story , its place in folk-lore , its various names , with a hint of what the poets have had to say concerning it , and then a careful series of directions as to its prac - tical needs .

		The chapters on transportation and exhibiting are of little present use to Americans , who , as far as flower-shows are concerned , are poor to the uttermost verge of poverty ; but perhaps they will help to ring in the better days that are to be in this respect .

		If it were not for her memory of the gardens of the Old South , sweet with the unforgotten scent of numberless roses , it is quite possible that Mrs.
Georgia Torrey Drennan	PERSON	had never written her monograph on `` Ever-blooming Roses , '' which would have been a great pity .

		There is sure to be wide welcome for a new book on the flower which has always and every - where reigned supreme in men 's hearts ; and so constantly is the culture of the rose leading to newer and greater triumphs , that there is a con - stant demand for new handbooks on the subject .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, Mrs.
Drennan	PERSON	's lists are particularly valuable , as using the nomenclature of American growers .

		Among other features , she gives us old recipes for preparing the delicate confection known as candied rose-leaves , for the distillation of rose - water , and for the compounding of pot-pourri , all gentle occupations of more leisurely days which it will be well to have reinstated in the household .

		Mr.
Henry H. Saylor	PERSON	dates his enrollment in the ancient and honorable guild of rosarians from the hour in which he found a well-thumbed copy of good old Dean Hole 's ` Book about Roses '' in an old bookshop .

		How many feet have been guided into the way of peace by that beloved gospel , and how many a lesser epistle has been inspired by that dear divine !

		Mr.
Saylor	PERSON	's little handbook on '' Making a Hose Garden '' has much to offer of practical suggestion .

		Its list of '' Dependable Roses '' is excellent , and its plan for a rose garden suited to the moderate purse and limited time which the average amateur is able to devote to the goddess is worthy of much praise .

		IN THE WONDERLAND OF TRAVEL .

		.

		* The
summer	DATE	travel season is upon us , and with its advent there comes from the press a goodly num - ber of books to tell us where preeminently the thirst for romance and natural beauty and artificial won - ders is to be quenched .

		Not that any one journal of travel or formal guide-book can prescribe for every variety of this thirst ; but it will be strange if some one or more out of the season 's supply of such pub - lications can not be of help to any undecided vaca - tioner casting about in his mind where to spend his TRAVELLER 'S TALKS .

		summer holiday .

		A half-score of the most noteworthy and promising of these travel books are here to be noted with too great brevity , perforce , but with cordial commendation of their several excellences .

		A chance to see the great world came somewhat late in life to `` The Princess , '' as the author of `` Traveller 's Tales '' exultantly calls herself , lit r Prince being the personified Opportunity who has pushed his way to her through the hedge of thorns and led her forth to roam over
Europe	LOCATION	for one delight - ful year , whose memorable incidents are chronicled in letters to a friend at home .

		Landing , with the `` Laird '' and the `` Child , '' at
Antwerp	LOCATION	soon after the death of
King Edward	LOCATION	, the writer sees the sights of
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Spain	LOCATION	, ending her travels with a second visit to En - gland and a view of the coronation ceremonies , which she pictures in a few brisk and telling strokes of the pen .

		She has the gift of imparting novelty even to the hackneyed by describing it simply as she sees it through eyes that have been bathed in the fountain of youth .

		`` To the young in spirit the world keeps open late , '' she takes pleasure in quoting at the open - ing of her first letter .

		Many illustrations , chiefly from photographs taken by the '' Child , '' adorn the book , some chapters of which had already enjoyed public favor in a prominent journal before being col - lected and added to and issued in the present book - form .

		An excellent account of the Oberanunergau sacred drama , the decennial repetition of which luckily occurred in the
summer	DATE	of the writer 's travels , occupies one chapter .

		The freshness and readability of these `` traveller 's tales '' will arouse the interest even of a jaded reader .

		The brilliant splendors of color-pictures are for once , at least , not out of place in conveying some notion of the glow and the magnificence of our western wonderlands in the
Sierra Nevada	LOCATION	region , among th
Rocky Mountains	LOCATION	, and along the Grand Canyon of the
Colorado River	LOCATION	.

		`` Three Wonder - lands of the American West , '' by Mr.
Thomas D. Murphy	PERSON	, would be a noteworthy book even without its numerous reproductions of paintings by Mr.
Thomas Moran	PERSON	.

		With these illustrations and its other decorative features the volume becomes a work of art as well as a useful guide-book and a treasury of first-hand information for the nature-lover and the tourist .

		Thirty-two uncolored pictures are added to the sixteen from Mr.
Moran	PERSON	's brush , and three maps help the reader to get his bearings in the
Yellowstone	LOCATION	and Yosemite parks and the Grand Canyon , which are the '' three wonderlands '' chosen for detailed de - scription .

		Some further wonders of the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast region furnish matter for a few supplementary pages and pictures .

		A passage from Mr.
Murphy	PERSON	's preface , describing his earlier incredulous attitude toward the alleged wonders of our great West , may strike a re - sponsive chord in some of his readers .

		He says : '' I was only languidly interested until it chanced my good fortune to see several original painting * by
Thomas Moran	PERSON	, the wizard who comes nearer than anything excepting a personal visit in presenting to the eyes the true spirit < > t
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 429 these wonderlands , and making one realize their glorious color and grandeur .

		I found myself wondering if it could be possible that there was such an enchanted land as he portrays such a land of weird mountains , crystal cataracts and emerald rivers , all glowing with a riot of color that seems more like an iridescent dream than a sober reality .

		It may be on account of this very scepticism that thousands ne ver see the most inspiring marvels of our own country . ''

		That unrivalled authority on the wonders of our far West and of our great national parks from whom Mr.
Murphy	PERSON	takes occasion to quote at some length in his book , has himself just produced a volume of description and of personal adventure in the
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia paradise of the Yosemite valley .

		`` The Yo - semite '' Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	calls his book , and in this engaging fashion it begins : '' When I set out on the long excursion that finally led to
California	LOCATION	I wandered afoot and alone , from
Indiana	LOCATION	to the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	, with a plant-press on my back , holding a generally southward course , like the birds when they are go - ing from
summer	DATE	to winter ... All the world was before me and every day was a holiday , so it did not seem import - ant to which one of the world 's wildernesses I first should wander . ''

		That was in the
spring of 1868	DATE	, when to some of us all the world was young , and to others of us there was not yet any world at all .

		To Mr.
Muir	PERSON	it certainly was a fresh and interesting world , and his account of the portion of it then first opening to his view catches much of the charm with which it was invested for him .

		The natural-history notes that occur in some abundance increase the book 's value to the student .

		Maps and striking landscape views are generously supplied .

		A long-cherished desire on the part of Mr.
Dillon Wallace	PERSON	to see some of the wilder sections of the
Rocky Mountain	ORGANIZATION	region , and to visit the big game ranges and study the game conditions there , was at last gratified in the
summer of 1910	DATE	, when he had an opportunity to make a two-thousand-mile journey on horseback from southern
Arizona	LOCATION	to
Montana	LOCATION	, most of the way without guide or other companion .

		The story of this expert survey of the chief remain - ing haunts of our too-rapidly disappearing big game , with advice and suggestions as to the course to be fol - lowed if these denizens of the wild are not to be exterminated , is issued in a volume appropriately entitled `` Saddle and Camp in the Rockies , '' and adorned with numerous illustrations from photo - graphs taken by the author .

		The ways of the human as well as of the animal residents of this vast region are touched upon by the observant soli - tary horseman , and his narrative , divided into twenty - one chapters of never wearisome length , is excellent reading .

		But those who are acquainted with his `` Lure of the Labrador Wild '' and other books of hunting and exploring will know well enough what sort of good things to expect in this latest volume .

		The serious purpose of the book , however , should not be lost sight of amid its attractions of passing anecdote and graphic description .

		Blithe was the mood of Dr.
J. Johnston Abraham	PERSON	when , sentenced by his physician to a long banish - ment from
England	LOCATION	for his health 's sake , he took passage in a tramp steamer for the far East .

		He himself t it appears , had been educated for the medi - cal profession , or at least he was a qualified surgeon , for in that capacity he became one of the `` Cly - temnestra 's '' company when she weighed anchor at
Liverpool	LOCATION	and turned her prow toward Port Said , the first port touched in a rambling trading cruise in the Orient .

		An abundance of miscellaneous incident and page after page of lively conversation , with a multitude of camera views along the way , insure the reader of `` A Surgeon 's Log '' against tedium .

		As a specimen of the author 's fluent and unstudied style , here is a passage from a chapter devoted largely to
Batavia	LOCATION	: '' It was distressingly close not a breath of air stirred .

		The heat was sweltering , and every one moped .

		Without the Chief , somehow no one seemed inclined to think of amusement .

		I busied myself taking photographs in the immediate neighborhood of Tanjong Priok .

		Once I elabo - rately stalked a policeman , to find , after painfully mancen - vring to get him into a good light , that he was itching to have himself snapshotted all the time , and so my wariness had been all unnecessary .

		He posed himself delightedly , pulling his sword well round to the front , and then demanded ' comshaw . '

		A cigarette completely satisfied him . ''

		A happy choice of title , a liberal use of anecdote , historical and legendary , and a generous supply of pictures , are some of the leading attractions of Mr.
Blair Jacket	PERSON	's `` Windmills and Wooden Shoes , '' a book for the intending tourist of
Holland	LOCATION	, and equally enjoyable if the reader has already toured that country , or even if he is content to confine his touring to stay > at-home travels of the literary sort .

		The writer attempts no extraordinary , out-of-the-way excursions in his Dutch sight-seeing ; perhaps there are no such unusual routes to be found in so small and densely-peopled a land .

		The old and familiar has its charm no less than the new and strange .

		Mr.
Jaekel	PERSON	's frequent scraps of history pleasantly recall one 's Motley , and even arouse a desire to re-read the stirring chronicle of little
Holland	ORGANIZATION	's defiance of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		The occasional departures from approved English idiom in the pages of the book need not shock one ; perhaps they indicate a greater famil - iarity with the language spoken in the land of windmills and wooden shoes than with that heard in the country of skyscrapers and the latest pattern of fashionable foot-gear .

		The intimacy and vivacity of private correspon - dence have imparted a certain liveliness and humor and pleasing personal tone to Miss
Rosalind Travers	PERSON	's `` Letters from
Finland	LOCATION	. ''

		She is best known as a writer of poetry , and when she undertook to produce a book of travel she felt somewhat at a loss how to go about it .

		`` Be concrete and personal , and avoid generalities as you would poison , '' was the advice of a trusted friend .

		Naturally she found it impossible to follow this counsel undeviatingly in a descriptive work ; but she kept it before her as an ideal , and it seems to have influenced her style in a manner likely to please her readers .

		The letters cover the period from
August , 1908	DATE	, to
March , 1909	DATE	, and are agreeably interspersed with fragments of verse , both 430 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, original and translated .

		As illustrating the book 's happy blending of the concrete , sometimes .

		even the commonplace , and the sublime , we quote this from the middle of the volume : '' For once I am writing to yon from one of ' the best hotel * ' -LSB- the
Cascade Hotel	ORGANIZATION	at Imatra -RSB- .

		No doubt they respond to aome deep-seated need of human nature , but , for my part , I only find them expensive and depressing .

		They charge twice as much as the smaller inns , and since neither the wash-stands nor the supply of hot water are doubled what does it benefit one ?

		I can not eat twice as much food as usual , and I do not want a band during meals . ''

		Here of course one pays for the neighbourhood of Imatra .

		Resist the temptation to call it
Imatra	LOCATION	, for , like all Finnish words , it has the accent on the first syllable .

		The renown of this very mighty waterfall is ancient , and has gone out into all lands .

		It is mentioned in the
Kalevala	LOCATION	by
Jouka	PERSON	- hainen , ' He , the meagre youth of
Lapland	LOCATION	, ' the singer who matched himself against Vainamoinen ... '' Imatra is so magnificent that it can bear its fame , and not shrink when the Finns call it the finest cataract in
Europe	LOCATION	, for it is the overflow of a thousand lakes , the trib - ute of Saima and all his brethren of the north . ''

		Pictures from photographs , paintings , and drawings help the writer to interpret the beauties and the won - ders of
Finland	LOCATION	.

		Readers of the French poet Mistral , and of our own Mr.
Janvier	PERSON	, stand in need of no solemn assur - ance that the Midi exerts a charm on all but the stolidest visitors .

		Still more will the visitors them - selves subscribe to all that Mrs.
John H. Mason	PERSON	-LRB-
Caroline Atwater Mason	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has to say in its praise in her tasteful volume , `` The Spell of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		It was not , she tells us , until she had journeyed through southern
France	LOCATION	that the spell of the country was laid upon her .

		From
Lyons	PERSON	to the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	, and from the
Riviera	LOCATION	to the Spanish frontier , she conducts her readers `` among the mountains and rivers of Old
France	LOCATION	; among the mighty remains of an earlier civilization ; among its legend-haunted castles , churches , and abbeys ; among fields of olive and vine , and the roses and nightingales of
Provence	LOCATION	; among the green pastures and sweet waters of the
Pyrenees	LOCATION	; under the palms and pines and orange groves , the sky and air of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	. ''

		Description and history and personal adventure are judiciously mingled in Mrs.
Mason	PERSON	's leisurely chap - ters .

		The book is one of a series , of which she has already written `` The Spell of
Italy	LOCATION	, '' and like the previous numbers this one is profusely illustrated from photographs .

		The motor-car , with the good roads it has brought in its train , has in the last few years laid open
Algeria	LOCATION	, a country of magnificent distances and admirable highways , to the novelty-seeking tour - ist Mr.
Charles Thomas-Stanford	PERSON	, F.S.A. , has pro- duced a good book of such random sight-seeing in
Algeria	LOCATION	as was only made possible by this coexist - ence , in time and place , of the petroleum chariot and the macadamized road . ''

		About
Algeria	LOCATION	'' is the short and sufficient title of the work , with a sub - title indicating that attention is devoted chiefly to
Algiers	LOCATION	,
Tlemcen	LOCATION	,
Constantino	ORGANIZATION	,
Biskra	LOCATION	, and
Timgad	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the author 's preliminary mention of previous book - writing tourists in
Algeria	LOCATION	, he asserts that `` the guide-books to
Algeria	LOCATION	, in the English language at all events , are , in view of modern conditions of travel , hopelessly out of date , '' failing to note the recent publication of what is , in its way , an excellent up - to-date path-finder for the traveller , Mrs.
Emma Hurl	PERSON	.

		a nk Ayer 's fine volume , `` A Motor Tour through
Algeria	LOCATION	. ''

		Perhaps the book is of too recent date to admit of mention in the later work .

		A note - worthy chapter of the latter describes the ruins of the public library discovered at Timgad in
1901	DATE	, but not identified as a library until
five years later	DATE	, when the missing fragment was unearthed of a tablet as - cribing the founding of the institution to the Car - negie of his time , one
Julius Quintianus Flavus Rogatianus	PERSON	, a Roman senator and a native of
Tim	PERSON	- gad .

		The book 's plentiful illustrations help to dem - onstrate that
Algeria	LOCATION	is indeed `` a country brimful of interest , historical and actual . ''

		`` This book was written for those who stay at home , '' says Mr.
Lion Phillimore	PERSON	in presenting his volume of Carpathian wanderings -LRB- `` In the
Carpa	LOCATION	- thians '' -RRB- to the gentle reader .


Transylvania	LOCATION	and
Galicia	LOCATION	and
Moldavia	LOCATION	and
Wallachia	LOCATION	are not exactly every-day or even every-year haunts of English and American travellers , so that comparatively few read - ers are likely to be other than those who stay at home , as far as the
Carpathian Mountains	LOCATION	are con - cerned .

		The book abounds in scenes and incidents and characters sufficiently out of the ordinary to make its pages inviting .

		The author and his companion , ''
Bobby	PERSON	, '' seem to have had a considerable taste of `` roughing it '' in the remote regions visited ; but the beauties of the mountain scenery must have amply repaid them .

		From the abundant talk with the na - tives that gives liveliness to Mr.
Phillimore	PERSON	's pages we are tempted to quote an amusing dialogue -LRB- but will merely indicate its substance -RRB- betraying a cur - rent conception of
New York	LOCATION	as the capital of Eng - land and of the
United States	LOCATION	as the centre of the English-speaking world .

		Possibly this is a bit of the geography of the future .

		A map of the Car - pathians , with the route followed marked in red , is appended to the book ; but no pictures vie with the narrative in holding the reader 's pleased attention , nor does any index follow to obliterate the impres - sion of careless spontaneity on the part of the maker of the book .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		Ax important work announced for early autumn is the journal of
Macready	ORGANIZATION	, the famous actor , which has been prepared for the press by Mr.
William Toyubee	PERSON	.

		Mac - ready wrote up his diary with great regularity , and although Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	had access to the manu - script when preparing the '' Reminiscences '' that ap - peared two yean after
Macready	PERSON	's death , it WHS thought that the time had not come for allowing the many refer - ences to contemporaries to be published .

		This veto has now been removed , and the coming volumes will give us many fresh glimpses of
Bulwer Lytton	ORGANIZATION	,
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Brown	PERSON	- ing ,
Forster	PERSON	, Sir
Theodore Martin	PERSON	, and other members of
Macready	ORGANIZATION	's brilliant circle .

		THE DIAL 431 LIGHT ON THE DARK CONTINENT .

		* To the European reader the
Dark Continent	ORGANIZATION	pre - sents interests predominantly commercial and polit - ical in their origin and force , with the added zest of propinquity .

		To the American reader , on the other hand , the lines of interest are historical , racial , and in a unique way idealistic as evidenced hy the founding of
Liberia	LOCATION	, the
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	relief expedition , and the missionary enterprises of American origin ; while to these is added somewhat of the charm and attraction of the unknown and distant though the racial problems which the Ethiopian raises are ever within our doors .

		It is significant of the revival of interest in things African that this season sees so large a grist of books dealing with various phases of African life .

		Seven of the eight books here dealt with are of British authorship , and but one is writ - ten by an American .

		They view the land from many angles , from the points of view of the sportsman , explorer , administrator , or journalist , of friend or critic of British rule .

		A compact handbook of
Africa	LOCATION	copiously drawn from the `` Encyclopaedia Britannica '' -LRB- with due ac - knowledgements -RRB- and other sources , supplemented by a modicum of personal observation -LRB- apparently in

		These deal with the effect of

Congo	LOCATION	atrocities and other phases of commercial exploitation ; with the liquor traffic ; with the inborn laziness of the native , savage or educated , and his failure to accumulate property ; with the railway , of which the untutored savage makes immediate and abundant use .

		The need of an adequate economic foundation based on agriculture and technical edu - cation is urgent .

		Ultimately the author believes the continent must be a '' White Man 's
Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		Details of the appropriation of African territory by European powers , and the readjustments in progress or pend - ing , are set forth ; and we are given an account of the Cape-to-Cairo railway project .

		The author has compiled a helpful bibliography of over a hundred titles , covering especially the recent works on the subject .

		The most forbidding part of the
Dark Continent	ORGANIZATION	is the
Great Kalahari Desert	LOCATION	, where a few scattered Bushmen and wretched Hottentots eke out a miser - able existence .

		A picture of the wild life of these sandy wastes is to be found in Mr.
Arnold W. Hod	PERSON	- son 's `` Trekking the Great Thirst . ''

		The author 's duties as sub-inspector of the

		The main duties of the office which he held appear to have been the collection of the annual '' hut tax '' and the settlement of occasional tribal disputes .

		Be - yond checking destructive internecine warfare and regulating the destruction of big game , the govern - ment appears to render little service to the native peoples of these desert wastes in return for this tax , whose main purpose appears to be to stimulate or compel the native to labor for the white man .

		Judg - ing from descriptions and photographs , the term `` hut tax '' is severely stretched in applying it to the wretched wind-breaks of twigs and grass which the Bushmen call their homes .

		The writer fills his narra - tive of official tours with much detail of sport with hartebeeste , kudu ,
spring	DATE	bok , and eland , and of ad - venture with leopards and the more formidable king of beasts .

		Not less exciting are his tales of the great desert , of lost spoor and parched pan where the wandering denizens of the desert were once wont to drink at night .

		It is a very vivid picture of desert travel and sport , of the wild life of shimmering tree - less wastes and of the untutored savage , which Mr.
Hodson	PERSON	leaves in the mind of his reader .

		His illus - trations are abundant and unique in character .

		Miss
Marguerite Roby	PERSON	's account of her `` Adven - tures in the
Congo	LOCATION	'' is a book of wholly different character from Mr.
Hodson	PERSON	's , though she too was in search of sport .

		She traversed the wilds of
Central Africa	LOCATION	to the north of
Rhodesia	LOCATION	on a bicycle , alone except for native porters , starting at the rail end of the northern extension of the Cape-to-Cairo line and skirting the eastern margin of
Belgian Congo	LOCATION	, emerging by way of
Lake Victoria	LOCATION	at
Mombasa	LOCATION	, 432 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, exhausted by fever and stricken with blindness .

		Her main theme is a denial of the atrocities in the
Congo	LOCATION	attributed to the Belgians .

		Her attitude is significantly portrayed in these words : `` When the conquering white enters a black country , labour he must and will have , let the theorists rave as they will . ''

		She evidently acted upon this belief in her treatment of her blacks , for she seems to have ap - plied the chicotte to their bare backs on the slight - eat provocation , continuing this policy to the bitter end , and in spite of the fact that desertion , treach - ery , and sinister plot increased as she progressed on her journey .

		She quite fails to appreciate the sig - nificance of her one faithful boy ,
Thomas	PERSON	, in whose training the lash had no part .

		She saw no mutila - tions in her short journey on the edge of the rubber district ; she interviewed Belgian officials for her in - formation , and attributes the reported mutilations to native customs -LRB- doubtless a contributory factor -RRB- .

		But , according to her own story , she was sick and even delirious during much of her transit of the Belgian territory .

		Her inadequately-founded con - clusions might carry more weight had she not so flagrantly disregarded the canons of tropical travel in reckless exposure to fever , the tsetse fly , and noon - day heat , as well as in the use of liquor ; and had she not permitted a certain element of exaggeration to creep into her pages .

		The illustrations accom - panying her narrative are excellent .

		The hunting expedition , or `` safari , '' of a
London	LOCATION	barrister and an American sportsman in
British East Africa	LOCATION	round about M t .

		Kenai is described in Mr.
R. Gorell Barnes	PERSON	's '' Babes in the African Wood , '' a misleading title , for the enterprise was by no means infantile in proportions or success , and much of the hunt was carried on not in the woods but in grassy uplands .

		The author portrays vividly the long march , the cautious trekking , the patient watch by
night	TIME	for the return of the lion to his `` kill , '' and the more dangerous and exciting stalk of the elephant in the j ungle or of the wily '' rhino '' and treacherous buffalo .

		The work is written in entertaining style , with occa - sional lapses into jingling verse , and is abundantly illustrated from photographs often mediocre in quality and inadequately reproduced .

		An excellent chapter discusses outfitting for big-game hunting in
East Africa	LOCATION	, with details as to what to provide and where to buy it , and advice as to the qualifications and short - comings of the various tribes who serve as porters , gun-carriers , and stalkers .

		The sportsman or naturalist desiring to obtain a comprehensive account from authentic sources of the game animals , large and small -LRB- including even birds , reptiles , and fishes -RRB- , of
Africa	LOCATION	will do well to consult Major
R. Stevenson-Hamilton	PERSON	's `` Animal Life in
Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		The author has spent many years in travel and sport in tropical
Africa	LOCATION	, and since
1902	DATE	has been Warden in charge of the game preserve * for the
Transvaal Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		His opportunities for first-hand knowledge of his subject are unique , for he spent nine years `` not in hunting but in living among wild animals , studying their habits , and watch - ing them gradually loose their intense fear of man . ''

		The writer is catholic in his views , and a noticeable candor pervades his pages . ''

		Experience teaches that however incredible some narra - tive may appear at first night , it may really be a perfectly correct description of what took place ; and therefore the wider knowledge a man has of wild beasts and their ways , the less prone is he to disbelieve anything he may hear con - cerning them .

		Man , even savage man , is utterly outside the economy of wild life .

		There exists among the beasts of the forest a sort of freemasonry , to which he , and to some ex - tent his domestic animals also , are strangers .

		The observer little by little becomes conscious of this , and the longer he studies wild animals in their native haunts the more forcibly does he realize his ignorance of the motives which often con - trol their individual and collective actions . ''

		An exceptionally high ethical standard -LRB- if one may apply such a term to any phase of the bloody busi - ness of hunting -RRB- is revealed in his treatment of the principles which should control the sportsman .

		He condemns the use of inadequate weapons , and of shooting unless one is certain of a reasonable chance of securing his quarry ; and he is scathing in his estimate alike of the pot-hunter and of the so-called scientific collector who is a mere accumulator or who uses his license for profit-making .

		An extensive and detailed account of camp equipment and pro- cedure , of the sportsman 's outfit , and of independent travel in the wilds is given in the closing chapters .

		Appendices give in full the game laws and regula - tions for the various British dependencies in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		Several good maps , numerous photographs taken in the field , and a full index add to the value of the work .

		Colonel
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	contributes a '' foreword . ''

		The growing custom , followed in this book , of decapitalizing scientific names is to be de - plored .

		The remaining three books of our group deal with
Nigeria	LOCATION	and the
Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	, fever-stricken wastes of swamp , jungle , forest , and desert , which , thanks to the services of the
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine	ORGANIZATION	, are now open not only to trade and com - merce but to primitive forms of travel for those who are duly inducted into the necessary hygienic pre - cautions .

		British and French administration have brought order and safety for the wayfarer in all but the remotest corners of this ancient home of the slave-driver .

		Major Tremearne 's volume entitled '' The Tailed Head-Hunters of
Nigeria	LOCATION	'' is based on seven years ' experience as administrator in the re - mote wilds of
Nigeria	LOCATION	, among savage tribes upon whom allegiance to British authority rests but lightly and intermittently .

		A military atmosphere pervades the work , and the author is no disciple of Grotius , much less a defender of arbitration .

		He is , rather , a modern representative of the `` old fighting spirit which has made the British nation what it is , '' a true follower of those venturesome souls who single - handed seized the trade and grasped the n-ins of power of a continent With the sociological , educa - tional , and intellectual invasion of
Africa	LOCATION	he has less sympathy .

		THE DIAL 433 `` We are unfortunately educating the natives upon
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean lines , and the results are disastrous .

		A
Filani	PERSON	chief who is proud of his rank is a man no one can help admiring ; the ex-canoe boy with a smattering of Latin inspires one only with contempt .

		Our cantonments , too , are built according to English ideas , and we have spoiled the beauty of many a spot noted before for its loveliness .

		I suppose
West Africa	LOCATION	will some day be as safe as
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		A very desirable state of affairs for the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, perhaps , but heavens !

		how dreary ! ''

		The writer is of a scientific turn of mind , and intro - duces not only a narrative of his more exciting ad - ventures among these savage and often warlike peoples , but devotes most of his book to an account of the social economy , superstitions and customs , music , dancing , occupations , head-hunting propensi - ties , modes of travel , and folk-lore of the savage tribes of
Northern Nigeria	LOCATION	.

		Head-hunting is , or was , much the fashion among the warriors , and tails are still de rigueur for the women after marriage .

		These are not , however , of an anatomical nature , but rather curious constructions of beads and brass , often with a little iron bell added .

		Captain Hay wood 's `` Through Timbuctoo and across the
Great Sahara	LOCATION	'' is a vivid picture of the rapid journey of an English officer , familiar with West African travel , from
Freetown	LOCATION	in Sierre Leone along the Upper and
Middle Niger	LOCATION	to Timbuctoo and thence across the desert wastes of the
Sahara	LOCATION	to
Algiers	LOCATION	.

		The writer is evidently an experienced and observant traveller , keen to note whatever is novel and significant along his path , and he wields a facile pen in relating his narrative .

		He tells us much of sport , native customs , natural features , and the social , political , and economic features of the tribes with whom he came in contact .

		The most interesting and novel part of his story is his account of his trip from
Timbuctoo	LOCATION	to
Algiers	LOCATION	across the
Sahara	LOCATION	by camel , a race with thirst , and -LRB- at the season of his expedition -RRB- with death itself , for wells are few and far between , yield at the best but scanty supplies of water , and may go dry .

		A single mis - hap such as a straying camel , a broken waterskin , or an exhausted well , and the caravan comes to an untimely end .

		Marvellous indeed is the skill of the Arab guide in finding his way across these trackless wastes of shifting sand , and no less wonderful the instinct of the camel which leads him to the well .

		The author 's vivid style and characteristic photo - graphs render his account of the desert very inter - esting and realistic .

		A newspaper woman 's account of a trip for `` copy '' along the coast of
West Africa	LOCATION	through
Sierre Leone	PERSON	,
Liberia	LOCATION	, the
French Ivory Coast	ORGANIZATION	, and the
Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	into German Togoland is to be found in Mrs.
Mary Gaunt	PERSON	's `` Alone in
West Africa	LOCATION	. ''

		Much to the ter - ror of
District Commissioners	ORGANIZATION	on whom the responsi - bility of her safe conduct fell , she performed the seemingly impossible feat of going by land with por - ters along this coast instead of by the usual trading steamers .

		It is not an encouraging report which she gives of conditions in
Liberia	LOCATION	, `` where the black man rules . ''


Monrovia	LOCATION	, the capital city , is without roads , and almost hidden by weeds and the jungle .

		A footpath leads to the Liberian College , and no one dreams of sanitation .

		The country lives on duties levied on goods in transit to and from the hinter - land , but local enterprise is wholly stifled in the ignorance and sloth of the descendants of slaves who misrule the land .

		The retrogression of
Liberia	LOCATION	is the more marked by reason of the prosperity and sanitation of other West African towns under Brit - ish , French , and German rule .

		The author praises most the thrift and enterprise noticeable in the Ger - man dependencies , where the methods of modern science are applied with thoroughness and often with a rigor to which the native is quite unwonted .

		This backwardness of the English settlements in contrast with those of the French , and especially the German , calls forth repeated comment .

		Miss Gaunt 's book is unique among those here reviewed in the historical atmosphere which pervades its pages .

		She tells us that in the days of slave-trader and buccaneer , when Fever was unchallenged monarch of the
Gold Coast	ORGANIZATION	, there sprang into intermittent notoriety along this shore a chain of forts or castles of English , French , Portuguese , and Danish origin , whose cemeteries filled faster than their courts or dungeons .

		Now they are all abandoned , and the trailing creepers of the jungle entwine their battlements , and shifting sands obliterate their defences .

		Quinine and the mosquito net are conquering the
Guinea Coast	ORGANIZATION	, and the quest for rubber is opening the jungle where the search for gold failed .

		434 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, and of reproducing the very form and pressure of the age and country in which her lot was cast .

		The work has been done in the most conscientious man - ner , and represents the labor of five or six years , during which period the subject has been studied not only in the light of the standard histories , but with constant reference to the sources .

		Every recorded word of
Anne	PERSON	's own writing , as well as every say - ing attributed to her by others , has been carefully weighed , and , wherever possible , incorporated into the narrative .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	papers of the reign , the correspondence of the
King	PERSON	, the Spanish ambassa - dors , the French court , and the Papal agents , the works of the old English chroniclers , have all been drawn upon for primary and collateral material , and used with skilful effect .

		A few inconsequential lib - erties have been taken , and are admitted , but in the main the work is faithful to fact , and will bear the scrutiny of the experts .

		The way in which the actual words of
Anne	PERSON	and others are introduced into the dialogue is admirably artistic , and the feeling of romance is blended with the truth of history in a fashion to deserve very high praise .

		The method above suggested would , in the hands of a less expe - rienced writer , be likely to result in an obviously artificial construction ; the joints of the framework would be too clearly in evidence , and the brocades would hang too stiffly .

		We get almost nothing of this from Mrs.
Bradley	PERSON	's deft cabinet work and investi - ture , but instead examples of living and breathing portraiture in a setting which suffers neither from over-elaboration nor from a pedantic insistence upon non-essentials .

		`` I have tried to paint , '' says the author , - ami to offer the
Anne Boleyn	PERSON	of this story , a very human girl , gay and fearless and rashly proud , as the likeness of that
Anne	PERSON	who dared and lost so long ago and whose blood was the first of any woman to stain an English scaffold . ''

		It would have been pain - fully easy , after the fashion of the Wardour Street school of historical fiction , to bedeck this narrative with rhetorical fustian and to bedew its course with tearful sentiment ; we notice with relief that Mrs.
Bradley	PERSON	has resorted to neither of these cheap devices , but has instead kept a high artistic aim well in sight as the tragedy inexorably develops and deepens to its close .

		We feel that the most episodical material introduced makes its contribution to the unity of the whole action , and the sense of tragic doom that comes with the closing chapters is like a storm-cloud that has been steadily gathering from the days of
Anne	PERSON	's blithe and light-hearted maiden - hood when she came to
England	LOCATION	from the French court , not unsophisticated , to see , to conquer , to win for herself the proudest rank the world could offer , and to realize in her downfall the vanity of all worldly ambitions .

		The chapters which bring her career to an end are made very fine indeed by the insight and power that they reveal , by their effect of artistic consummation , and by the distinction of their style .

		Much is to be expected from a writer whose first book exhibits such qualities as are to be found in `` The Favor of Kings . ''

		Middle-class society in an
Ohio	LOCATION	town of moderate size is minutely pictured by Miss
Dorothy Canfield	PERSON	in `` The Squirrel Cage . ''

		It is a microcosm of American society in general ; at least , of that sec - tion thereof which feeds its idealism upon `` The Ladies ' Home Journal , '' and its ambitions and its antics are vividly suggested by the metaphor of the title .

		Into this environment
Lydia Emery	PERSON	is plunged , after she is `` finished '' at a fashionable school and has had a year of foreign travel .

		Now
Lydia	PERSON	is a nice girl , who has some notion of the things that really matter , but she is not strong enough to assert her individuality until society has worked its mis - chief upon her .

		She is persuaded and cajoled into accepting the husband that her environment has predestined for her , a pushing and successful busi - ness man to whom the conventions of '' the squirrel cage '' are social principles not to be questioned .

		Meanwhile , a real man , who has flouted convention , and learned to support himself by his own hands , is there in the background , and is clearly the one whom
Lydia	PERSON	ought to have married .

		After several years of a mismated existence , the husband is killed in an accident , and the wife is left with one child in fact and another in prospect .

		She is morbidly convinced that she will not outlive the birth of the second child , and determines to entrust them both to the guardian - ship of the man who has turned his back upon society , hoping thereby to save their future from the dreary round of existence in `` the squirrel cage . ''

		Fortunately , her fears are not realized , and she is spared to shape for them and for herself a saner mode of existence than that which has well nigh proved her undoing .

		Miss
Canfield	PERSON	understands the folly of the sham and artificiality that clog most human lives , and satirizes it most effectively in her description .

		The picture is perhaps over-elaborated , but its truthfulness is beyond question .

		Miss
Katherine West	PERSON	, returning to her home in
Westville	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, after completing her education , which has included the study of law , finds Dr. `` NV > t , her father , under indictment for bribery in connec - tion with the construction of the municipal water - works system of which he has been in charge .

		He is one of the most highly-respected of
Westville	LOCATION	's citi - zens , enjoying the complete confidence of the com - munity , but the evidence that he has accepted money is convincing , and his plea that he thought the money a contribution to one of his philanthropical enter - prises seems too flimsy to be considered .

		The case goes against him , and he is convicted and sent to prison .

		Thus opens Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's '' Counsel for the De - fence . ''

		Then
Katherine	PERSON	gets busy , suspecting a deep - laid conspiracy having its roots in a morass of polit - ical corruption , and determines to reopen the case and secure her father 's rehabilitation .

		She gropes vainly about for evidence , but at length conies upon a clue , which she follows persistently to the cn < l , revealing the whole conspiracy , and accomplishing her father 's release .

		Her chief ally is the editor of a local newspaper , who has been particularly violent in his denunciation of Dr. West , but who is honest ,

		THE DIAL 435 although brutal in his methods .

		Katherine is at first repelled by him , then attracted , and finally a love - story of considerable intensity develops between them .

		His somewhat old-fashioned notions of what a woman should be and how she should comport herself are rudely shocked by
Katherine	PERSON	's activities , but he makes a graceful surrender when he realizes how effective her methods have been .

		The story is bluntly told , with a well-appointed plot and much dramatic force , and shows much intimacy with the sort of corruption , born of an alliance between busi - ness and politics , which is a festering sore in the life of so many American cities . ''

		Fate Knocks at the Door '' is Mr.
Will Levington Comfort	PERSON	's third novel , and again he impresses us by the opulence of his diction , by the range of his thought and observation , and by the intensity with which his characters are delineated and his situations unfolded .

		The underlying plan of the book is sug - gested by the structure of the symphony , and its four parts correspond to the four movements of the traditional sonata-form , being described by the con - ventional terms .

		In this there seems to be more of artifice than of reality , and if the table of contents did not give such a direction to our thoughts , the plan would not otherwise be apparent .

		That the writer has a deep sense of the power and significance of music is , however , made evident by many passages which could not have been written by one who had not felt music to be the most searching of agencies for the interpretation of life .

		It is through an ac - quaintance with the C minor symphony of Beethoven that the hero finds himself and comes to an under - standing with humanity , while the motto of that work , So pocht das Schicksal an die Pforte , supplies his story with a title .

		An even more appropriate title might have been borrowed from the closing words of `` Faust , '' '' Das Ewigweibliche Zieht uns hinan , '' for the book is essentially a paean in praise of woman - hood as the source of all spiritual beauty , and as the inspirer of everything in character that is lovely and of good report .

		Although of American origin , An - drew Bedient has been cast upon the world in child - hood , and by the time he is a young man has gained a rich experience of life on the seven seas , in
the Philippines	LOCATION	, in
Kashmir	LOCATION	, in
Australia	LOCATION	, and in the lands of the
Caribbean	LOCATION	.

		The Bible and the
Bhagavad	LOCATION	-
Gita	PERSON	have been almost his only books when he makes his acquaintance with American fiction .

		`` The love of man and woman which the stories in gen - eral exploited , struck him of Indian ideals as shifty and pestilential .

		The woman of fiction was equipped with every - thing to make her as common as man .

		She was glib , pert , mundane , her mind a chatter-mill , a creatiire of fur , paint , hair , and absurdly young .

		The clink of coins was her most favorable accompaniment , and her giving of self was a sort of disrobing formality .

		The men who pursued her were froward and solicitous .

		There was something of sacrilege about it all .

		The minds and souls of real women - such were not matters for American story ; and yet the Americans wrote with dangerous facility .

		Bedient , who worshipped the abstraction , Womanhood , felt his intelligence seared , calcined ... Only here and there was a bit of real litera - ture usually by a woman .

		The men seemed hung up to dry at twenty-five .

		There was no manhood of mind . ''

		In contrast to this conception of woman , we have the hero 's own , which is thus formulated : '' I believe that woman is the bread-giver , spiritual and material ; that it is she who conserves the ideals and rewards man for fineness and power when she has a chance .

		But I also believe that woman must conquer in herself the love of luxury , her vanity , her fierce competition for worldly position if only for the disastrous effect of such evils upon men .

		They force him to lower his dreams of her , who should be high-priestess .

		... It is woman who has turned the brute mind of the world from war , and woman will turn the furi - ous current of the race to-day from the pits of trade , where abides the twentieth century lie . ''

		In the face of such an idealism as this , how pitiful appears the ambition of women to achieve the vote , or to force themselves into the occupations which belong to men !

		There is a great deal of rhapsodiz - ing in this book , and it clogs the plot considerably , but a plot there is , and a fairly interesting one .

		It chiefly concerns Bedient , and the young woman ar - tist ,
Beth Truba	PERSON	, predestined to be his soul-mate .

		He finds her in
New York	LOCATION	, and the conquest , though difficult , is complete .

		Bedient has large possessions in
Equatoria	LOCATION	, which is a Spanish island-republic in the
Carribean	LOCATION	, and the narrative acquires swift dra - matic action and vivid coloring in the closing chap - ters , which deal with an abortive revolution in that toy state .

		It is like the whirlwind finish of Mr.
Comfort	PERSON	's last year 's novel , with the rumblings of Mont Pel ^ e for a chorus .

		The mysticism with which this book is more than tinged is not unpleasant , and gives it a special distinction .

		The style is at times affected to the point of turgidity , but at its best strikingly poetical and full of pregnant meanings .

		The sort of scientific sensationalism which was made popular in fiction by
Jules Verne	PERSON	, and of which Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	has been one of the most successful exponents in more recent years , has been resorted to in `` The Second Deluge , '' by Mr.
Garrett P. Serviss	PERSON	, the well-known popularizer of astro - nomical knowledge .

		The book tells of one
Cosmo Versal	ORGANIZATION	, astronomer and physicist , who observes a slight dimming of the stars in a certain quarter of the heavens , and who , by means of a special spec - troscope of his own invention , is enabled to prove that aqueous vapor is the cause of the obscuration .

		From these facts he concludes that a vast watery nebula has strayed into the solar system , and that the earth is making straight for it .

		It means con - densation sufficient to envelope the globe with a film of water six miles deep , and the consequent extinction of all the land fauna , mankind included .

		Although Versa '' Fs predictions are supported by the most cogent reasoning , his warnings to the learned societies and governments of the world go unheeded , and he becomes an object of derision .

		He advises people everywhere to build arks while there is yet time , and himself sets the example by constructing an enormous vessel of levium fa newly-discovered metal -RRB- , capable of providing accommodations for one thousand people .

		When the disaster becomes 186 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, imminent , this ark is the sole refuge of humanity .

		and it is filled with selected guests , representative of what is best worth preserving of the human race , besides being stocked with animals .

		As the earth nears the outer spirals of the nebula , there are pro- digious portents , and when the deluge comes , the ark floats on the waters , and is navigated over the sub - merged continents , until it floats above the crest of the
Himalayas	LOCATION	.

		All of the race has perished except the remnant inVersaTsark , a few forehanded French - men who have escaped in a submarine , and a group of refugees in
Colorado	LOCATION	, who have been saved by a fortunate `` batholite , '' or forcing up of the earth 's crust in that region by pressure from beneath .

		Mr.
Serviss	PERSON	shows great inventiveness in the development of this story of a twentieth-century
Noah	PERSON	, and his book is a fair match to Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's romance , '' In the Days of the Comet . ''

		The story ends with the beginnings of a new organization of human society in the
Rocky Mountain	LOCATION	region , at a time when the absorption of the waters has once more brought
Mount Everest	LOCATION	and the Thibetan plateau above the surface .

		Those who remember pleasantly `` The Colonel of the Red Huzzars '' and `` The Princess Dehra , '' by Mr.
John Reed Scott	PERSON	, will welcome the entertain - ment provided in `` The Last Try , '' which tells of the later fortunes of some of the characters in those romantic inventions .

		The story is dated five years after the successful establishment of Dehra and her American consort upon the throne of
Valeria	LOCATION	, and the discomfiture of the pretender Lotzen .

		It tells of Lot/en 's last desperate effort to gain his ends , in - cluding several attempts to assassinate the
King	PERSON	, the kidnapping of the Princess , her exciting rescue , and the sword conflict in which
Lotzen	ORGANIZATION	pays the final penalty for his misdeeds .

		The scene of the ear - lier chapters is in
Washington	LOCATION	, but the action is soon transferred to
Valeria	LOCATION	, where the atmosphere becomes thick with plot and counterplot , with intrigue , conspiracy , and exciting adventure .

		It is all stuff of a very artificial sort , but fairly good of its kind .

		Mr.
Burton Stevenson	PERSON	is one of our most success - ful spinners of detective yarns , and his `` Mystery of the Boule Cabinet '' holds the attention unrelaxed .

		That villainous piece of furniture is guilty of several baffling murders , for it has two secret drawers , and one of them is protected by a
spring	DATE	which injects hydrocyanic acid into the knuckles of those who fool with it .

		whereupon they keel over and die .

		This is the device of Crochard the Invincible , genius among French criminals , who has stolen the Michaelovitch diamonds and hidden them in the protected drawer .

		He then contrives to have the cabinet shipped to
America	LOCATION	to the address of a well-known collector of antiques , and , himself following , indulges in various machinations to recover possession of it He finally gets away with the jewels , to the discomfiture of the French police agents , whom he tricks most inge - niously and outrageously .

		Mr.
Leonard Merrick	PERSON	is an English novelist , hav - ing a dozen or more books already to his cn - < lit .

		\ \ h < ha - been winning golden opinions from discriminat - ing critics , and who certainly deserves a wider popu - larity than he has hitherto enjoyed with American readers .

		The publisher who has recently undertaken to introduce him in this country has just put forth `` The Position of Peggy , '' a new work , and `` The Actor-Manager , '' one not quite so new .

		Both are concerned with the theatre in
England	LOCATION	and with the lives of the player - folk .

		The subject is one that Mr.
Merrick	PERSON	knows through and through , and he - Iral - with it sympathetically .

		His method is that of un - affected simplicity and naturalness , a method which is content to give a plain transcript of real conditions , and which aims neither at ingeniously strained situ - ations , nor at sensational effects .

		The actors who are Mr.
Merrick	PERSON	's heroes and heroines are in no way showy persons of widely-advertised fame , but humble members of the profession who find it hard to make a bare living , and who know at first hand the full meaning of the struggle with poverty .

		In each of the novels before us we are concerned with a man and two women .

		One woman is the wrong one , with whom the man gets entangled before he is old enough to make a wise choice , and the other is the right one , who saves him from the error of his youth .

		In '' The Position of
Peggy	PERSON	, '' there is a long engagement , broughtabout and kept up by the chivalry of the hero , but it does not lead to marriage , because
Peggy	PERSON	's heai 1 is turned by her success in musical comedy , and she turns from her former lover to one of her gilded admirers , which leaves the former free to follow the promptings of his heart In `` The Actor-Manager , '' the hero marries one of his associates , only to discover that she is vain , selfish , and worldly , which means a hopeless clash between her ideals and his own .

		A divorce smoothes the path for the woman whom the hero has come to love , and the curtain goes down upon a prospect of happiness to come .

		One passage in this book is so timely , as expressing the aims and ideals of those who are now engaged in the Herculean task of making the stage a vital influence for good upon our modern life , that it deserves quotation .

		It is the vision of the `` actor-manager '' for whom the book is named . ''

		I see a small theatre , and at this theatre the one literary medium for the drama is n't held to be the baldest prose ; poetry is neither divorced from the stage , nor limited to Shakespeare it is thought possible to test the work of a poet who has not had centuries of advertising !

		But the realist is as welcome as the poet ; oh , he is welcome !

		Only the plays are literature , and they are real plays .

		The men and women live !

		They are not puppets pulled by inexorable strings through four acts to a conventional end .

		Reward for virtue and punishment for vice are shown to exist in the soul , and not in material success and failure .

		To depict the world as a school , where virtue wins the prize and vice gets a flogging , is immoral .

		The parts around me are n't written down to bring my part into greater prominence .

		The dramatist who comes to me is free ; free to be true to his own convictions and his art ; free to choose his characters where he will , and to trace their legitimate development , free to make the ` lost * woman noble , and the ` godly ' woman vile for such things are !

		THE DIAL 437 all humanity would point the moral when it needed pointing .

		The real playwright is your real optimist your real Christ - follower , for he shows that sin does n't mean damnation , and that there is redemption for the pure in heart .

		The one command laid upon him is to see things nobly that his deeper vision shall help the crowd . ''

		The Irish humorist known as ``
G. A. Birming	PERSON	- ham , '' who was introduced to the American public a few months ago by the republication of a group of three of his novels , `` Spanish Gold , '' `` The Search Party , '' and `` Lalage 's Lovers , '' reviewed in our issue of
Feb. 16	DATE	last , now claims our attention for a fourth book , `` The Simpkins Plot . ''

		Here , as in `` Spanish Gold , '' we make the acquaintance of the
Reverend J. J. Meldon	PERSON	, curate of
Ballymoy	LOCATION	, and his friend , Major Kent .

		The parson , who is as audaciously resourceful as ever , finds an object for his dark devices in an attractive young woman whom he meets on a railway train , bound like himself for Ballymoy .

		She is in reality an inoffensive woman of letters , a niece of Sir
Gilbert Hawkesby	PERSON	, and has taken an Irish country house for the
summer	DATE	, in order that she may have a quiet place for her work .

		But it so happens that she closely resembles a mur - deress who has been acquitted only the day before by an emotional jury , in the face of a terrific charge by Sir
Gilbert	PERSON	himself .

		The parson , having seen illustrated newspaper reports of the case , mistakes his travelling companion for the murderess , and , en - gaging her in conversation , seeks to draw her out .

		He becomes quite convinced of the identification , and when he learns , on reaching
Ballymoy	PERSON	, that the peace of the place has recently been disturbed by the doings of a meddlesome government inspector named Simp - kins , who has become very unpopular in the com - munity , he sets about planning ways and means for the removal of this inconsiderate intruder .

		Believ - ing that the young woman is guilty of the murder of her husband , and assuming that she would cheer - fully murder another , having `` got away '' with her first experiment in crime , he determines that Simp - kins shall be persuaded to make love to her .

		If the match is accomplished , it will prove a convenient and expeditious way of ridding the village of his undesired presence .

		The rest of the story deals with his devices for bringing the two together , and for getting them interested in one another .

		Unfor - tunately for the parson 's hopes , the Major himself becomes enamored of the young woman , and when Sir
Gilbert	PERSON	himself appears upon the scene , the guest of his niece , the whole imaginative fabric upon which the plot is based crumbles to the ground , and
Simpkins	PERSON	is saved , from matrimony if from nothing worse .

		The whole farcical situation is handled with great skill , and with much joyous exhi - bition of the humors of Irish character .

		The par - son is the same loquacious , audacious , and inventive person who figured in `` Spanish Gold , '' and it is refreshing to be once again in his society .

		This irresponsible light-hearted comedy is an ideal book for the lazy
summer	DATE	hours .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		VARIOUS BOOKS FOR SUMMER READING .

		Outdoor scenes An anthology so distinctly worth while and thoughts that one is surprised that it had not from
Whitman	LOCATION	.

		be en attempted before is `` The Roll - ing Earth '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a little volume of passages on Nature and out-door life selected from
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's poems and diaries .

		Much has been said of Whitman 's curious blending of egoism with the sense of brotherhood ; his more intemperate disciples have written of his resemblance to Christ ; and hostile critics have attacked his exhibitionism and his indif - ference to artistic form .

		But few writers have fitly emphasized his attitude toward Nature as Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	, his life-long friend and fellow observer , has done pithily and charmingly , in an Introduction contributed to the present volume .

		In these varied and well-chosen selections ,
Whitman	PERSON	speaks in his own person , watching `` God 's calm annual drama '' with never-failing sympathy and receptivity .

		Insect and bird , tree and flower , dawn and twilight , noon and night , sea and land , and the inscrutable `` rolling earth '' itself , all are represented here , and before all of them Whitman stands fervid yet reverent , seek - ing to read `` the unspoken meanings of the earth . ''

		In this reading ,
Whitman	PERSON	, like his contemporary
Thoreau	PERSON	, was greatly aided -LRB- and hindered at times , no doubt -RRB- by his delicate and powerful sensuousness .

		With him , the sense of smell , for instance , normally the most sluggish of the senses , was extremely active .

		There is an `` exquisite smell of the earth at day - break , '' and the night has a '' natural perfume belong - ing to the night alone . ''

		The odor of apples , of the cedar , and of Indian corn , pervades many of his pages .

		Corn when gathered has an aroma `` rich , rare , ripe , peculiar , '' and at night is `` just-palpable . ''

		He was fond of just-palpable odors , but he loved also the strong perfume of lilac blossoms .

		The complex im - pressions of the
night	TIME	, he says , came to him chiefly through the sense of smell .

		`` There is a scent to everything , '' he wrote in his diary ; `` even the snow , if you can detect it no two places , hardly any two hours , anywhere , exactly alike . ''

		And what is true of his sense of smell is substantially true of his other sensuous faculties .

		So highly did he value these that he even spoke of the `` soul senses , '' and asserted that the spirit receives from the body no less than it gives .

		Significantly , one of the commonest words in his writ - ings is `` absorbing . ''

		He absorbed anything as bulky as
Kanada	LOCATION	, or as impalpable as the dusky green of the cedar .

		Everything in Nature fresh air , swamp odors , the song of the wood - thrush was to him so much spiritual food .

		In most of Whitman 's great - est poems `` When Lilacs Last in the
Dooryard Bloom	ORGANIZATION	'd , '' `` Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking , '' `` Crossing Brooklyn Ferry , '' and isolated passages such as that beginning '' I am he that walks with the tender and growing night , '' Nature is more promi - nent than the democratic propaganda that
Whitman	PERSON	was impelled so insistently to set forth .

		The mysti - cal revelation of
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's meanings came to him , it 488 THE DIAL , -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, should be noted , on a `` transparent
summer	DATE	morning '' when , as he says , he and his soul lay together on the ground -LRB- a passage which , unfortunately , has not found its way into this collection -RRB- ; and throughout his life
Whitman	PERSON	sought to bring everything to the test of the open air all books , all observation , all philosophy and religion .

		He spoke his own poems to the wind , and bade his readers do likewise .

		Born and bred on - fish-shaped
Paumanok	LOCATION	, '' with clover and winding lanes and `` cow-processions '' about him , and the moody ocean rolling its waves to the shore almost within hearing distance , he learned to love Nature , both pastoral and wild .

		Gentle Nature he celebrated especially in his diaries covering the years of his convalescence in
New Jersey	LOCATION	; wild Nature , generally the ocean , he celebrated constantly in his verse .

		The little volume embodying the best of this writing has been given an attractive setting by its publishers .

		Kindred in lightness of mood and man - ner an ^ * n an intention to reveal the unsuspected charm of every-day liv - ing , are two volumes of recently-issued essays , one , called `` First and Last , '' containing a fresh supply of Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	's dainty trifling -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- ; the other , `` Romance and Reality '' -LRB- Kennerley -RRB- , being practically Mr.
Holbrook Jackson	PERSON	's introduction to our reading public .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	is of the school of
Chesterton	ORGANIZATION	and
Belloc	LOCATION	; in thought he has closer affinity with
G. K. C.	PERSON	, but the graceful rather than forceful style of his essays is nearer to Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's gentle , genial way of putting things .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	opens fire with a distinctively Chestertonic declara - tion . ''

		I like to do nothing , to sit by a fire in winter , or in a garden in
summer	DATE	; to loaf on a sea-beach with the sun on me ; to hang over a pier-head and watch the waves in their green and white tantrums ; to sit in a brasserie on a Parisian boulevard with a common bock , and the people moving to and fro ; ... to forget haste and effort in old empty churches , or drowsy taverns ; to rest by a roadside hedge , or in a churchyard where sheep browse ; to sit on a fence these things please me well . ''

		Work , in Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's philosophy , is a necessary and almost universal evil ; possibly , too , it adds rel - ish to idleness , to the happy margin of real living for which it provides the means .

		Doing nothing involves , for Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	, besides sitting about in pleasant places , `` going to Nowhere , '' along the open road with its wayside treasures , or by city streets that never yield up the full richness of their humanity to the man who is hurrying somewhere .

		It involves , also , an acceptance of the gospel of ''
Peter	PERSON	- pantheism , '' a realization that , in the capacity for pure joy of living , '' the most superb adult is a dis - mal failure beside a child making mud pies or a kitten chasing its tail . ''

		And with the spirit of youth , of play and make-believe , with the love of `` going to Nowhere '' and seeing much by the way , go a hot distaste for the noisy trafficking of our '' hucksters ' age , '' a deep pity for the hopeless , hunger-tamed wrecks of humanity , who , borne down by the struggle , have lost their capacity for joy and become almost indifferent to pain , and an enthusiastic appreciation for the men who are interpreting the age , and fur - nishing it with a varied gospel of betterment .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's `` Introductions , '' as he terms his casual interpretations of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Chesterton	LOCATION	,
Wells	ORGANIZATION	,
Robert Blatchford	PERSON	, and
Will Rothenstein	PERSON	, contain some of his most sincere and earnest work .

		Par - ticularly good , as is natural considering the kinship of their thought , is the Introduction to Mr.
Chester	PERSON	- ton .

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	's idea of amusing himself with life is to prick its popular fallacies and to supply odd data that will give color to its current commonplaces .

		The commonplaces he fronts squarely ; he has none of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's art of making them appear sud - denly new and strange .

		His way is to interpret them by parable , to tinge them with kindly irony , to look at them through the eyes of old men , to invest them with the great associations of history .

		`` First and Last '' contains many entertaining , if not momentous , discussions on such varied topics as cheeses , captains of industry ,
St. Patrick	ORGANIZATION	, the tide , the Public , and the
Battle of Hastings	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is just the sort of book to explore on a rainy holiday afternoon .

		Its adven - tures are quainter than Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's , less strenuous , less youthful .

		For a sunny , windy , sea-side holiday , Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's book will be in better tune .

		for the ^ ^ atte ntion to the traveller revised editions of Grant
Allen	PERSON	's ad - inltalv .

		mirable guide-books to
Venice	LOCATION	, the Umbrian Towns , and the Smaller Tuscan Towns , and especially to the new volume on the delightful group of little Tuscan cities ,
Arezzo	LOCATION	,
Pistoia	LOCATION	,
Lucca	LOCATION	,
Pisa	LOCATION	,
Siena	LOCATION	, and the rest , that are so deservedly dear to all lovers of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		These volumes -LRB- published by Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- are attractive and convenient in form , clear , orderly , well-written , and constructed on sound principles .

		While they are adapted typographically to the use of the hurried traveller , they assume a stay of some length in the fascinating towns they describe , and they therefore lead the visitor to the monuments in chronological sequence , so that , at the end of his stay , he may have a really organic impression of the city as a whole , of its history and its art .

		They are enriched with well-executed reproductions , from photographs , of monuments elsewhere for the sake of comparison with those de - scribed in the text .

		The idea is a good one , and might be carried further to advantage .

		But the great value of the series , in our judgment , resides in the emphasis laid upon what may be called the human , as distinguished from the exclusively art is tic , interest of the monuments .

		Mr.
Maurice Hew	PERSON	- lett somewhere says : `` The question whether this or that bad picture is by Duccio or
Cimabue	ORGANIZATION	is noth - ing to me .

		Sufficient is it that somebody painted the thing to somebody 's order .

		Now how near does it take me to those dead people in whoso country I stand ? ''

		This point of view is applicable to all pic - tures , good as well as bad , and indeed to all artistic production ; and it is to the credit of the editors of this series that they have adopted it .

		In the in -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAI , 439 troduction to the volume on
Venice	LOCATION	, Mr.
Allen	PERSON	wrote : `` Instead of looking upon monuments ... mainly as the product of this or that architect , I look upon them rather as material embodiments of the spirit of the age crystallizations , as it were , in stone and bronze , in form and colour , of great popu - lar enthusiasms . ''

		As a consequence , the traveller is led to see the human uses to which architecture and painting were put in the brave days of old , and it is impossible that such associations should not give a vitality and permanence to his impressions that they could hardly otherwise have .

		Naturally , this admirable principle is not perfectly carried out ; but , at least , the traveller who uses these guide-books will never be able to think of the churches he has seen as mere museums , nor the pictures as utterly divorced from the altars over which they once hung .

		The errors that we have noted are neither numerous nor important .

		The account of
Assisi	LOCATION	is perhaps , to a sensitive eye , unduly colored by the preconcep - tions of
M. Sabatier	PERSON	.

		At any rate , the interesting little chapel in the fields below the city , which
M. Sabatier	PERSON	, in defiance of tradition , calls `` the true
Rivo Torto	PERSON	, '' is dedicated not to
San Giovanni	LOCATION	, but to
San Rufino d'Arce	LOCATION	, a local saint .

		The
Sodoma	PERSON	frescoes on either side of the altar in the chapel of
St. Catherine	LOCATION	at
San Domenico	LOCATION	in
Siena	LOCATION	are wrongly described .

		The one represents the Stigmatization of the Saint at
Pisa	LOCATION	, the other the occasion when , not being able to go to the altar in
San Domenico	LOCATION	, she was communicated by
Christ Himself	ORGANIZATION	.

		Considering the great influence of
Catherine	PERSON	in her own day and her permanent hold upon the affections of men , it seems hardly justifiable to reduce her biography to the statement that she was `` the daughter of a dyer , born in
Siena	LOCATION	in
1347	DATE	. ''

		Finally , in the article on
Montefalco	LOCATION	, that little shrine of Umbrian art , there is a typical guide-book error , which is not common , we think , in this series , but which is worth noting for its moral .

		In the church of
San Francesco	LOCATION	, there is a group of three saints attributed to
Lo Spagna	LOCATION	, and named , on the canvas itself , `` S. Vicentius ,
S. Illuminata	LOCATION	, S. Nicolaus . ''

		These names the article accepts without question or comment .

		But inasmuch as the female saint is crowned and bears the palm and wheel , it requires no great knowledge of hagi - ology to identify her , in spite of the inscription , as
St. Catherine of Alexandria	ORGANIZATION	.

		Moreover , the name
Nicholas	PERSON	, without qualification , is misleading ; for in
Umbria	LOCATION	it generally means
Nicholas	PERSON	of
Bari	LOCATION	, while the saint so named in this picture is plainly
Nicholas of Tolentino	PERSON	, who flourished a thousand years later than the benevolent bishop .

		But these are trifles .

		The books are invaluable to all intelligent travellers in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		_ A hand-book of American forestry .

		^ est book on
American Forests	ORGANIZATION	, their use and conservation , that has yet been written ig Mr Si mon
B. Elliott	PERSON	's '' The Important Timber-Trees of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' just published by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are larger tree-books , sumptuous and expen - sive volumes dealing with our trees in scientific man - ner and telling us all about their relationships and their kinds ; but there is no other that gives us in clear and concise form the wisdom of the trees , the science of the forest .

		The author is a trained for - ester ; he has been for many years a member of the
Pennsylvania Forestry Commission	ORGANIZATION	, and so knows whereof he speaks .

		While we are all prone to ad - mire the forests , to grow eloquent in their praise , here is one man at least who with his associates is actually doing something to make these gifts of na - ture permanent , teaching men to use and not to de - stroy , to cover the mountains with the mantle of protection and not leave them to be ruined by the merciless erosion of the elements .

		Mr.
Elliott	PERSON	's handbook is so well arranged , so beautifully illus - trated , and so simple in style , that it can be enjoyed and used by everybody .

		The forest-owner will want it , to aid him in the care of his estate ; the lumber - man must have it and follow its counsels , or his in - dustry will perish ; the farmer will read it and learn to save his hillsides from erosion and his meadows from destruction .

		In short , this is a book on real conservation ; but it is a book on restoration as well .

		It tells us not only how to use the land that is ours , but how to retrieve the follies of yesterday , how to rebuild the waste places , how to save our soil - wealth from ultimate destruction .

		The first of the two parts into which the volume is divided is for the land-owner , who may learn here to plant the seeds of the grove , how to care for seedlings , how to transplant .

		The second part describes every valu - able forest tree of the country , and enumerates its qualities and its possibility of service in human in - dustry .

		The book as a whole is as timely as it is valuable .

		Its precepts must be heeded , and heeded now , if this nation would avoid the irretrievable disaster that has befallen Palestine and
Spain	LOCATION	.

		Amateurs as well as those more ad - vanced in the study of butterflies will rejoice over the very intelligible `` Butterfly and Moth Book '' by Mrs.
Ellen Robertson	PERSON	-
Miller	PERSON	.

		The book begins with the statement that `` the history of a moth or butterfly is a veritable fairy-tale , and of absorbing interest when we study the development of the insect through the four periods of its existence . ''

		The story of over thirty moths or butterflies is traced through the egg , cater - pillar , pupa , and winged stage , and made clear not only by the text , but by a wonderful series of pho - tographs .

		Even the ignoramus to whom all cater - pillars are only ugly crawling things can not repress a dip into the book here and there to find out how the beautiful Modesta comes from her ugly `` worm of promise , '' or the Viceroy from a caterpillar all humps and bumps .

		And ten to one after a dip or two he is in for the whole book , and comes out an ignoramus no longer , which is to say that the book accomplishes the rare alliance of scientific accu - racy and fulness with popular interest .

		The answer to the common query , '' How can I tell a moth from The book of Moths and Butterflies .

		440 TliE DIAL , -LSB- .

		hint ' 1 , An incnutinut cicerone .

		a butterfly ? ''

		is thus clearly stated : '' Usually by the feelers or antennae located on the head those of a butterfly being always thread-like and clubbed at the end , while those of moths vary according to species and are of several different patterns .

		Another dif - ference is that the majority of moths fly at night and the butterflies in the daytime ; and , again , the moths rest with wings held horizontally , in roof form , or wrapped about the body , while butterflies when at rest usually hold their wings in a vertical position . ''

		Nearly all of the very numerous illustrations are beautiful to look at , and all have the merit of showing just the points most needed for perfect expo - sition .

		An up-to-date guide-book , that should prove useful to the traveller , is Mr.
Douglas Sladen	PERSON	's '' How to See
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Pott -RRB- .

		In its nearly 600 pages , illustrated by 160 reproductions from photographs , with its large map , detailed descriptions of routes by rail , steamer , motor , or carriage , nearly all practical matters con - nected with Italian travel are well considered .

		As a guide-book to town and country , to scenery and places , it seems entirely trustworthy .

		It is quite otherwise than trustworthy , however , when it deals with pictures , sculpture , and antiquities in general .

		Here , the author speaks with an air at once so defi - nite and so debonair as to amaze a cautious student For example , he twice speaks of the statue of a draped female figure found at Antium more than thirty years ago as `` recently discovered , '' and adds that `` it rep - resents a school-girl . ''

		As a matter of fact , no statue more shrouded in mystery has ever perplexed the student ; and because archaeologists are to-day as ignorant of its authorship , name , and place in the history of Greek art as they were thirty years ago , the figure is still often called '' The Maiden of Mys - tery . ''

		But , whatever it may or may not be , it is pretty certain that the statue does not represent a school-girl .

		Other similar slips may be noted ; but usually they are amusing rather than serious blemishes .

		The enthusiastic student of birds SStSSS *** hel P applying what Mr.
Augustus Wright Bomberger	PERSON	says in the Introduction to his '' Book of Birds '' -LRB- Winston -RRB- : `` There is perhaps less danger of becoming a mere one-sided specialist along this line in the natural world around us than any other .

		It is hard to be nar - row and contracted of spirit amidst the sweet and multitudinous voices of the winged creatures of the air . ''

		The author calls himself a beginner in bird - lore , and writes in the hope of helping beginners ; but it would be difficult to imagine any old profes - sor of `` birdology '' who would not take pleasure in this book , it is so genuine , and so full of the love of anything that wears feathers and sings .

		Bewitch - ing photographs of nests , and of youthful kingfishers , crows , catbirds , warblers , and especially red - eyed vireos , who are still in bed or '' who ought to be in bed , '' delight the eye .

		Verses by the author punc - tuate the chapters and gratify the ear .

		A good key is appended , though the book i - meant `` to arouse and inspire rather than instruct . ''

		An interesting fact which further coimnemls it is that the site of Mr.
Bomberger	PERSON	's study is
Western Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, near where Audubon lived .

		All the birds of tliis region are met in their haunts ; and their habits , with many of their sayings , are lovingly reported .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The late Dr.
W. J. Rolfe	PERSON	's `` Satchel Guide t < > Ku - rope , '' which for forty years has proved an almost indis - pensable adjunct to the paraphernalia of the vacation tourist abroad , makes its annual reappearance in a re - vised edition for
1912	DATE	.

		The revisions seem to have been extensive this year , as the type is entirely reset and the volume printed from new plates throughout Messrs.
Houghton Miftlin Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		Another batch of '' Home University Library '' vol - umes -LRB- Holt -RRB- further emphasizes the usefulness of this publishing enterprise , and the competency of the writers whom it enlists .

		One could not well ask for something better than such handy volumes as Dr.
A. F. Pollard	PERSON	's '' History of
England	LOCATION	, '' and Mr.
A. G. Bradley	PERSON	's '' Ca - nada , '' and Mr.
W. Warde Fowler	PERSON	's ''
Rome	LOCATION	, '' and Mr.
G. L. Strachey	PERSON	's '' Landmarks in French Literature . ''

		These are readable books as well as trustworthy ones .

		Although emanating , according to the date-line of the Preface , from the ''
Department of History	ORGANIZATION	, University of
Washington	LOCATION	, '' Miss
Katherine Berry Judson	PERSON	's `` Myths and Legends of
California	LOCATION	and the Old Southwest '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is a popular rather than a scholarly work .

		The volume contains some seventy brief Indian myths ; and is illustrated by many half-tones of Western scenery , and a few more pertinent plates .

		The tales are interest - ing ; but they arouse the suspicion that , like many recent attempts to reproduce folklore , they have gained sophis - tication and literary effectiveness at the cost of their true primitive flavor .

		Miss
May Sinclair	DATE	, the novelist , has published through the Women Writers ' Suffrage League of
London	LOCATION	a pam - phlet entitled '' Feminism , '' in which she disposes very conclusively of the pseudo-scientific argument recently advanced by Sir
Almroth Wright	PERSON	to the effect that hys - teria and neurosis are the pathogenic agents responsible for the modern suffrage movement The booklet de - serves wide circulation .

		Suffragists will find in its pages many effective barbs for their argumentative shafts ; but especially is it to be recommended to those honestly in doubt as to the character and purpose of the present - day feminist movement .

		``
Harper	PERSON	's Guide to Wild Flowers '' is a good-si / < !

		manual , prepared by Mrs.
Caroline A. Creevy	PERSON	, which classifies flowers by a new system presumably easier than the old .

		THE DIAL 441 All lovers of English gardens , groves , and fields will rejoice in the new and enlarged edition of Mr.
C. A. Johns	PERSON	's '' Forest Trees of
Britain	LOCATION	, '' now entitled '' British Trees and Shrubs '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		The new edition surpasses the old , not in the text -LRB- that remains unsurpassed -RRB- , but in the lengthened list of species , in the descriptions of the finer small trees and shrubs suitable for lawn and garden , and above all in the increased number of beau - tiful full-page plates , many of them colored , and all extremely helpful .

		Mr.
Johns	PERSON	's pages are by no means confined to detailed descriptions of species , or to the rules of horticulture ; his chapters are replete with lore and legend and all manner of interesting tradition and literary reference .

		The new volume is edited by Mr.
E. T. Cook	PERSON	, whose part consists in the main of brief descriptions and commendations of such desirable shrubs as have more recently come upon the market . ''

		The
Yosemite National Park	ORGANIZATION	is perhaps the most delightful region in all the world for the study of plant life . ''

		So declare Mr. and Mrs.
Harvey Monroe Hall	PERSON	in the introduction to their '' Yosemite Flora '' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book forms a popular guide to the interesting vegetation found among the Yosemite foot - hills and extending up its mountain-summits as far as the line of perpetual snow .

		The nine hundred and fifty-five species here described represent , in large part , the results of the author 's own botanical explorations throughout the
Park	LOCATION	.

		All the plants have been care - fully classified and grouped according to their relation - ships , and keys are provided for the determination of their names .

		Technical terms have been introduced only where accuracy demands their use .

		The intro - duction deals with the origin , characteristics , and distri - bution of the flora in general , and the descriptive matter devoted to the individual species supplies information relative to the locality in which they may be found , their use by the Indians , their medicinal and poisonous properties , and interesting points regarding their dis - covery .

		There are eleven full-page illustrations from photographs , and numerous outline cuts in the text aid in easy identification of the different varieties .

		A revelation of the beauty and variety of an art that has by no means yet reached its rightful place in popu - lar appreciation is embodied in the '' Catalogue of the International Exhibition of Contemporary Medals '' held by the
American Numismatic Society	ORGANIZATION	in
1910	DATE	.

		This is a revised edition , much amplified and fully illustrated , of the provisional catalogue issued for the use of visitors to the exhibition .

		Biographical sketches -LRB- supplied in many cases by the artists themselves -RRB- of nearly all of the two hundred-odd exhibitors are given , with full descrip - tion of each of the medals exhibited .

		A clearly - written Introduction , by Miss
Agnes Baldwin	PERSON	, traces the history of the medallic art , and describes the various processes employed in the production of modern medals .

		The most notable feature of the volume , however , and one which in itself entitles the work to a place in every art library , is its wealth of illustrations .

		These consist of nearly five hundred separate half-tone cuts , beautifully reproduced and printed , illustrating several thousand medals .

		In every detail the book reflects much credit upon all concerned in its production not least the De
Vinne Press	PERSON	, who have given it an outward garb of dignified typography and perfect presswork deserving of the highest praise .

		It is a work that will do much to enhance a more general interest in , and appreciation of , the fascinating art of the medallist .

		NOTES .

Lawrence P. Jacks	PERSON	, editor of '' The
Hibbert Jour	PERSON	- nal , '' and author of `` Mad Shepherds , '' `` Among the Idol Makers , '' etc. , is soon to visit the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Henry S. Harrison	PERSON	, author of '' Queed , '' has well on the way toward completion a new novel which
Hough	PERSON	- ton
Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	expect to publish either in the coming autumn or early next year .

		Dr.
Henry Sweet	PERSON	, for the past eleven years university reader in phonetics at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and author of a long list of standard works in the field of philology and phonetics , is dead at the age of sixty-eight .

		Mrs.
John King Van Rensselaer	PERSON	, author of '' The Devil 's Picture Books , '' will soon publish through Messrs.
Jacobs	PERSON	another study in the same field entitled '' Pro- phetical , Educational , and Playing Cards . ''

		A volume of verse by Mr.
La Tpuche Hancock	PERSON	, con - sisting principally of contributions to the columns of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Sun '' during the past ten years , will be issued shortly by the
Neale Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A volume on
Robert Toombs	PERSON	, by Professor
Ulrich B. Phillips	PERSON	, and one on
Ulysses S. Grant	PERSON	, by Dr.
Franklin S. Edmonds	PERSON	, are announced as immediately forthcoming in Messrs.
Jacobs	PERSON	's '' American Crisis Biographies . ''

		Mr.
Algot Lange	PERSON	, author of '' In the
Amazon	LOCATION	Jungle , '' recently published by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	, has been chosen to head the South American expedition now being organ - ized by the
Museum of Pennsylvania University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
C. E. Brock	PERSON	, an English illustrator of unusual skill and intelligence , has been commissioned to prepare the drawings for an illustrated holiday edition of Mr.
Jeffery	PERSON	FarnoPs popular novel , '' The Broad Highway . ''

		A new novel by
M. Rene ' Bazin	PERSON	entitled '' Davide'e Birot '' will be issued shortly by Messrs.
Charles Scrib	PERSON	- ner 's Sons .

		Social problems of the day , particularly the problems of labor , hold a prominent place in the story . ''

		The Promise of the Christ Age in Recent Litera - ture , '' a study of ten representative works whose inspira - tion and interest centre about the Christ figure , will be published immediately by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		The author is Dr.
William Eugene Mosher	PERSON	.

		The publication of Professor
Earl Barnes	PERSON	's study of '' Woman in Modern Society '' has been postponed so as to permit `` The Atlantic Monthly '' to use three chapters in its three immediately forthcoming issues .

		The book will be published in
August	DATE	by Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Edwin Bjorkman	PERSON	, whose translations of three of
Strindberg	LOCATION	's plays were recently published by

Strindberg	LOCATION	's '' There are Crimes and Crimes , '' a drama dealing with modern life in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Edward Thomas	PERSON	is at work on a critical study of
Swinburne	LOCATION	, which will be published later in the year .

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	's book will in no way clash with the official biography of
Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	, on which Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	is engaged , and which , we understand , is making satisfac - tory progress .

		M.
Anatole France	LOCATION	's forthcoming novel , '' Une Idylle sous la Revolution , '' is said to owe its existence to a chance discovery by
M. France	PERSON	of some engravings by
Prudhon	PERSON	, intended for an edition of
Racine	LOCATION	, but rejected by Didot , the publisher .

		The pictures roused
M. France	LOCATION	to an enthusiasm for
Prudhon	PERSON	, and , as was the case with the Goncourts and others , study of
Prudhon	PERSON	expanded into study of the Directoire period , then of the Terror , 442 THE DIAL -LSB-
June 1	DATE	, of
Robespierre	LOCATION	, Saint-Just , and other personages of the Revolution .

		The coming volume is a result of the re - searches which were led up to in this way .

		The tint book dealing with the '' Titanic '' disaster is announced in a volume entitled '' The Loss of the S. S. Titanic : Its Story and its Lessons , '' written by Mr.
Lawrence Beesley	PERSON	, one of the survivors of the catas - trophe .


Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish the volume late this month . ''

		Radical Empiricism , '' by the late
William James	PERSON	, will be published immediately by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	.

		According to the publishers ' announcement , the author gives utterance in this volume `` to a doctrine which he regarded as of more fundamental importance than his widely-known pragmatism . ''

		Modern Science and the Illusions of Professor
Berg	PERSON	- son '' is the title of a forthcoming volume which is likely to flutter the Bergsonian dove-cotes .

		The author is Dr.
Hugh S. R. Elliot	PERSON	, who may be remembered as the editor of
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	's published letters , and the publishers are Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	's interesting tribute to the late Ed - ward
H. Harriman	PERSON	has been issued by Messrs. Double - day ,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in an attractive booklet for private circulation .

		We understand that a copy will be sent free to any librarian who makes application to the pub - lishers .

		It is well deserving of a place in every library .

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's forthcoming book on
South America	LOCATION	, to be published by Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	, will not , as was at first thought , treat mainly of constitutional and admin - istrative questions .

		Unlike '' The American Common - wealth , '' it will give a general picture of the South Amer - ican countries , and of their commercial development .

		It is announced that the right to publish the author - ized editions of the writings of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	has been transferred to Mr.
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	by the Whitman executors , Messrs.
Thomas B. Harned	PERSON	and
Horace Trau	PERSON	- bel .

		Mr.
Kennerley	PERSON	announces new editions of `` Leaves of Grass '' and `` Complete Prose Works . ''

		Mr.
Horace Traabel	PERSON	's ''
Walt Whitman	PERSON	in
Camden	LOCATION	'' has also been transferred to the same publisher , and a third volume is to be issued in the
autumn	DATE	.

		The late
Henry Haynie	PERSON	, who died at his home in
Newton Centre	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	,
May 15	DATE	, was born at
Winchester	ORGANIZATION	,
Illinois	LOCATION	, in
1841	DATE	, received a grammar-school and high - school education , and promptly responded to the call to arms when the Civil War broke out , enlisting in the first infantry company raised in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		After honor - ably serving in the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of the
Cumberland	LOCATION	and under - going several months ' confinement in
Libby Prison	LOCATION	, he was mustered out in
1864	DATE	, and entered upon newspaper work .

		His foreign editorship of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times '' and his subsequent
Paris	LOCATION	correspondence to a number of American journals are among his best-known activities in this department of literary labor , and incidentally they opened the way for his two best books , ''
Paris	LOCATION	, Past and Present , '' a descriptive and historical work , and '' The Captains and the Kings , '' a reminiscent vol - ume from one who , in the pursuit of his calling , had met and talked with a considerable number of promi - nent men .

		AUGUST STRINDBKRG .

		The perturbed spirit of
August Strindberg	ORGANIZATION	passed to its rest on the fourteenth of
last month	DATE	, after racking its frail tenement of clay for sixty-three years , and with its passing the greatest figure in the Swedish literature of our time disappeared from the view of men .

		Strind - berg illustrated , better than most of the examples ad - duced in ita support , the familiar notion of the close relationship of genius to insanity .

		Lombroso , we suppose , would have called him insane , and made no bones about it , but such a verdict would account but inadequately for his extraordinary power to cause vibrations in the con - sciousness of his readers .

		For the most part , the mo - tions -LRB- or emotions -RRB- thus set up in minds that came within the sphere of his influence were not pleasurable ones , and were accompanied by a distinct sense of aver - sion , and even of repulsion .

		What most men held acred in belief and human relationship had for him no sanctity , and he rode rough-shod , with a Nietzschean brutality , over their tenderest sentiments and their most cherished social beliefs .

		The intensity of his intellectual life brought him at times close to the borderland between reason and unreason , and the reader of his many books , who does not correlate them as he reads with the state of mind and other conditions under which they were written , will find them hard to interpret in the terms of any well-ordered system of thinking about art and social philosophy .

		His warmest admirers must allow that his literary output , taken in its entirety , exhibits an unbal - anced mind , and a mind permanently twisted awry by circumstance .

		His work was the expression of an un - happy life , desperately eager for happiness , and essaying many futile ventures in its quest .

		He was a confused idealist , without the central core of glowing faith that irradiates the writings of
Bjornson	PERSON	and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and makes those men in so high a sense prophets of humanity .

		Of life as it was revealed to him in the shifting moods through which he surveyed it , he had an extraordinarily intense and penetrating vision , and he had an almost un - exampled mastery over the rich and flexible language to whose inheritance he was born .

		His collected works , filling upwards of fifty volumes , contain nearly all the species of literary composition , although novels and plays are predominant .

		He was a hater of womankind , and was preoccupied to the point of obsession with the share of sex-struggle in human life .

		His realism was unrestrained , as to both word and situation , and no
Kn	ORGANIZATION	- glish publisher would dare to reproduce some of his works in uuexpurgated translation .

		He is only begin - ning to be known at all to the English-reading public , but his death will probably stimulate the activity of trans - lators and theatre-managers , with the effect of consid - erably enlarging our acquaintance with his works .

		BRIEFER MENTION 474 NOTES 475 LIST OF NEW BOOKS ... .475 UNIVERSITY CONTROL . ''

		That a professor 's salary should depend on the favor of a president , or that he should be dismissed without a hearing by a president with the consent of an absentee board of trustees is a state of affairs not conceivable in an English or German university . ''

		This succinct statement illustrates a condition of affairs which has become common in our Amer - ican institutions of higher education , many of which have fully developed , or tend to develop , a system of academic autocracy which , in the opinion of many observers , is ominous of evil and a menace to the best interests of education .

		Things were not always thus , for a historical survey of the history of universities shows a very different condition to have prevailed in earlier times .

		The great mediaeval universities , to which legend tells us that students flocked by the tens of thousands , were organized upon a basis which made them true republics of learning .

		A university then was '' unhierarchical , democ - ratic , anarchic , '' being simply the professors and the students , governed by many prescriptions of custom , and administered by councils and rec - tors elected for short periods by the university body .

		The German universities of the nineteenth century inherited this good tradition , and the English universities followed its teachings .

		In
America	LOCATION	, the colonial colleges copied the English form of government , and were controlled by their faculties , fellows , and alumni .

		By gradual steps , however , they slipped into the hands of small self - perpetuating corporations , of which an extreme case was
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, whose reactionary charter of
1810	DATE	gave to trustees and president autocratic powers of the sort that political absolutism was even then beginning to discard as outworn and unconsonant with the new spirit of freedom that was abroad in the world .

		These quotations and examples are taken from Professor
Cattell	PERSON	's informed and thorough discussion of the subject of university control -LRB- `` Science , '' Nos. 908-909 -RRB- , a subject upon which he has had much to say of late , finding occasion for caustic criticism of existing Ameri - can conditions , and standing as the champion of an academic democracy and a teaching profession upon which a man may enter without forfeiting his self-respect .

		An earlier paper on the same subject , published some six years ago , was reprinted by him , with footnotes , and sent to 452 THE DIAL j .


June 16	DATE	, several hundred men of science holding academic positions , asking for their opinions .

		About three hundred replies were received , exhibiting a some - what remarkable consensus of agreement upon the main thesis , and betraying a degree of dis - satisfaction with present conditions , which those in the seats of educational power would be well - advised to heed .

		This paper proposed a plan of organization upon more democratic lines than now prevail , not as a substitution to be immediately made , but rather as an ideal to which recon - structive movements should tend .

		A university corporation was proposed which should be made of professors , alumni , and interested members of the community at large .

		This corporation should elect trustees '' having the ordinary func - tions of trustees the care of the property and the representation of the common sense of the corporation and of the community in university policy . ''

		The professors should elect a president for a short term of years -LRB- or an annual rector , as in
Germany	LOCATION	-RRB- , and `` his salary should not be larger , his position more dignified or his powers greater than those of the professor . ''

		The uni - versity should be organized in departments , each of which should elect its own administrative head , `` and have as complete autonomy as is consistent with the welfare of the university as a whole , '' and each department should nominate its own professors .

		There should be a coordinating body , or `` senate '' for final elections and for general legislation . ''

		There should be as much flexibility and as complete anarchy throughout the univer - sity as is consistent with unity and order . ''

		These are the outlines of the plan offered for consideration to Professor Cattail 's correspond - ents .

		He does not balk at the word `` anarchy , '' nor will his intelligent readers , for they know that the term has a respectable connotation , and its use in this connection properly emphasizes the contrast that should be drawn between the ideal advocated and the ideal which naturally finds favor in a commercial and industrial com - munity , which owes its prosperity to autocratic forms of organization , and to which '' efficiency '' is a fetich .

		It is hard indeed to make such a com - munity realize that its most cherished maxims and methods can not be applied to an art least of all to the fine art of education and that in such application they must be deadening or de - structive .

		Yet such is undoubtedly the case , and it illustrates just the difference or the absolute antagonism between the professional and the commercial motive .

		The professional man must be free to set his own standards of conduct ; the man of business pursuits must be content with having them set for him by the
State	ORGANIZATION	, or by the organized opinion of his special occupation .

		Freedom is the breath of life to the professions , and the law of fruition in achieve - ment is for them the law which the inner being of the individual both shapes and enforces upon him . ''

		Efficiency '' properly lauded in the erec - tion of a building , the construction of a machine , or the management of a railway system , is a per - fectly meaningless bugbear in the realm of medi - cine , or of art , or of teaching , and it is enough to make angels weep to read certain recent sug - gestions that the methods which yield desirable practical results iu bricklaying should forthwith be applied to the work done in our schools and colleges .

		The state of mind in which such a suggestion can be even entertained is one that calls for a curious inspection of the bumps .

		The university is the last place where efficiency should prevail , says Professor
Cattell	PERSON	, if it means giving autocratic powers to any individual .

		We like a writer who is not too timid to take a logical bull by the horns .

		The answers received in reply to the question , 299 in number , showed 46 favorable to the pres - ent system , 69 favorable to a greater degree of faculty control , and 184 favorable to `` a plan of representative democracy more or less similar to the one proposed . ''

		These figures certainly justify the statement that '' when eighty-five per cent of those responsible for the conduct of a given system unite in holding that it should be altered , the case may be regarded as strong . ''

		A still stronger statement results from examining the returns made by five large institutions Col - umbia ,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	,
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	, and
Chicago	LOCATION	for out of seventy-two replies only three indicated a preference for the exist - ing system . ''

		This is surely a condition which foretells reform or bankruptcy '' is Professor
Cattell	PERSON	's fitting comment .

		The realization of such a reform as is urged in this paper must necessarily be a matter of many years .

		As Pro- fessor
Cattell	PERSON	says , '' no sensible person would attempt to reform suddenly by a paper constitu - tion a system which has developed in response to its environment .

		The boss in politics , the trust magnate in business , the university president and school superintendent , have probably con - duced to a certain kind of efficiency and to an enlargement more rapid than would othei - \ \ i-r have been possible . ''

		But this does not mean that the system thus shaped should be perpetuated , and we are convinced that our author is right , as far as the root of the matter is concerned .

		But it will be peculiarly difficult to give effect to such
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 453 a reform as he proposes , for the reason that the controlling authorities in most of our universities are bodies of men successful in affairs , who can - not think that the methods by which efficiency is secured and success attained in the business world may not properly be applicable in the edu - cational sphere , and to whom the professional point of view is simply incomprehensible .

		They will not easily be converted , because they can not easily be made to understand .

		Yet the ideal is worth understanding which is embodied in this series of questions : '' Can there not be one university where the professor will have a study instead of an office , where the ideal set before the young instructor is something else than answering letters promptly and neatly on the typewriter , where men are weighed rather than counted , where efficiency and machinery are subordinated to the per - sonality of great men ?

		Could there not be a university or school , dominating some field of scholarship and research with its half-dozen professors and group of instructors and students drawn together by them ?

		Might not means be devised by which the professor would be paid for the value of his teaching service and research , and then be set free to do his work how and when and where he can do it best . ''

		It is our belief that such a university is pos - sible , and that , when once brought into being , it would do away with many evils , while its efficiency in the higher sense would be made so manifest that many others would hasten to copy its example .

		THE DUOCENTENARY OF
ROUSSEAU	PERSON	.

		The case of
Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	is about to be re-opened .

		The occasion for even Jean - Jacques must await his turn in the modern magazine is provided by the approaching duocentenary .

		Therefore , as the twenty-eighth of
June	DATE	draws nigh , we may expect to hear that
Rousseau	PERSON	was good , that
Rousseau	PERSON	was bad , that he was a great prophet , that he was a mad - man , as well as other opinions almost as diverse and contradictory .

		And we shall not easily come to a conclusion , since the whole question involves the fundamental opposition between the feelings and the intellect .

		For if the personality of
Jean-Jacques	PERSON	is still a matter of discussion , if the value of his influ - ence is contested , it is because he represents , in his temperament no less than in his conception of life , education , and politics , the man of feeling the neurasthenic , one might almost say as opposed to the humanist and believer in the supremacy of the reason .

		Such a platitude perhaps requires an apology .

		Yet from this fact arises the whole dispute over
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		Judged by the Romantic generation , his lineal descendants ,
Jean-Jacques	PERSON	is accounted a saint .

		Dissected by modern pathological criticism , he is explained as a degenerate .

		That fact at least indicates a reaction .

		Among his contemporaries , however , we find something of each point of view .

		This shows us that
Rousseau	PERSON	's nature must have had its winsome side .

		Indeed , the whole theory of his repulsive personality , so ingeniously forwarded by
Grimm	PERSON	,
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	, and their circle , is refuted at once by
Jean-Jacques	PERSON	's proved capacity to attract friends and to win their affection and their influence .

		In this respect , at least , there was really no need for Mrs.
Macdonald	PERSON	to amass all the laborious evidence of her two-volume apologia .

		* Of course , one may make friends everywhere and still be a charming good-for-nothing .

		Such individ - uals we all know ; we are not blinded , as were so many of
Jean-Jacques	PERSON	's contemporaries , by the charms of a newly-discovered sentimentality .

		Keeping one 's friends is rather a different matter .

		For friend - ship has its duties no less than its privileges ; and if this great sentimentalist experienced at times the need of affection and appreciation , if he felt now and again the want of an interlocutor or a confidant , a study of his 4i Confessions '' reveals his selfishness if not his self-sufficiency .

		He could forget he could let his friends slip out of his life as easily as he could change his religion .

		A study of
Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	's friendships would shed much light upon his character .

		But his essentially anti-social egotism needs no such evidence .

		A genius standing out against society , isolated as much through his morbid sensitiveness as by an apprenticeship to life which deprived him of any realization of man 's place in a world of men , we may be sure that his prodigious capacity for feeling will some day find an outlet in the wildest individualism .

		Motherless and early abandoned by a worthless father , we shall not expect such a boy to develop any conception of dis - cipline .

		Heredity , environment , and the `` moment , '' as
Taine	PERSON	puts it , all conspired to produce a Jean -
Jacques	LOCATION	.

		Yet such is the weakness of his will that even these things might have conspired in vain .

		If this young ne'er - do-well , rich only in thirty years of vagabondage and dreaming , had not been forced out of a home and a disgraceful guest-friendship by a qualm of wounded pride -LRB- read the whole story from the time of the partnership with
Anet	LOCATION	-RRB- , he might have died a teacher of music in
Geneva	LOCATION	, and the world might never have known what an apostle it had lost .

		Upon such a chance did the fame of
Rousseau	PERSON	depend .

		Always a plaything of his feelings , a man whose actions were determined by his moods , his role in history hangs upon the event which sent him forth into the world of
Paris	LOCATION	, a world of convention with a highly organized social hierarchy .

		Into such a society , as
Emile Faguet	PERSON	points out , a society of perfectly dovetailed parts , a world where * ' orig - inal '' spelt `` eccentric , '' came this dreaming vag - abond , a grown man with all a boy 's timidity , a plebeian conscious of genius , an over-sensitive coun - * ''

		4 THE DIAL -LSB-
June	DATE
Iti	ORGANIZATION	, tryinan , devoid of social graces and social tact The result was inevitable .

		Given such a genius , his de - velopment , his theories , his works , his whole apostle - ship , arise from his reaction upon society , a reaction which came too late to permit him to conform .

		The process of transformation required several years .

		At the beginning ,
Jean-Jacques	PERSON	made his effort to conform : he was obliged to earn his living .

		But deep in his heart , his disappointment and his rebellion were slowly gathering force ; and when , one fine day in
1749	DATE	, a newspaper announcement of a lit - erary contest * suggested an impeachment of civili - zation , his sense of personal wrongs and his imag - inative sentimentality drove him into self-expression with a storm of tears .

		Now at last he may express his opinion of this world of
Paris	LOCATION	, so different from the idealized reminiscences of his vagrant adoles - cence .

		That the occasion of this indictment is the arts , that he is himself a writer of little comedies and light operas , and will continue to be one for years , is at least significant .

		But human motives are often mixed , and in the man of moods they may become inextricably tangled .

		So
Rousseau	PERSON	wrote his essay , won the prize , and , in the first flush of fame which the event brought him , threw aside all attempt to conform .

		More than that , he undertook a personal reformation : he became , as he tells us , `` virtuous or at least intoxicated with virtue , '' resigned his secre - taryship to earn his living by copying music , and emphasized a republican simplicity of dress by a cynic 's rudeness of manner .

		One remembers his early reading and his life-long admiration of Plutarch .

		The effect speedily justified the means .

		Jean - Jacques became famous .

		`` All
Paris	LOCATION	, '' as he tells us in the `` Confessions , '' repeated his biting sarcasms ; now at last the despised plebeian and the haughty aristocrat might exchange rules .

		Such a transposi - tion could hardly have been unpleasant .

		And if , meanwhile , our moral `` convert '' was living with a mistress and sending his illegitimate children one after the other to the foundlings ' home. , it only shows us how impossible it is to achieve a senti - mental consistency or to escape the influence of one 's age .

		One may dream of an
Arcadian	ORGANIZATION	`` Nature '' and still accept the vices of irresponsibility so conven - iently afforded by a hated civilization .

		This was
Jean-Jacques	PERSON	's `` Conversion . ''

		It makes a very lyrical page in the `` Confessions , '' a page worthy of this re-discovery of emotion in the realm of morality .


Rousseau	PERSON	was now thirty-seven , his first adolescent response to sentiment dulled by use and by his experience in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		He was to find that again , reminiscentially at least , when he quitted the world of men and actualities for the dream life of the
Hermitage	ORGANIZATION	.

		Now , with the first delights of his liaison behind him , his heart was drifting like a ship becalmed .

		He had his chance , a chance favored by his work with the Encyclopaedists , to divorce his brain and his heart .

		Then , without warning , a new On the question : Has the restoration of the art * and the sciences contributed to purify or to corrupt manners ?

		storm of sentiment overcame him ; the .

		- tilled waters began to course once mure ; the tide of passion bore away its victim , and Jean -
Jacques	PERSON	lost his opportu - nity to leai n tlu - true nature of sophistry .

		For if half of his eloquence is vision , a deal of it is sophistical .

		What a corpus vile for clasps in logic could be found in
Rousseau	LOCATION	, if anyone took tin * trouble to read these tiresome volumes !

		Yet in their own day everybody read them ; in an age of theorizing , in an age of sentiment already ripe for passion , this new strain of passionate theory rang on the ears of a feminized society with a delicious thrill .

		And the virtuous
Jean-Jacques	PERSON	, no longer an outcast , but accepted with all his boorish whims , now lived as the guest of the great , and in the inter - vals of music-copying poured forth , with a rapidity which attests the force of his passion , tin - 1 > i-courn sur I ` lne ` galiteY ' the `` Lettre sur les Spectacles , '' ``
Julie	PERSON	, '' ``
Emile	PERSON	, '' the `` Contrat Social , '' and the `` Lettres de la Montagne . ''

		For the fervor of this second youth lasted fully twelve years .

		A veritable emotional renascence , out of it sprang all the works of
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		After all , passion alone can arouse the dreamer to thought , an < l in this prophet of an emotional emancipation there were several varieties of passion .


Jules Lemaitre	PERSON	enumerates them in his biography .

		There was , first of all , the plebeian , smarting under the consciousness of hi > social unreadiness and his lack of savoir-faln .

		There was the disappointed aspirant for musical and literary celebrity .

		There was the vagabond who had suffered , who had endured even hunger and privation , in his attempt to live his dream in a world of facts .

		There was , in short , every seed of revolt , everything that could help to create a destructive critic of the world as it was .

		But there was also the man of generous enthusiasms , filled with a personal ideal in which he would have liked to include all humanity .

		All these were combined and incarnated in this prose-poet , who , as he tells us , , `` felt before thinking , '' and who in reality was only impelled to think because he felt .

		Thought derived from such a source is rarely new , however original it may appear to its re-discoverer .

		Even in the eighteenth century ,
Rousseau	PERSON	's ideas were not new .

		The basic principles of his `` system '' were the common property of his age .

		They were in the air , and Jean-Jacques only appropriated them .

		But he made them his by his lyricism , by the com - pelling eloquence with which he expressed them , l > y his passionate force .

		And if that eloquence sprang from chance , if all his work is the product of cir - cumstance , it surely vitiates them as we behold their source .

		It must alter our opinion of their author ; a man who is guided by events , who is always accus - ing circumstances or excusing himself thereby , has little of that force of character which we look for in our moral leaders .

		As a moralist , it is our right to judge
Jean-Jacques	PERSON	and his doc-trine ihu .

		- ; as the first of the Romantic fatalists , it is our ri ^ lit to confront his ideas with hi > conle-ioiis ; for if this plaything of events and of the elan viful dors not .

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 455 dignify his weakness by the name of pragmatism , he does excuse it by the sophistries of his `` philosophy . ''

		Of course he is not aware of that .

		A true Roman - ticist , he deceives himself before he deceives others .

		But what unwitting humor in the result !

		How clearly he dissimulates his weakness , how he hides his hatred of the facts of life and his desire for an im - possible dream of self-indulgence a dream to which we owe that virile phrase of our Declaration : `` the pursuit of happiness '' !

		For when Jean - Jacques compares society with the `` natural '' man , when he opposes the evils of society to the good of which he is ever conscious in himself , we ought to read , not '' society , '' but the rights of others and the ineluctable force of reality .

		No , this regenerator of humanity never accepted the fact of life , never saw life sanely or saw it whole .

		But space forbids the discussion of
Rousseau	ORGANIZATION	's ideas and their place in the history of civilization .

		To these ideas we owe a great deal : much that is good and much that is unqualifiedly bad .

		After a hundred and fifty years , the danger of his doctrine is visible in its results .

		If , a century ago ,
Rousseau	PERSON	- ism meant Thja Rights of Man , to-day Rousseauism carried to its logical conclusion means Socialism .

		And as we find that it was he who furnished the Revolution with its vocabulary , so we may trace his principles in the propaganda of the Socialistic agita - tion of the present day .

		Hence a reaction has set in .

		Some of the greatest critics of
France	LOCATION	have presented the negative side of
Rousseau	PERSON	and Rousseauism , and one wonders why their books have not been trans - lated into English .

		Surely , at the present juncture of American politics , we can not afford to ignore this intellectual movement of our sister republic ; for only such a reaction can show us , children of Jean - Jacques that we are , how the malady of his dream - ing has invaded our conceptions of politics , life , and art .

		It may be that we are unable to change it .

		Many can not recognize the evil , many will not ; and these latter would maintain that there is no trace of disease in our Rousseauistic individualism .

		Admitted evils they would explain as necessary , on the analogy of the bacterial life which is a concomitant of health in the human system .

		To such as these it is of no use to read
Faguet	ORGANIZATION	's book on Democracy , `` The Cult of Incompetence . ''

		They will assure us that they alone represent democratic ideals , since they are in the majority ; and as they are in the majority , it is plain that they must await the final development of Rous - seauism and the argument of events .

		If the equali - tarian chimaera brings us a syndicalistic
State	ORGANIZATION	, war and militarism will inevitably follow ; and then per - haps we shall all , as equals , enjoy the sweet convic - tion of force majeure .

		Certainly , if
the Industrial Revolution	ORGANIZATION	is on its way , no anti- Rousseauistic argument is likely to stop it .

		It will come , and our only consolation must be the thought that it will also come to an end .

		Twelve years after the French beheaded
Louis XVI.	PERSON	, they were obliged to call in a military dictator to save their State from annihilation .

		So if we are to have syndicalism , or some other form of direct proletarian democracy , it might be well to aid it discreetly , just as in certain maladies physicians employ a serum obtained from the diseased blood of the patient .

		In point of fact , we are doing this very thing .

		For Rousseauism in politics depends upon Rousseauism in education .

		It was Jean-Jacques who first stood for pedagogic naturalism , so intolerant of discipline and the direct training of the character and the will .

		If we consider our present educational system , most of its features are ultimately traceable to Rous - seau .

		What do our schools and colleges stand for to-day ?

		Interest , amusement , rather than set tasks ; election of congenial studies -LRB- since life has in store for us no uncongenial labors -RRB- ; non-sectarianism ; and then , absence of all that religious training which makes character ; neglect of philosophy and meta - physics which make thinkers -LRB- what need have we of thinkers ? -RRB-

		; predominance of natural sciences , which are mainly nomenclatures , over that harder intellec - tual training which makes leaders -LRB- why should we train leaders , being a democracy ? -RRB-

		; predominance of utilitarian subjects and manual training over history -LRB- what can we , the heirs of all the ages , learn from a dry and dusty Past ? -RRB-

		.

		Yes , if the incapacity of our present school and college students be taken into account , if we consider their weakness in thinking , in character , and in power of self-control , we must admit that we are educating our children up to the requirements of a socialistic or syndicalistic Utopia .

		Furthermore , we are helping matters in other ways .

		Rousseauism in the schools goes hand in hand with
Rousseauism	PERSON	in Art and Literature , since artist and public are alike trained to prefer an emotional naturalism to the `` aristocratic '' beauty of self-control .

		What Jean-Jacques has given us in the excesses of the Romantic school , what his ideals of aesthetics are giving us to-day , such critics as
Monsieur Lasserre	PERSON	and our own Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	have shown us ; `` Le Romantisme Francais '' and `` The New LaokoCn '' will perhaps mark an epoch in the history of the ideas of the twentieth century .

		In our industrial civilization , where many have come to see in Art and Literature only a form of amusement or a titillation of the senses , where the excesses of certain persons have degraded the very connotation of the adjective `` artistic , '' such books as these ought to open our eyes to the future of Art and Letters under present conditions .

		If critics and artists do not unite in the formulation of a more virile ideal , the whole subject of Art may find itself relegated to that feminine control which
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	prophesied as its ultimate function .

		Shall we then confess that we are incapable of rising above the lower aesthetic conception of transcending the Romantic subjection to passion and sentiment for the classical inspiration of intellectual vision ?

		Of course , the former conception is the first to move our sympathies .

		It is difficult to rise to an appreciation of the more virile elements in literature .

		It is difficult to discount the Romantic element , to 4f > t ;

		, hold it in a subordinate position , to keep it in control .

		Yet we must do it .

		And we need not fear that its better qualities will thereby be lost .

		We need not fear that
Rousseau	PERSON	's contribution to us will be vitiated by a little anti-Rousseauism .

		History in all its bloody cycles , life and politics to-day , literature itself , indi - cate that of all the factors which control human life and human activities , passion is the one that plays in our despite the largest part As thinkers , as observers , we may deny its predominance , we may believe ourselves immune .

		But our immunity ends when we cease to think .

		If we make a choice , if we descend from contemplation to action , it is pas - sion , spontaneous or intellectualized , that compels us thereto .

		Shall it be the former type , the type for which Jean - Jacques mainly stands ?

		Or shall we , through a judicious study of an ti -
Rousseau	PERSON	ism , turn passion against itself , and give our energies , not merely to a humanitarian but also to a humanistic
LEWIS PIAOET SHANKS	ORGANIZATION	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		CONVENTIONS OF LITKRART ART , the things men and women in books are represented as doing and saying in certain circumstances , are often very dif - ferent from the things they really would do and say in the given circumstances .

		Yet how can great and soul-moving scenes be depicted without a consider - able employment of these conventions , these well - understood symbols to indicate to the reader what is taking place ?

		The older romancers made their heroines weep and swoon and go into hysterics with astonishing facility .

		The story required it .

		and to remove these manifestations of feeling would be to leave the context flat and feeble and often all but meaningless .

		As Mr.
Arthur C. Benson	PERSON	points out in an article on `` Realism in Fiction '' in the
May	DATE	`` Cornhill , '' the conscientious realist of our own time often finds himself in a dilemma between his devo - tion to realism and his need to give some sort of adequate expression to high emotion and profound feeling .

		A situation fraught with passion and sen - timent of the most intense nature is often in real life chiefly remarkable for the outward calm and the perfect self-restraint of all concerned .

		`` It is certainly my experience , '' says Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, `` and I should imagine the experience of everyone in En - gland at all events , that in scenes and situations where the atmosphere is tense with emotion , the most amazing fact is the incredibly commonplace things which people say and do .

		In the most tragic scene which I can call to mind , the conversation was mainly about the weather ; it was an intense relief to everyone present that anyone should have been sensible enough to introduce the subject '' How , then , shall the realist picture and not merely > lc scribe at wearisome length and in disenchanting detail the intense situation , the moment of over - whelming passion , of prostrating grief , of ecstatic emotion ?

		Successfully to solve the problem , as it arises , is to demonstrate one 's genius as a literary artist ... LIBRARY WORK WITH
THK	ORGANIZATION	BOOK-HUNGRY IMMI - GRANT seems not infrequently to inert with \ \ ; u m.-r appreciation and to yield more gratifying results than does similar effort bestowed upon our own peo - ple .

		At the
Providence Public Library	ORGANIZATION	this work appears to be zealously and fruitfully prosecuted .

		In the current annual Report of the library we read : `` As in previous years , the service rendered by this department is two-fold .

		On the one hand , it serves the readers of foreign birth and parcnta ^ f who otherwise would have but scanty means of obtaining reading matter , and , on the other hand , it nerves the readers of American birth and descent who would gladly make themselves familiar with the rich resources of other literatures than their own ... Large as is the benefit rendered by the Foreign De - partment in these directions , its service to the newly - arrived representative of other nationalities is even greater .

		In the hands of the vigilant and enter - prising Custodian of the
Department	ORGANIZATION	,
Mi Reid	PERSON	, its work has almost risen to the level of an active philan - thropic agency ... Some of the noteworthy fea - tures of this department are the sympathetic interest in the readers , together with the total absence of a patronizing attitude , which have always character - ized its work . ''

		The making of American citizens out of the crude material so abundantly offered in our manufacturing towns may now be reckoned a part of the task likely to be imposed upon the library worker .

		THE WIDENER BEQUEST TO
HARVARD	LOCATION	, being the valuable collection of rare and what may be briefly called `` association '' volumes that is , books en - deared by old associations and often bearing some mark to indicate these associations comes into the possession of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	library with a sad pre - maturity , through the death of the testator -LRB-
Harry Elkins Widener	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in the awful shipwreck of
April 14-15	DATE	.

		Mr.
Widener	PERSON	, though a young man and hardly more than started in his labor of love as a book-collector , had already gathered a library unsur - passed in its way by any similar collection .

		Among its treasures are mentioned Shakespeare folios , and autograph or otherwise valuable copies of books by
Dickens	PERSON	,
Cowper	PERSON	,
Browning	PERSON	,
Charlotte	LOCATION	Bronte * ,
Byron	PERSON	, and
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, the
Steven	PERSON	- soniana being especially noteworthy .

		Some of the latter , including , it is reported , the original manu - script of
Stevenson	PERSON	's fragment of autobiography , were lost in the disaster that cost their owner his life .

		The first Hoe sale had greatly enriched the collection , and further sales of the same great library , as also the important forthcoming auction sales of other famous libraries , would doubtless have left in Mr.
Widener	PERSON	's hands a large number of liter - ary treasures to add to his store .

		By the terms of the will , the collection is to go to
Harvard	LOCATION	when the university shall have made proper provision for the
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 457 care of the precious bequest .

		If this clause hastens the erection of a new building to take the place of old
Gore Hall	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Widener	PERSON	will have rendered a double service to
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and to the larger world of letters ... THE LITEKARY NEEDS OF THE MANY must often conflict with the scholarly demands of the few in that work of purveying to the reading public which constitutes the never-ending and often perplexing task of the free library .

		A significant passage at the opening of the twenty-second annual Report of the
Minneapolis Public Library	ORGANIZATION	is of interest in this connection .

		`` Before entering upon the details of this report , '' says the librarian , '' we wish to speak of a criticism , more or less just , which has been passed upon the work of the library .

		All criticisms are welcomed , and many of them are valuable .

		This particular criticism , in brief , charges that the library , in attempting to reach the many in a large extension policy , has somewhat overlooked or neglected the needs of the more scholarly .

		It is true that in build - ing up new branches , and in opening numerous sta - tions and factory libraries , much of the book fund has been consumed in the purchase of standard lit - erature and duplicate materials .

		The extension work has certainly crowded upon the more scholarly side of the library .

		The purchase of expensive works and those attracting but a limited number of readers has been often postponed until these titles could be obtained at a cheaper rate .

		The criticism is well taken , and it is to be regretted that the book fund will not stretch any farther . ''

		The wise policy of the greatest good to the greatest number will always , and unavoidably , cause some discontent among the cultured few , for the public library is and should ever remain a democratic rather than an aristocratic institution .

		... AN OBVIOUS MISPRINT in an otherwise perfect bit of poetry or prose always tempts the nicely critical reader to note the correction in the margin rather than run the risk of letting the error jar and confuse a succession of subsequent readers .

		In
Browning	PERSON	's poem `` The Worst of It '' the sixth stanza is printed in all the editions , so far as we know , as follows : '' And I to have tempted you !

		I , who tried Your soul , no doubt , till it sank !

		Unwise , I loved , and was lowly , loved and aspired , Loved , grieving or glad , till I made you mad , And you meant to have hated and despised Whereas , you deceived me nor inquired ! ''

		Now , as in all the other eighteen stanzas of the poem the first , third , and sixth lines are made to rhyme except in the second , where it is the first , third , and fifth that rhyme one feels it a wanton blemish that here alone the rhyme should be spoiled when by simply transposing the r and i of '' tried '' both rhyme and sense are restored .


Browning	PERSON	's syntax may at times be labyrinthine , and his metre now and then jolty ; but when he essays rhymed verse he is not so poor in resource as to be forced to content himself with so imperfect a consonance as that here noted .

		Accordingly it is with some satisfaction that we find a writer in the
London	LOCATION	`` Telegraph '' describing an interview with the poet in which the latter , on hav - ing his attention called to the passage , cried , with `` delighted laughter , '' `` Why , of course !

		It ought to be ` tired ' the rhyme is obvious enough .

		And nobody ever saw it before ! ''

		ONE METHOD OF BOOK-SELECTION is to pick the volumes one most hungers for , let the critics and the connoisseurs say what they will .

		Another way is to follow blindly and slavishly the judgment of some one or more recognized authorities .

		An unex - pected employment of the second method comes to public notice in the mention made by Mr.
George W. Smalley	PERSON	-LRB- in his just-published second series of `` Anglo-American Memories '' -RRB- of the library at
Skibo Castle	ORGANIZATION	.

		It appears that in this collection of the famous founder of libraries for the people ' there are some five-and-twenty thousand volumes , all chosen by the late Lord Acton . ''

		`` What could be more stimulating , '' continues Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	, `` than to look over the collection of books which Lord
Acton	PERSON	had thought suitable as a library for Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	?

		You saw the meeting of two minds , each highly remarkable and as unlike as it was possible for two minds to be . ''

		At any rate , this method of furnish - ing one 's house with a ready-made library is prefer - able to that sometimes resorted to by the excessively wealthy , the indiscriminate purchase of absurdly costly and notoriously worthless subscription books and sets of books .

		Better than that , because less wasteful of money and less encouraging of humbug , is it to fill one 's shelves with book-shaped blocks of wood , handsomely backed and tooled and lettered .

		Then when the evil day comes and the price of coal soars , you will still have a good supply of excellent and well-seasoned fuel .

		... WEAR AND TEAR IN A LARGE LIBRARY , an ener - getic , up-to-date library that does its best to serve the community maintaining it , necessarily amounts to a good deal each year in terms of dollars and cents .

		For example , the
Brooklyn Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, as indicated in its current Report , discarded last year worn-out volumes to the number of nearly thirty thousand , .

		or more than half as many as were added in the same time ; and in the last ten years one hundred and sixty-nine thousand volumes have been sent to the rubbish heap .

		This last number is not far from one-quarter of the total number of books in the library , and indicates a commendable ' -LRB- though costly -RRB- vigilance in keeping the collection in good dress-parade order .

		The question of durable binding is an important one in this connection , and a state - ment from the assistant librarian in the same Report emphasizes the superior quality of work done by the
Chivers Bookbinding Company	ORGANIZATION	in rebinding and oversewing .

		Expenditure for replacement has been reduced by employing the services of this company , and the money thus saved has been used in buying new books .

		But after all care and economy has been exercised on the public library 's part , the public 45s THE DIAL itself is still lamentably thoughtless and ungentle in its handling of the books provided for its enjoyment .

		No volume needs to be gripped by the reader as if its two halves were the two handles of a plough , nor does it respond kindly to such rude buffeting as one might give to a football .

		THE STRENGTH AND THE WEAKNESS OF AMERI - CAN UNIVERSITIES , as pointed out by one whom we have already more than once quoted in these columns , Professor
Murray	PERSON	of
Oxford	LOCATION	, were thus expressed in an alleged interview shortly before the English scholar 's departure from our shores .

		`` The features of the American universities which particularly im - pressed me , '' are his reported words , `` were their excellent libraries , the swift effectiveness with which they punish or drop men who do not pass examina - tion - , ami the vivid , vigorous spirit which colors and animates the whole of their university life . ''

		He deplored the excessive addiction to athletic contests and other distractions , as also the recent rapid decline of classical study . ''

		Deep decay has eaten into the study of the classics in
America	LOCATION	, '' he declared , u and there is widespread consciousness of it The decay is in part due to Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's policy at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		He abolished compulsory Greek .

		It wan an experiment which should have been tried in a laboratory less noble than
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		While he can not but admire the general effectiveness of the training sought by the average energetic American , he thinks the time has come '' which demands deeper , more solid , and therefore slower , education . ''

		HUMORS OF THE BOOK-AUCTION ROOM ought to furnish some industrious compiler with material for a highly entertaining volume .

		Among recent curious happenings of interest to the purchaser of autographs , there comes from the auction rooms of the
Anderson Company	ORGANIZATION	, where the library of the late historian Lossing has been passing under the hammer , the story of the unheard-of prices commanded by two letters of Colonel
Zebulon Butler	PERSON	, of Revolutionary fame , and especially associated in history with the so-called Massacre of
Wyoming	LOCATION	.

		The letters in ques - tion were rated at about eight and ten dollars apiece , the brave
Zebulon	LOCATION	not being by any means a star of the first magnitude in the autographic firmament .

		But when they were put up at auction they amazed all beholders by bringing four hundred and sixty and five hundred and
fifty-five dollars	MONEY	respectively .

		The reason for this furious bidding was later found to be the fact that two descendants of
Andrew Adams	PERSON	, to whom the letters were addressed , had given each an unlimited order for the letters to an agent , a differ - ent agent in each case , with no expectation of any active counter-bidding from any quarter .

		THE INCREASING GLUT OF THE BOOK-MARKET , the large preponderance of quantity over quality in the wares offered , must sooner or later compel a halt in the recklessly rapid production of printed matter .

		A writer in the
London	LOCATION	`` Daily News '' who signs himself `` A British Puhli.shrr '' recognizes the harm that is being done to the trade by an over-production that in the
last decade	DATE	has mounted by leaps and bounds beyond all precedent .

		From the five thou - sand new English works issued in
1901	DATE	to the eight thousand five hundred of the last calendar year is a long stride , and ruinously in excess of any increase in demand during the same period .

		With the larger book-production the profit on any one work tends to diminish , and so , to make up for this diminution , the publisher is tempted to make his output still more disproportionate to the demand a policy obviously leading to ruin if persisted in .

		Manifestly , a gen - eral agreement among publishers to adopt a policy of restriction is what is needed .

		But who is to bring about this agreement or enforce its terms after it has been adopted ?

		Like many other evils , this one of over-production is sure to correct itself , more or less crudely and clumsily and imperfectly , in the course of time ; but a more speedy and effective and less ruinously expensive remedy is earnestly to be desired .

		ACTIVITIES OF
THE A. L. A. PUBLISHING BOARD	ORGANIZATION	, an organization formed in 1 886 -LRB- ten years after the founding of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	itself -RRB- '' to further cooperation among libraries in preparing and publishing bibliographies , indexes , and special catalogues , '' are thus far responsible for the issue of between eighty and ninety publications in book or pamphlet form , of which about sixty are at present in print .

		Mr.
Henry E. Legler	PERSON	, librarian of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, is chairman of the board , and Mr.
George B. Utley	PERSON	secretary .

		It is from a re - cently published statement of the latter that we learn how beneficently and unselfishly active the board has been in the quarter-century since its formation .

		The well-known ''
A. L. A.	PERSON	Catalogue '' and ''
A. L. A. Index	PERSON	to General Literature '' and `` A. L. A. Portrait Index '' are among the most valuable publications of the board ; and it now has in preparation a work that will be not less useful in its way to those whom it primarily concerns .

		It is a manual of library economy , each chapter written by a specialist in his particular department of library work , and will con - tain about twenty-six chapters , ten of which have already been issued as separate pamphlets .

		The edi - torship is vested in a special committee whose chair - man is Mr.
J. I. Wyer	PERSON	, Jr. , Director of the
New York State	ORGANIZATION	Library ... THE AWARD OF A FRENCH LITERARY I-RI/K of ten thousand francs to
M. Andre '' Lafon	PERSON	for his piece of fiction entitled `` L'Eleve Gilles '' is announced in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It is the Grand Literary Prize offered regu - larly by the French Academy for the best work of imagination and inspiration produced within the -RSB- > n - ceding two years .

		The committee of award at first favored the recognition of some acknowledged writer of talent rather than the crowning of any single bril - liant production of an unknown hand : hut thin nat - urally led to interminable discussions and dissensions , with the intermixture of personal prejudices and

		THE DIAL 459 animosities .

		Consequently , as has often happened before and will often happen again in such elections , the choice of a `` dark horse '' was forced upon the electors ; and
M. Lafon	PERSON	proves this time to be the lucky man .

		Not that it is all luck , however , for a suffi - ciently trustworthy authority pronounces `` L'Eleve Gilles '' to be `` simple et tres profond . ''

		But we are still far from being assured that as a spur to genius the literary prize of so-and-so many francs or dollars or ducats is really productive of works destined to live , or that even the most carefully selected profes - sional critics can discern the qualities that are likely to ensure this immortality .

		AN AGREEABLE INNOVATION , among other agree - able experiences encountered in
Boston	LOCATION	by our late English visitor , Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, and noted by him in his contribution to the current issue of ``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' was the nature of the reading matter he found awaiting him in his hotel room .

		He says : `` When I got to the entirely admirable hotel I found a book in a prominent situation on the writing table in my room .

		In many hotels this book would have been the Bible .

		But here it was the catalogue of the hotel library ; it ran to 182 pages .

		On the other hand , there was no bar in the hotel , and no smoking-room .

		I make no comments ; I draw no conclusions ; I state the facts . ''

		It is safe to say that the number of hotels in
England	LOCATION	, or indeed in all
Europe	LOCATION	, that have their own libraries and their own printed catalogues of their libraries could be counted on the fingers of one hand , with not far from five fingers left over after the enumer - ation ; and this , of course , is only one small item in the splendid story of the growth and spread of the library idea in
America	LOCATION	as compared with its less general and rapid extension in the Old World .

		The subject of his thoughtful and admirable address was '' Juvenile Readers as an Asset , '' and he spoke an energetic word for raising the standard of children 's books handled by the dealers that is , for wiser discrimination on the bookseller 's part in selecting his juvenile stock .

		The cooperation of parents is necessary in this toning up of the book-market , and one way in which they can make their children ashamed of a low taste in story-books is to make them read some of the trash aloud . ''

		One boy , '' said Mr.

		LIBRARY BORROWERS AND CIRCULATION .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Concerning your recent paragraph on the number of borrowers according to the population of a town , may I be allowed to suggest that statistics of borrowers which do not also include the statistics of circulation do not mean much ?

		I have in mind a library which reports over 14,000 borrowers and a circulation of less than 70,000 books , while other libraries with less than 8,000 borrowers circulate nearly 80,000 books .

		Why borrow - ers if they do not borrow ?

		The only difference can be that in the former case the list of borrowers has not been revised for years , and is no doubt many times the actual number of active borrowers ; while in the latter case , the list is kept more nearly down to the real number .

		It is true that `` statistics have a bad reputation , '' and in perhaps no other field do they often mean so little as in that of the library .

		TALKS ON FAMOUS ETCHERS .

		* It might be supposed that a book on Etchings forming a part of ' The Connoisseur 's Library '' would give a clear and comprehensive account of the etching process and the cognate processes of dry-point and aquatint , would then deal with the beauties and limitations of the results obtain - able by their employment , and place before the reader descriptions of the noteworthy achieve - ments of the artists who have used them success - fully , furnishing also lists of the most highly esteemed plates and indicating in each instance the preferable state .

		Apparently , however , Sir
Frederick Wedmore	PERSON	's conception is that the series to which he contributes aims not so much to educate connoisseurs as to entertain them ; so he considers it needless to attempt to tell the reader '' what constitutes a good Etching in the abstract '' or '' what subjects and what moods this particular Art favours . ''

		Instead he tells what he thinks of the best-known practitioners of the art .

		Personality rather than performance is what interests Sir
Frederick	PERSON	most .

		This book is more about etchers than etchings .

		It is made up of informal discourse in a rambling and jerky style , abounding in many parentheses .

		The following extract is characteristic , though it contains only two instances of the extraordinary use of capi - tals that the author affects .

		He speaks of Mr.
William Strang	PERSON	. ''


Strang	PERSON	has been extraordinarily prolific .

		Hundreds of plates landscapes and figure pieces , allegory and realism have been chronicled by Mr.
Laurence Binyon	PERSON	a grave , noteworthy personality : a serious thoughtful student in just such a volume as it ` is apparently at present -LRB- witness , for instance , the vast book which dis - plays the performances of Mr.
Brangwyn	PERSON	-RRB- the fondest aim of the ambitious , pertinacious Etcher to know is in existence about him .

		Far am I from saying that amongst those hundreds of pieces amongst these ' many inven - tions ' there are not numerous examples of Mr.
Strang	PERSON	's capacity to entertain visions of Beauty .

		His dreams that come to him so constantly : that come nearly as easily as words do to a Welshman his dreams are really not quite all of them nightmares . ''

		The caustic tone of these remarks is exceptional .

		For the most part the work of the several artists whom the author passes in review is looked upon with an indulgent eye .

		There is a constant effort to find as much as possible to praise .

		Occasion - ally he bestows dubious compliments , as when he prefaces an appreciation of the work of
Axel Bromxos	PERSON	.

		Haig by saying he will speak of him with per - haps no accent of personal ` iitliusi ; iMii , 1 ` iit with a measure of respect that is not invariably ac - corded him . ''

		In strong contrast to this is his warm commendation of a '' little Set '' of etchings by Veyrassat , which he does not hesitate to clas - sify as `` some of the most distinguished cm/nix wrought in all the years since men have etched . ''

		Whistler he is sure would have put his name to them with satisfaction .

		Hesitation in expressing opinion is not one of Sir
Frederick	PERSON	's shortcomings .

		Nevertheless he discreetly avoids committing himself upon diffi - cult matters of connoisseurship , as in the case of the etchings formerly attributed to Rembrandt but now regarded as of doubtful origin .

		The deft way in which he dodges the questions raised by these etchings is amusing .

		He admits that '' It is necessary of course , in writing about Rem - brandt or in studying him , to take account of this matter .

		But it would be a mistake here to pursue it in detail . ''

		Hence We have moved , in this chapter , where we were entitled to move among accepted pieces .

		We were entitled because it is very seldom , in the case of any master , that the chefs d'cmvre , and those that are in line with the chefs d'ceuvre , and therefore fit in any way to be remotely compared with them , are questioned at all .

		As a rule , the critic who is busy with doubtful attribu - tions , is busy with the second-rate . ''

		The longest chapters in the book are those de - voted to
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	and
Whistler	LOCATION	, twelve pages being accorded to one and a few lines more than that space to the other .

		The inadequacy of this to give anything like a comprehensive view of the work of either of these artists is so obvious that it savors of supererogation to point it out .

		What should be said of an appreciation of Rembrandt as an etcher that fails to make any mention of such important plates as '' The Three Trees '' or '' The Death of the Virgin '' ?

		It can scarcely be that the author does not find these works interesting .

		Yet he professes to give a brief chronological survey of the master 's achieve - ment in this special field , and he assigns dates with a confidence that a more careful student would find difficulty in sharing .

		His assertion that '' It was not till
1651	DATE	that we get the first of the nude women , '' is a case in point .

		In the main the author 's estimates of the ar - tistic worth of the etchings he sees fit to name are well considered .

		Few discriminating connois - seurs , for example , would question his rating of the ''
Clement	PERSON	de Jonghe '' as the greatest of
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	's etched portraits .

		But when he transforms
Whistler	LOCATION	's comment upon it into a glorification of Tintoretto the reader may well
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 461 be amazed .

		This is Sir
Frederick	PERSON	's version of Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's statement : '' And yet more interesting is it to be assured , as we have been lately assured , on evidence irrefutable , of how
Whistler	LOCATION	regarded it .

		He praised not often , but of this , what he said was , ' Without flaw : beautiful as a canvas by Tintoret beyond which there is nothing . ' ''

		Whistler , like other men , may have had sins to answer for , but he never could have made a state - ment so palpably absurd as this .

		What he did say was inscribed by him and signed with the butterfly signature upon the mount of a marvel - lous impression of the third state -LRB- according to
Dutuit	ORGANIZATION	's classification -RRB- of the `` Clement de Jonghe , '' now in a
Chicago	LOCATION	collection : '' Without flaw !

		Beautiful as a Greek marble or a canvas by Tintoret .

		`` A masterpiece in all its elements beyond which there is nothing . ''

		This and Sir
Frederick	PERSON	's distorted version , it will be perceived , are as wide apart as the poles .

		It is a pity that the incorrect statement should be given currency by being printed in a volume of an important series and vouched for '' on evi - dence irrefutable '' by an author so well known as Sir
Frederick Wedmore	PERSON	.

		The chapters dealing with other etchers are quite as cursory as the one about Rembrandt .

		That concerning
Whistler	LOCATION	is merely `` a little sketch-map '' of his career as an etcher .

		In mentioning Mr.
Howard Mansfield	PERSON	's `` Catalogue of
Whistler	LOCATION	's Etchings and Dry - Points , '' to which he accords generous praise , and the illus - trated catalogue issued by the
Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	, the author questions the advisability of `` the mul - tiplication of States '' that they encourage , and says `` It is possible it seems to me to be too elaborate for lucidity too intricate for practical convenience . ''

		Yet in commenting upon the ''
Clement	PERSON	de Jonghe '' he remarks that `` Little changes unimportant to mention , but not unimportant to avoid , have caused deterio - ration in the second '' state of the print .

		How , it may be asked , is the collector to know about these differences if they are not to be mentioned ?

		Apparently Sir
Frederick Wedmore	PERSON	has attempted in this volume to do again what Hamerton accomplished in his '' Etching and Etchers . ''

		In a way he has brought that work down to date , though without
Hamerton	PERSON	's liter - ary skill and charm of style ; and he overlooks some of our best American etchers , such as
Charles A. Platt	PERSON	,
J. Alden Weir	PERSON	, and
Cadwal	PERSON	- lader
Washburn	PERSON	.

		To have written a volume of two hundred and thirty pages upon a techni - cal subject and put in so very little information is , after all , something of a feat .

		Yet it fur - nishes agreeable reading , and the forty-four excellent reproductions of notable etchings make the book worth having .


FREDERICK W. GOOKIN	PERSON	.

		A RATIONAL VIEW or THE SUPERNATURAL .

		* It seemed inevitable that sooner or later such a book as Mr.
Tuckett	PERSON	's '' The Evidence for the Supernatural '' would come to be written , that once the tidal wave of mysticism spread by the precipitate conclusions of '' Psychic Researchers ' ' had spent its force and inundated defenceless positions , the sturdy common sense character - istic of
Huxley	LOCATION	's countrymen would assert itself .

		That the critical review when it came should be so thorough in execution , so broad in treat - ment , so acceptable in form and content , is a cause for congratulation in the rationalistic camp .

		The author 's misgiving that his sub-title would lay him open to the charge of egotism may be readily dismissed ; it is not the least of the merits of the book that it shows so clearly the necessity of trained judgment and the saturation of the inquiring mind with the saving grace of logical rectitude , sustained in turn by psycho - logical insight , for a safe conduct through the tangled thickets from which so many a traveller returns with strange tales and stranger beliefs .

		Mr.
Tuckett	PERSON	, among whose titles of distinc - tion is that of Senior Demonstrator of Physiology in
Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	, upholds the traditions of his scientific fraternity with a directness of purpose reflected in simple and effective address .

		He conveys a sense of mastery of his material that is indeed sufficiently '' uncommon '' to de - serve favorable mention .

		With the dissector 's sense of structure he manages to strip each subject of its enshrouding envelopes of acquired prejudice and confusion , and to deal directly with the flesh-and-blood reality underlying the presentable argument .

		In many hands this treatment might readily lead to a charge of irreverence , for the subjects of the dissection involve the intimate facts of our being and des - tiny about which cherished beliefs and hallowed views have been built up .

		Mr.
Tuckett	PERSON	's con - sideration is at once calm and sympathetic ; his knife is applied to save , not to injure .

		The personal candor which pervades the whole dis - arms criticism and compels attention .

		A Critical Study Made with `` Uncommon Sense . ''

		By
Ivor LI	PERSON	.

		Tuckett .


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		JU'J THE DIAL , -LRB- Mime 16 , The treatment is broad , though suggestive .

		It considers three orders of inquiry : first , the inherent logic of vexed issues , the nature of truth and evidence , the psychological prejudices and logical pit-falls that beset the procedure through which intellectual emancipation is achieved ; second , the examination of the prob - lems of '' Psychical Research '' and the proposed conclusions favoring a supernatural interpreta - tion of this type of occurrence ; third , the par - allel survey of the supernatural beliefs espoused by dominant religions .

		To this is added , by way of constructive compensation , a lucid state - ment of the agnostic position , offering food for all , irrespective of philosophy or religious be - lief .

		A series of appendices gives confirmatory data and citations , and gives an analytical review of Mrs.
Piper	ORGANIZATION	's revelational -LRB- or inquisi - tional -RRB- sittings which is quite the best diagnosis yet put forth of this illusive and defiant candi - date for supernatural honors .

		It would be comforting to believe that the mid - Victorian illumination of the logic of sci - ence had done its work so thoroughly that the fruits thereof would become the natural heritage of succeeding generations .

		Yet despite the reinforced contributions of Mill ,
Lewes	LOCATION	,
Lecky	LOCATION	,
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Clifford	PERSON	,
Morley	PERSON	, White , and others in brilliant succession , it would appear that the les - son must be set anew to each generation , almost for each situation ; the personal element is so insistent that vicarious experience carries but a feeble moral .

		The fundamental clue to the reason why men and women of ordinary and extraordi - nary sturdiness of mind go wrong in the alluring purlieus of `` Psychical Research '' remains a logical one .

		Truth and evidence seem objective enough ; and with charted seas , light-houses , and compass , it would appear that anyone with com - mon sense and a fair experience could steer a sea - worthy vessel safely to port .

		Yet the frailty of human reasoning is writ large on every page of history ; and the
fall	DATE	of man through partak - ing of the tree of too little knowledge is quite as truly the story of logical as of moral imper - fection .

		We talk glibly of the prejudices , as of the superstitions , of our ancestors and of our neighbors ; and we realize these forces , for the most part , sincerely , tolerantly , and understand - ingly .

		But bias spreads its roots tenaciously in the sub-soil , conditioning growth in a way not revealed on the surface .

		There seems , too , a peculiar atmosphere of the seance chamber hostile to lucid rationality .

		Even men of large intellectual calibre and trained judgment seem to lose or drop the aegis of their armament when confronted with a '' medium '' claiming trans - cendental powers and strangely violating , while professedly conforming to , the rules of scientific procedure .

		Mr.
Tuckett	PERSON	's chapters on `` Truth and Evidence '' are highly pertinent .

		They are addressed to '' the man-in-tlii ' - .

		street / ` and though intended for home consumption will > aiVI \ U.-ar exportation to kindred communiti > Modern Spiritualism , an American product of lowly origin , represents the leit-motif in the movement of ** Psychical Research . ''

		This is significant ; for its affiliations are ancient , with varied and rich development among primi - tive peoples .

		This cultural connection is well brought out by Mr.
Tuckett	PERSON	, who cites parallels in the beliefs , practice , and conclusions among unenlightened devotees to the most recent so - berly recorded message from the beyond .

		The presence of scientific instruments , a stenographic record , and the academic credentials of the sitters fail to obscure the resemblance .

		The hypothesis finds its complement and its rival in telepathy , which is the scientific formulation of the power to transcend ordinary limitations of sense ; its cultural analogue is the belief in second-sight -LRB- clairvoyance -RRB- of favored individ - uals .

		The argument when stated statistically seems to carry conclusion with the sacredness attaching to numbers ; but the qualities ascribed to them as reinforcements of beliefs aroused and cherished by quite other considerations are no less subjective , however radically unlike the mys - tical ascriptions of the most devout Pythagoreans of Hellenicor mediaeval cast of mind .

		Mr.
Tuckett	PERSON	subjects the evidence for telepathy to a critical analysis .

		It all comes back to a sense of logical solidarity ; knowledge is limited , but the temper to which it yields is abundantly manifest .

		The universe is imperfectly known ; but the dom - inant trend of its phenomena forms a goodly and after all a fairly consistent bit of doctrine .

		Shall we modestly recognize the manifold gaps in our constantly revised system , or shall we peer through these openings for strange light that shines not on sea or land of our accredited domain ?

		Professor
James	PERSON	was wont to regard the answer as determined by our sense of the dramatic possibilities .

		Mr.
Tuckett	PERSON	finds in the dossier of the case a great contribution to the psychology of bias .

		At first sight a relation between the argu - ment for telepathy and for the efficacy of prayer seems strange .

		Granted the preliminaries of Mi .

		Tuckett 's position and the logical analogy fol - lows , and leads naturally to the discussion of miracles , which has always occupied the centre
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 463 of the stage in the drama of the supernatural .

		The spirit of the inquiry is here broadened .

		Logical value gives way to psychological inter - est ; for prayer and miracles become '' varieties of religious experience '' in the sense familiar - ized by
James	PERSON	.

		These we may project upon a foreign background , and thus withdraw undue attention from the veridical features , while ob - serving their common function of ministering to spiritual satisfaction and the generic features of psychological conformity to type which such experiences present despite contrasts of setting and alien habits of mind .

		Here , too , pathology of the mind enters ; hallucinations have taken the guise of revelations ; abnormal susceptibility may be associated with the possession of alleged supernormal powers .

		The inclusive query re - mains : Why may not the comprehension of the manifestations grouped about prayer and miracles , and the tendency to credit supernatural powers of revelation , proceed by mutual illu - mination ?

		The spirit of the drama is quite independent of the stage setting ; interests and their expression exert a mutual influence upon one another , yet reveal similarity of source and appeal in and through the diversity of culture .

		Whether or not investigations in `` Psychical Research '' can or should influence one 's atti - tude towards experiences most conveniently called spiritual , towards a group of beliefs that have always attracted the interests of men , towards the conception of the universe , and the bearing of science upon the conduct of life , is a question which Mr.
Tuckett	PERSON	includes within the scope of his survey .

		He sets forth the founda - tions of the agnostic position , and compares its offerings even to the concreteness of parallel columns with those of more positive religious faiths .

		The spirit of tolerance has so far tri - umphed that such argument proceeds nowadays with mutual respect of rival protagonists and a relieving absence of suggestions of moral lapse .

		There is no doubt that philosophical inclinations have now an easier approach to a respectful hearing than in the days when heresy was a convenient charge for an uncongenial position .

		With this increased privilege comes the obliga - tion and opportunity to achieve an intellectual conformity of thought and sympathy that is char - acteristically modern , even recent , and which in turn determines the manner of interest in , and the attitude towards , the significance and bear - ing of `` Psychical Research . ''

		Views are not so much refuted as outgrown .

		Mr.
Tuckett	PERSON	's volume is at once a factor and an aid in this consummation .

BASSETT	PERSON	'S LiIPE OF
ANDREW JACKSON	PERSON	.

		* The appearance of the Life of
Andrew Jack	PERSON	- son , upon which Professor
John Spencer Bassett	PERSON	of
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	has long been engaged , gratifies the expectant reader .

		Based upon a painstak - ing examination of the voluminous manuscript papers of President
Jackson	PERSON	, this work , more nearly than any of its numerous predecessors , intimately and justly portrays the character of one of the most remarkable of Americans .

		In the first volume Professor
Bassett	PERSON	traces
Jackson	PERSON	's career from his birth -LRB- as to which he accepts
Jackson	PERSON	's own belief that he was born in
South Carolina	LOCATION	-RRB- through the oppressed boy - hood of the Revolutionary period , the youthful shif tings in
North and South Carolina	LOCATION	, the early duelling and judging and Indian fighting , the rise to fame in military affairs , the crowning glory of
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and the evolution of the frontier general into a presidential candidate .

		This volume closes with the election of
1824	DATE	; thus there is left for the second volume the cam - paign against
Adams	PERSON	, the two presidential terms , and the declining years , to
Jackson	PERSON	's death , in
1845	DATE	, at the age of seventy-eight .

		When one compares the periods of time allotted to the re - spective volumes , fifty-seven years to the first and twenty-one to the second , it would seem hard to suggest a fairer division ; yet the second vol - ume leaves one with the sense of compression , as if the story had been hurriedly brought to a close .

		This feeling involves not so much the details of the life , for these are kept before one to the end .

		The relation which
Jackson	PERSON	, as the central figure , bore to the purely political phase of the period could hardly be presented in better proportion .

		The account of the rivalry with
Calhoun	PERSON	and the struggle with Clay is masterly .

		It is to the deeper economic and social forces which
Jackson	PERSON	repre - sented that one wishes the author might have given more space .

		It is indeed attempted , and with all success , to give summaries of the prob - lems of
Jackson	PERSON	's administrations , the craze for internal improvements , the difficulties of the system of finance and banking , the friction in Indian relations and in foreign relations , the con - flict as to the proper policy in the administration of the public lands .

		But
Jackson	PERSON	's own relation to the questions which his administration brought before him , and his own point of view as deter - mined or strongly influenced by the experience of his own
State	ORGANIZATION	, might , in the opinion of the reviewer , be more clearly brought out .

		As to the banks , it was

Jackson	PERSON	stormed at the first relief '' bank of this section of the

Washington	LOCATION	was set at work to accomplish the '' Western '' policy .

		In the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	,
John Bell	PERSON	was made the chairman of the committee on Indian rela - tions ; in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, in the similar chairman - ship ,
Hugh Lawson	PERSON	White led the administra - tion 's forces .

		Strangely enough , of all the
Tennessee	LOCATION	delegation it was only the typical and eccentric backwoodsman ,
David Crockett	PERSON	, already at odds with
Jackson	PERSON	, who arose to plead the cause of the poor Indian .

		But we recognize that Professor
Bassett	PERSON	has undertaken to write a life of
Jackson	PERSON	, not a history of his times .

		For what he has done he is entitled to the warmest praise .

		We have found but few errors of fact .

		In the first volume , two may be noted .

		On page 25 , it is stated that * By an act of
May 26 , 1790	DATE	, con - gress organized the country between the
Ohio	LOCATION	and the present states of
Alabama	LOCATION	and Missis - sippi as ` The Territory of the
United States Southwest of the River Ohio	LOCATION	. ' '

		This statement is incorrect :
Kentucky	LOCATION	was admitted to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	as a district of
Virginia	LOCATION	, and was never ceded to the
United States	LOCATION	, as
North Carolina	LOCATION	had ceded the
Tennessee	LOCATION	country .

		Again , page 28 , it is argued that the position of representa - tive in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was reserved by the leaders for
Jackson	PERSON	because he was strong with the people and this was `` a single oilier which depended on the suffrages of all the people . ''

		On the contrary , the governor was elected by popular vote .

		In this respect the
Tennessee	LOCATION	constitution of
1796	DATE	made a notable advance over that of the mother-state ,
North Carolina	LOCATION	.

		The work is embellished with reproductions of the Sully ,
Healy	PERSON	,
Carter	PERSON	, and
Earl	PERSON	portraits of the
General	ORGANIZATION	, and others of a daguerreotype by
Adams	PERSON	and a miniature by
Vallee	PERSON	.

		Tin it - are also reproductions of a drawing of the Hermitage and an engraving of a miniature of Mrs.
Jackson	PERSON	by
Anna C. Peale	PERSON	.

		There are two maps , one illustrating
Jackson	PERSON	's operations in the
Creek	LOCATION	country and around Mobile in 1813-1814 , and the other the movements of the armies around
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		The printing is for the most part well done .

		Somewhat unusu - ally , and perhaps to the confusion of those who may wish to refer to the work , the paging is carried consecutively through the two volumes .

		A NEW STUDY OF POETRY .

		* Professor
Jack	PERSON	, the author of a brilliant study of the poetry of
Shelley	LOCATION	, has of course long since won his spurs in the lists of criticism .

		In his new volume on '' Poetry and Prose '' he discusses the work of some seven poets of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , with the fundamental purpose of demonstrating how these poets illus - trate the description of poetry with which his volume opens .

		Mr.
Jack	PERSON	is too sensible to undertake an exact definition of poetry .

		The most he attempts to do is to describe it .

		Perhaps one may best char - acterize his attitude by saying that he resolutely exalts the mood of the poet . ''

		Prose is the language of cool reason , Poetry that of ecstasy .

		It follows that Prose is the language of speech , normal , without rhythm , balanced , like a highway road , a straight line , a stick , the sentences coining to an end and joining into one another imperceptibly ; and that Poetry is the language of song , at least of rhythm for utterance , when excited , takes to itself a rhythmk - cjiuil - ity .

		Poetry is what man utters when he loses his balance , his normality the high and low notes of emotion . ''

		Acceptance of this doctrine of course depends on the sense which we are willing to attach to the words '' ecstasy '' and '' loss of balance or normal - ity . ''

		Taken in the ordinary sense , it seems to us POBTBT AND PROSE .

		THE DIAL 465 that they present an extreme view of the poetic mood .

		But compare it now with this passage a little further on : `` Prose is Is , the ever-present fact , to-day ; Poetry , in love with yesterday and to-morrow , flies to the cool night and away from noon to the cool night with its silences and the riddle of the unnumbered stars .

		Prose deals with things as they are school , marriage , wills , dress , law , civilisation , order and degree .

		Poetry is oc - cupied with the bases of these birth , love , and death , human passions , men . ''

		From this it appears that it is not so much with the non-normal as with the commonplace that prose has to deal .

		It is perhaps unfortunate that Mr.
Jack	PERSON	uses the word normal in this sense .

		For the usual , or common , and the normal are not necessarily identical ; and to say that the poetic mood is not as normal to man as the mood of prose is inexact and misleading .

		The last two sentences of the quotation , too , seem to us unfor - tunate , since they tend to draw attention to the material with which the poet deals .

		It is not , how - ever , the matter but the mood that counts .

		To accept Mr.
Jack	PERSON	's words literally would compel one to rule out poems like
Spenser	PERSON	's `` Epitha - lamion '' and the conclusion of '' In Memoriam , '' as well as such lines as '' Move upward , working out the beast , And let the ape and tiger die . ''

		Likewise this , which is surely not the least poetic stanza of '' The Palace of Art '' : '' And one , an English home gray twilight pour 'd On dewy pastures , dewy trees , Softer than sleep all things in order stored , A haunt of ancient Peace . ''

		Of course Mr.
Jack	PERSON	means nothing of the kind .

		What he does mean , as we infer from his context , is that in a general way school , while it lasts , is a prosaic , not to say distasteful , matter ; that marriage , when it suggests merely settlements and household economies , is likewise incapable of arousing the poetic fervor .

		We follow our author more readily when he says that '' the use of the poetic imagination com - municates an ideal pleasure , a pleasure derived ultimately from the realization by the soul of its own freedom in regard to the world . ''

		Or , as one might put it , poetry is the voice of the infi - nite in man .

		Mr.
Jack	PERSON	now takes up some of the kinds of poetry , and first the poetry of the young man and of the mature man .

		By the poetry of maturity he means that which `` is concerned immediately with the feeling itself and is occupied solely in expressing the feeling as felt ... Some experi - ence comes to the poet and he reverberates with a sympathetic cry . ''

		The most concrete instance of this he finds to be
Wordsworth	PERSON	's lines on the death of Lucy : '' A slumber did my spirit seal ; I had no human fears : She seemed a thing that could not feel The touch of earthly years . ''

		No motion has she now , no force ; She neither hears nor sees : Rolled round in earth 's diurnal course , With rocks , and stones , and trees . ''

		Perhaps impressions are of no great consequence , but it seems to us that these lines are distinctly the work of a young man ; it may be recalled that
Wordsworth	PERSON	wrote them at twenty-nine .

		We grant that the first six lines are a simple and `` perfect '' expression of the vital contrasted with the inanimate ; but what of the last two lines ?

		Is not this the thought of a young man , who is not expressing the naked feeling that the loss of Lucy brings ?

		The thought of earth 's diurnal course is an intellectual concept , a matter of science .

		The young man , then , is not so far from the `` normal '' but that he thinks of this fact and connects
Lucy	PERSON	's remains with other revolving objects .

		* And -LRB- though this is aside from the main question -RRB- is it not after all a poor way of characterizing inanimity , for do not the living revolve with the dead ?

		We will only add that if the two lines be justified by Words worth - ians on the ground of their being emotion recol - lected in tranquillity , then the expression of such emotion is to us not convincing .

		The poetry of the young , Mr.
Jack	PERSON	believes to be that in which the expression is less deeply con - trolled by the emotion ; it is '' the rhapsody of appreciation .

		The young poet is more alive than any other young man , though all young men are more alive than mature men to the beauty and charm of colour , glory of sight , delight of scent , which is in the world , as also he is more alive to the delicate ecstasies of newly awakened feeling . ''

		To illustrate this the author quotes from
Keats	PERSON	and from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's early plays .

		But un - fortunately for his nomenclature , he admits that we occasionally find the same sort of thing in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's later plays .

		Would it not be bet - ter , then , instead of distinguishing between the poetry of maturity and that of immaturity , to say that the difference is not so much of kind as of the degree to which the emotion controls the expression ?

		* Compare
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Break , thou deep vase of chilling tears , That grief hath shaken into frost . ''

		the effect of which is similar , because it is an invasion by science into the domain of poetry .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
June 16	DATE	, Mr.
Jack	PERSON	is quite right in saying that '' poetry is not description , it is sympathetic emotion . ''

		A passage is poetical to the degree in which the description , brief or prolonged , rises out of and conveys , with sustained effect , the emotion of the poet .

		There must be a unity of impression ; a poem , long or short , must impress us as a whole .

		Sometimes , however , '' the impression is not poetical , as in * The Ring and the Book / and this is because the whole , allowing for surprising spurts of emotion , is the result of an intellectual process . ''

		To discuss this passage leads us into a large question .

		Is '' The Ring and the Book '' a poem ?

		Is it poetical in its effect ?

		Applying the rigor - ous standard propounded by Mr.
Jack	PERSON	, we must answer in the negative .

		Only in spots does the poet come anywhere near the poetic madness posited by Mr.
Jack	PERSON	's description .

		Yet we can not believe that this is quite conclusive .

		For it must be borne in mind that '' The Ring and the Book '' is a dramatic poem .

		Except in the prologue and the conclusion , the poet is depicting not his own state of mind and feeling but that of nine other persons , namely , three citizens of
Rome	LOCATION	, , the three chief actors in the drama , the two lawyers , and the Pope who pronounces the final judgment .

		Obviously a lyrical standard , which will apply to the singer 's personal expression , can not be the same as a dramatic standard , which will apply to all the other persons represented by the poet as speak - ing .

		The utmost that we can require of char - acters dramatically conceived in poetry is that they shall be so far removed from the common - place as never to suggest it or reflect it .

		That is , they must be conceived with ideal skill and speak and act with ideal propriety .

		They need not , nay , they can not , always exhibit a non - normal state of mind ; it is enough if they exhibit this high poetic feeling when the dra - matic situation demands it .

		Nobody expects poetry in the narrowest sense from the Roman citizens who present their views of the tragedy ; or from the lawyers , who provide a kind of comic relief .

		But we do expect the protagonists , the persons vitally concerned in this dark trag - edy , to speak and act at climactic points as becomes denizens of the world of poetry .

		Let us see how
Browning	PERSON	manages this .

		At his exam - ination , speaking of the flight , Caponsacchi is reported in '' the Old Yellow Book '' to have said : '' Accordingly , at about one o'clock in the
morning	TIME	, she came alone to the said gate .

		We entered the car and turned along outside of the city wall to go to the gate of
San Spirito	LOCATION	, which is in the direction of
Perugia	LOCATION	. ''

		This is how
Browning	PERSON	renders it : ' And thus Through each familiar hindrance of the day Did I make steadily for its hour and end , Felt time 's old barrier-growth of right and tit Give way through all its twines , and let me go .

		Use and wont recognized the excepted man , Let speed the special service , and I sped Till , at the dead between
midnight and morn	TIME	, There was I at the goal , before the gate , With a tune in the ears , low leading up to loud , A light in the eyes , faint that would soon be flare , Ever some spiritual witness new and new In faster frequence , crowding solitude To watch the way o ' the warfare , till , at last , When the ecstatic minute must bring birth , Began a whiteness in the distance , waxed Whiter and whiter , near grew and more near , Till it was she : there did Pompilia come : The white I saw shine through her was her soul 's , Certainly , for the body was one black , Black from head down to foot .

		She did not speak , Glided into the carriage , so a cloud Gathers the moon up .

		By
San Spirito	LOCATION	, To
Rome	LOCATION	, as if the road burned underneath !

		Reach
Rome	LOCATION	, then hold my head in pledge , I pay The run and the risk to heart 's content ! '

		Just that , I said , then , in another tick of time , Sprang , was beside her , she and I alone . ''

		In the Old Yellow Book , as is well known , there is no suggestion of love between
Caponsacchi	ORGANIZATION	and
Pompilia	LOCATION	, except from their enemies .

		Their mutual love in the poem is entirely the creation of
Browning	PERSON	, and this it is which removes the story from the commonplace of an ordinary trial and surrounds it with the atmosphere of poetry .

		We do not forget that the intellectually conceived purpose of the poem , as expressed at the outset , was to furnish an object lesson on how the poet by a mysterious alchemy makes poetry out of the raw material of fact , as well as to show how difficult is the course of Truth in the world , though she will ultimately come to her own and triumph .

		That is all very true ; but the poet , as it were , forgets all about this purpose , so that in the hist chapter , `` The Book and the Ring , '' we have only leave-takings , last echoes of the trial , the execution , the lawyers ' complaints ; and then at the end the words , didactic indeed but emotionally phrased , about the mission of art Art may tell a truth Obliquely , do the thing shall breed the thought , Nor wrong the thought , missing the mediate word .

		So may you paint your picture , twice show truth , Beyond mere imagery on the wall , So , note by note , bring music from your mind , Deeper than ever the Andante dived , So write a book shall mean beyond the facts , Suffice the eye and save the soul beside . ''

		We should be inclined , then , to say that the prevailing impression made by '' The Ring and
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 467 the Book '' is poetical .

		The intellectual process has been lost to sight in the artistic transforma - tion of the characters as dramatically conceived and presented .

		The poets whom Mr.
Jack	PERSON	discusses and the varieties of poetic activity they respectively rep - resent , are Gray -LRB- social or prose poetry -RRB- ,
Burns	PERSON	-LRB- natural or spontaneous poetry -RRB- ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	-LRB- basic or elemental poetry -RRB- ,
Byron	PERSON	-LRB- oratorical poetry -RRB- ,
Emerson	PERSON	-LRB- didactic poetry -RRB- , Arnold -LRB- crit - ical or reflective poetry -RRB- , and
Meredith	PERSON	-LRB- intel - lectual poetry -RRB- .

		It will be noted that epic and dramatic poetry have no place in the list ; it is with lyric poetry that Mr.
Jack	PERSON	is in the main concerned .

		We shall not quarrel further with our critic , for with most of what he says we are in hearty accord .

		* He has a fine and accurate critical sense .

		We would call special attention to his remarks on
Burns	PERSON	's love poetry -LRB- pp. 81-5 -RRB- ; his subtle analysis of the '' Ode on Immortality '' -LRB- pp. 110-16 -RRB- ; and his close examination of the style of Meredith -LRB- pp. 205ff . -RRB-

		.

		In short , he has produced an illuminating and suggestive study of poetry , which no student can afford to ignore .


CLARK S. NORTHUP	PERSON	.

		* Just what is '' ungrammatical '' in the line quoted from
Burns	PERSON	, '' It was na sae ye glinted by '' -LRB- p. 79 -RRB- , we can not make out .

		To us the line makes perfect grammatical sense .

		A COOPERATIVE HISTORY OF THE MIDDLE AGES .

		* It is now nearly a century since
Leopold von Ranke	PERSON	began his wonderful career as student of history and master workman in the little guild of historical investigators .

		Since that day the advance of historical science has been almost marvellous .


Ranke	PERSON	's work furnished not only inspiration but standards and methods .

		The influence of the German ideals is clearly seen in the vast collections of documentary materials and the innumerable monographs on themes , both great and trifling , that have been pub - lished during the past two generations .

		These activities have also compelled a change in the method of writing histories of the general type .

		The task that
Edward Gibbon	PERSON	undertook would to-day seem almost impossible .

		Histo - rians who write extended works find themselves revising the first volume before the second is finished .

		The only way out of present difficul - * THE CAMBRIDGE MEDIEVAL HISTORY .

		Planned by
J. B. Bury	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	Edited by
H. M. Gwatkin	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, and
J. P. Whitney	PERSON	,
D.D. Volume I. New York	LOCATION	: The Mac - millan
Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		ties seems to be through cooperative work .

		Of cooperative histories we have two chief types : one , in which each contributor deals with a period of some extent , one that can be conven - iently treated in a single volume ; and another composed of a series of brief monographs , each making a chapter or part of a chapter in a volume of related studies .

		The latter type is best illustrated by `` The Cambridge Modern History , '' a massive work of twelve bulky vol - umes that has just seen completion .

		The
Cambridge	LOCATION	plan has been severely criti - cized as one that sacrifices unity and continuity of style and narrative in order to secure the last conclusion and the most recent view of the specialist .

		But the
Cambridge	LOCATION	historians still have faith in the correctness and practicability of Lord
Acton	PERSON	's ideas .

		A ''
Cambridge History	ORGANIZATION	of English Literature '' has recently been pre - pared according to the
Cambridge	LOCATION	plan .

		And now we have the initial volume of a new venture , '' The
Cambridge	LOCATION	Medieval History . ''

		It was eminently proper that this work should be planned by Lord
Acton	PERSON	's successor in the Regius professorship , Professor J. B. Bury .

		It is also appropriate that the writing of a history that must necessarily give particular attention to the mediaeval church should be done under the supervision of scholars who have positive church interests : the first volume has been edited by the church historian , Dr.
H. M. Gwatkin	PERSON	, and by the Rev.
J. P. Whitney	PERSON	.

		The work begins with the reign of Constantine , and the first vol - ume covers roughly two centuries , the fourth and the fifth .

		Eight volumes will complete the work .

		When the last chapter is written , Cam - bridge
University	ORGANIZATION	will have given us a continuous narrative of the world 's history since the decline of
Rome	LOCATION	sixteen centuries of decline and pro- gress in twenty large and carefully written volumes .

		With all its shortcomings , the series is a most notable undertaking ; it will be many years before the student of the past can afford to neglect the
Cambridge	LOCATION	histories .

		It is an essential part of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	plan to find and enlist the services of the most eminent specialists , not only in
England	LOCATION	but elsewhere .

		Whether all the writers who have contributed to the present volume belong to this class may well be doubted ; but no fault can be found with the choice of contributors in most instances .

		The chapters on Constantine and Arianism are from the pen of Professor
Gwatkin	PERSON	.

		For an account of the Asiatic background of the Hunnish and other Mongol invasions , the editors have gone to Dr.
T. Peisker	PERSON	of
Graz	LOCATION	.

		An Irish abbot , Dom 4ti8 THE DIAL -LSB- .


June 16	DATE	,
E. C. Butler	PERSON	, writes on monasticism .

		Professor
Paul Vinogradoff	PERSON	, the economic historian , sums up the social situation in
the fourth century	DATE	.

		Other contributors who have acquired more than local fame are Professor
F. J. Haverfield	PERSON	of
Oxford	LOCATION	, Professor
M. Dumoulin	PERSON	of
Paris	LOCATION	, and Dr.
M. Manitius	PERSON	of
Dresden	LOCATION	.

		The editors inform us that the work follows the general lines of Lord
Acton	PERSON	's plan , but with a few improvements of detail suggested by experience . ''

		What these improvements are the reviewer has not been able to determine .

		In all the externals of print , binding , arrangement of materials , etc. , this volume bears a close resem - blance to those of the
Modern History	ORGANIZATION	.

		In its treatment of events it is more philosophic than the earlier work , one of whose chief defects lies in a failure to subordinate minor details .

		The present volume has more discussion and fewer details .

		But this is not necessarily due to a conscious effort on the part of the writers : the nature of the sources and the poverty of the doc - uments are such that a highly detailed account becomes impossible .

		It seems , however , that a conscious attempt has been made not merely to chronicle passing events , but also to discuss somewhat fully the social , institutional , and intellectual aspects of the age .

		This purpose appears in such chapters as those on the reorganization of the empire ; the organization of the church ; monasticism ; social and economic conditions ; thoughts and ideas of the period ; and early Christian art .

		Dr.
Peisker	PERSON	's chapter on the nomadic life of the steppes can scarcely be called history at all ; nevertheless , it is an exceedingly suggestive and informing discussion , and adds much to the value of the work .

		A volume of this sort , embodying as it does the views of twenty historians , can in the nature of things have no single view-point .

		But differ - ing view-points need not necessarily be contra - dictory or hostile .

		It must be said that , on the whole , the editors have succeeded remarkably well in fitting the chapters and parts of chapters together in such a way as to avoid a too evident clash of opinions .

		In a brief review it is not possible to indicate the divergent views or the new views that may be found in a text of more than six hundred large pages ; the reviewer therefore wishes to limit himself to a brief state - ment of the opinions advanced by Dr.
Martin	PERSON	Bang and Dr.
Peisker	PERSON	as to racial origins .

		A generation ago it was held that the Indo - European race originated somewhere in
Central Asia	LOCATION	and came into
Europe	LOCATION	as an invading peo - ple .

		Recent scholars have rejected this hy | > oth - esis , some even going so far as to doubt the existence of any such race .

		But Dr. Bang , who writes the chapter on '' The Expansion of the Teu - tons , '' holds with the archaeologists of tin - North that the Indo-European race is not a fiction , but that its origin was European not Asiatic .

		`` The earliest home of the Teutons was in the coun - tries surrounding the western extremity of the
Baltic Sea	LOCATION	, comprising what is now the south of
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Jutland	LOCATION	with
Schleswig-Holstein	LOCATION	, the German Baltic coast to about the
Oder	PERSON	, and the islands with which the sea is studded as far as
Gothland	LOCATION	.

		This , not
Asia	LOCATION	, is the region which , with a certain extension south , as far , say , as the great mountain chain of central
Germany	LOCATION	, may be described as the cradle of the Indo-Germanic race .

		According to all appearance , this was the centre from which it impelled its successive waves of population towards the west , south , and southeast , to take possession , in the end , of all
Europe	LOCATION	and even of a part of
Asia	LOCATION	. ''

		This expansion of the race seems to have been completed by
1500	DATE	B. C .

		A fragment remained behind in the original home , where it developed into the group of tribes and nations that we call the Teutons or Germans , whose migrations in the fourth and fifth centuries overwhelmed the ancient world .

		But what
Asia	LOCATION	loses in Dr. Bang 's chapter it regains to some extent in a later discussion .

		Dr.
Peisker	PERSON	emphasizes the Mongolian element in the European peoples , an element which he finds all through eastern and southeastern
Europe	LOCATION	: '' the Mongol type of features extends westwards to
Bavaria	LOCATION	and Wiirttemberg . ''

		The Roumanians need no longer boast of Roman descent ; like the Huns and Bulgarians , they are of Asiatic origin .

		descendants of nomads from the steppes .

		The same the author holds to be true of several other European peoples whom we usually do not think of as of Turanian stock .

		If Dr.
Peisker	PERSON	is cor - rect , more than half of the population of
Europe	LOCATION	must have descended from Asiatic fathers and European mothers .

		And like the peasantry among which they wintered -LRB- and winter -RRB- long enough , they became -LRB- and become -RRB- after a transitory bilingualism , Greeks , Albanians , Ser - vians , Bulgarians , Rutheniaus , Poles , Slovaks ,
Chekhs	LOCATION	, Slovenes , Croatians , seeing that they appeared there not as a compact body , but as a mobile nomad stratum among a strange-tongued and more numerous peasant element , and not till later did they take to agriculture and themselves become settled . ''

		It has long been realized that purity of race is a mere fiction ; but as to the various ingredi - ents in the different racial mixtures , there is no general agreement .

		To the settlement of these problems , the present volume appears to have brought an important contribution .

		THE DIAL 469 SOME RECENT DRAMAS .

		* Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's '' The War God , '' quite aside from its significance as a document in the movement for Peace , is a vigorous and well-wrought drama , dar - ingly using verse form for a play realistic in setting and detail , and by no means failing in the literary aspect of the work .

		At times the writer drops below the level demanded of blank verse , and he indulges in an irritating and entirely unnecessary clipping of words ; but , broadly speaking , the literary technique is adequate , while there can be no question as to the dramatic values or noble largeness of the theme .

		Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	is working with increasing effectiveness in the dramatic form .

		It is worth noting that Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	's new and striking piece , `` The Terrible Meek , '' is a variant of the same subject : he cries up the coming of Peace , even as does Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	.

		Much silly and mislead - ing criticism has been directed against this drama , since its production at the Little Theatre in
New York	LOCATION	.

		The reader discovers that here is a one-act play very novel in method and design , played for forty minutes in darkness , but showing plainly in its dialogue how certain soldiers are turned away from their profession by the words of a poor mother bewail - ing the execution of her son .

		Her meekness , and that of her child , is terrible in its non-resistance .

		The final clearing-away of the mists to reveal , not modern
England	LOCATION	, but
Palestine	LOCATION	, with the three figures on the cross , is simply making visual the allegory , and none but the philistine could take it otherwise .

		The play is a beautiful , impressive , and altogether legitimate work .

		But Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	is a social student ; and with the most sympathetic characterization , happy dialogue , and atmospheric visualization , he has here shown us the dangers in two opposing methods of charity : the impulsive kind-hearted personal sort , represented by the painter who is the gull of the piece , and the organized philanthropy which leaves the heart cold .

		Just as in '' Strife , '' the author states the case , and lets us make the inference ; nor does he ever forget that a play is an entertainment .

Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	and Brieux in their social biologies .

		It is an interesting essay in eugenics ; and also , to our mind , an interesting play .

		Why should not the daughter of a scientist father be so educated as to regard clean blood in her suitor as important as blue eyes ?

		Her decision is justified , and a final scene of real power finds her aligned with the right man .

		Mr.
MacKaye	PERSON	does not consider it necessary to be '' unhappy '' at the end , in order to drive his lesson home .

		The same author 's group of one-act plays , '' Yankee Fantasies , '' reminds us how steadily this promising dramatic form is gaining .

		It should become thor - oughly domesticated , for it offers opportunities of broad brush-work superior to the longer play , and often brings us back to the essentials of drama , stripped of all padding .

		The work in this volume might be described as the poetic and imaginative handling of homely realistic material ; and in such examples as `` Sam Average '' and `` The Cat Boat '' the result is convincing .

		In a piece like '' Chuck '' the symbolism may possibly overlie the dramatic texture too thickly ; but Mr.
MacKaye	PERSON	's idealism is refreshing in contrast with the frequent sordid insist - ence upon the other extreme .

		An unobtrusive note of patriotism breathes through the entire book , and the atmosphere is richly and enjoyably that of
New England	LOCATION	.

		Popular interest in the work of
Strindberg	LOCATION	will be quickened by his death , especially as many of his plays are now being brought out in
America	LOCATION	.

		The latest addition is a fairly good English version of his `` FrOken
Julie	PERSON	, '' described by the author as `` a nat - uralistic tragedy . ''

		It is a brutal study of opposed types ; and of the two persons , the aristocratic woman and the valet to whom she stoops , it were hard to say which is the more repellant .

		So far as such a work has any use or meaning , it would appear to be an exposure of the worst features of both upper and lower classes , done with the grim , uncompromising realism for which
Strindberg	LOCATION	is famous , Yet one 470 TIIK DIAL -LSB- .


June 16	DATE	, can but sigh that so much power should be expended upon such a result One has a right to challenge this kind of literature with the inevitable Cui bonof From
Strindberg	LOCATION	's '' Frdken Julie '' to Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	's `` Polite Farces '' is a change indeed !

		These light , clever , keen one-act sketches are built for parlor dimensions ; and while not an important part of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's product , they serve their pur - pose of intelligent amusement .

		The best of the three is `` The Stepmother , '' but u A Good Woman '' is full of fun and skilfully handled . ''

		A Question of Sex '' seems less successful because of the assumed condi - tions .

		Given the drawing-room environment , all of them should go well , and they certainly are pleasant to read .

		Tchekhof ranks among the leaders of latter-day Russian fiction and drama , and the appearance of two of his representative plays in a capital transla - tion is therefore welcome .

		After their perusal , however , one is tempted to doubt the Russian gift for play-making .

		The dramas of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	,
Gorky	ORGANIZATION	,
Andrev	LOCATION	, and
Tchekhof	PERSON	have a hundred virtues ; but that particular virtue which consists of so telling a story in dramatic form as to lead up to an essential and compelling climax , the Slav can not boast .

		Of these two pieces of Tchekhof , `` The Seagull '' and `` The Cherry Orchard , '' the former is the more dramatic , and is unquestionably interesting for its character study ; but it is a visualized narrative of love at cross purposes rather than a drama .

		As for the second , the reader is fairly dazed as the dra - matis persona drifts off and on , and he grasps like a drowning man for a straw at the incident of the sale of an orchard , whereby is revealed the tendency of upper-class folk in the land of the Czar to talk eternally and never act ven the informing Intro - duction by the translator .

		Mr.
George Calderon	PERSON	, can not convince us that `` atmosphere dialogue '' is a substitute for `` action dialogue . ''

		Two versions appear almost simultaneously of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's striking posthumous play , '' `` The Living Corpse , '' which has aroused considerable discussion abroad , and has been played in several countries .

		The idea of an unworthy husband allowing his wife to think him dead so that she may secure a divorce and marry another , is an excellent one for dramatic purposes , and a dramatist such as
M. Bernstein	PERSON	would have made it thrilling .

		But in the hands of the great Russian it is a fine theme told in narrative rather than dramatic fashion .

		Valuable as it is for its knowl - edge of the types , and arresting as it is in individual scenes , judged as structure , growth , and climax it is emphatically material mishandled .

		Printed with one of the versions is a one-act sketch called `` The Cause of It All , '' which is open to the same criticism , modified because less of drama is needed ; as a study of poverty and a screed on temperance , it serves its purpose , and has ethical significance .

		Still another posthumous play by Tolstoy is '' The Light That Shines in Darkness . ''

		This has a special interest , quite aside from any artistic consideration , in that it seems to have some autobiographic signifi - cance .

		In the opinion of some , at least , the tragedy which darkened the great writer 's last days , his fol - lowing of the dictates of conscience and so separating himself from his home and dear ones , is reproduced in a veiled way in this drama , which portrays a man who clashes with family and friends because he holds the Tolstoyian doctrine of non-resistance , poverty , and brotherly love .

		It is incomplete , the fifth act being merely sketched out ; but even in its pr * form it is a deeply moving piece of literature , with a direct simplicity and earnestness far more effective than any stage tricks could make it Decidedly able work is to be found in the volume of three plays by Mr.
Maurice Baring	PERSON	, whose literary labor has of late been many-sided .

		All these plays have the merit of naturalness of character-sketching and dialogue ; and if the motives be comparatively tenuous , much is made of them .

		The additional merit of variety , too , is possessed by the author .

		`` The Grey Stocking '' is an Ibsenesque piece , with the quiet tone which brings out well a tense situation , sad and logical as life itself .

		`` The Green Elephant . ''

		in vivid contrast , is melodrama , of the same genre as `` The Thief . ''

		And the third , `` The Double Game , '' is a picture of Russian revolutionary life with a tragic culmination , an intimate revelation , one feels , based upon real knowledge .

		Mr.
S. M. Fox	PERSON	is an English dramatist hitherto unknown to most of us ; but he deserves serious consideration .

		For a clever seizing of contemporary moods , keen and witty dialogue , and the right set - ting of character in scene , his work is capital .

		`` The Waters of Bitterness '' is a poignant bit of psychology possessed of real pathos and power ; while `` The Clodhopper '' is delicious fun in the way of a satire on the latter-day mannish woman .

		Mr.
Fox	PERSON	is a frank partisan , but both sides should succumb to his gay humor .

		At its best , his dialogue rivals that of Oscar Wilde . ''

		The Waters of Bitterness '' has been produced by the English Stage Society .

		A well-known latter-day German dramatist is
Otto Ernst	PERSON	; and `` Master Flachsmann , '' now iran -- lated by Mr.
H. M. Beatty	PERSON	, is one of his best pieces .

		Even if it were not an excellent satiric comedy , clean in construction , keen in characterization , and life-like in dialogue , it would still be a valuable educational document , for it gives in vivid contrast the ideals of the old and new pedagogic dispensation .

		The picture of the old-time narrow pedant bully is 1 as laugh-provoking as that of
Dickens	ORGANIZATION	's Gradgnml .

		and as true .

		His overthrow by
Flemming	ORGANIZATION	, a sym - pathetic portrait of a genuine teacher and educa - tional idealist , makes fine comedy , the sort that obeys Meredith by leaving a thoughtful smile on the reader 's face .

		The translation is very accurate , erring , indeed , a little on the side of liti-rality .

		`` My God '' is not the true English equivalent of Mein
Gott	PERSON	, nor can the Du of endearment be lifted bodily into our tongue .

		THE DIAL 471 BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		The greatest '' We in En g land al < e apt to cling SO of Russian blindly to half-truths that we con - reaiists .

		sider the statement of the other half - truths a mere joke , which may or may not be amusing . ''

		So observes Mr.
J. A. T. Lloyd	PERSON	in his volume on `` A Great Russian Realist : Feodor Dostoieffsky '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- ; and his book is a sternly ear - nest effort to bring the `` self-contented spirit of the West '' to some conception of the `` inner pain of
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		All of us who have come into personal contact with Russians , and have looked with amaze - ment into depths and vistas of which the Germanic peoples and the Latins alike are utterly devoid , will follow Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's effort sympathetically , even though it is evident from the beginning that this fervent Russophile , being himself an Anglo-Saxon , is almost as helpless as a man without eyes trying to describe the sun to his blind fellow-men .

		The most successful parts of the book are citations of certain lurid and haunting pages which will certainly grip all readers not already familiar with
Dostoieff	PERSON	- sky , and will impel them to seek first-hand informa - tion about his works , which are available in translation although they have been very little read in this coun - try .

		To Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	the Russian novel is the greatest of all , and he ranks Dostoieffsky as the greatest , or at least the most typical , of Russian novelists .

		His reasons for these judgments are at least deserving of respectful consideration .

		If the best fiction is that which approaches the most sympathetically and faithfully to the life of the emotions , neither the close-mouthed Englishman nor the super-educated Frenchman nor the docile and cautious German has produced anything worthy to rank with the works of this infinitely pitiful and infinitely curious , absolutely spontaneous , shameless , unassuming combination of dreamer and unsparing realist ,
Feodor Dostoieffsky	PERSON	.

		His life , as poignant , as terrible , as chaotic , and as astonishing as the strangest of his books , ended thirty years ago .

		At the time of his death , his name was almost unknown in this country .

		Now special students of Russian literature are writing books about him ; perhaps in a few years more he will receive from the reading public a small share , at least , of the attention he deserves as the most Russian of all great Russian novelists .

		For the Russian is swayed by his emotions , and to quote Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	again : `` Turgenev had caught as an artist the want of the vast silent country ;
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	had reasoned upon it , and explained it ; but the want was in the heart of Dostoieffsky . ''

		New studies of Mr < HilaI 7 A -
Herbert	PERSON	, ex-Secretary the anti-slavery of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, has written a volume conflict .

		on u The Abolition Crusade and Its Consequences '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , the main thesis of which is that responsibility for the tragedy connected with the ending of slavery in this country is to be traced directly to the organization of the Abolition Move - ment , by
William Lloyd Garrison	PERSON	, in
1831	DATE	.

		Mr.
Herbert	PERSON	writes in good temper , and there is much truth in his volume difficult to be found in books written from the Northern standpoint .

		But no one who has gone to the bottom of the slavery question can believe that the great struggle which culminated with the Civil War would have been obviated if the fates had in some way turned the attention of the individual
William Lloyd Garrison	PERSON	in some other direction .

		In asserting that in
Garrison	LOCATION	's view the most humane slave-holders were wicked monsters and fiends , the author shows himself not quite suffi - ciently well acquainted with
Garrison	ORGANIZATION	's own words .

		Garrison 's hatred was for the sin of slavery , not for the slave-holder personally .

		Mr.
Herbert	PERSON	of course believes that the more or less outspoken opposition to slavery which existed in the South itself would have resulted finally in emancipation , if the North had only consented to keep still and leave the matter exclusively to the states in which the system existed .

		But to assume the possibility of such a development from slavery to freedom is to assume conditions which simply did not exist .

		With human passions what they are , the time when a peaceful path to emancipation was still open had passed years before
Garrison	PERSON	founded `` The Liberator '' and organized the New Abolitionists in
1831	DATE	.

		And upon no one man of earlier date , any more than upon
Garrison	PERSON	, can the whole of the burden be placed .

		Another study of the anti-slavery conflict , though from a different point of view , is '' The Battle of Principles '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Dr.
Newell Dwight Hillis	PERSON	, of the
Plymouth Church	LOCATION	in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	. ''

		Our national peril is
Mam	ORGANIZATION	- monism , and the sordid pursuit of gold , '' says the author . ''

		Our fathers came hither in pursuit of God and liberty , not gold and territory . ''

		To draw the attention of our youth to the fundamental prin - ciples of freedom and right , then , is the duty of the hour ; and to this end he describes the struggle for the abolition of slavery , grouping his facts and ideas mostly about prominent characters in the conflict , such as
Webster	PERSON	and
Calhoun	PERSON	,
Garrison	PERSON	,
Phillips	LOCATION	,
Sumner	PERSON	,
Greeley	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	,
John Brown	PERSON	,
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Douglas	PERSON	, and
Beecher	PERSON	.

		The person who has read much in this field will find little that is new in Dr.
Hillis	PERSON	's volume ; but the story is told in attractive form , and will perhaps carry its lesson to many who will not take time for the more extensive reading from which those of us who are older gathered it .

		Viewing her at a new angle and with far-eastern preposses - sions , he startles and delights the reader with many fresh and highly original and sometimes salutary comments on her character and ways .

		Here is a pathetic bit from the chapter in which he writes of love : '' Daring my fourteen years ' stay in
England	LOCATION	once , nay , twice , thrice , perhaps more , I fell into love with some
John Bullesses	PERSON	.

		Unfortunately none of them could love me .

		It was some years ago when the last one told me it was impossible for her to love me .

		I wrote in my diary thus : ' Alas , have I for - gotten myself again ?

		I was born as an artist and to love the beauties .

		Therefore I am permitted to walk into this flower garden .

		How charming are those flowers !

		They are blossoming beautifully for me to try my brush , but not for me to pick up . ' ''

		It is not surprising to find the author championing the cause of the '' suffragettes '' in a chapter devoted to them .

		Other chapters deal with the English woman 's home life , with her amusements and her social life , with her services to him as teacher , with `` broad-minded
John Bullesses	PERSON	, '' with the conditions that best bring out the beauty and the liveliness of English women , and so on .

		The colored pictures are worthy of the gifted artist , and are well reproduced ; and the draw - ings are suggestive and amusing sometimes unusu - ally spirited and graceful .

		Reverence for the
Old Masters	ORGANIZATION	has dangers of its own ; if carried too far , it hinders current effort by nourishing an excessive awe of tradition and au - thority . ''

		Mr.
Lavery	PERSON	, still in the vigor of his best years , has won such repute as a portrait-painter that the King and Queen of
England	LOCATION	have commissioned him to paint their portraits , and he is one of the comparatively few artists who have been invited to present their own likenesses , the product of their own skill , to the
Uffizi Gallery	ORGANIZATION	.

		The story of young
Lavery	PERSON	's straggles with adversity and rise to pros - perity by the way of a
Glasgow	LOCATION	photographer 's studio , where he tinted photographs , a
Paris	LOCATION	art - school , where he had to unlearn much that he had already acquired , and sketching travels through various foreign countries makes good reading as narrated by his always-sympathetic biographer .

		It is , of course , these formative years that are most important in tracing the development of genius or character , of whatever sort ; and Mr.
Shaw-Sparrow	PERSON	takes pains to remind his readers , in so many words , that he is `` studying a painter 's career as it ought to be studied in a book , from within the changing atmosphere of its early years , which are always the The rite of a noted Iriih most important years in the making of an arti-t .

		Mr.
Lavery	PERSON	, it should be remembered , is an Irishman by birth , `` and he and his work prosper in an Irish manner as emigrants . ''

		Twelve color plates , five '' Rembrandtgravures , '' and twenty collo - types do their best to give the reader some notion of this artist 's leading characteristics ; and twenty - two pages of preface , personal and reminiscent , are contributed by Mr.
R. B. Cunninghame Graham	PERSON	.

		It is the author 's purpose `` to show the young monarch as she really was , surrounded by the somewhat cruel limitations of her time a girl frank , loving , truthful , and ad - mirable in many ways , yet one in whom the seeds of an undue pride had been planted and most earnestly fostered by those responsible , '' though on the whole a very lovable person .

		As such a work must neces - sarily deal largely with influences within the family , considerable attention is given to
Victoria	LOCATION	's relatives , the children and grandchildren of
George III	PERSON	.

		It is not possible to write of these scions of royalty with - out telling unpleasing tales ; but as far as possible the author avoids all forms of scandal .

		The extraordi - nary care that the Duchess of Kent showed in bring - ing up the future Queen , and which has been praised so highly by uncritical writers , is shown in a new light : the author has little sympathy for such mater - nal care as allows no opportunity for unaided growth . ''

		Some account is also given of the polit - ical influences that controlled the earlier years of the reign .

		The work closes with the Queen 's marriage ; the concluding chapter deals with Queen
Victoria	PERSON	's home and the difficulties encountered in organizing the new establishment and in the efforts to free it from annoying interferences .

		The work is provided with a number of excellent contemporary portraits , including two of the young Queen .

		THE DIAL 473 whether such a comprehensive subject can be treated satisfactorily within the limits prescribed by the plan of the series .

		Frankly , we remain rather doubtful : we can not quite escape the impression that might arise from seeing an elephant driven to a trotting sulky .

		But we must hasten to add that the book seems as good as it can be under the conditions .

		In fact , it is the best small treatise we know dealing with the range of subjects fairly indicated by the general title ; and on that ground it can be cordially recom - mended .

		The ten chapters , bearing such captions as `` The People , '' `` The Caste System , '' `` Economic Life , '' `` The Native States , '' etc. , are concise and trustworthy presentations in simple form of their respective themes .

		There are some indications that the author 's `` copy '' was turned off at rather high speed , although on the whole one reads along pleasurably enough .

Virginia	LOCATION	State Li - brary is an unusually full and interesting volume , run - ning indeed to more than five hundred pages , the greater part of which is occupied with a '' List of the Revolu - tionary Soldiers of
Virginia	LOCATION	'' a partial list , necessarily , but much nearer completeness than any previous one .

		It is sadly significant to note , among the serious diffi - culties encountered by the compiler -LRB- Mr.
H.	PERSON	.1 .

		Kcken - rode , Archivist -RRB- , the incomprehensible refusal of the War Department at
Washington	LOCATION	, or of its archivist , to permit the copying of its rolls .

		But Mr.
Eckenrode	PERSON	has succeeded in obtaining the names of between thirty-five and thirty-six thousand
Virginia	LOCATION	soldiers of our War of Independence .

		Most of the ambitious books dealing with
India	LOCATION	nat - urally omit details about '' native building , occupations , mode of farming , daily life , productions , methods of mission work , obstacles , and so forth . ''

		Yet these are just the things an average American might ask a friend to write about in his letters from that picturesque pen - insula , and they form the subject matter of a little vol - ume entitled ``
India	LOCATION	and Daily Life in
Bengal	LOCATION	, '' from the pen of the
Reverend Z. F. Griffin	PERSON	, and issued by the
American Baptist Publication Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is un - pretentious , and is written with no concern about style ; but , if it may be judged by its own standard , it really deserves the success indicated by the appearance of the third edition , for the author amply fulfills the modest promises made in the preface .

		Mr.
Griftin	PERSON	does not for - get that he has been a missionary for fifteen years ; but he does not obtrude this interest unduly .

		The text is vivified by thirty-eight illustrations , `` mostly from the author 's own negatives . ''

		Ohio occcupied an important and influential position duriug the critical period of the Civil War , and as a result a large amount of writing on the various questions connecting the history of the state with the momentous epoch has accumulated from year to year . ''

		The -LRB- .

		` nil War Literature of
Ohio	LOCATION	: A Bibliography with
Explan	PERSON	- atory and Historical Notes '' -LRB-
Cleveland	LOCATION	:
Burrows Brothers Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , compiled by Mr.
Daniel J. Ryan	PERSON	, now makes this mass of literature available to librarians and students of history .

		The material here described represents all types of writing on the subject , from < -RRB- l1i - cial Documents and records of
Army	ORGANIZATION	organizations to miscellaneous works , including fiction , poetry , letters , etc. .

		All is arranged alphabetically by author , and , following the annotation of the book or article i which is frequently extended to a digest that pains in significance when the item described represents a piece of work \ \ \ \ out of print -RRB- is a brief summary of the author 's life .

		The analytical index is serviceable .

		In scope , as u.-ll as in conciseness , this pioneer work might well serve a * a model for other states that may have a similar task to perform .

		She was born in

		Besides producing a large amount of original verse , fiction , etc. -LRB- largely for younger readers -RRB- , Mrs.
Sangster	PERSON	was for ten years editor of ''

		In connection with the recataloguing and reclassifi - cation of its collections the
University of Chicago Li	ORGANIZATION	- braries expect at an early date to begin printing on cards a considerable number of titles for which no printed cards can be obtained from the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	or the
John Crerar Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The entries will conform to the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	rules , author as well as subject , and will include subject and other added en - tries as well as the classification numbers , according to the Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	system It is not yet known to what extent it will be possible to place these cards at the disposal of other libraries .

		In order to learn what demand there may be for them it is proposed to try the plan based on that recently adopted by
Harvard College Library	ORGANIZATION	, whereby complete sets of all cards printed will be supplied at a nominal subscription price ; or , where individual cards are desired , dated proofsheets will be supplied as rapidly as the type is set , and orders for separate cards may be entered for a period of thirty days after the date of each proofsheet .

		Full informa - tion as to prices , etc. , may be obtained from the Director of the Libraries ,
