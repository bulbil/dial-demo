		On
Washington	LOCATION	's
Birthday , 1887	DATE	,
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	came to
Chicago	LOCATION	, upon the invi - tation of the
Union League Club	ORGANIZATION	, to deliver an address at the exercises held by the
Club	ORGANIZATION	in celebration of that anniversary .

		The outcome of the affair was so unexpected , and its conse - quences so humiliating , both to Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's friends and to those who cherish the fair fame of this city , that it seems desirable to put on record certain accounts , hitherto unpublished , of what happened .

		These accounts ' place the matter in a light very different from that cast on it either by the newspaper reports or by the gossip current at the time .

		Mr.
Browne	PERSON	, the editor of this journal , felt the thing very deeply , and the following publication properly belongs with the rest of the reminiscent mate - rial that we have printed since his lamented death .

		Unwitting of what was to follow , Mr.
Browne	PERSON	wrote an article , in the manner of `` A Fable for Critics , '' which appeared on the editorial page of the morning edition of the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Daily News '' the day of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's arrival in town .

		A GREETING TO
LOWELL	LOCATION	.

		We welcome to-day a visitor who , though but brief is his stay in our western metropolis , yet should receive such a greeting as to make him re - luctant to leave .

		A sincere , unobtrusive , unforced hospitality will no doubt please him more than too great prodigality of attentions , or keeping too much on the go , or making too great an exertion to show how '' unique '' the career of our wonderful city , which is still in its infancy -LRB- more is the pity -RRB- .

		Do n't pile up statistics the schooners and brigs that enter our port , or the number of pigs and of cattle and other brutes killed in a year ; and especially let us keep in the rear those two-legged animals who make their jaw go incessantly braying in praise of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Spare our guest the details of our startling chronol - ogy , and stand as we are , without brag or apology .

		He will find a community , though hard at work , not engaging en masse in the packing of pork ; with even a few , here and there , who 've inferred there are some things in life that are better than lard .

		We shall find him but who in our midst does not know him ?

		If such creature exists , fetch him out , let us show him .

		No one but a dense and confirmed ignoramus could deny that he knew of an author so famous .

		Or even if literature set its bar sinister on him , he would know our distinguished ex-minister 6 THE DIAI , -LSB-
July 1	DATE	he who , at the fashionable court of
St. James	LOCATION	, moved , a gentleman born , with the squires and the dames ; and while it was not to his taste to geologize among buried scores , yet he did not apologize for the plain words he 'd said when our hearts were all full of wrath and of bitterness toward
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	.

		With the whole human race have his sympathies ever ran , yet he 's first and foremost of all an American ; and while his survey is as wide as creation he keeps in his foreground the great Yankee nation .

		For his country his genius rose highest and glowed in his '' Crisis '' and '' Washers '' and memorial '' Ode . ''

		These poems flashed out like a fire in the dark , and went straight to our hearts as a ball to its mark .

		In prose or in verse how he makes words effectual , what a vigor he has this athlete intellectual !

		Then how charming his fancy , how brilliant his jest , how flashing his wit , in his quips what a zest !

		How delicious his humor !

		may the moment come slow when we cease to admire dear old
Hosea Biglow	PERSON	.

		As poet and patriot , critic and scholar , his career stands as full and as round as a dollar ; and clearly , of all those now living who grace American letters , he holds the first place .

		Nulli secundus , there always will show well among our best names that of JAMES
RUSSELL LOWELL	PERSON	.

		May each year that passes more lightly assess him , and the prayer of our hearts will be ever '' GOD bless him ! ''

		When Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	substituted , for the polit - ical discourse that he had expected to deliver , the delightful paper on Shakespearean criticism which may now be read in his `` Latest Literary Essays and Addresses , '' his audience was con - siderably taken aback , and gave vent to its disappointment in language that must have been the occasion of much regret to those who were guilty of it .

		The newspapers took the matter up in a sensational way , and for the next few days Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	was made the victim of much coarse abuse from press and public .

		The obvious explanation that he had simply acted like a gentleman was completely lost sight of in the comment that followed .

		He himself felt the matter keenly , and meeting Mr.
Browne	PERSON	soon after the address , said to him : `` I hope you will put me right with the public . ''

		Shortly after the address , Mr.
Browne	PERSON	held a consultation with two of his friends , the up - shot of which was that the two articles which are now printed for the first time were pre - pared .

		The first of them , written by Mr.
Browne	PERSON	, was intended for use in THE DIAL , but circumstances which need not here be explained prevented its appearance .

		It now follows ex - actly as then written .

		MR.
JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL	PERSON	'S recent visit to
Chicago	LOCATION	was an event scarcely inferior in interest to the visit of Mr.
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	three years ago .

		Its most important incident was of course the address on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, delivered by Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	in Music
Hall	PERSON	on the
afternoon	TIME	of
February 22	DATE	.

		This discourse , while perhaps less brilliant and polished than the addresses on Gray and
Wordsworth	PERSON	given with such success in
England	LOCATION	, was yet worthy of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's high rank as a scholar and critical essayist .

		Its main thesis was the extra-Shakespearean origin of the play of ''
Richard III.	PERSON	, '' but it touched many of the aspects of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's genius and abounded in those felicitous phrases and stimulating thoughts which come so readily from Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, especially when dealing with a congenial literary theme .

		In its delivery he labored under the disadvantage of an almost painfully unsympathetic and unresponsive audience .

		It was not such an audience as would ordinarily have gathered in
Chicago	LOCATION	to hear Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	on a purely literary topic .

		His subject had been announced as '' American Politics . ''

		The au - dience , which was a large one , had come to attend a patriotic celebration of
Washington	LOCATION	's birthday .

		The fact that the lecture was delivered in the after - noon of a patriotic holiday , and other incidents , strongly confirmed this idea .

		Hence the surprise and disappointment when the announcement was made , by Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	himself , of a change of subject .

		His explanation was , in effect , that when he had first been invited to speak in
Chicago	LOCATION	he had been offered a choice of two themes , a literary and a political one ; that he had chosen the latter , and prepared an address accordingly ; but that since reaching
Chicago	LOCATION	and becoming informed of all the circumstances , he found that he u stood on very delicate ground . ''

		He had , he said , always been in the habit , when speaking on public questions , of speaking his mind frankly ; and if on this occasion he spoke on a political subject he felt that he must either not speak with entire frankness or risk being discourteous to those whose guest and to some ex - tent whose mouthpiece he was , and thus perhaps '' mar a cordiality of welcome which will be among the pleasantest recollections of my life . ''

		It is ap - parent that Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	felt himself surprised in a position where , if he went on , he must either be disingenuous or rude ; and he preferred to take the responsibility of withdrawing from the position , by changing the subject of his address .

		His motive in this , and the delicate sense of honor which actuated him , are such as every gentleman must respect .

		He may have underestimated the disappointment he would cause his audience , and have overestimated the interest his substituted topic would have for them ; but it ought not to ` be difficult to understand and appreciate his feelings and situation in the matter .

		It is well known that Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	was in - vited to
Chicago	LOCATION	by the
Union League Club	ORGANIZATION	, whose guest he was , and by whom the proposed patriotic celebration was managed .

		What he probably did not know until he reached
Chicago	LOCATION	is that , while the
Club	ORGANIZATION	is not a political organization , yet its membership is composed largely in fact , almost entirely of pronounced Republicans .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	had prepared his address on politics evidently with -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL out knowledge of this fact .

		The nature of his in - tended address we can to some extent infer , not only from our previous knowledge of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, but from some of his utterances while in this city .

		At the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	dinner , two days later than his Music
Hall	PERSON	address , and where he felt free to express himself '' with entire frankness '' on politics , he said : '' We are told that we should not stand out - side of party .

		I have stood outside of all parties for twenty-five years ... What I wish is that good sensible men , and honest men , should act together on certain points , and stand outside of all parties until they accomplish those points ... Party organi - zation is no doubt a very convenient thing , but a great many people feel , and I feel very strongly with them , that when loyalty to party means disloyalty to coun - try , and means what it seems to me is still worse , disloyalty to conscience , it is asking more than any good man or citizen should concede . ''

		It can not be doubted that such sentiments as these would be re - garded as highly offensive when delivered before a club most of whose members sincerely believe that loyalty to party is a political virtue ; and the fact that the speaker was the guest , and , as he said , '' in a certain sense , the mouthpiece , '' of the club , would certainly not lessen the displeasure .

		It is not hard to see why Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	felt the necessity of a change of subject ; although it is certainly to be regretted , for the sake of all concerned , that the change could not have been decided on before the subject of the lecture had been so publicly announced .

		We do not precisely know on whom the responsibility belongs for the suppression of the intended change of subject until the very moment of the lecture .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, in his introductory remarks , generously assumed all blame for the awkward situation ; and he has since maintained a proper and dignified silence .

		The other article , written by one of Mr.
Browne	PERSON	's most intimate associates , was intended to be sent to an
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	journal for publication , but this also failed of the use for which it was prepared .

		The present word of explanation is given to account for the evident difference of longitude assumed in behalf of those who might read it .

		Although never published , it was in the hands of Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	,
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's official biographer , when he wrote of the
Chicago	LOCATION	episode , and enabled him to give his account the right coloring .

		THE CONFLICT BETWEEN LITERATURE AND PATRIOTISM IN
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		The great pork and grain centre of the country has just undergone a convulsion consequent upon the failure of a patriotic revival projected for the 22nd of
February	DATE	.

		The
Union League Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, with the purpose of fitly celebrating
Washington	LOCATION	's birthday , arranged for public exer - cises in the
Music Hall	ORGANIZATION	, and invited Mr.
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	to deliver an address .

		The club also tendered Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	a banquet upon the evening of the same day . ''

		American Politics '' was announced to be the subject of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's address , and at the appointed hour the house was filled to its utmost capacity .

		The audience that had assembled to hear the distinguished speaker was not a little surprised when he rose and announced that he had changed his subject and would speak , not upon `` American Politics , '' but upon the principles of literary criticism as illustrated by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's ``
Richard III	PERSON	. ''

		In explanation of this change of theme , he said , in effect , that in announcing `` politics '' as the subject of his address he had not fully realized the conditions under which it was to be delivered ; that he was accustomed to speak frankly , and that here , speaking in some sort as the representative of the
Union League Club	ORGANIZATION	, he feared that if he were to speak on the subject of politics he might give offence to his hearers , and that for this reason he had ventured to make the change .

		Having given this explanation , Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	proceeded to read what appears to have been a most delightful essay in the higher criticism , one of those brilliant and scholarly efforts , full of delicate suggestion and cultured allusion , which are familiar to all of his readers .

		The true inwardness of the situation in which Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	was placed is obvious enough to those who are familiar with the character of the organization under whose auspices he spoke .

		The
Union League Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	is very similar to the club of that name in
New York	LOCATION	; it is a stalwart Republican organization , the term `` Republican '' being under - stood to indicate that the club is a bulwark for the support of Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	and whatever political prin - ciples he may choose to represent .

		The club has succeeded in `` freezing out '' a few obnoxious mug - wumps developed by the crisis of
1884	DATE	, and is prac - tically unanimous in its political creed .

		The extent to which it carries its political zeal may be well illus - trated by one or two minor episodes of the
Lowell	LOCATION	affair .

		Among the distinguished guests invited to the banquet , the mayor of
Chicago	LOCATION	, who , whatever he may be politically , is socially unexceptionable , was not included ; and a numerous faction among the committee on arrangements displayed their rudi - mentary notions of politeness by seeking to exclude also from the banquet Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's
Chicago	LOCATION	host , who suffered under the reproach of being a notorious mugwump .

		With these facts in view , the delicacy of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's action in changing the subject of his address is sufficiently evident .

		His own political opinions are too well known to require to be specifi - cally contrasted with those of the club at whose in - vitation he came to
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		What he might have said , had he spoken upon politics , may perhaps be inferred from some remarks which he made at the
Harvard Club	ORGANIZATION	banquet , two days afterwards .

		`` I stood outside of party for nearly twenty-five years and I was perfectly happy , I assure you ... Party organization , no doubt , is a very convenient thing , but a great many people , and I feel very strongly with them , feel that when loyalty to party means disloyalty to country , and means , what seems to me 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	is still worse , disloyalty to conscience , it is then ask - ing more than any good man or any good citizen ought to concede . ''

		Everyone knows the horror in which the Blaine men hold such sentiments as these , and we may well imagine the consternation with which the
Union League Club	ORGANIZATION	would have listened to their orator had he expounded these damnable heresies .

		But owing , perhaps , to a too dim realization of what they had escaped , and , certainly , to an inabil - ity to appreciate the delicate instinct that prompted Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	in making the change , his hearers were not only dissatisfied , but did not hesitate to express their dissatisfaction .

		The mute reproach of the large numbers who left their seats and silently stole away during the delivery of the address was fol - lowed by audible reproaches at the close , on the part of those who had remained , and to these the newspapers supplied a chorus on the next day .

		Some of the comments reported are very amusing . ''

		He ca n't come this sort of a sell on us again , '' was the elegant remark of one member of the
Club	ORGANIZATION	, as he sadly left the hall .

		Another auditor , a clergyman , was heard to say , `` This is the first day I wished Bill Shakespeare had never been born . ''

		Another expressed his regret at the time wasted , exclaiming : u The idea of a man spending two hours trying to prove that
Shakespeare	PERSON	did n't write
Henry VIII	PERSON	. ''

		Still another was reported as saying that `` the speaker was a great man on politics , but who was
Richard III	PERSON	? ''

		When one of the committee on arrangements tersely remarked : '' It was a pretty hard grind on the Club , '' he expressed very neatly the prevailing sentiment of the audience .

		Not less amusing than these random comments are the various theories put forward to account for Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's change of subject .

		The obvious explanation which we have already given requires for its acceptance some degree of refinement of feeling , and this seems to be lacking in many of his critics .

		The simplest of the theories propounded is that Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	was `` full '' upon the occasion of the address .

		Another almost as simple is that he lacked `` sand . ''

		A third has it that Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	is a presidential candidate and does not wish to injure his chances of success by being too outspoken on political subjects .

		This finds a number of adherents .

		A fourth theory is that he was dissuaded from ex - pressing himself on politics by secret emissaries of Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	.

		Still another ingenious theorist sug - gests that Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's modesty prevented him from speaking upon a subject of which he is notoriously ignorant .

		`` What does he know about politics ?

		He never made a stump speech in his life ! ''

		Two other theories of conflicting character find each a certain number of upholders .

		One of them is , in effect , that Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	came to the conclusion that
Chicago	LOCATION	was not capable of appreciating a profound treat - ment of politics , and that he chose literature as something more nearly upon the level of his pro- spective audience .

		This theory was expressed by the gentleman who is reported to have said : '' He thought anything good enough for
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		The opposing theory , which is far more popular , is based upon a finer perception of the relative demands of politics and literature upon the intelligence of an audience .

		According to this theory , Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	had prepared a political address suited to what he supposed to be the limited capacity of a
Chicago	LOCATION	audience .

		When he reached that city , however , the evidences of culture and refinement which met him on every hand revealed to him the extent of his misconception , and he hastily substituted something better suited to the exacting standard of his hearers .

		This theory has the great advantage of having no offensive implications as far as
Chicago	LOCATION	is concerned , and of leaving Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	under the reproach of all Chicagoans for his want of faith in the greatness of their city .

		The most amusing feature of the whole matter is found in the unanimity with which it is agreed that Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	'' missed the greatest oppor - tunity of his life '' when he abandoned the treatment of patriotism for that of literature .

		However diverse are the reasons brought forward to account for the fact , there is but the one conclusion that in doing this he made in the words of the poet whom he has lovingly expounded to so many classes of Har - vard students u il gran rifiuto '' `` the great refusal '' of his life .

		The newspapers , which refer to him sometimes as Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, and sometimes as `` Mr.
Russell	PERSON	, '' are particularly strong upon this point .

		`` He misjudged the importance of his opportunity , '' says one of them .

		`` Not until he set foot in
Chicago	LOCATION	did he realize that here in the ' far West ` of his youth , was the great heart of the nation , which only wanted the touch of a master hand to awaken to the measure of its responsibilities in American politics . ''

		That he missed '' the greatest opportunity of his life '' is the general verdict , the implication being the very modest one that the audience which it was his privilege to address was better worth speaking to than any with which his public career had previously brought him face to face .

		Upon the occasion of the banquet tendered Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	the evening of the same day , much care was taken to make him realize that he had failed to meet the expectations entertained of him by the
Union League Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		The president of the club , in his introductory remarks , made it evident that he regarded Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's excuse as a flimsy one , and said , amid the cheers of his auditors : '' This club is not organized for the purpose of keeping silent .

		As American citizens , we need have no fear here or at any time of expressing our honest opinions . ''

		Thus reassured , Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	spoke at considerable length upon the subject of '' Practical Politics . ''

		But what he said was evidently not quite up to the club standard of '' patriotism , '' and so a genuine '' patriot '' from the river bottoms of the Sangamon valley , Mr.
Jehu Baker	PERSON	, was introduced to succeed him .

		This distinguished statesman said , according to the news - paper report of his remarks , that '' he did not care a continental for English customs , or for those who
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL aped those customs in this country .

		We had a literature which was purely American , and did not need to go abroad for our scholars or our books . ''

		This was evidently the article of `` patriotism '' for which the listeners had been waiting , and the applause which followed no longer partook of the perfunctory , but was , we read , genuine and pro- longed .

		The events of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's visit to
Chicago	LOCATION	afford a fresh illustration of the peculiar fatality which seems to follow the eminent men of letters who occasionally find their way to that city .

		When Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	was there twelve or fifteen years ago , a reception was arranged for him , and it went off successfully in every respect but one the distin - guished guest himself failed to put in an appearance .

		Some people accounted for this by the fact that the invitation did not include his host .

		When
Lord Coleridge	PERSON	was entertained at a large dinner-party by a well-known Chicagoan , the harmony of the oc - casion was marred by an attachment of the dinner itself in satisfaction of a claim against the entertainer .

		When Mr.
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	went to
Chicago	LOCATION	, he was received with feelings of ill-concealed hostility , and the publication , not long thereafter , of a letter hastily assumed to have been written by him , was gladly seized upon as a warrant for the removal of all concealment , and
Chicago	LOCATION	said without reserve what it had thought of its guest all the time .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	is the latest victim of the arrogant philistin - ism which seems to inhere in the very nature of the prosperous but crude community on the shore of
Lake Michigan	LOCATION	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		FICTION AND DIPLOMACY would seem to be not very distantly related to each other if we understand in its double sense the '' merry definition of an ambassador '' which , says Sir
Henry Wotton	PERSON	in a letter to Velser , `` I had chanced to set down at my friend 's , Mr.
Christopher Fleckamore	PERSON	, in his Album . ''

		The definition , as will be recalled , was this : `` An ambassador is an honest man sent to lie abroad for the commonwealth . ''

		Of American novelists who in an official capacity have juggled with the truth at foreign courts , the list is not long .

		In fact , only two foreign ministers ,
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	and Mr.
Arthur Sherburne Hardy	PERSON	, come to mind at this moment as combining the two characters of story - writer and minister plenipotentiary ; and
Taylor	PERSON	, though he produced four creditable novels , is ranked rather with the poets than with the writers of prose fiction .

		Washington Irving wrote some things '' Knickerbocker 's History of
New York	LOCATION	, '' for in - stance that contained more fiction than fact ; but even the most elastic definition of a novelist fails to include him in that category .

		The consular service , however , has engaged the talents of several em - inent writers of pure fiction , notably
Nathaniel Hawthorne	PERSON	during the administration of the presi - dent whose biography he prepared .


Charles Lever	PERSON	, among British novelists , filled consular positions .

		But now we have , in the appointment of Mr.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page as ambassador to
Italy	LOCATION	, and of Mr.
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	as minister to
Portugal	LOCATION	, two notable additions to the little company of diplomat - novelists .

		The author of ``
Marse Chan	PERSON	, '' `` In
Ole Virginia	LOCATION	, '' `` On Newfound River , '' `` Red Rock , '' ''
Gordon Keith	PERSON	, `` and many other deservedly popular works of fiction , is in the full maturity of his powers , having been born in
1853	DATE	, in the `` Old Dominion '' that has served as the scene of so many of his stories * Three terms at the
Washington	LOCATION	and
Lee University	ORGANIZATION	, with a subsequent course of law at the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, seem to have completed his formal education ; and he holds the degrees of Litt.D .

		and LL.D .

		from both
Southern and Northern	ORGANIZATION	universities .

		His abandonment of the law for letters came only after eighteen years of legal practice in
Richmond	LOCATION	, during a part of which time he followed the two professions simultaneously .

		He is a member of the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters .

		Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	, the popular
Indiana	LOCATION	novel - ist , known especially for his '' House of a Thousand Candles , '' `` The Lords of High Decision , '' and `` The Siege of the Seven Suitors , '' has also issued at least two volumes of poems and has tried his pen in serious prose , as in `` The Hoosiers '' -LRB- in `` National Studies in American Letters '' -RRB- .

		Born at
Craw	ORGANIZATION	- fordsville in
1866	DATE	, he was educated at the public schools of
Indianapolis	LOCATION	, holds honorary degrees from
Wabash College	ORGANIZATION	and
Rutter College	ORGANIZATION	, and is a mem - ber of the
National Institute of Arts and Letters	ORGANIZATION	.


INDIA	LOCATION	'S FIRST LIBRARY SCHOOL is about to be started , if it is not already started , at
Baroda College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The principal of that college , Mr.
A. B. Clarke	PERSON	, in a recent address before the
Baroda Library Club	ORGANIZATION	, now printed in the
Baroda	LOCATION	`` Library Miscellany , '' said : `` I propose and my proposal will go out to Government for orders very shortly I propose to start in the College a Post-Graduate course in
Library Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		I imagine that we are probably about to see a great development of libra - ries throughout
India	LOCATION	, very largely as a result of the work begun under His Highness ' direction here .

		No
University or College	ORGANIZATION	in this country , so far as I am aware , has yet made any steps in pre - paration for this coming need , and I suggest as a subject for profitable consideration that here in
Baroda	LOCATION	we should recognize this force , compara - tively new to Indian life , by the institution of a two years ' course in Library Science in the
Baroda College	LOCATION	.

		We are well situated to undertake this work , for we have an expert in classification and library methods , who would doubtless gladly give his services ; we have at our disposal also the whole of the
College	ORGANIZATION	staff to lecture on the subjects which may be selected as appropriate to the course . ''

		Confidence is expressed in the future demand for library-school graduates to take charge of `` the various libraries we may expect to see arising in different parts of 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	this country . ''

		The foregoing mention of `` His Highness '' refers to the
Maharaja Sayaji Rao Gaikwad	ORGANIZATION	, leader in the present free-library move - ment in
India	LOCATION	; and the `` expert in classification and library methods '' we infer to be Mr.
W. A. Borden	PERSON	, formerly active in library work in this country , and now
Director of State Libraries	ORGANIZATION	in
Baroda	LOCATION	.

		The `` Library Miscellany , '' first and at present only journal of its kind in
India	LOCATION	, is now approaching the end of its first year , and has doubled in size since its starting .

		It contains an unexpected richness of varied matter , all having to do with library work and progress at home and abroad ; and it continues its heroic undertaking of printing its matter in three languages , English ,
Gujarati	LOCATION	, and Marathi .

		It is also well illustrated .

		That so considerable and necessarily expensive a library journal should be able to maintain itself in a country where the modern public library is in its infancy is cause for surprise and congratulation .

		EDUCATIONAL VALUES are not often expressed , or indeed expressible , in terms of dollars and cents .

		But the
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	statisticians have of late been busy computing the worth in money of a higher education .

		For this purpose a census was taken of the class of
1903	DATE	, which has had nearly ten years to get shaken down and to realize the per - manent value of things acquired at college .

		For the first five years after graduation the average earning power was eight hundred and
sixty-seven dollars	MONEY	, and for the next five eighteen hundred and sixty-two .

		The national
Census Bureau	ORGANIZATION	gives the average yearly income of the
Chicago	LOCATION	salaried man as twelve hundred and
two dollars	MONEY	.

		Subtract this latter amount from eighteen hundred and sixty-two , and multiply the remainder by forty -LRB- a fair estimate of a man 's years of productive activity after he attains to full earning capacity -RRB- , and the result is something over
twenty-six thousand dollars	MONEY	.

		Deduct from this the cost of a four-years course at college , computed at
twenty-four hundred dollars	MONEY	for the
Northwestern	ORGANIZATION	curriculum , and we have as the net value of the sheepskin handed out to the young graduate on commencement day , twenty-four thou - sand dollars , or let us say , not to shave the figure too closely , twenty-five thousand .

		That is a very pretty arithmetical performance , and the result arrived at ought to cheer the worldly-ambitious collegian , present or prospective .

		But there are not a few young men who , naturally acquisitive of material possessions , find their aims and ideals so raised to a higher plane by a college course that they themselves are rendered much less efficient as money-making machines .

		And are not those who succeed in preparing for and completing a college or university education the very ones who , as a rule , would in any case be victors in the battle of life ?

		The bachelor of arts sometimes succeeds as a bread - winner , not because of , but in spite of , his academic equipment .

		Thus , after all , the problem is not so simple as it looks .

		SIR
JAMES MATTHEW BABRIE	PERSON	, BART. , enjoys the distinction , as his friends and admirers claim , of being the first man of letters since
Scott	PERSON	to receive the baronetcy .

		Scribbling knights are as plentiful as plums , but to win the higher grade with the pen is a distinction indeed .

		The honor is in this instance as well deserved as it was unexpected and unsought , Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	-LRB- or Sir James , we should say -RRB- being among the most modest and un-selfseeking of mor - tals .

		A
London	LOCATION	correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' calls attention , in this connection , to the autobiographic value of '' When a Man 's Single , '' especially in the unabridged form in which that cheerful narrative originally appeared in '' The British Weekly . ''

		The author , it is asserted , is a composite of two of his characters ,
Rob Angus	PERSON	, the youth who leaves a Thrums sawmill to accept the position of reporter on the Silchester '' Daily Mirror , '' and afterward courts success or failure as a free-lance in
London	LOCATION	, and
J. Noble Simms	PERSON	, an experienced metropolitan journalist whose counsel proves helpful to the young man from the country .

		Silchester of course stands for Nottingham , where the future creator of Thrums and its picturesque characters was for two years , after leaving Edin - burgh
University	ORGANIZATION	, on the staff of a daily paper .

		That the above-named book is rich in autobiographic material is thought to be at least partly proved by the reported utterance of Sir
William Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	-LRB- editor of `` The British Weekly '' -RRB- concerning young Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	as he first knew him : '' You never caught him reading ; he did not buy papers , and yet in some mysterious way he knew everything . ''

		That , as may be recalled , is a good description , as far as it goes , of
J. Noble Simms	ORGANIZATION	.

		Intending writers for the press are advised by the authority here quoted to make a serious study of '' When a Man 's Single . ''

		Such a study is certainly likely to prove remunera - tive in diversion even if not in useful advice , and the probability is that it will be profitable in both . ''

		CREATIVE '' LIBRARY WORK is what all earnest library workers naturally wish to engage in , and do engage in to the extent of their aptitudes and opportunities .

		At the
St. Joseph -LRB- Mo.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Public Library there has been established a new depart - ment , called the
Creative Department	ORGANIZATION	, of which the librarian , Mr.
Charles E. Rush	PERSON	, says in his current Annual Report : `` The need of an assistant to devote full time to the various methods of securing larger numbers of readers and to promote the reading of better literature on the part of those enrolled as patrons resulted in the establishment of the ' Creative Department . '

		This department was given immediate supervision of the compiling of reading lists , news - paper stories , printed Library publicity , bulletins , picture collections , and special exhibitions . ''

		Of the library 's illustrated circular addressed to school - children , of which mention has already been made by us , it is reported that '' these circulars more than doubled the juvenile registration in one month , and also increased the adult registration . ''

		A further
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 11 activity of a '' creative '' nature has been the instal - lation of an
Edison Home Kinetoscope	ORGANIZATION	, equipped for moving-picture films and stereopticon slides .

		This is especially for story-hour use at the branches , and it has proved a decided success with the children .

		It will be of interest to note that `` the equipment includes moving-picture films of such titles as ' Little Red Riding Hood , ' ` Hansel and
Gretel	PERSON	, ' ` The Child in the Forest , ' and ` The Little Girl Who Did Not Believe in
Santa Claus	LOCATION	, ' etc. , and lantern slides showing ten pictures on each plate of interesting travel scenes and instructive geographical subjects .

		The remarkable features of the machine are its simplicity of construction and management , portable size , economy in purchase and maintenance cost , and the pleasing results obtained . ''

		Other features of Mr.
Rush	PERSON	's Report , especially its novel and artistic form , appeal for notice ; but our space is inexorably inelastic .

		... THE FRENCH ACADEMY 'S GRAND PRIZE FOR LITERATURE , awarded this year to
M. Remain Holland	ORGANIZATION	, author of the ten-volume chronicle of the doings of Jean-Christophe a narrative that its numerous French admirers , and perhaps others also , would like to see extended to a hundred volumes has been well bestowed .

		A mind capable of con - ceiving and producing a work of so generous a scope must have an unusually wide range of interests and tastes and aptitudes .

		That it has such a range is evident , even to the inquirer who searches no further than the pages of `` Who 's Who , '' whence a few significant items may here be noted .

		Born
January 29 , 1866	DATE	, at
Clamecy	LOCATION	,
M. Rolland	PERSON	was educated at the college of his native town , at the
Ecole Normale Supe	ORGANIZATION	* rieure in
Paris	LOCATION	, and at the
French School	ORGANIZATION	in
Rome	LOCATION	.

		He has the academic degrees of agrege d'histoire and docteur es lettres , and has been professor of the history of art at the
Ecole Normale Supe	ORGANIZATION	* rieure , and afterward at the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, where he was the first to teach the history of music ; he is a member of the `` conseil de direc - tion de 1 ` Ecole des Hautes Etudes Sociales . ''

		His published works include seven dramas , which need not here be named , biographies of
Beethoven	ORGANIZATION	,
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	, a history of the opera in
Europe	LOCATION	before
Lully	PERSON	and
Scarlatti	ORGANIZATION	, books on musicians , early and modern , and the monumental `` Jean-Christophe . ''

		His recreations are music and travel , and he has his abode , appropriately enough , on
Mount Parnassus	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 162
Boulevard Montparnasse	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		A GREEK PARALLEL TO `` THE PILGRIM 'S PRO- GRESS , '' unsuspected by most lovers of that famous allegory , is pointed out by Mr.
William E. A. Axon	PERSON	in a contribution to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post . ''

		He first quotes from a letter written by
Southey	ORGANIZATION	to Sir
Egerton Brydges	PERSON	: '' The paper upon
Bunyan	PERSON	in the last Quarterly Review is by Sir
Walter -LSB- Scott	PERSON	-RSB- .

		He has not observed , and I , when I wrote the ' Life , ' had forgotten , that the ' compleat design of a Pilgrim 's Progress ' is to be found in
Lucian	LOCATION	's 4 Hermotimus . ' ''

		Quotation at some length is then made from this dialogue , in the translation of Messrs.
H. W.	PERSON	and
F. G. Fowler	PERSON	-LRB-
Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Bunyan 's
Celestial City	LOCATION	is , in
Lucian	LOCATION	, a sort of
Utopian State	ORGANIZATION	, symbolizing virtue , and inspiring in those who hear about it a desire to become its citi - zens .

		As
Lycinus	PERSON	says , in the course of the dia - logue : `` In good truth , Hermotimus , we should devote all our efforts to this , and neglect everything else ; we need pay little heed to any claims of our earthly country ; we should steel our hearts against the clingings and cryings of children or parents , if we have them ; it is well if we can induce them to go with us ; but , if they will not or can not , shake them off and march straight for the city of bliss , leaving your coat in their hands , if they lay hold of it to keep you back , in your hurry to get there ; what matter for a coat ?

		You will be admitted without one .

		I remember hearing a description of it all once before from an old man who urged me to go there with him . ''

		Differences as well as resemblances occur , inevitably , in the two treatments of the theme , and it is obvious enough that the English allegorist had no knowledge of his forerunner ; and , of course , however many writers before
Bunyan	PERSON	may have had dreams and visions similar to his , and even if , as some have supposed , he got a few hints from
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's `` Faerie Queene , '' or possibly from the legend , a favorite with him , of Sir
Bevis	PERSON	of
Southampton	LOCATION	, nevertheless the honors of the Bedford preacher remain undiminished ; for `` Though old the thought and oft exprest , 'T is his at last who says it best . ''

		A REMARKABLE GUIDE-BOOK , unknown to readers of
Murray	PERSON	and
Baedeker	PERSON	, but more genuinely useful than any of those familiar red volumes , is Mr.
John Foster Carr	PERSON	's admirable '' Guide to the
United States	LOCATION	for Immigrants . ''

		It was in his college days that Mr.
Carr	PERSON	, tramping in his
summer	DATE	vacations through the sunny south of
Europe	LOCATION	, had planted within him the germs of what later developed into a large ca - pacity for understanding and helping the foreigner of lowly station on his arrival in this land of oppor - tunity and freedom .

		Of the Italian immigrant especially he learned to comprehend the needs and desires ; and so it was for him first of all , and in his tongue , that the now famous '' Guide '' was pre - pared .

		Though specialists and experts were called upon to put their finishing touches to the various sections of this primer for prospective Americans , the simplicity of its style and plan remained unim - paired , and the readiness with which its lessons can be grasped by the humble reader is a constant source of delight to him and to all concerned .

		First pub - lished three years ago , the initial edition of three thousand copies was soon exhausted , and a second of ten thousand went the way of its predecessor .

		Translations , or adaptations , rather , in Yiddish and Polish were added , and found eager purchasers .

		12
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 1	DATE	English versions of the Italian and the Yiddish manuals were prepared for Americans desirous of keeping themselves informed of what Mr.
Carr	PERSON	is doing .

		The modest price of
fifteen cents	MONEY	is charged for the book , in any of its several versions ; and as it is well-illustrated and otherwise well made , this price harely pays for its manufacture .

		To further its distribution , and thus to do something toward solving the immigration problem , a general invita - tion is extended to make the acquaintance of the '' Guide , '' which can be had , postpaid , of Mr.
John Foster Carr	PERSON	, 241 Fifth Avenue ,
New York	LOCATION	.

		A POVERTY OF POETIC TERMS seems to be appre - hended by Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	in the near future of the art of poetry .

		In a recent lecture on '' The Future of English Poetry '' he expressed himself , according to the
London	LOCATION	'' Times , '' as foreseeing a dearth of adequately expressive and sufficiently unhackneyed language to meet the poet 's need . ''

		With the superabundant circulation of language year after year , week after week , the possibilities of freshness grow rarer and rarer .

		The obvious , simple , poignant things seem all to have been said . ''

		Such is the tone of Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's gloomy prognosti - cations , but one may , without being a fatuous optim - ist , refuse to share his fears .

		Some thousands of years ago it was written by one who chanced to find himself in what may have been not unlike Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's present state of mind : `` Is there anything whereof it may be said , See , this is new ?

		it hath been already of old time , which was before us . ''

		Just how the new bottles for the new wine will be provided , and exactly what form and fashion they will take , can never be predicted ; else they would not be new ; but a good case could be made out for the probability of greater freshness and richness in the vehicle of poetic thought in the future than in the past , if any such argument were needed to avert a panic among the poets .

		The necessity , however , does not exist .

		... FURTHER FACTS CONCERNING THE WIDENER COLLECTION , which is ere long to find a suitable home in the new
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	library building erected to his memory , are contributed to the current '' Harvard Graduates ' Magazine '' by Dr.
A. S. W. Rosenbach	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		It appears , rich and rare as the collection has been found to be , its value will be still further enhanced by the addition of a * number of items from the second
Huth	PERSON	sale for which Mr.
Widener	PERSON	left bids with Mr.
Quaritch	PERSON	before embarking on the ill-fated '' Titanic '' ; and these orders are to be filled , under his mother 's authority , as if he were still living .

		A pathetic story about the
Bacon	PERSON	's `` Essaies '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	, 1598 -RRB- in
Widener	ORGANIZATION	's possession is now told .

		A short time before the ship sank he put the little volume , of which only four or five copies are known to exist in that rare second edition , into his pocket , saying to his mother : '' Mother , I have placed the volume in my pocket ; little '
Bacon	PERSON	' goes with me . ''

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE DATING OF BOOKS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Two or three months ago one of the best publishing firms in this country sent out for review a book bearing upon its title-page the date
1913	DATE	.

		The title-page does not in any way indicate that it is a new edition or new impression , but turning over , we read '' Copyright ,
1908	DATE	and
1909	DATE	, by Copyright ,
1911	DATE	, by . ''

		In the preface it is stated that the book is based on chapters contributed to two magazines , but that since their pub - lication in these , they have been revised and consider - ably enlarged .

		The copyright dates
1908	DATE	and
1909	DATE	evidently refer to the magazine publications , but the meaning of the date
1911	DATE	is not clear without further enquiry .

		To be quite sure , I wrote direct to the pub - lishers for information , receiving this reply : '' Answering your inquiry of
April 12th	DATE	, we would advise that we first published in
November , 1911	DATE	.

		The book has been re-issued since in the same form . ''

		I then wrote to the author , explaining what had been done , and asking if it had his approval .

		He replied under date of
May 31	DATE	: `` I thank you for telling me what my publishers have done .

		I do not approve of it , and am forwarding your letter with a request that they do the proper thing in this matter . ''

		To-day I have a letter from the publishers , dated
June 12	DATE	, as follows : '' Your letter to concerning has been referred to us for reply .

		We wish to state that the title pages of books are always changed to the date of the year in which that special edition has been printed , but the date on the copyright page remains the same , being the date when the book was first published . ''

		It is because the publishers appeal to common usage for their justification , that I think it may be worth while to discuss the practice described .

		Without making any minute or statistical enquiry , I think I am justified in saying that it is becoming increasingly difficult to determine from the title-page the true history of a book .

		In many cases new impressions are styled new editions , while in others their dates are those of the impression , with nothing on the title-page to indicate that they were published in an earlier year .

		There is , of course , the copyright date , given in small type over the page , but purchasers and even reviewers may not notice this .

		Can publishers say , with a perfectly clear conscience , that they do not expect or wish the public to be deceived by their method of dating ?

		THE HERO OF
GETTYSBURG	LOCATION	.

		* It is a commentary on the power of words that what
Lincoln	PERSON	said at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	has eclipsed what
Meade	PERSON	did there .

		To be bowled over by an eulogy celebrating your own per - formance is a hard fate .

		Of course such an effect can only be temporary .

		There is room in the gratitude of men both for the doer of a deed and the orator or prophet soul who ap - preciates it .

		Evidences are not wanting that General
George Gordon Meade	PERSON	is coming into his own .

		He has at least been fortunate in his biog - raphers .

		The first was
Colonel Bache	ORGANIZATION	, a cousin , who gave an admirable account of
Meade	ORGANIZATION	's personality .

		The second was Mr.
Pennypacker	PERSON	, whose careful military study of
Meade	ORGANIZATION	's career , based on the
War Records	ORGANIZATION	, has been accepted as authoritative both at home and abroad .

		The work now just published consists primarily of
Meade	ORGANIZATION	's letters to his wife during the Mexican and Civil Wars .

		These are connected by a thread of biography supplied by his son , Colonel
George Meade	PERSON	, with some additions by his grandson ,
George Gordon Meade	PERSON	, who edits the whole .

		This biographical matter is calm and clear in style , with no trace of partisanship or special pleading .

		In its simplicity and reserve , indeed , it foregoes opportunities for popular appeal .

		More than this , however , there are over two hundred pages of appendices , in which are given the correspondence between
Meade	PERSON	and
Halleck	PERSON	after
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, many newspaper articles attacking
Meade	PERSON	, his testimony before the
Congressional Committee	ORGANIZATION	on the Conduct of the War , and much other matter impugning or defending him .

		In addition , there is a set of twenty-four maps showing the positions of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and Confederate armies before , during , and after
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		Such boldness in editing we believe is un - paralleled in biography .

		It is as though
General Meade	ORGANIZATION	's family had said to the public : '' We want nothing but truth and justice .

		Here are all the materials for an opinion .

		Judge ! ''

		The entirely new part of this work lies of course in
General Meade	ORGANIZATION	's letters to his wife .

		They are attractive and interesting , and reveal * THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF
GEORGE GORDON MEADE	PERSON	,
Major-General United States Army	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
George Meade	PERSON	, Captain and Aide-de-camp and Brevet Lieutenant-Colonel
United States Army	LOCATION	; edited by
George Gordon Meade	PERSON	.

		In two volumes , illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		a character fiery and firm , considerate and gen - tle .

		In the darkest hours he is not despondent , and in the brightest not too much elate .

		His judgment of men and measures is extraordi - narily just .

		In the thick of things , his views as to what should be done , both politically and in the field , are such as time has proved accurate .

		Towards the end his indignation at the treat - ment meted out to him occasionally breaks forth in strong words .

		`` I do n't believe the truth will ever be known , '' he wrote , `` and I have a great contempt for History . ''

		These letters are rich material for a future historian .

		There are hundreds of incidents , and innumerable flashes of light upon important events , which can be found nowhere else .

		Of
Meade	ORGANIZATION	's personal character and his relations to his family and friends it is unnecessary to speak .

		They were ideal .

		Yet there was a quality in him which worked against his success , a certain aloofness which probably caused the newspaper cabal against him and alienated the complete Sympathy of the public .

		For one thing , he was a trained soldier , and he had scant regard for people who took up soldiering without such training .

		His earliest letters from
Mexico	LOCATION	are filled with objurgations at the volunteers or irregulars .

		Yet when in the middle of that campaign the despised volun - teers won the victory of
Buena Vista	LOCATION	, he said it was the greatest feat of arms
America	LOCATION	had ever seen or will see .

		Similarly , the ink was hardly dry in the letters describing the hopeless char - acter of the recruits of the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Re - serves when they gave a good account of them - selves at
Dranesville	LOCATION	, winning the first victory of the war .

		Meade 's views of the necessity of training and preparation for war were entirely right , but he never seemed to realize that the American volunteer soon becomes a veteran .

		Somebody asked Grant once how long it took to make an infantry soldier . ''

		Oh , about half an hour , '' he said .

		Grant 's trust in common humanity endeared him to the people , and when the critical moment came probably helped him to take precedence of
Meade	LOCATION	, though it is prob - able that he was not so brilliant a soldier , and it is at least doubtful whether his total sheaves of victory overtop
Meade	ORGANIZATION	's in importance .

		If this touch of hauteur and professional pride must be scored against
Meade	PERSON	, there is a vast account of injustice on the side of the country to be wiped out .

		Americans , indeed , may be said to have an hereditary instinct of injustice towards him .

		His father died broken-hearted at the failure of his Spanish claims under the 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	Treaty of
Florida	LOCATION	.

		The justice of these claims was admitted , and at different times bills for their payment passed both Houses of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the matter was not consummated then , and this really infamous robbery has been perpetu - ated to the present day .

		For fifty years
Meade	PERSON	has been set aside , ignored , depreciated , even insulted .

		The man who saved the
Union Army	ORGANIZATION	from disaster at
Charles City	LOCATION	, who swept the Confederates from
South Mountain	LOCATION	, who led the charge at
Marye 's Heights	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- the most splendid one of the war -RRB- , who was promoted on the field of
Antietam	LOCATION	, who saved Grant from the consequences of his blun - der at the
North Anna	LOCATION	and
Sheridan	PERSON	again and again , who fought the two battles which drove the Confederates into their lines at
Richmond	LOCATION	, has ever been doubted and decried .

		But of course his crowning triumph was
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		It was the greatest single thing done by any leader on either side during the war , the most important battle of the four years .

		The best military authorities are practically united in say - ing that if
Gettysburg	LOCATION	had been lost the cause of the North would have been doomed .

		Consider the conditions of the two leaders in that conflict .

		Lee , knowing of course his aim and purpose , his army well in hand , his troops flushed with two great victories and made more formidable by rumor , had been in long trusted command .

		Meade was suddenly sum - moned three days before the battle to take charge of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	army .

		Its morale was more or less impaired by defeat ; he hardly knew the positions of his widely scattered troops , and of course could not tell where the enemy would strike .

		Consider the marvellous concentration that preceded and followed the crushing in of his van and the death of his most brilliant captain in the first day 's fight at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		Consider the energy , the promptitude , the skill , with which he repaired the gallant but almost fatal error of
Sickles	LOCATION	's advance on the second , when , but for the support he gave , the army would have been cut in two and the Round Tops lost .

		Consider his prevision of the third day 's fight . ''

		They have tried our right , they have tried our left , and to-morrow they will attack our centre , '' he said .

		Consider how he met this probability , ranging line after line of troops at the threatened point , so if the Confederate col - umns had broken through the outer rim it would have been an avalanche swallowed up by an earthquake .

		Consider how he placed
Gregg	PERSON	and his cavalry to cover his right .

		Wherever men or a leader were needed there they were set by the stern ruler of the day .

		Surely few battles have ever been fought which exhibited more divining and directing genius , more pre - vision , preparation , and personal daring than
Meade	PERSON	put forth at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		But , his critics have sung in chorus ever since , he did not make a counter attack .

		Well , flesh and blood are not quite iron and fire .

		Three days of tremendous marching , three days more of terrific fighting , would seem as much as could be expected from mere mortals .

		The
Sixth Corps	ORGANIZATION	, which we are always told was fresh to the fight and could have been hurled upon
Lee	PERSON	, did not exist as an entity .

		It had been broken up and scattered to different points of the line .

		Besides , the head of
Meade	ORGANIZATION	's spear of battle ,
Reynolds	PERSON	, was shattered , its massy shaft ,
Hancock	PERSON	, broken .


Gibbons	PERSON	,
Sickles	PERSON	, and other generals were out of the combat .

		All Lee 's great lieutenants were alive and ready for the fray .

		But why apologize for what was wisdom 's very course ?

		Anyone who knows the ground , who has realized the spirit of the Southern troops , who has read the lessons of
Fredericks	PERSON	- burg and Cold Harbor , knows that an assault on Lee 's position would have been repulsed with fearful slaughter .

		The Confederates ' concave line was more defensible than the convex one of the Unionists , and its converging fire would have annihilated any columns
Meade	PERSON	could have set in motion .

		It is surely a fair thing to com - pare
Gettysburg	LOCATION	with the Battle of the
Wilder	PERSON	- ness .

		Meade 's superiority in numbers has been questioned , at the most it was trifling .

		Grant had 125,000 to
Lee	ORGANIZATION	's 70,000 .

		After a long rest in winter quarters and then a leisurely day 's march , Lee struck him in the tangled scrub oak thickets of the Wilderness .

		Two days of fight - ing ensued , terrific , but not worse than the first two days at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		Then both armies accepted check .

		If Grant was a more deter - mined fighter than
Meade	PERSON	, why did he not turn upon
Lee	PERSON	then and there and overwhelm and smother him with his immense numerical superi - ority ?

		He might have saved
Spottsylvania	LOCATION	, Cold Harbor , and
Petersburg	LOCATION	.

		Doubtless he did all that was humanly possible ; but if we criticize
Meade	PERSON	must we not also condemn Grant ?

		Fame at last awards its wreaths to the worth - iest .

		Prejudice , clap-trap , partisan feeling are in vain .

		To the South , which was outnumbered two and a half to one in men and outweighed probably five times in resources , will finally go the larger share of the glory of the war .

		Lee ,
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 15 in whose hand the South placed and kept its sword of command , will shine forth as the central figure of the strife .

		His audacities , his endurance , his resourcefulness , and his indom - itable battle spirit , were longer tried and more triumphant than those of any other leader .

		But in
Meade	LOCATION	, though the latter had no such range of opportunity , no such unfettered command , we believe that
Lee	PERSON	met his match .

		They were the two best soldiers of the war , and it was a fate propitious to the Republic which set them opposed in the battle that saved the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		THIRTEENTH CENTURY POLITICS AND CULTURE .

		* Mr.
Henry D. Sedgwick	PERSON	, already known as a sympathetic student of Italian life , has giveii us in his ''
Italy	LOCATION	in the Thirteenth Century '' a work of belles lettres rather than a formal his - tory .

		No learned footnotes mar the delight of browsing through pages bristling with poetical quotations , and all the dry material of chro - nology and bibliography is relegated to the appendix at the end of the second volume .

		And yet the work has an historical purpose , for , winding in and out among the details of Proven9al , Sicilian , Bolognese , and Tuscan poets , university professors , artists , and saints , is the story of the last great phase of mediaeval imperialism in
State and Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		The impos - ing figure of Innocent III .

		ushers us in ; the versatile Emperor
Frederick II.	PERSON	, stupor mundi , flits through the first volume ; while the pathetic Pope Boniface VIII. , broken by the humiliation of Anagni , closes the panorama and marks the end of the middle ages .

		Little essays on politics , religion , literature , and art as found in thirteenth-century
Italy	LOCATION	form the substance of the two volumes .

		There are twenty-nine of these essays in the first vol - ume , each averaging twelve well-printed octavo pages , and twenty in the second volume , each about sixteen pages in length .

		Such short disconnected chapters are easy to read by them - selves and of themselves as special topics in the history of politics and culture .

		Thus in vol - ume one we have a chapter on Innocent III .

		as the Priest and as the Preacher , then one on Joachim the Prophet , followed by an essay on *
ITALY	LOCATION	IN THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY .

		By
Henry Dwight Sedgwick	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		Illustrated .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Papal Jurisprudence and a culminating chap - ter on Innocent as Dominus Dominantium .

		From this group we pass to a chapter on St.
Francis	PERSON	and another on his First Disciples , while the next two chapters or essays relate to
Frederick II	PERSON	.

		and his relations with the
Papacy	LOCATION	.

		The field of religious and political history is then abandoned in favor of brief studies of Provencal and Sicilian poetry ; of the Lombard Communes ; of
Bologna	LOCATION	, her Constitution , her
University	ORGANIZATION	, and her
University	ORGANIZATION	professors , espe - cially the merry Boncompagno , and their inter - ests ; of the
Nobles	PERSON	of the North ; and of Art in its earlier development and its thirteenth - century applications .

		Only towards the end of the first volume do we get back to the
Papacy	LOCATION	and the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	, with Innocent IV .

		excommu - nicating
Frederick	PERSON	, and that '' wonder of the world '' bringing his meteoric career to a close by a death-bed marriage to the mother of Manfred .

		But we are asked to turn to Gothic architecture , the later history of the early Franciscans , and the disciples of Joachim before studying the last stand of the Italian Hohenstaufen .

		Essays on
Tuscany	LOCATION	and
Florence	LOCATION	close the first volume , which has thus presented a bewildering variety of content in its many brief chapters on politics , religion , and culture .

		The twenty chapters of the second volume are slightly longer and in general somewhat less topical than those of the first .

		Without attempting a detailed survey of the contents , it will be sufficient to say that there is one chap - ter on thirteenth-century manners and customs , two on the great theologians St.
Thomas Aquinas	PERSON	and
St. Bonaventura	LOCATION	, three on Italian vernacular and Latin literature , three dealing with the city states and provinces , four in succession on sculp - ture and painting , six on Italian politics and the papacy , and an epilogue which attempts in five pages to give a synthesis and summary of what has been treated .

		Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	brings to his task of descrip - tion and interpretation the enthusiasm of a lit - erary scholar rather than the organizing power and critical acumen of the scientific historian .

		His portrayal of Innocent III .

		is sympathetic and appreciative compared with the less enthu - siastic treatment accorded to
Frederick II.	PERSON	, who is depicted as '' less a man ahead of his time than out of sympathy with it . ''

		In view of the remarkable constructive work of a governmental and legal character that
Frederick	PERSON	undoubtedly accomplished in his Italian kingdom , it is diffi - cult to see how such a negative judgment can be 16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	sustained .

		Frederick was probably somewhat out of sympathy with his time , but he was in advance of it also , not in his imperial ideas and ambitions but in his viewpoint as to centralized government .

		Yet Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	observes that '' he looked back and not forward . ''

		Surely this is not true of the ablest and most interesting of the Hohenstaufen , save in so far as he was an imperialist .

		The truth is that Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	is not convincing as an interpreter of mediaeval history , however entertaining and fluent he may show himself as a sympathetic commentator on thirteenth-century civilization .

		The treatment accorded St.
Francis	PERSON	and his followers is scholarly and interesting , though lacking in unity .

		Similarly the account of Italian vernacular culture in its various stages of development is scattered through several chapters , interesting in themselves but more valuable historically if grouped together .

		Were the work as a whole arranged in sections having topical unity and development , it would be more readable and convincing as a study of mediaeval politics and culture .

		As it is , we must either skip from one chapter to another further on , making our own topical selection , or read a suc - cession of chapters with no more than numerical or slight chronological continuity .

		The value of a work such as this , though not great from the constructive historical viewpoint , is considerable .

		Information attractively pre - sented abounds in every chapter .

		The poli - ticians , churchmen , poets , and artists that made the thirteenth century so wonderful in history pass before us in brilliant procession .

		Their activities are described , their characters ara assessed , and their words quoted in a spirit of sympathy and appreciation .

		The English reader has the opportunity given him of coming in contact with great personalities of
Church and State	ORGANIZATION	, with famous and romantic Italian cities and districts , and with the stirring new life of the Italian vernacular as it develops from the Provencal forms and the southern Italian or Sicilian dialect to the sweet mysticism of the dolce stil nuovo over which the young
Dante	ORGANIZATION	raved so mightily .

		Many an eager young stu - dent with tenacious memory and enthusiasm for culture will find these volumes an Open Sesame to the varied life of
Italy	LOCATION	in what Renan calls le plus grand siecle du moyen age , while older and more experienced minds will pick and choose such topics as interest them and will find the treatment scholarly and sympathetic .

		This is particularly true of Innocent III. , about whom there is so little of value in English ; and also of
Joachim	PERSON	of
Calabria	LOCATION	, whom Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	characterizes as one who '' Flew at the sacred text like Michelangelo at a block of marble , hacking , ciitting , chiselling , shaping , until he forced the cold material to set free the imprisoned truth within .

		He cared little or nothing about dates and times ; his soul was swept along on the whirl of St.
John	PERSON	's tremendous vision ; he saw again the pale horse ridden by Death with hell following after , he saw the fearful beasts and the stars of heaven falling to earth as the fig tree casts her fruit ; he felt the mighty mystic import of the end of one era and the beginning of another , and his soul flushed with expectation and passion . ''

		This remarkable religious enthusiast and prophet has been too little noticed by English writers in comparison with St.
Francis	PERSON	and
St. Dominic	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was in many ways a mediaeval prototype of
Savonarola	LOCATION	in his prophecies of disaster , though lacking the political power possessed by the great Florentine seer .

		Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	's treatment of Italian culture is of particular interest and value on account of the many illustrative quotations he gives .

		This feature makes the half-dozen chapters devoted to the poets a veritable source book of thirteenth century vernacular literature .

		The extracts are admirably selected , and of sufficient length or completeness to furnish the reader with a com - parative idea of the progress of literary culture from Sordello to
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		The original Italian usually precedes the English translation , afford - ing an opportunity for the linguist who may wish to criticise the translator .

		Popular and yet scholarly accounts of the various fine arts round out the cultural treatment , and emphasize the intimate relationship that existed in the later middle ages and early Renaissance between politics , religion , and culture .

		A sense of humor is present in many of the cultural chapters , and is especially apparent in the delightful little essay entitled `` On Some University Profes - sors , '' as witness the following extract relating to the incomparable Boncompagno of Bologna : ''
Boncompagno	PERSON	's treatise ,
The Palm	LOCATION	, which , so he says , enjoyed great success at the
University	ORGANIZATION	and put his enemies to rout , seems to us as primitive as the paintings or sculpture of contemporary artists .

		It is a little book of some twenty pages , intended rather for teachers in the preparation of their lectures than for students ; it deals briefly with various matters in the art of writing : composition itself , prose , a grant of privilege , a testament , the parts of a letter , salutation , narra - tion , petition , conclusion , punctuation , minor clauses and parables .

		It reveals to us the difficulties that beset the men who dig the foundation of knowledge . '

		I admit , ' he says , ' that I do not know where the epis - tolary art was discovered .

		In
Greece	LOCATION	I was told that when the Israelites were under Pharaoh 's yoke they
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 17 did not dare speak to one another , and therefore Moses invented writing and communicated with them in that way .

		Others say that the art was invented in
Noah	LOCATION	's ark .

		I am wholly ignorant whether these explanations are true or false . ' ''

		His self-confidence and his love of humour , how - ever , enliven the book .

		He gives but one example of the proper form for beginning a letter : ' Suppose , ' he says , that the Pope writes to the Emperor on one mat - ter or on several .

		If it is on one matter the writer may begin in this way : Since We are bound by our office to be assiduous in admonishing all the sons of the Church lest they be caught in the snares of earthly temptation , much more attentively We ought to counsel your Imperial Majesty by apostolic letters , so that you may pass through the things of this world in such a way as not to lose those of eternity , etc. .

		But if in the same letter the Pope wishes to touch upon a second matter he may proceed thus : Moreover We commend most heartily to your Excellency our beloved son Doctor B. , whom We and our brethren from an intimate knowledge of his piety and learning love most dearly , begging your Excellency that on account of our request you will treat him with every consideration and give a favourable answer to his requests . '

		To whom can he refer under this discreet initial ? ''

		We are certainly under obligations to Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	for the exploitation of this delightful character .

		Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	's style is fluent , though a little flowery .

		It savors somewhat of an attempt at fine writing , but is easy to read and well suited to the descriptive work with which he chiefly occupies himself .

		A full-blown literary style is not out of place when literature and art in their interpretative aspects are being enthusiastically treated .

		There are , however , in some places naivetes of expression and commonplaces of quotation that jar on one in reading a work of seemingly selective character .

		But , on the whole , one can not but admire the general liter - ary tone and quality of the work , and pronounce it a valuable addition to the library of any lover of books or student of culture .

		The lack of historical organization is a fault that may be remedied in another edition ; meanwhile we are the richer by the possession of new material in English on thirteenth-century politics and culture .

		Some thirty well selected photogravure illus - trations , together with a map of
Italy	LOCATION	, add to the general value of the work for reference and guidance .

		An excellent index is provided , and the typography and appearance of the volumes do credit to the publishers .

		Teachers giving college or university courses in mediaeval history will undoubtedly find these volumes a most welcome addition to the somewhat scanty material in English available for students ' use .

		LITERARY RELICS OF A BYGONE AGE .

		* In
Miss Weston	LOCATION	's new volume we have for the first time completely accessible in modern English `` Sir
Gawain	PERSON	and the Green Knight , '' the most beautiful of all mediaeval English romances of chivalry ; together with either pioneer translations or better translations than have hitherto existed of a number of other medieval poems `` Arthur at
Tarn Wadel	PERSON	- ing , '' '' Cleanness , '' '' Patience , '' the '' Pearl , '' with parts of the ''
Morte Arthure	PERSON	, '' and of the '' Vision of Piers the
Plowman	PERSON	. ''

		Of these , the '' Pearl '' is an especially noteworthy vision - poem which deserves to be widely known .

		It has the distinction of style and the power of poetic imagery which one admires in `` Sir
Gawain	PERSON	and the Green Knight , '' and it is generally thought to be by the same unknown author .

		A partial translation in verse by Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	-LRB-
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
1906	DATE	-RRB- has already drawn some attention to this remarkable poem ; but
Miss Weston	LOCATION	's version , besides being complete , succeeds far better in reproducing the spirit and atmosphere of the original .

		If faithfulness to general effect , rather than line-for-line accuracy at particular points , be the test of verse translation , it should be said at once that
Miss Weston	PERSON	's versions of `` Sir
Gawain	PERSON	and the Green Knight '' and the '' Pearl '' are splendidly successful .

		Miss
Weston	PERSON	's general competence is assured by the long practice which she has had in translating from medieval languages .

		She translated
Wolfram	PERSON	's `` Parzival '' into English verse in
1894	DATE	, the greater part of `` Sir
Gawain	PERSON	and the Green Knight '' into English prose in
1898	DATE	,
Gottfried	PERSON	's `` Tristan '' in
1899	DATE	, four of the lais of
Marie de France	ORGANIZATION	in
1900	DATE	, and since then several other Old-French Arthurian stories .

		Doubtless in a second edition of her latest volume Miss
Weston	PERSON	will polish and improve some careless phrases .

		It is hoped that she will also avoid the mistake of using , in a translation into modern English , words which are either obsolete or are employed in a meaning no longer understood .

		In a few places , by the use of such words , she has obscured the meaning of her lines .

		Two examples must suffice : '' The very steed beneath the self-same semblance ware '' -LRB- p. 10 -RRB- . ''

		For tho ' his weird be drear Each man that same must dree '' -LRB- p. 26 -RRB- .

		Miss
Weston	PERSON	has done well to place her trans - lation of `` Sir
Gawain	PERSON	and the Green Knight '' first in her book , for it is sure to make the greatest appeal to the reader .

		It is a capital story , told with distinction of manner and ade - quate constructive skill .

		Sir
Gawain	PERSON	is pictured as the Father of Courtesy , the beloved and almost perfect English knight of the fourteenth century .

		Ideals of conduct and those things which train , develop , and test the heart of a man are kept ever before us .

		We feel as we read that the class of society for which the poet wrote , and to which he doubtless belonged , took much thought for the spirit , how it should be strengthened and made noble .

		The intellectual weakness of such a society is plain .

		It was unwilling to entertain new ideas , except such as seemed likely to be of use to the soul .

		That the habit mediaeval men had of repressing every - thing new that seemed to them valueless for the soul was narrow and deadening , everyone knows .

		To-day the condition is reversed , no fear of injury to the soul deters anybody from giving welcome to a new idea , however dangerous it may appear .

		A new idea is likely to be sub - mitted to the test of a different kind of utility , utility to the body .

		If it will not help us to be clothed , warmed , and filled , we will have none of it .

		Our narrowness is different from that of the Middle Ages ; and some readers experience a delightful and perhaps useful change by look - ing back from the materialistic civilization of to-day to the ideal which English noblemen of the fourteenth century pictured for themselves .

		In romances of chivalry such as `` Sir
Gawain	PERSON	and the Green Knight '' one gets at least a com - plete relief from the insistent utilitarianism of modern writing .

		The change in point of view may broaden our horizon ; but perhaps , after all , it is wiser to say that we turn back to these old stories merely for mental play , merely to relax our spirits with the exhilarating thought that we are doing nothing useful .

		The increas - ing number of readers who enjoy these romances will feel an obligation to
Miss Weston	LOCATION	and to her publishers for making accessible in such charming form these relics of a bygone age .

		A GREAT EDUCATIONAL , REFER - ENCE WORK .

		* Anyone who glances through the list of con - tributors to the new volumes of Professor
Monroe	PERSON	's '' Cyclopedia of Education '' f will be impressed with the fact that the editor has induced many of the recognized educational authorities in this country and abroad to col - laborate with him in the production of this great work .

		The writers who have prepared the articles for these volumes are to-day playing the chief roles in determining educational theory and , to some extent , educational practice throughout the world .

		Usually much of the work in encyclopaedias is done by persons who are chiefly skilled in presenting in acceptable form the knowledge which others have devel - oped ; but it is precisely the other way around in respect to the volumes before us .

		This peculiarity is perhaps due to the fact that educa - tional subjects have not heretofore been pre - sented to any extent in encyclopaedic style , so that it has been necessary to call upon those who are actually shaping educational thought to furnish the contents of this work .

		Every article in these two new volumes is , in the opinion of the present reviewer , the work of a capable specialist ; and it is probable that what these writers have presented will command the respect and secure the attention of educa - tional workers in all countries .

		In assigning space to the various articles , primary importance has been given to those dealing with subjects of present-day interest ; and these should meet the needs of those persons who are actually engaged in the work of instruction .

		There are many articles in these volumes , of course , which will appeal primarily to the educational philos - opher , historian , and administrator ; but the in - terests of these groups are not made paramount .

		Some of the more important articles which bear directly upon the problems of the school are those on Geography ; Geology ; the educa - tional history and present practice of
Germany	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	, and
Japan	LOCATION	; the study and teaching of Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, and English Grammar ; high schools in the

M. V. O'SHEA	PERSON	.

		SEVENTY-FIVE years ago
Alfred Smith Barnes	PERSON	, at the age of twenty-one , founded at
Hartford	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, the publishing house of
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- now the
A. S. Barnes Company	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which in
1840	DATE	removed to
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia , and five years later to
New York	LOCATION	, where it still flourishes .

		A short history of the house '' Seventy-five Years of Book Publishing '' is now issued in pamphlet form , with portraits of the founder of the firm and others of its members , facsimiles of early title-pages bearing its imprint , and some account of the educational and other works it has published .

		It is a record of consci - entious as well as able effort in the production and circulation of standard textbooks and , in later years , of a wider range of works .

		Since the acquisition , in
1906	DATE	, of the educational publications of
E. L. Kellogg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the house has shown a tendency to return to the special field in which it first achieved success .

		Conservative plans are now under way for a considerable increase in the company 's list of textbooks .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* There is always a danger in the cultivation of the garrulous , intimate , discursive style .

		Its prac - titioner is apt to become so enamoured of his own cleverness that his conceits will grow ever more fantastical , and his irrelevancies ever more discon - certing .

		It is given to few to drape the mantle of Thackeray about them in graceful folds .

		Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	adopted this perilous practice to such effect that from ``
Joseph Vance	PERSON	'' on his novels grew steadily less readable , and he ended in a veritable super-subtle futility .

		We notice symptoms of the same tendency in the novel that Mr.
Henry Sydnor Harrison	PERSON	has given us as a successor to the '' Queed '' of two years ago , and we regret it exceedingly .

		His manner has become irritatingly labored , and frequently one does not know what he is driving at until a page or a paragraph has been re-read and closely scrutinized .

		Not that `` V. V. 's Eyes '' is a bad novel , on the contrary , it is a very good one ; only it is less good than `` Queed , '' and this mainly because of the tendency of manner that we have above characterized .

		The scene is again -LRB- presum - ably -RRB- in
Richmond	LOCATION	, and again we have a study of a soul growing human before our eyes by the action of circumstance and environment .

		The story is complementary to '' Queed '' in that it deals with the expansion of a woman 's soul instead of a man 's , and also in that the evolutionary process leads it out of selfishness and frivolity rather than out of dryness and logical pedantry .

		The soul belongs to
Carlisle Heth	PERSON	, who is brought up with the vain and empty ideals that prevail in that small fraction of a com - munity that calls itself '' society , '' and who is brought to realize that a girl may have a nobler ambition than reigning in that petty sphere , and winning the desirable parti that is the goal of a '' society '' girl 's ambition .

		Now
Carlisle	PERSON	, with all her frivolity and petty self-satisfaction , has the glimmerings of a conscience , and this is aroused into activity by two agencies first , a lapse of conduct on her own part , * V. V. 's EYES .

		20 -LSB-
July 1	DATE	and , second , the influence of
V. V.	ORGANIZATION	's eyes , which penetrate her soul-recesses much as ROntgen rays penetrate the opaque tissues of the body .

		Her lapse of conduct is merely an expression of her moral cowardice , and seems too slight a matter upon which to hang the plot of the novel , and all the serious consequences that ensue .

		She has had a
summer	DATE	flirtation with a dissipated youth , and one day , when he is too drunk to know what he is doing , he swims out to the boat in which
Carlisle	ORGANIZATION	is taking a solitary sail , climbs aboard , and frightens her with the vio - lence of his reproaches .

		Repulsed by her , he leaps overboard and swims back to shore .

		Meanwhile , a gust has upset the boat , and witnesses on the shore think that he knows of it , and has deliberately left the girl in danger to save himself .

		In consequence , he is ostracized , goes to
Texas	LOCATION	, gets drunker than ever , and finally commits suicide .

		Now
Carlisle	PERSON	's dereliction is simply that she allows the story of the youth 's assumed cowardice to spread when she might have corrected it , a not unnatural course of conduct for a selfish girl who dislikes being made the subject of gossip .

		The longer she lets the matter go , the more impossible it seems to say the words that would clear the boy 's reputation , butwhen she learns of his death , she is self-convicted of guilt , and with her remorse comes a general spiritual awakening .

		Turning now to
V. V.	PERSON	, it becomes our function to say of him that he is a physician who works in the slums , and who gives the poor gratui - tous service .

		He is the soul of goodness , and his optimism is such that he can not believe that any human being can continue to do wrong after his eyes have once been opened .

		He even applies this doctrine to
Carlisle	PERSON	's father , who employs underpaid labor in his unsanitary cheroot works , and , although denouncing him from time to time , still expects that he will one day experience a change of heart .

		Between him and
Carlisle	PERSON	there are several sharp passages at arms , and she tries hard not to like him , but there is something in his eyes that she can not resist , and she is won over , despite herself , to his ideas and philanthropies .

		He becomes her con - science , until her own has grown strong enough to assert itself , and his influence leads her to make what tardy reparation she can for the death of the boy in
Texas	LOCATION	, to discard the wealthy and aristocratic suitor for whom she has successfully angled , to bring about the needed changes in the cheroot works , and to offer herself as a worker in
V. V.	PERSON	's pet project of a social settlement .

		The author quite wantonly kills V. V. just when
Carlisle	PERSON	has learned to love him , and the fact that he gave his life for his fellow - man is small consolation either for her or for the reader , who has never been led to suspect so tragic an outcome , for the .

		story .

		Some of the minor char - acters are quite delightful , especially the slum child
Corinne	PERSON	, a `` buncher '' in the cheroot works , who wants to be a lady and know about `` netiquette , '' and who worships
V. V.	PERSON	as an incarnation of Pro- vidence .

		She is as appealingly pathetic as any figure in the gallery of
Dickens	LOCATION	, and is perhaps the figure that will linger longest in our memory from the pages of this book .

		The old moral that the objects for which most men strive with all their energies become , when achieved , dust and ashes in the mouth , is once more read for us in `` The Ambition of
Mark Truitt	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Henry Russell Miller	PERSON	.

		The hero , who leaves the country town which has reared him to plunge into the life of the great industrial city , is deter - mined to carve out for himself a successful career , and sets somewhat ruthlessly about it .

		His aim is empery in the kingdom of steel , and he begins as a common laborer in the mills .

		With industry , he combines foresight and a capacity for leadership which soon make him a marked man , so we find him climbing rapidly up the hill of fortune .

		He works upon the devil-take-the-hindmost principle which spells success under the conditions of our competitive civilization , and becomes a wealthy captain of in - dustry before the book is half written .

		The rest of the story tells us how he finally saves his soul , which has seemed irrecoverably lost .

		For one thing , he has married the wrong woman , a hard , conven - tional , material-minded creature , and has meanwhile learned to love the right one , an illegitimate Polish girl of humble connections , with an immense capa - city for love and self-sacrifice .

		It seems to be a condition of his regeneration that he shall divorce his wife , and of our sympathy that we shall accept both this step , and the irregular relations that he establishes with
Cazia	PERSON	, whose own previous life has not been inerrant .

		What really saves him , in con - junction with , or in despite of , these unfortunate things , is the dream of an industrial community , based upon cooperation and mutual helpfulness , which shall make meaningless the class struggle between employer and employed , and which , after surmounting many obstacles , he succeeds in making a reality .

		It is a matter-of-fact story , for the most part , but one that is shot through with gleams of the imaginative vision .

		`` The Quarry , '' by Mr.
John A. Moroso	PERSON	, is the story of a country lad , a mechanic by trade , who goes to
New York	LOCATION	in search of work , falls into bad company , and becomes implicated -LRB- although entirely innocent -RRB- in a burglary which results in the murder of a night watchman .

		The boy is arrested , tried , and convicted on circumstantial evidence , the most damning fact being that his finger-prints are found on the instrument of the murder one of his tools which the real criminals have stolen and used for their horrid purpose .

		Being friendless , he is rail - roaded to Sing Sing , and becomes No. 60,108 be - fore he has gotten over being dazed by his ill fortune .

		He has for a cell-mate one
Bill Hawkins	PERSON	, a burglar of parts with a big heart , who befriends him , and devises a plan for his escape .

		The plan works , and the boy swims across the
Hudson	LOCATION	, hides in the
Hackensack	LOCATION	marshes , and makes his way to the South , where , under an assumed name , he becomes a cotton-mill worker , and eventually a successful inventor and mill-owner .

		This takes many years ,
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 21 and all the while
Mike Kearney	PERSON	, a
New York	LOCATION	police sleuth , is on his trail , like a modern Javert .

		The fugitive hides his tracks so well that pursuit is baffled , but one slight clue is at last discovered , and the detective is hot after the quarry .

		When the fugitive is on the point of arrest , he deliberately mutilates his hands in the mill machinery , knowing that the
Bertillon	PERSON	record of his finger-prints is the only certain hold that the law has upon him , and thereby destroys the evidence of his identity .

		In the end , his name is cleared by a death-bed confes - sion of the real murderer .

		The story is simply and tensely told , without any attempt at ornament , and holds the interest throughout its entire course .

		As a sort of secondary hero ,
Bill Hawkins	PERSON	has a large share in that interest , and the ingenuity with which the detective stalks his quarry also wins our admiration .

		`` The Hill of Venus , '' by Mr.
Nathan Gallizier	PERSON	, is an ultra-romantic historical narrative of
Italy	LOCATION	in the
thirteenth century	DATE	, of Guelf and Ghibelline , of church and state , and of the warring ambitions of petty princes .

		The hero is one
Francesco Villani	PERSON	, who loves the fair
Ilaria	PERSON	, and who , upon his father 's death-bed plea , renounces the world for the monas - tery .

		But the call of the flesh proves too imperious , and in the end wrests him from his vows and unites him with the woman he loves .

		There is much stir - ring incident in this narrative , but it is so gummed up with rhetoric as to be difficult of vivid apprehension .

		What is intended to be fine writing is for the most part fustian , and even the interest of the story 's historical setting does not save it from being tiresome .

		We often wonder whether '' Anthony Hope '' would have published `` The Prisoner of Zenda '' had he foreseen the number and character of the tales that were to be its progeny .

		In regular procession , they have been issuing from the press every year since , reaching in '' Graustark '' their lowest possible depth , and occasionally rising comparably near the level of their prototype .

		Mr.
Ralph Goodwin	PERSON	, in `` The Stoenberg Affair , '' has done rather better than most of these imitators , and he really makes the old puppets seem almost alive , with blood rather than sawdust in their veins .

		The adventurer does not get the princess , because she is preempted , but he does her valiant service , and the lady-in-waiting a very charming person becomes his consolation prize .

		A breezy story , told in plain journalistic fashion , with much invention and little artifice , is offered by the `` Brass Faces '' of Mr.
Charles McEvoy	PERSON	.

		A girl who has run away from school to meet a wooer whom she expects to marry , finds him somewhat less than fancy has painted , and regrets her escapade .

		He has got her into
London	LOCATION	lodgings , where she finds herself a prisoner .

		She writes a note appealing for aid and it comes into the hands of a nocturnal passer-by .

		Now this young man has for some time been leading a dual life , albeit a blameless one , and in his assumed character occupies a secluded cottage in the country .

		He rescues the girl , hides her in the cottage , and straightway falls in love with her .

		All
England	LOCATION	rings with the mystery of the alleged abduction , and a shrewd young American detective woman is put in charge of the case .

		She soon spots the young man , shadows him , discovers the where - abouts of the cottage , and forces its occupants to take a hasty flight .

		The pursuit grows highly exciting , when the young man , discovering the girl 's long-lost father , obtains his consent to a marriage .

		Whefc the facts come out , the first aspirant , the scion of a noble house , becomes alarmed at the prospective scandal , and declares honorable intentions .

		Where - upon the girl says that that was all she wanted , and capitulates , leaving her rescuer with the poor con - solation of knowing that he has been the means of this unforeseen union .

		The young man , thus basely deserted , then discovers that the American detective woman is the real object of his affections , and there the story ends .

		It is not particularly refined comedy , but it has originality of plot and freshness of interest , which are as much as we have any right to expect .

		The versatile Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	has again contrived a new style for his latest novel , `` An Affair of State . ''

		This is a work which takes us into the thick of con - temporary English politics , imagining a crisis which might easily become a fact of English history at almost any time .


James Draper	PERSON	is the chief figure in a government which strikingly resembles the un - holy coalition that has now been undermining the Constitution for several years , and is at present pur - suing with unabated , if somewhat chastened , zeal its monstrous designs .

		At the opening of the story , a measure is pending which , if it become law , will commit the country irrevocably to the tyranny of the hosts of labor .

		It is all to be done in the name of democracy , but
Draper	PERSON	has become skeptical of the cause which he has hitherto championed .

		`` There is something right here , '' he said , clasping his fore - head , '' that seems to tell me that the time has come when we who love
England	LOCATION	must start to back the engine . ''

		His confidant is
Lady Rockingham	LOCATION	, whose husband is a pillar of the old order .

		The conference steels
Draper	PERSON	to a great resolution , and a few days later he rises in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, and makes a speech of such eloquence and destructive criticism against the Conciliation bill that he is given a majority in the division that follows , and the government is forced out of office .

		Then follows a time of distraction , of pulling and hauling , of desperate efforts to form a new government , and of threatened shipwreck be - cause there is no strong hand at the helm .

		In spite of the extremists of his own party , who regard him as a renegade , and of the tory leaders , who regard him as the arch-enemy of their order ,
Draper	PERSON	is so clearly the strongest , man in
England	LOCATION	that there is a deep-seated conviction that he is the one man to restore order out of the disorder which his act has created .

		There are many conferences , and cabals , and projects , in which the leaders of the opposing factions take part , and in which the King is an influ - ential figure .


Draper	PERSON	's enemies nearly accomplish his undoing by starting a scandal about his friendly 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	relations with Lady Rockingham , and the social aspect of the matter is still further complicated by the defection of his wife , who has engaged in an intrigue with
Lord Rockingham	ORGANIZATION	.

		The final plea of the Crown is that the latter shall form a government in which
Draper	ORGANIZATION	shall also serve .

		Things come to a crisis in a country house conference , where a very tense situation is created by
Draper	PERSON	, who not only refuses to serve under Rockingham , but deliberately affronts him , and challenges him to a duel .

		A way is found out of the impasse by
Rockingham	LOCATION	, who yields to the importunities of his terrified colleagues by failing to meet
Draper	PERSON	at the appointed hour , and announcing his withdrawal from political life .

		Under the circumstances , he has nothing left to do but to take his own life , whereby the country is saved from imminent peril , and a new ministry is formed under
Draper	ORGANIZATION	's leadership .

		It would be unfair to seek to identify too closely the leading figures in this story .

		There is something , but not much , of Mr.
Lloyd George	PERSON	in the character of
Draper	ORGANIZATION	, and more of Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	in the character of
Evan Manleverer	PERSON	.

		As characterizations , both these figures , as well as several others , are masterly creations , and the whole story is told with a com * pression and an intensity which make it a very remarkable work .

		Everything counts , dialogue , cor - respondence , description , by-play ; there is no sur - plusage , no extraneous matter not absolutely essential to the development of the action .

		Mr.
Snaith	PERSON	has brought no finer artistic power to bear upon the finest of his previous performances , and this is no small thing to say of the author , for example , of ''
William Jordan	PERSON	, Junior . ''

		To say that a novel is the work of Mr.
Humfrey Jordan	PERSON	is to commend it in high terms to all who have read `` The Joyous Wayfarer . ''

		The title of his new book is `` Patchwork Comedy , '' and its theme is the protection of a woman 's good name from the assaults of a blackmailer , and the final discomfiture of the villain .

		The woman is the mother of
Charles Carfew	PERSON	, the hero , and has long been dead when the story opens .

		Knowledge of a youthful indiscretion on her part comes into the possession of a slimy adventurer of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	ill-repute , who uses it as a means of successfully bleeding the family for many years .

		When
Charles	PERSON	comes to his inheritance , he is not disposed to be submissive , and makes it his purpose to hunt down the blackmailer and bring him to justice .

		How this is done , with the aid of
Morton	PERSON	, a young sculptor , and of
Margery Gillanby	PERSON	, freed from a brute of a husband after several years of married misery , is told in a story which combines an exciting and complicated plot with a quiet rem - iniscent manner of narration .

		Both the men love
Margery	PERSON	, and
Carfew	ORGANIZATION	is the one who wins her .

		The scene shifts from
England	LOCATION	to
France	LOCATION	and
Switzer	PERSON	- land , and back again .

		It is distinctly a pleasant story to read , because it has the finished style and the wide outlook of an accomplished man of letters , which qualities in no way detract from its vivid portraiture and dramatic effectiveness .

		In the story of `` The Man Who Would Not Be King , '' Mr.
Sidney Dark	PERSON	expounds , with much force and pungent humor , a philosophy of somewhat exaggerated individualism .

		The story is so entirely made the embodiment of a thesis that it becomes a rather lifeless performance , and its interest lies far less in its action than in its shrewd running com - mentary upon the organization of society .

		The best part of it , in fact , is the '' prefatory note '' which makes no pretence of fictive disguise , and in which the author hits straight from the shoulder , making vehement onslaught on the aims and methods of the hypocritical philistinism which is advocated in the name of social welfare .

		The most important thing for a man to do is to live as nearly untrammelled an existence as possible , and this proposition implies as a corollary that he shall not try to shape the lives of other people according to his notions .

		This is a much-needed gospel , and Mr.
Dark	PERSON	preaches it so convincingly and so delightfully that we make no apology for quoting at considerable length from his preface . ''

		For years , '' he says , '' I have been impressed by the disgusting tyranny , ever growing more grinding , exercised by politicians , philanthro - pists , social reformers , and other virtuous persons , over the lives of the great mass of everyday men and women who are bored by politics -LRB- except at elections -RRB- , have no desire whatever to be reformed , and merely desire to live and love and have a good time .

		We -LRB- for I am one of them -RRB- are being threatened by experts , by scientists , by sociologists , by all manner of interfering people mostly well - to-do , and nearly all without enough blood in their veins to sin or enough soul to repent who yearn to make us sober , healthy , industrious , efficient , virtuous and inhuman . ''

		This theory of life he calls Webbism , for '' Mr.
Sidney Webb	PERSON	is the type of these enemies of the people , '' and '' all the moralists , all the parsons of evangelical faith , most of the politicians , all the Labour Members , and all the old women are Webbists . ''

		Crushed and subdued by them are `` all the common natural men in all the public-house bars in the country -LRB- a mighty and a pleasant multitude -RRB- , all the mystics , all the children , all the tramps , all the lovers , quite a number of respectable citizens and I think Mr.
Robert Blatchford	PERSON	. ''

		We who are natural men have our own ideas about the value of `` getting on . ''

		We drop the bone for the shadow but we find the shadow delightful .

		We pursue the will-o ' - the-wisp and think it good hunting .

		We blunder and sin , and sorrow and rejoice , and repent , and blunder again .

		The obstinate determination of the average man to be a man is a rock of offence to the social reformer .

		Against that determination he wages ceaseless war with eugenics -LRB- the filthiest and most bestial doctrine ever propounded -RRB- , with minority reports , with tee - total legislation , with tracts and pamphlets and wearisome talk . ''

		Mr.
Dark	PERSON	's philosophy of life is expressed in the following vigorous terms : `` The blood flows fast in the veins of the common man .

		He must now and then shout and dance , bonnet a
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 23 policeman , fall in love with his neighbor 's wife , write a poem , or chuck his money into the river .

		The curse of our time is that man , since he has discovered wireless telegraphy and made an aeroplane , is con - vinced that he is wiser than God .

		We are to be born not in the splendid haphazard of reckless passion , but after careful medical selection , like racehorses on a stud farm .

		Confusion is the rule and the glory of nature .

		The stars have been thrown higgledy-piggledy into the heavens .

		The whole scheme of things is magnificently rollicking disorder .

		But man is to live by rule and according to science .

		Laws are passed without the slightest consideration of the needs of the natural man .

		The Webbist is dissatisfied with man as
God	ORGANIZATION	has made him and is eager to create a man in his own image , just as the modern painter is dissatisfied with God 's world and has made a world of his own . ''

		It would be easy for the cold-blooded logical analyst to pick holes in this plea for untrammelled individuality , but with so much of it as is outraged by the manifold petty restrictions that society imposes on freedom of action in matters essentially personal , we are heartily in sympathy .

		The most pestiferous persons on earth are those who make it their life endeavor to interfere with us for our own good , regulating our food and drink and amusements and little personal habits in the name of such high-sounding abstractions as temperance and education and efficiency and eugenics and morality .

		Wherever a legislature or a board or a commission exists they infest its membership and pervert its legitimate function .

		`` Dost thou think because thou art virtuous , there shall be no more cakes and ale ? ''

		We trow not , if man have any manhood left .

		As a commentary upon these principles , Mr.
Dark	PERSON	's novel is not altogether success - ful .

		His hero , who has led a joyous and care-free existence , suddenly finds himself at the head of the
Peptonized Soup	ORGANIZATION	industry , which has been carried on by his family for generations , and which has created the model community of
Slavingtonville	LOCATION	, in which men live in material comfort and spiritual starvation under the puritanical rule of the company .

		He stirs things up a good deal , but his effort to bring freedom into the life of the community results in a demoralization that he has not anticipated .

		After a year of management , he chucks the whole thing , having made a mess of it , and returns to his former mode of existence , which can not , however , be as irresponsible as before , because he takes with him the pretty office stenographer for a wife . ''

		God bless us , every one , '' is his cry at the close , adding '' It is rather a splendid wish , and it would come true , too , if we would only let Him . ''

		Reading the opening chapters of Mrs.
Helen Reimensnyder Martin	PERSON	's `` The Parasite , '' we find it difficult to escape from the impression that we are occupied with a novel by Mr.
John Reed Scott	PERSON	, for the theme is not the manners and customs of the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Germans , but those of frivolous society in
Baltimore	LOCATION	, and this theme is Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's special province .

		The story deals with a man of middle age , divorced from his wife -LRB- wherein he has not been guiltless -RRB- , and left with the charge of their small son , whom he idolizes , and of whom she plots to gain possession .

		Randall is wealthy , besides be - ing a man of parts , and carries on a flirtation with a society belle , who is making a dead set at him .

		Then he surprises everybody by a sudden marriage with '' the parasite , '' who is a young woman of good family in reduced circumstances , and a hanger-on in the homes of her prosperous relatives and friends .

		She is thought to be a designing creature , because she has attached to herself the affection of
Randall	PERSON	's child , but this seems to have been done without an interested motive .

		At all events , it so touches Ran - dall that he offers to annex her to his household , to become his wife in name only , but not in communion of spirit .

		The proposition is made in a cold-blooded way , and accepted without effusion of sentiment .

		It is obvious that these two are destined to discover love after marriage , an outcome which is precipitated by an amazing plea made by the wife not long after their union , which gives
Randall	ORGANIZATION	furieusement & penser , and makes the reader gasp for breath .

		Bluntly , it is that she be allowed to become a mother by other means than those the law has sanctioned , and that he both condone the lapse and father the child .

		This , as Art em us Ward would have said , is `` tu mutch , '' and , as
Randall	PERSON	rejects it , he recognizes the dawning of love for his wife in his own breast .

		From this happening on , the way is smooth , and the happy ending speedily follows .

		Miss
I. A. R. Wylie	PERSON	, whose knowledge of Indian life , and whose skill in its portrayal in fictive form , are comparable with those of Mrs.
Steel	PERSON	, has for the second time given us a powerful novel of life in the chief of
England	LOCATION	's dependencies .

		It presents the contrast between eastern and western modes of thought as exemplified by typical figures of the rul - ing and the subject races .

		Miss
Wylie	PERSON	understands them both , and helps us to understand them in `` The Daughter of
Brahma	LOCATION	, '' a narrative of original plot and absorbing interest .

		The heroine is a Brahman girl , consecrated from childhood to the worship of
Siva	PERSON	, and trained by the priests to become the
Joan	PERSON	of Arc of a native uprising against the oppressor .

		The hero is the posthumous child of an English officer , slain in
Kolruna	LOCATION	by a native fanatic , and brought up there by his widowed mother .

		The mother is a woman of Spartan character who hates her son because she can not discern in him the heroic traits of character which are the tradition of his line .

		She believes him a coward , and the subsequent rev - elation of his moral courage comes too late to save him from a life embittered by the knowledge that his mother despises him .

		He gets sight of the cere - monies attendant upon the worship of
Sarasvati	LOCATION	, the Brahman priestess , and penetrates into the mystery of the secret temple in which the rites take place .

		He becomes enamoured of the girl , who willingly flees with him , and then , to the horror of his family and friends , makes her his wife .

		He takes her to
England	LOCATION	, having unexpectedly succeeded to the 24 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	family title and estates , and seeks to enter public life .

		But the fact that his wife is a black woman is a terrible handicap to him , and his love slackens when he realizes the gulf between them , and especially when he discovers that his feeling for an English girl , the comrade of his youth in
Kolruna	LOCATION	, has grown into something more than friendship .

		Meanwhile Brahman emissaries have come to En - gland , having tracked the lost
Sarasvati	PERSON	, and so work upon her racial and religious feelings that she con - sents to flee with them , and resume the interrupted r6le of inspirer and deliverer of her people .

		The scene again shifts to
Kolruna	LOCATION	, and the situation becomes very tense , as the mutiny is imminent , and the garrison in extreme peril of massacre .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		It is not too much to say that no in the Arctic otner record of Arctic exploration in recent years excels in compelling human interest Mr.
Ejnar Mikkelsen	PERSON	's simple and manly story of the attempt to recover the lost jour - nals of the Danmarks expedition , `` Lost in the Arctic : Being the Story of the `
Alabama	LOCATION	'
Expedi	PERSON	- tion , 1909-1912 '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The Danmarks expe - dition had started out in the
summer of 1906	DATE	, under the leadership of
Mylius Erichsen	PERSON	, `` with the object of exploring the as yet unexplored part of the north - east coast of
Greenland	LOCATION	, from
Cape Bismarck	LOCATION	to
Cape Bridgemann	LOCATION	, covering over six degrees of latitude .

		... Two years later , in
August of 1908	DATE	, a message from the Danmarks Expedition was flashed around the world : ' Object attained , coast surveyed , the outline of
Greenland	LOCATION	now known throughout its ex - tent , important scientific results obtained in various fields , ' but the leader ,
Mylius Erichsen	PERSON	, with Lieut.
Hoeg Hagen	PERSON	, and the
Eskimo Bronlund	PERSON	, perished after a heroic struggle against the difficulties of the country . ''

		Captain
Mikkelsen	PERSON	adds : `` The result of the expedition , a piece of surveying work , the difficulty of which few perhaps can better appreciate than I myself , was in part attained by the death of these three men . ''

		None of the diaries or observa - tion books were found , and for the sake of the three brave men who had given their lives in a last des - perate effort to preserve the results of their explo - ration , as well as because of the scientific value of the records themselves , the present expedition was undertaken .

		The hardships , the suffering , the con - tinual struggle against almost insurmountable ob - stacles , and the indomitable courage that had marked the journey of
Erichsen	ORGANIZATION	, of which we already know the story , were equally present in the long sledge expedition of
Mikkelsen	PERSON	into the far north .

		The latter and his companions fortunately survived ; though as one reads his narrative , graphic in its un - studied manner , and convincing in its modest recital of heroic achievement , one wonders how human en - durance could possibly survive such an ordeal .

		The story reveals the plucky little band of explorers struggling on day after day and week after week , fighting their way through terrific arctic blizzards , creeping by way of frail snow bridges across fathom - less crevasses , struggling up the sides of icy moun - tains , crawling painfully over the rugged sea-ice ; and then , as the season advances , wading doggedly day after day through deep , soft snow , slush , and water , risking their lives repeatedly amid the grinding turmoil of the ice-pack , because they must at all costs get forward ; taking hunger and cold cheer - fully as part of the ordinary routine of the day 's work , and facing manfully the most trying ordeal of waiting day after day in camp for the ice to set and open a road , while their small stock of provisions rapidly dwindles ; hunting from early morning till dark and finding nothing ; reaching at last a cache of provisions , to find it rifled and empty ; losing their dogs from starvation and exhaustion , and feeding them to the others , and in the end to themselves ; finally , haunted by starvation and scurvy , and with the last remnants of their strength about gone , drag - ging their unwilling feet the last few miles to the main camp ,
Danmarks Havn	PERSON	, only to discover their ship crushed in the ice , their companions gone , and themselves condemned to another winter in the Arctic , when they had been dreaming of home and all that home implied .

		This is the story that
Mikkelsen	PERSON	tells .

		It is one worth the telling , and one not easily forgotten .

		An artist 's
Edward Martin Taber	PERSON	, artist , nature - communings lover , poet , was born on
Staten Island	LOCATION	with nature .

		in I$ Q ^ and died at
Washington	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, in
1896	DATE	.

		Exiled from
New York	LOCATION	for his health in
1887	DATE	, after a European tour and other excursions in quest of bodily strength , he took up his abode at
Stowe	LOCATION	, in northern
Vermont	LOCATION	, and there remained until within a few months of his death .

		His notes and self-communings , made there and else - where , with selections from his letters and verses , and sketches from his ready pencil , are now brought together and published in a handsome octavo under the title , `` Stowe Notes , Letters and Verses '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Like that earlier naturalist , poet , and recluse ,
Thoreau	LOCATION	,
Taber	PERSON	shows in his writings the most intimate and loving intercourse with nature .

		Here is one of this artist-naturalist 's winter notes : '' This day is perfect winter , clear as a bell , whelmed and softened in sunlight , with an icy-flowing north wind , to which the pines sing , though bare boughs are silent .

		The trees on the mountains are com - pletely snow-covered with the sun upon them , 1913J THE DIAL 25 even the evergreens show no trace or hint of green .

		Hogback is a frosted cake , a coral reef its spots of shadow deep purple-blue . ''

		In the following the writer , like all persons of imagination , reads his own fancies into the things about him : `` As I passed through a sugar-wood in the still and quiet afternoon , the maples had a knowing air as of half - tamed creatures conscious of a power unshared by the wilder spirits of their kind the wondering beeches , birches , ashes , and elms and seemed aware of the friendly office they perform , and to acquiesce , as well they may , since accident in the blood of them insures a certain protection , if not care . ''

		Fine feeling and quick sympathies show in the work of both pen and pencil in this volume .

		A short biographical and appreciative preface is supplied by ''
F. T. H.	PERSON	, '' and Mr.
Abbott H. Thayer	PERSON	also contributes a brief introduction .

		In conclu - sion , and as an illustration of the exiled invalid 's undaunted spirit , we can not forbear giving the last eight lines of his poem , `` Winter 's Answer to Misgivings . ''

		In response to the question , `` Why struggle & till against despair ?

		How long resist the creeping gloom ? ''

		he replies in ringing tones : '' As long as crowns that hilltop bare The pine against the azure sky , And gives its music to the air , And waves its tasselled boughs on high ; As long as shall the chickadee Flit , lisping sweet , from tree to tree ; As long as on this slope 's displayed The sumach 's dauntless red cockade . ''

		Essays in humanistic Since the death of
William James	PERSON	, the leaders of the pragmatic move - ment haye been p ro fe 8Sor J o h n Dewey in
America	LOCATION	and Dr.
F. C. S. Schiller	PERSON	in
England	LOCATION	.

		The Englishman has that happy sense of humor and of human values which characterized
James	PERSON	, and which causes his books to attract a large lay public .

		His volume of philosophical essays entitled `` Humanism '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is now issued in a second edition , brought up to date by the inclusion of four new essays , two of which deal with topics which have become common since the original publication of the essays .

		The first of these new essays is entitled `` Solipsism . ''

		The reader who disregards the forbidding harshness of that label and plunges into the essay will read it in its entirety for its philosophical good sense , no less than for its humor .

		The theory that life is nothing but experi - ence , and that you whoever , gentle reader , you may be are the sole experiencer , such is Solipsism .

		Absurd as this definition may sound to common - sense , it is the logical outcome of the premises of several popular and imposing systems of philosophy .

		How and why this is , Dr.
Schiller	PERSON	shows in detail .

		His most surprising showing , however , is that Solipsism of some degree is implied in the newest and most objective of philosophies the
New Realism	LOCATION	, in its several varieties .

		Of course Dr.
Schiller	PERSON	is far from implying that the New Realism intends to be solipsistic ; but he shows how its rejection of ideas as mediating between man and the outer world , and its insistence that man sees reality directly , leaves it quite unable to explain the different versions people give of what they see and their different reactions thereto , or to explain the relation between knowledge and opinion , except on the hypothesis that the particular realist in point regarded himself as the one final court of appeal and his fellows as other than real .

		Of course Solipsism , whether considered in itself or as an outcome of Realism , is not to be taken very seriously ; but this making a bogey out of it for the new realist is a most effective way of drawing attention to his weaknesses .

		Another of the new essays called forth by recent tendencies of importance is that entitled `` Infallibility and Toleration '' ; it takes the recent Catholic encyclical against Modernism as the text for a discussion of some of the logical consequences involving intolerance as a duty which flow from absolutism and rationalism as systems of philosophy .

		While some of these essays are couched in more technical language than is found in the more popular books of
William James	PERSON	, Dr.
Schiller	PERSON	is often more coherent and suggestive than
James	PERSON	in his positive contributions to one 's stock of working conceptions of the universe in its spiritual aspects , and so his latest volume may confidently be recommended to the lay reader .

		A ten days ' What one likes best about Mr.
Ed	PERSON	- tramp on an , mi > i i e j j. old Enough ward
Thomas	PERSON	s book for pedestrians , highway .

		`` The Icknield Way '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , is its admirable restraint , its freedom from `` gush , '' its scholar 's preference for the under-statement to the over-statement .

		In his assertion that '' stumping along on a shoeful of blisters is not bad when you are out of
Royston	PERSON	and have
Pen Hills	LOCATION	upon your left ; low , insignificant , restful stretches upon your right ; and Odsey before you in the cool of evening , '' there is no painting of the pleasures of walking in rainbow hues that will cause subsequent disappoint - ment to the reader .

		And when he says that `` we walk for a thousand reasons , because we are tired of sitting , because we can not rest , to get away from towns or to get into them , or because we can not afford to ride ; and for permanent use the last is perhaps the best , as it is the oldest , '' he does not claim for himself any sublimated passion for pedes - trianism , such as it is given to but few to experience .

		His chronicle of a ten days ' tramp on the Icknield Way , from
Thetford	LOCATION	to
Wanborough	LOCATION	, is a sober un - pretentious narrative , but full of reality , of human nature , and of that other and larger nature of which mankind is but a part .

		Of the Icknield Way itself we learn that `` it is the name of two apparently distinct roads : one with a Roman look running north and south through Worcestershire and
Warwickshire	LOCATION	, the other winding with the chalk hills through
Suffolk	LOCATION	,
Cambridgeshire	LOCATION	,
Hertfordshire	LOCATION	,
Bedford	LOCATION	- shire ,
Buckinghamshire	LOCATION	,
Oxfordshire	LOCATION	,
Berkshire	LOCATION	, and
Wiltshire	LOCATION	. ''

		It is with the second road that the book has to do .

		The origin of the name '' Icknield '' 26 THE DIAJ , -LSB-
July 1	DATE	is lost in obscurity , though several derivations are suggested by ancient authorities , whom the author duly cites .

		He also , with a sort of humorous exaggeration of the extent to which he has taken his readers into the musty atmosphere of these old chroniclers , says of his own narrative that it `` was to have been a country book , but I see that it has turned out to be another of those books made out of books founded on other books . ''

		On the contrary , it is preeminently , after the introductory historical matter is past , a book about the country and its varied attractions ; and its charms are heightened by the numerous illustrations , in color and in pen and ink , contributed by Mr.
A. L. Collins	PERSON	.

		A map and an index complete the work .

		Dr.
Wilfred T. Grenfell	PERSON	's '' Labra - The resources and possibilities dor : The Country and the Jreople of Labrador .

		-LRB- reviewed in
THE DIAL	LOCATION	,
Dec. 16 , 1909	DATE	-RRB- is now issued in a revised and enlarged edition -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		A new and timely chapter is added on Conservation and Exploration , the object being to illustrate the present and prospective resources of the country as a storehouse and game sanctuary , and the importance of conservation of these resources , not only to the country itself , but in the interests of the ever-increasing population of the North Amer - ican continent .

		Dr.
Grenfell	PERSON	emphasizes the ideal situation of Labrador as an immense natural game reserve , but sounds a note of warning as to the urgent need of protection .

		He shows that the in - habitants of the region , Whites ,
Eskimo	LOCATION	, and Indian , are almost absolutely dependant upon animal food , and that the sources of their supply , such as codfish , capelin , seal , herring , walrus , whale , are rapidly diminishing , and in some cases -LRB- for instance , herring and walrus -RRB- have practically disappeared .

		The same thing applies to the land animals , caribou , duck , goose , grouse , and curlew .

		The record is disheart - ening , and would be more so but that Dr.
Grenfell	PERSON	shows clearly that it is not yet too late to replenish the land and neighboring waters by protecting their inhabitants .

		He goes even further .

		The experiment of introducing reindeer has been notably successful , and promises not only to supply the needs of the people of Labrador , but to afford an ever-increasing surplus of meat for export to outside markets .

		Dr.
Grenfell	PERSON	discusses briefly the possibilities of fur - farming , pulp-wood , and the utilization of Lab - rador 's unrivalled water-powers .

		`` In short , '' he hopefully concludes , `` everything seems to point to the fact that Labrador will come to her own in the not very distant future . ''

		A much-needed bibliog - raphy , and some remarks about the habits of the land mammals of the country , are also added to this edition .

		The story of The story of the accumulation of the Rothschild the '' greatest aggregate fortune ... that the world has ever seen or is likely to see '' is a marvellously interesting one , and Mr.
Ignatius Balla	PERSON	has told it well in `` The Romance of the Rothschilds '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Starting with the small beginnings of the humble
Frankfort	LOCATION	bank - clerk ,
Maier Amschel	PERSON	, surnamed '' Rothschild '' -LRB- Red Shield -RRB- apparently from the painted sign that hung over his door in Jew Street , the volume traces the work of each prominent member of the family , down to the present head of each branch ,
Lord Nathan	PERSON	in
London	LOCATION	,
Robert Philip	PERSON	,
James	PERSON	, and
Maurice	PERSON	in
Paris	LOCATION	, and
Baron Ludwig	PERSON	in
Vienna	LOCATION	, the original bank in
Frankfort	LOCATION	and the one in
Naples	LOCATION	having been discontinued .

		It is clear from the story that the great secret of the family 's unpre - cedented success lies in the fact that they have always worked together , almost invariably marrying among themselves , and always consulting with one another before taking any important step .

		If the dozen ablest financiers in the world to-day could be brought into such perfect harmony and sympathy that each would reckon the advantage of the others quite as much worth seeking as his own , the combine would literally rule the world ; and this was substantially the state of affairs with this international organiza - tion of brothers , cousins , uncles , and nephews , fifty years ago .

		The quality in the group that strikes the reader of this book most forcibly is their absolute integrity .

		So far from ever misrepresenting , they never even attempted to withdraw from a bad bar - gain .

		The
Bank of England	ORGANIZATION	was uncertain com - pared to their own , the former institution , in fact , would have gone under in
1825	DATE	without their assistance ; and there was as much truth as sarcasm in BiJrne 's qualification of a difficulty between the family and the Austrian government as a disagree - ment between two world-powers .

		The great nations have gained in stability and independence until the
Rothschild	ORGANIZATION	fortunes are relatively unimportant to - day ; so that the family 's rise from obscurity to the maximum of influence was the work of one short century .

		Adjure and Man y yf Englishmen , first and misadventure last , have left their native island and in many lands .

		SOU ght the Canadian far-west and other parts of the world in the spirit of adventure or the hope of gain , but few if any have chronicled their experiences more entertainingly than Mr.
Ralph Stock	PERSON	in his '' Confessions of a Tenderfoot '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , which professes to be `` the true and unvar - nished account of his world wanderings , '' and is en - livened with many views caught by the wanderer 's camera on the way .

		Cow-punching , ranching , cattle-tending on a cattle steamer , beating his way westward again on freight trains , life in a British Columbian lumber camp , glimpses of the Sandwich and the
Fiji Islands	LOCATION	, fruit - farming at a loss in
Queens	LOCATION	- land , and finally a successful venture in the purchase of a pineapple plantation in the same quarter of the globe all this and much else may be found set forth in brisk and often admirably picturesque and idio - matic form in Mr.
Stock	PERSON	's book .

		An unusually severe winter , the worst in twenty five years , encountered by him just after he had secured a `` bunch '' of cattle and started ranching on his own account , leads
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 27 Social force * in modem literature .

		him to the following conclusion : `` I have learnt many things by travel ; among others , that stock - raising in any country is a game of chance ; that the Canadian prairie is neither better nor worse than her sister colonies
Australia	LOCATION	with her droughts and
South Africa	LOCATION	with her rinderpest and that life the world over is a see-saw , and one can not always be at the upper end . ''

		The seeming composure with which the author remains at or near the lower end until just before the close of his tale is not the least of the factors contributing to the excellence of the book .

		His story was well worth putting into book form .

		_ So completely is modern literature the expression of social forces , that ft canno t be understood without a knowledge , at least in its broad outlines , of the intellectual history of
Europe	LOCATION	during the last hun - dred and fifty years .

		To give some idea of the relation between these forces and literature is the purpose of Professor
Philo M. Buck	PERSON	's `` Social Forces in Modern Literature '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , though of course it does not pretend to do more than '' draw into a focus what else is fragmentary and scattered . ''

		For a treatise of this extent the literature is almost inev - itably limited to
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	; the topics are represented by such as the intellectual and emotional revolutions in
France	LOCATION	as in
Montes	PERSON	- quieu and
Rousseau	PERSON	, the intellectual revolution in
Germany	LOCATION	as in
Lessing	LOCATION	, the beginnings of romanti - cism in
England	LOCATION	as in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	, and the empire of beauty as in
Shelley	LOCATION	.

		The treatment of romanticism and that to which it was in large measure a reaction , classicism , is perhaps the least satisfactory in the book .

		Our indispensable eighteenth century is given scant courtesy , and the reaction is treated in a rather summary way .

		Shelley is not viewed as the ineffectual angel beating in the void his lumi - nous wings in vain , but as the leader of a force that had beauty as its ideal and that in an age devoted to science and business held aloft that ideal till it became a part of the idealism of the later century .

		Few of our fellow-citizens speak to us with more certainty of being heard than the Hon.
Oscar S. Straus	PERSON	, and the gathering into book form of his various addresses and lectures , twenty-two in number , under the suit - able title of `` The American Spirit '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , will be welcomed by those who have at heart the best expression of our national hopes and fears , problems and ideals .

		The most various occasions brought these addresses forth , and they deal with seemingly unrelated topics , fused into harmony by a steady and uncompromising patriotism .

		The collection begins , appropriately , with
George Washington	PERSON	, and closes with the response to a toast at a dinner given by non-Catholics to the archbishop of
New York	LOCATION	after his being made cardinal , though there are two brief tributes to American statesmen to end the volume .

		The topics treated range from sociology to manufacturing , from the consular service to the cause Addresses of an American ambassador .

		of international peace , from an address to his fellow - Jews to a lecture at the
American War College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Every word shows the intensity of the speaker 's moral convictions , his love for civil and religious liberty , and his devotion to republican institutions .

		Best of all , they show him in touch with every move - ment in our common country which he believes will make for its spiritual integrity , no less than its physical betterment and intellectual progress .

		The first of a new series dealing Our Japanese w fth Q U r Neighbors '' comes from neighbors .

Joseph King	PERSON	Good - rich and describes '' Our Neighbors , the Japanese '' -LRB-
F. G. Browne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Other volumes are an - nounced treating of the Chinese and the Filipinos .

		Professor
Goodrich	PERSON	has had a long acquaintance with our brown brothers who are now so prominent in our thought , and he is able to write of them in neighborly fashion .

		In an entertaining manner he talks of the country and the people , the lords and the commoners , the Ainu and the '' Earth Spiders , '' and he weaves stories from mythical lore into the nar - rative along with incidents from his own experience .

		It is a very human volume .

		This is evident in the interest shown in the life of the farmer and fisher - man , as well as in the good neighborly custom of criticizing the neighbor .

		And from cover to cover the book is full of interest .

		In appearance the vol - ume is most attractive , of handy size , clear type , with almost a score of excellent illustrations , a select bibliography , and an index .

		Surely it will cause many a reader to plan a trip to the Land of the
Ris	PERSON	- ing Sun , or at least to dip into some of the more extensive studies of these interesting neighbors of ours across the Western sea .

		59 EXPLAINING
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		This huge democracy of ours requires a good deal of explaining to the European intelligence .

		We do much of the explaining ourselves , through our representatives in the diplomatic service , who rightly regard this as one of their official functions , and the fact that the higher posts in that service are so frequently filled by our leading men of letters tends to make the explanation effective .

		Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, for exam - ple , never did his nation a finer service than that of delivering his address on `` Democracy '' to an English audience at the time of his tenure of diplomatic office .

		Such services as his are as effective as arbitration treaties or other formal agencies for the promotion of interna - tional good will .

		And he had an illustrious line of predecessors in well-doing , all the way down from the time when
Franklin	PERSON	and
Jeffer	PERSON	- son brought visible embodiment of the ideals of the coming age to the court in which the ideals of an aristocratic society based upon privilege were entering upon the inevitable process of dissolution .

		Of recent years , we have been sending special intellectual envoys to
Europe	LOCATION	, charged with the special duty of national inter - pretation lecturers to the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, and ex - change professors to
Berlin	LOCATION	and other capitals .

		It is all to the good , for the better two nations come to understand one another , the less the chances of friction between them .

		Tout com - prendre , c'est tout pardonner , and a better understanding of us might soften even the asperities of `` The
Saturday	DATE	Review '' when American affairs engage its attention .

		But busily as we are engaged in explaining ourselves , our foreign critics , amateur and professional , are still more busily engaged in explaining us to their own fellow-countrymen .

		We owe much to the professional expositors , of whom
Tocqueville	ORGANIZATION	,
Ostrogorski	PERSON	, and Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	offer typically conspicuous examples , and not a little to the amateurs , even if they are carica - turists like
Dickens	PERSON	, or supercilious observers like
Arnold	LOCATION	.

		The work done by Mr.
John Graham Brooks	PERSON	when he prepared `` As Others See Us '' for `` The Chautauquan '' a few years a , go , collating the opinions expressed by many foreign observers during several generations , 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	was very instructive , and profitable both for admonition and for the cultivation of our sober self-esteem .

		Even the tirades of Mrs.
Trollope	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	have their value for reproof , or the anguished outpourings of
M. de Bacourt	PERSON	, sent for his sins by an unfeeling French government to dwell among us for a few months in 1840-2 .

		This sensitive soul , who relieved his feelings by the outburst : `` My God !

		what have I done to be obliged to live amongst such people ? ''

		and who departed for home exclaiming : `` I shall thank Heaven when I feel that I have placed the ocean between me and this dreary abode , '' is in striking contrast to the latest of our foreign commentators , the Frenchman to whose recently published `` Les Etats Unis d'Amerique '' we now wish to call attention .

		The author of this book ,
Baron d'Estournelles	PERSON	de Constant , has the best of excuses for writing about the
United States	LOCATION	.

		He has visited us upon four occasions since
1902	DATE	, and travelled extensively throughout the country .

		He ha ^ studied our life and our institutions under the most favorable conditions , and collected a great mass of observations , which he has interpreted with sympathy and discriminating judgment .

		His new book offers a happy combination of impressions de voyage and philosophical reflec - tions .

		It is not a formal treatise in the manner of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's ''
American Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, '' but a discursive narrative which is everywhere enter - taining , but which is by no means superficial .

		It is sprinkled with rhetorical exclamation points , treats our foibles with gentle satire , is outspoken about our mistakes of national policy , and deeply impressed by our material achievements .

		Even where it is severe in its strictures , it makes us feel that the author is dealing the faithful wounds of a friend , and tells the harsh truth in a way best calculated to spare our susceptibilities .

		It is as amiable as the journal of a six weeks ' tourist , but has the substance and the penetra - tive insight that such a journal usually lacks .

		Now and then it is amusingly naive , as when it expresses the author 's astonishment at the sight of a young man under the manipulations of a manicure in a hotel barber-shop .

		The young man , it seems , while one hand is being treated as if it were a hand of wax , is using the other to hold an open newspaper , which he calmly reads while cet ange penche vers lui , sa main dans ses mains .

		This matter-of-fact way of dealing with a sentimental situation in which a Frenchman would ogle the fair ministrant , leads to an '' explanatien '' of the American character that need not be taken too seriously . ''

		In the
United States	LOCATION	sensuality is reduced to a minimum ; it is set aside ; people have no time to think of it to begin with , then it is felt to be a danger in a new country ; thus co - education has become possible ; young girls may dare anything ; they finally externalize themselves , devoting to useful works , to society , and to athletics a share of the impulses which nature awakens in them ; then these impulses become rarer and less imperious .

		I do not know whether to call it a virtue or good fortune , but it is a fact which plays an important part in the life of the
United States	LOCATION	, and must be taken largely into account . ''

		Truly , on pent etre trop philosophe .

		On the whole , our author avoids rash generalizations , saying : Quiconque id generalise est un naif ' et un ignorant , and understanding that there can be few underlying principles of unity in a civilization so diversified and conglomerate .

		M. d'Estournelles has the occasional lapses from accuracy that no Frenchman seems quite able to escape .

		He tells us of his friend ,
Jennings William Bryan	PERSON	, of the eminent divine
Phillips Brook	PERSON	, and of President Judge of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, of the douglas-fir-tries of
Washington	LOCATION	, and of le coktail insidieux .

		He repeatedly speaks of the forty-nine states , and falls into other trifling errors from time to time .

		Generally speaking , however , his infor - mation is trustworthy , and the aperpus and judgments which he bases upon it reveal an orderly mind dominated by logic rather than by sentiment or prepossession .

		An idealist himself , he is prompt to recognize the idealistic push which is back of the gropings of our national spirit , and our fundamental purpose to deal justly with the perplexing problems offered us by education , politics , religion , the suffrage , and the Indian and negro elements of our population .

		These problems , and many others , he discusses always intelligently and often acutely .

		And he shows himself at every point the enemy of war - fare and the uncompromising advocate of the policies that make for peace among the nations and good will among men .

		It is where this sacred principle is endangered that we find his strictures most severe , and his condemnation most outspoken .

		He does not mince matters in declaring the folly of our tariff wall , of our inflated armaments , and of our monstrous expen - diture for pensions .

		He sees clearly how foolish and how utterly unreconcilable with our prin - ciples are our recent experiments in colonialism , and points out the dangers of a continued refusal to `` let the island men go free . ''

		On the other
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 39 hand , he makes good-natured fun of the alarm - ists who see us plunged into war , now with
Mexico	LOCATION	, now with
Japan	LOCATION	, and has full confi - dence that our fundamental good sense will safeguard us against such horrors .

		On the subject of
Panama	LOCATION	, he is distinctly on the side of wisdom and justice , as his summing up of the subject will indicate : '' Thus , from violation to violation , from the question - able seizure of a territorial zone to the fortification of the canal , from fortification to differential tolls , and finally from differential tolls to the refusal of arbitra - tion these are , within a few years , the temptations to which the
United States	ORGANIZATION	government has yielded , since it has found itself the absolute master of the inter - national waterway . ''

		Truly , a rake 's progress , succinctly stated .

		It is for such clear-headed and dispassionate judg - ments as these that we should owe our deepest debt of gratitude to M. d'Estournelles and to the pleasant book in which he has explained us to the foreigner .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A VALUABLE COLLECTION OF EAST-ASIATIC LITERATURE has been acquired by the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	, with the expert assistance of Dr.
Berthold Laufer	PERSON	, who has now prepared a careful `` De - scriptive Account '' of these examples of Chinese , Tibetan ,
Mongol	LOCATION	, and Japanese books and manu - scripts .

		The well-printed and beautifully-illustrated pamphlet is issued as No. 4 of the
Newberry Library Publications	ORGANIZATION	; and though its author modestly calls it a '' brief sketch , '' it runs to forty-two pages and is packed with information of interest to Orientalists , and is not uninteresting to others .

		Six years ago Dr.
Laufer	PERSON	was commissioned by the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	to obtain a representative collection of East -
Asiatic	ORGANIZATION	works on subjects in which that library specializes , religion , philosophy , history , belles - lettres , philology , and art .

		At the same time he collected for the
John Crerar Library Oriental	ORGANIZATION	works on geography , law and administration , trade , industries , national economy , sociology , agriculture , mathematics , medicine , and the natural sciences .

		The two collections together form a notable Oriental library ; but it is to the
Newberry	LOCATION	collection alone that Dr.
Lauf	PERSON	er 's pamphlet refers ; and for that col - lection he obtained
1216	DATE	works in 21,403 volumes , which he considers truly representative of the liter - atures named .

		There are 143 works in Japanese , 310 in Tibetan , 72 Mongol , 60
Manchu	LOCATION	; the others are in Chinese , `` which is the most extensive and important literature of the
East	LOCATION	, and the one from which the light of the others radiates . ''

		Also , `` there are eighteen manuscripts , all unpublished and deserving of publication . ''

		Facsimiles of wood - engraving and text are interspersed in the descrip - tion , from which we quote , in closing , a brief passage of general interest . ''

		Fiction is considered by Chinese scholars an inferior branch of litera - ture , and is not grouped with literature proper .

		It covers a wide field , nevertheless , and is immensely popular ... Poetry , however , has always been viewed as one of the liberal arts and elegant pas - times of a gentleman , and the Chinese have cul - tivated it to an extraordinary extent .

		Its study is valuable to us for its high aesthetic merits , but at a future date it will surely fulfil a still greater mis - sion and furnish the fundamental material for the most difficult of all subjects connected with
China	LOCATION	the psychology of the Chinese . ''

		THE RETURN OF THE WOOD - ENGRAVING , after its long banishment at the hands of the cheaper and for some uses more effective process print , may perhaps be looked for in the near future , if certain present indications in book-illustration are not mis - leading .

		Few though the wood-engravers be who are now practicing their art , we have in this country at least one eminently distinguished exponent of xylography who is still delighting the connoisseurs with his handiwork .

		We refer , of course , to Mr.
Timothy Cole	PERSON	, known to all readers of `` The Century Magazine . ''

		Word comes from
London	LOCATION	that
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are favoring more and more the old style of illustration in their books of travel and description , in preference to the facile and abundant photo-engraving .

		The beautiful bits of scenery and architecture executed by Mr.
Joseph PennelTs	PERSON	skilful hand show us , even though they are not reproduced by engraving on wood , how much more artistically pleasing and poetically suggestive a pen - cil sketch or a pen-and-ink drawing can be than a picture that is the product of the soulless camera .

		There is a tidal wave , or , to change the figure , a pendulum-swing , in all fashions , sartorial , literary , and other , including the mode of graphic illustra - tion for books and periodicals ; and as the hand - made picture has now been out of vogue for nearly a generation all illustrating having become more or less dependent on mechanical processes its revival might , on general principles , be predicted in the not very distant future .

		Not the once too familiar caricatures of wood-engraving art do we hope to see revived , but such examples as were for - merly furnished by
Linton	PERSON	,
Roberts	PERSON	, and
Gardner	PERSON	, in
England	LOCATION	, and by
Lepere	PERSON	,
Baude	PERSON	, and Jonnard , in
France	LOCATION	, not to mention American engravers , who have probably done more than any others to perfect the art .

		The continued existence and activity of the
International Society of Wood Engravers	ORGANIZATION	give hope of some such renaissance as is here indicated .

		THE ANNUAL DISCUSSION OF LIBRARY PROBLEMS which has recently occupied the attention of our librarians in conference assembled impresses the observer with the library 's increasing closeness of relationship to the varied interests and activities of modern life .

		So eager , in fact , has the librarian 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	become to enlarge and strengthen this relationship by every conceivable legitimate device , that Mr.
Legler	PERSON	, in his presidential address , felt called upon to admonish his hearers against letting the methods of the moment encroach upon the library 's larger general usefulness .

		The importance now attached to efficiency and specialization does indeed threaten to overshadow the vital human element , and to make us forget that even the most wonderfully efficient machine is an absolutely soulless , heartless , lifeless piece of mechanism .

		Hence it is well that the broadly human factor in library work received timely emphasis in the speeches and debates at
Kaaterskill	LOCATION	.

		Among minor matters pressing for attention were the probable future effect of the commission form of municipal government upon public-library administration ; the ever-present prob - lem of book-selection , more particularly of novel - selection ; the helpfulness or harmfulness of novels in the solution of social and economic problems ; the amount of attention that the public library , especially the large library , should give to the special needs of scholars ; the question of granting librarians sufficient leisure for both the reading and the recu - peration that are necessary if the daily grind is not speedily to result in lessened efficiency ; and -LRB- this from the delegate of the
British Library Association	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the detrimental effect of an excessive employment of women in library work , not by reason of any inferiority in such service , but because the salaries offered to young girls and women are so low as to tend to diminish the remuneration of men also , and to cause hardship in an already underpaid profession .

		On the whole , the attendance at this thirty-fifth annual conference , the addresses and discussions , the interest shown , and the whole atmosphere of the con - vention , give encouraging evidence of the growing importance and usefulness of the public library , which , as an appreciable factor in promoting the public good , is not yet much more than half a cen - tury old , and which in its modern development we are justified in proudly regarding as preeminently an American institution .

		POST-COMMENCEMENT CONTEMPLATIONS may not yet be out of order , though the last diploma of the season has now been tenderly laid away by the proud recipient , or sent to the picture-dealer to be framed .

		From the educationally somewhat backward South there comes a cheering note in the form of an editorial utterance in the
Hattiesburg	LOCATION	`` News . ''

		-LRB-
Hattiesburg	LOCATION	is in
Mississippi	LOCATION	, and has a population of somewhat less than twelve thousand . -RRB-

		The edi - torial , which needs no approving comment from us , is in the following strain : `` A good deal has been written and said against Latin and Greek in the public schools and in favor of corn and tomatoes .

		We have not the slightest objection to corn and tomatoes as side lines , but in school days the boy or girl whose attention is not given to books is cheated .

		Hog and hominy is poor diet to feed the mind on .

		Those who value education purely for the money there is in it or the money that may be gotten out of it , do not know how to value its true value at all .

		Education , ` book education , ' broadens the mind , gives culture to the man , wakens ambition , inspires to higher ideals , and prepares the man for com - panionship with books and authors .

		Agriculture has been an honorable calling through all the ages , and the greatest men
Mississippi	LOCATION	has produced have come from the farm ; but they were not great because they came from the farm , but because they educated their minds and learned from books things they could not learn on the farm .

		There is no more inviting field of endeavor than may be found on the farm .

		There is no living so sure , no life so inde - pendent as the farm life .

		But the boy on the farm who is denied the advantages of that higher and broader education which comes from books is badly cheated , though he may become the biggest hog and hominy grower in
Mississippi	LOCATION	. ''

		No sign of surrender there to the modern craze for vocational education .

		... FORMIDABLE FICTION , under which head most present-day readers would include the voluminous productions of
Richardson	PERSON	, if not also those of
Smollett	PERSON	, and such morally improving tales as the benevolent
Thomas Day	PERSON	and the excellent Miss
Aguilar	PERSON	knew so well how to write , gives occasion to Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	-LRB- in his `` University and Historical Addresses , '' noticed more at length in another col - umn -RRB- to indulge in some interesting reminiscences of his own earlier readings .

		`` I can just recall an austere time , '' he says , '' more than sixty years ago , when in
Britain	LOCATION	not a few moralists and educators were disposed to ban novel-reading altogether to young people and to treat it even among their elders as an indulgence almost as dangerous as the use of cards , dice , and tobacco .

		Exceptions , however , were made even by the sternest of these authorities .

		I recollect that one of them gave his imprimatur to two stories by an estimable Scottish authoress now long forgotten named
Miss Brunton	LOCATION	.

		These tales were entitled ` Discipline * and ` Self-Control , ' and a perusal of them was well fitted to discourage the young reader from indulging any further his taste for imaginative literature .

		Permitted fiction being scanty , I did attack ' Self-Control , ' and just got through it , but ' Discipline ' was too much for me . ''

		His further remarks show that this harsh experience did not by any means kill Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's taste for imaginative literature ; `` but , '' he laments , `` we have no
Dickens	LOCATION	, no
Thackeray	PERSON	, no
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, no
George Eliot	PERSON	. ''

		... DISGUISED BOOK-TITLES will always furnish book - sellers and librarians with amusing puzzles to fill their unoccupied half-hours , if they have any , and to diversify the daily routine .

		A small boy rushed , breathless , into a certain public library the other day , and thus delivered himself at the loan desk : '' Mother says , please , to send her
Browning	PERSON	's pair o ' scissors ! ''

		Of course it did not take long for the well-informed attendant to translate this into a re -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 41 quest for ''
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Somewhat more perplexing was the demand that came from a young lady who wished to read '' Pretty
Rita	PERSON	, '' which she thought was a recent novel , but could not remember the author .

		Attempts were made to satisfy her with '' Pretty Polly , '' by
Clark Russell	PERSON	, and with '' Pretty
Michal	PERSON	, '' by Jdkai ; but she insisted that the heroine 's name was
Rita	PERSON	, and refused all substitutes .

		At last the patient attendant had a happy thought . ''

		Was the author 's name
Ruskin	PERSON	? ''

		she asked .

		Yes , that was it ; and in a moment '' Prseterita '' -LRB- which if improperly accented becomes something like '' Pretty Rita '' -RRB- was produced , but , not seeming to have much flavor of romance about it , was speedily rejected by the hard-to-wait-upon young lady , who finally com - promised by taking ''
Gretchen	PERSON	, '' by the novelist popularly known as ''
Rita	PERSON	. ''

		A writer in the Lon - don '' Book Monthly '' enlivens the pages of that interesting periodical with some examples of dis - torted titles that have caused a few smiles and chuckles in the library world . ''

		Ingoldsby Legends , '' went masquerading as ''
England	LOCATION	's by-legends , '' `` The Insanity of Genius '' horrified the desk - attendant as `` The Insanity of Jesus , '' and a treatise on conic sections became a book of '' comic selec - tions '' than which the freak of humorous distortion could no further go .

		LITERATURE AND SOCIAL SERVICE were placed in aspects of inter-relationship at a late meeting of the
Bay Path Library Club	ORGANIZATION	, a central
Massachusetts	LOCATION	organization , before which Mr.
Frederic Kenyon Brown	PERSON	-LRB- better known as ``
Al Priddy	PERSON	, '' author of '' Through the Mill , '' '' Through the School , '' and `` Man or Machine '' -RRB- spoke on `` The Human In - terest Factors in the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Industrial Situ - ation . ''

		Mr.
Brown	PERSON	, his readers will be interested in learning , is now pastor of a church at
Southwick	LOCATION	, a position contrasting sharply with that in which his first book presents him to view .

		Following him as speaker came Dr.
Louis N. Wilson	PERSON	, librarian at
Clark University	ORGANIZATION	; and then there was some instruc - tive book-talk , especially concerning reading matter adapted to the needs of mechanics and that appeal - ing to agricultural workers .

		These themes occupied the attention of the morning session , and were fol - lowed in the afternoon by a consideration of '' The Library and School as Mutual Helpers , '' with Mr.
George Rugg	PERSON	, principal of the
Quinsigamond School	ORGANIZATION	at
Worcester	LOCATION	, as leading speaker .

		It is such meet - ings as this , which was held in the
Leicester Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, that help librarians and others to realize that a library 's proper work is not confined to the mere custody and classification and circulation of books .

		THE NEW LAUREATE , Dr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	, is not one of those generally named by the wise prophets who thought themselves able to reduce the list of likely candidates to four , or three , or perhaps two , or even one .

		But his being a `` dark horse '' is by no means in his disfavor ; and the fact that he has courted the Muse in a modest , unostentatious man - ner , as a relief and recreation after the exacting demands of medical practice , inclines one to think well of him and to hope for good things from his pen in the future .

		Born
October 23 , 1844	DATE	, he assumes the laureateship at a mature age , as did his immediate predecessor .

		An Etonian and Oxonian , he studied medicine at
St. Bartholomew	ORGANIZATION	's ,
London	LOCATION	, and was afterward connected with a number of hospitals , but retired in
1882	DATE	to the more congenial atmos - phere of his library and study , where he wrote a succession of plays , poems , and essays , some of which were privately printed , and others publicly offered to the world ; but no book of his , so far as we know , has ever joined the clamorous company of best-sellers .

		The names of a few of his works will serve as some indication of their quality and partly explain their exemption from a perhaps unde - sired popularity .

		Essays on
Milton	PERSON	's prosody and
Keats	PERSON	's poetry early came from his pen , as also a number of short poems ; and among his plays we note such classical titles as `` Nero , '' in two parts , `` Ulysses , '' `` Achilles in Scyros , '' `` The Feast of Bacchus , '' and `` Demeter : a Masque . ''

		The Yat - tendon Hymnal '' also appears in the list of his pro- ductions , indicating in him a turn for sacred poetry .

		Commended by the critics for his refinement , deli - cacy , restraint , purity , and other merits , he gives promise of adorning the position to which a discern - ing government has appointed him .

		THE ART OF ENTICING THE READER TO THE PUBLIC LIBRARY is now as sedulously studied and practiced as was formerly the art of repelling him and of keeping the books intact , each in its sacredly fixed location on the shelf .

		From a letter of invi - tation sent out by the librarian of the
Valparaiso	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Indiana	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library to suburban citizens , and printed in the current Report of the
Indiana Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, we quote the concluding para - graph .

		`` When you are in town , drop in at the library ; you will find it a comfortable place in which to spend a pleasant hour .

		Perhaps you may have some suggestions to offer .

		I shall be very glad to hear them and will give them careful considera - tion .

		If you do not have time to come to the library , let us know your wants through the teachers or your boys and girls any way that will help us to give you the best possible service , for that is what we are striving to do .

		Yours for a successful library year ,
Bertha Joel	PERSON	, Librarian . ''

		In order to meet the reluctant or over-occupied library patron half-way , and even three-quarters or four-fifths way , the estab - lishment of branches and deposit stations is going on all over
Indiana	LOCATION	, as in many other parts of the country .

		`` Sometimes the district school-house is the branch library building , and the teacher or some older pupil is branch librarian .

		Sometimes the books are placed with a family , and a private residence becomes a branch library with a mother or daughter 42 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	as branch librarian .

		Churches , country stores , and post-offices are all used in some parts of
the State	ORGANIZATION	as library centres , and in this way the public library is brought to the very doors of the country people . ''

		THE AMATEUR ELEMENT IN GREAT ART , the f resh enthusiasm , the delight in execution , the tendency even of zeal to outstrip knowledge this has been remarked often enough , and is emphasized again by Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	in his essay on `` Writing Novels , '' which occupies the leading place among the articles printed in the
June	DATE	'' English Review . ''

		After telling us that '' the novelist is he who , having seen life , and being so excited by it that he absolutely must transmit the vision to others , chooses narrative fiction as the liveliest vehicle for the relief of his feelings , '' and that `` he differs from most artists in this that what most chiefly strikes him is the indefinable humanness of human nature , the large general manner of existing , '' Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	continues his discourse on the novelist 's attributes and char - acteristics , and says among other things : '' I begin to think that great writers of fiction are by the mys - terious nature of their art ordained to be ` amateurs . '

		There may be something of the amateur in all great artists .

		I do not know why it should be so , unless because , in the exuberance of their sense of power , they are impatient of the exactitudes of systematic study and the mere bother of repeated attempts to arrive at a minor perfection .

		Assuredly no great artist was ever a profound scholar .

		The great artist has other ends to achieve . ''

		Of course it would not be very difficult to name a few erudite artists , but their erudition has always been subordinate to their art ; and the great artist , literary or other , if he is to be splendidly productive , must be the amateur , the '' lover , '' of his self-imposed task .

		This whole subject , however , has already been skilfully treated by Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	in his essay on `` The Amateur Spirit . ''

		... HOOSIER READERS AND WHAT THEY READ are told about , with other interesting information , in the `` Seventh Biennial Report of the
Public Library Commission of Indiana	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The progress of the library movement in that
State	ORGANIZATION	is graphically pre - sented by means of diagrams and a map , and two new Carnegie buildings are pictured in full-page illustrations .


Indiana	LOCATION	now has one hundred and forty-five public libraries , of which twenty have come into being since the issue of the last Report ; but eleven of her ninety-two counties still appear on the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	's map in black , to denote their benighted condition in respect to libraries .

		One hundred and six public library buildings , seventeen of them com - pleted or begun in the
last two years	DATE	, and sixteen presented by Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, are now scattered over the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Especially interesting is the account given of libraries in
State	LOCATION	institutions , whence it appears that in no other libraries can a little money and a little expert assistance be made to contribute so greatly to the benefit of the readers .

		At the bottom of a diagrammatic presentation of this truth it is asserted that `` with the same number of volumes , one-third the income , and fourteen per cent , of the population , the
Indiana	LOCATION	Reformatory library circu - lates five times as many books as a good public library . ''

		Lack of funds for maintenance , and the want of trained librarians , are the chief causes of the present failure of institutional libraries to attain the highest degree of usefulness .

		PROFESSOR WOODBERRY 'S PHI BETA KAPPA POEM formed not the least memorable feature of the late Harvard commencement .

		It was a noble tribute to the memory of
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, whose death occurred nearly five years ago .

		The poem , `` In Memoriam :
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, '' is now published under the poet 's copyright , which we venture to violate to the extent of a brief quotation finely descriptive of Professor
Norton	PERSON	's refinement and grace of manner .

		After some personal remi - niscence , in which he refers to himself as
Norton	PERSON	's `` firstling charge , boy - leader of the host of those who followed in the after-time , '' the writer thus , in part , depicts the proprietor of Shady Hill : '' A grave demeanor masked his solitude , Like the dark pines of his seignorial wood ; But there \ vithin was hid how warm a hearth Hospitable , and bright with children 's mirth .

		How many thence recall his social grace , t > The genial welcome beaming from his face , The shy embarrassment of his good-will Chafing against the forms that held it still ; Or , in more private hours , the high discourse , With soft persuasion veiling moral force ; The reticent mouth , the sweet reserved style ; Something unsaid still lingered in his smile ; For more he felt than ever he expressed , Then silent most when in his conscious breast Most intimate with some long-cherished guest . '' '

		OF INTEREST TO BIBLIOGRAPHERS are the various bibliographic lists , reports , announcements , news items , and other kindred matter in the current issue -LRB- No. 3-4 of Vol .

		4 -RRB- of '' The Bulletin of the
Bibli	PERSON	- ographical Society of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Especially to be noted are the list of
Brooklyn	LOCATION	publications in the years 1799-1820 , and that of current American bibliographical publications .

		Also noteworthy is the announcement of Mr.
William Abbatt	PERSON	's purpose to issue , as a monthly supplement to his magazine of history , a periodical to be entitled `` The Interna - tional Notes and Queries , '' and to be edited by Mr.
Eugene F. McPike	PERSON	, 135 Park Row ,
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		It will be obtainable separately , if desired , at
$ 2.25	MONEY	a year , subscriptions to be sent to Mr.
Abbatt	PERSON	, 410
E. 32d St.	ORGANIZATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		Interchange of useful in - formation will be the purpose of the new periodical , and it hopes to facilitate intercommunication be - tween reference librarians and others engaged in research .

		The
London	LOCATION	publication of similar name and character is said to have more than eleven hun - dred constant contributors , and the projectors of the new journal look for a like support .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 43
Cjp	ORGANIZATION	Ito JOHST BlGEJLOW IN HIS PRIME .

		*
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	tells us of Pericles that , '' following the dictates of enthusiasm and absorbed in sublime inquiries , '' he became engrossed in questions of public concern and gave to his paternal estate and private money matters only such attention as sufficed to insure him against pecuniary embarrassments , and brought the management of his property '' into such a method as was very easy at the same time that it was exact . ''

		In much the same way the late
John Bigelow	PERSON	, after he had reached the prime of his powers , refused to be further troubled with the question of money - getting , but , having already acquired a modest competence , gave his time and thought to matters of larger interest and served his country and his generation with works better suited to his tastes and more worthy of his energies than any pursuit of private fortune .

		In the fourth and fifth volumes of his ''
Retro	PERSON	- spections of an Active Life , '' issued under the editorship of his son , Major
John Bigelow	PERSON	, we have a near view of the famous diplomat and publicist , scholar , writer , and reformer , in the full maturity of his varied powers , and showing himself most genially in the mellowness of his sixth and seventh decades .

		As in the earlier vol - umes , diaries and correspondence are copiously drawn upon , with such insertion of narrative and comment as is necessary to round out the story .

		Among the noteworthy contents of the two rich volumes , mention may be made of Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's discovery and purchase of the original manuscript of the Franklin autobiography , his brief editorship of the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times , '' his memories of
Dickens	PERSON	,
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	, PreHyacinthe ,
Horace Greeley	PERSON	, and many other celebrities of his time , his visits to
Europe	LOCATION	and comments on current European events , including the Franco-German War and the fall of
Napoleon III.	PERSON	, and his public services at home in various capacities .

		The period covered by the two volumes extends from
1867	DATE	to
1879	DATE	, leaving the last thirty-two years of Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's life to have their story told in the letters , diaries , and other literary remains that are still unedited , but , as the editor says , `` may be utilized in the preparation of future publications . ''

		For the first time the whole history of the * RETROSPECTIONS OF AN ACTIVE LIFE .

New York	LOCATION	:
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		finding and purchase of the Franklin auto - biography , and of a series of his letters and the original
Duplessis	PERSON	portrait , is given to the public , in minute and often amusing detail , in the early pages of Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's fourth volume .

		The price he paid for the treasure was twenty - five thousand francs , the owners ,
Georges	PERSON	and
Paul de Senarmont	PERSON	, being not at all eager to part with these interesting relics .

		To the friendly offices of
William H. Huntington	PERSON	, at that time
Paris	LOCATION	correspondent of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' the American purchaser was considerably in - debted for the successful transaction of the business .

		Letters between the buyer and his agent show the latter to have been a wit and humorist , and also reveal Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	himself in the rather unfamiliar role of an indulger in pleasantries .

		Huntington describes with much playfulness his first call on
Georges deSenarmont	PERSON	, and the `` gentle domestic aperient '' by whom his passage through ante-room to reception - room was `` lubricated '' and he was eased of his card and letter of introduction `` in the most soothing manner . ''

		To this letter the reply , written in
London	LOCATION	, was in part as follows : '' Your promptness and zeal in the execution of my commission are appreciated .

		I congratulate you upon the pleasant passage which Mr.
de Senarmont	PERSON	's domestic aperient secured you though I may he called upon to indemnify two of my English friends for a set of buttons snapped off from their waistcoats through laughing at the incident in yr note which described that particular stage of your good fortune .

		... I do not suppose I should ever get my money back , and yet I feel that I should derive some satisfaction from being the actual proprietor of old
Benny	PERSON	's story of his life .

		... I pro- pose to commit myself to the oceano dissodabili , as your friend Mr.
Flaccus	PERSON	terms the waste of waters between
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	and
Yankeedom	LOCATION	, on the 30th inst ... What - ever you decide to do or to leave undone will be sure of the approval of your humble servant . ''

		The '' Franklinicnacs , '' as
Huntington	LOCATION	jocosely and a trifle contemptuously called the valuable objects of his friend 's quest , were promptly secured by him and sent to
London	LOCATION	, where they arrived just in time to be carried off in glad triumph to
America	LOCATION	by the returning traveller and retired minister .

		This was at the end of
January , 1867	DATE	.

		Ten months later occurred an ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' dinner in
Boston	LOCATION	, at which Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	sat as guest in the distinguished com - pany of
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Norton	PERSON	,
Whipple	PERSON	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, the two
R. H. Danas	PERSON	, father and son ,
James T. Fields	PERSON	, Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and others .

		Longfellow presided , in the absence of
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, who was president of the club ; and a part of the description of the animated proceed - ings that attended the eating and drinking will here be in place .

		44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	''
Holmes	PERSON	spoke with great emotion of the persistent attacks of the Nation upon The Guardian Angel , begin - ning with the first number .

		Had the writer awaited the completion of the work , he said , he would not have minded it ; but his conduct ,
Holmes	PERSON	said , could only be compared to the brutality of kicking a woman with child every week , in the belly .

		He thinks the writer to be a foreigner who has an idea that he may show his smart - ness to advantage at the Doctor 's expense .

		I told him I feared he attached too much importance to the criti - cisms of books , which were read by very few persons after all .

		He thought he had gotten over it , but I saw he had not . ''

		Dickens was asked by
Holmes	PERSON	if he had ever had his head examined by a phrenologist . '

		Oh , yes , ' he said , ' frequently ' ; and he said he had faith in the science , if only for the prominence of the bump of order in his head . '

		For , ' said he , ' I never can set myself down to work till I have been all over my house and seen every - thing in its place .

		It is simply impossible for me to write till I have gone through that preliminary .

		I do it now , ' said he , ' every day . ' ''

		In the
summer	DATE	and
early autumn of 1869	DATE	occurred Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's brief editorship of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Times , '' which he conducted in such a manner that its proprietors became alarmed lest he '' was elevating the standard of the paper too high for
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		Consequently the editorial chair was vacated with cheerful readi - ness by its too idealistic incumbent , who rejoiced to resume his quiet home life and once more dedi - cate the usual number of night hours to sleep .

		Here is a significant paragraph on this episode : '' Because I had been an ardent Republican when the preservation of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	was the dominating issue of the new party which had taken that name , and during my service abroad had enjoyed the confidence of Mr.
Seward	PERSON	and the Republican leaders in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, the proprietors of the paper doubtless assumed that I would edit the Times on the political lines on which it had been edited by Mr.
Raymond	PERSON	.

		President Grant himself called upon me to talk about the course of the Times , and appeared to be entirely satisfied with it .

		I took occasion , however , in the course of our interview to tell him that as the war was over and the dangers of dis - union were disposed of , it seemed to me to be his first duty to ask
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to repeal the War Tariff for which there was no longer any excuse .

		His reply surprised me .

		< Oh , ' said he , ` we ca n't do anything of that kind . '

		And he uttered it with so much confidence that I saw any argument with him about it would be wasted .

		Hav - ing known of Grant only as a military man , and that so far as he had any political principles he had been a Democrat , the promptness with which he rejected any thought of a reduction of the war tariff satisfied me that the protectionists had already been ploughing with the Whig contingent 's heifer . ''

		Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	's intensity of feeling on the third-term question appears in a letter of his to
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	in the
summer of 1875	DATE	, when the possible continuance of Grant in office for another four years was exciting animated debate .

		Recent events and certain future possibilities give additional interest to the sentiments so emphatically expressed in the following : '' The two-term tradition derives all its force and vigor from the respect entertained in this country for the privi - lege we enjoy of changing our executive at convenient intervals and our hereditary aversion to dynastic au - thority .

		It means that or it means nothing .

		Whoever assists in or connives at breaking down that tradition assists in and connives at the transformation of our government from a republic to a monarchy , and that by the terms of the Constitution is treason ; and our fathers saw fit to declare that traitors and those who abetted them were worthy of death not the presidency . ''

		More follows in the same strain , only intensified .

		From the
Paris	LOCATION	diary of
1877	DATE	we take a passage showing
Victor Hugo	PERSON	in a characteristic attitude : '' When
Dom Pedro	PERSON	, the Emperor of
Brazil	LOCATION	, was here , he sent a message that he would be glad to see Mr.
Hugo	PERSON	.

		Hugo replied that he was much obliged to his Majesty , but that he made no visits .

		The Emperor sent a mes - senger the second time to know whether , if he called first on
V. Hugo	PERSON	, the poet would return his visit .

		Hugo replied that he could not depart from his rule ; that his Majesty the King of
Bavaria	LOCATION	had done him the honor to visit him , and that he had not returned his visit , and it was therefore only more difficult to make an exception , however agreeable it might be to do so , in the case of his Majesty .

		The Emperor sent again to know if they could not meet somewhere at
Versailles	LOCATION	during the session of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	of which Hugo was a member .

		Hugo saw no difficulty about that , and therefore they did meet in one of the committee rooms , and ' had a charming time . ' ''

		Permission was graciously accorded by the poet to the potentate to join him at dinner some day in his own house , and there everything seems to have gone pleasantly .

		When Hugo 's son entered and was bidden by his father to `` salute his Majesty , '' the latter replied , `` No , there is but one Majesty here , and he sits there '' pointing to his host ; all which , says the diarist , was highly satisfactory to everyone concerned .

		These later volumes have a wealth of interest , and a lightness of touch in narrative and com - ment , that make them even better reading than the earlier ones .

		Portraits and other illustra - tions are interspersed , and a full index -LRB- not faultlessly accurate , which would have been almost too much to expect -RRB- to the entire work is appended .

		1913 -RSB- 45 THE VARIORUM `` JULIUS The publication of another volume of the Variorum Shakespeare marks an important step towards the completion of a great and noble undertaking .

		The amount of work involved in the preparation of such a volume can scarcely be realized by one who has not sometime at - tempted such a task .

		The careful collation of the four Folios , the comparison of the texts of all the more important editions of this play since the time of
Rowe	PERSON	, the thorough study of the poet 's originals and of the history of the times of the protagonist of the drama , the investiga - tion of possible sources for material contained in the play , the perusal of the letters of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's contemporaries for light on certain incidents , the critical study of the text itself and of the different interpretations by the poet 's numerous editors and commentators , the selection of crit - ical and aesthetic commentaries from the vast mass of French , German , and English com - mentary published during the past two hundred years , the study of other plays dealing with
Julius Caesar	PERSON	, the tracing of all sorts of obscure references to their sources , the verification of the editors ' comments , etc. , are all so well done and , withal , so modestly that we can not withold our admiration and gratitude for the present editor .

		Considering how well the work has been done as a whole , it is a pity to be compelled to pick flaws in it ; but we can not help judging this work by the high standard set for us by the late and universally beloved Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, the most genial -LRB- in the German as in the English sense of this word -RRB- , scholarly , and witty editor that ever shed light on the works of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The errors of the present editor , such as they are , can easily be remedied , and then his future work will come very near to that perfection aimed at by his illustrious predecessor .

		The most important task of the editor of this volume , I take it , was the faithful reproduction of the Folio text , with all its peculiarities of capitalization , punctuation , italicization , line dis - placement , word and letter displacement , type peculiarities , etc. .

		In this task he has failed , owing to careless proof-reading .

		For the benefit of those who own copies of the work in hand , I append the following list of the more important of these errors .

		In v. 5 .

		50 , a comma is omitted after '' labour 'd , '' and in v. 5 .

		Occasionally the Variorum emphasizes a partic - ular capital letter which is not so emphasized in the original ; very often it fails to reproduce the very heavy and clumsy periods of the Folio printer , and in some fifteen or eighteen instances it fails to reproduce the peculiar double-length capital C which elsewhere is reproduced .

		So , too , the displacements of single letters are not always copied .

		We would not call attention to these peculiarities were it not the editor 's pur - pose to give an exact reproduction of the orig - inal .

		Other misprints mar the book throughout .

		On p. vii .

		of the preface , seeing is misprinted seemg ; on p. 151 a verse from `` Romeo and Juliet '' is ruined by a superfluous comma , etc. .

		How trustworthy a guide the editor is to the texts of his predecessors I can judge only from the way he has dealt with

		Rolfe is not quoted every time he departs from the generally accepted text , nor are the readings peculiar to his text recorded .

		46 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16 47	DATE	, answered for answered , etc. , but these are not noted by Mr.
Furness	PERSON	.

		In an edition of this kind it is always a difficult question to determine what to give and what to omit .

		It is impossible to suit all tastes .

		The habit of referring to the
New English Dic	ORGANIZATION	- tionary for the interpretation of obscurities is , of course , a very good one .

		It brings home to the reader the fact that the understanding of what Shakespeare wrote depends very largely upon a knowledge of the peculiarities of the language of his day , that Elizabethan English is a wholly different thing from modern English , and that the poet 's linguistic peculiarities were the peculiarities of his age .

		But in the present volume this tendency is somewhat overdone .

		A student of a variorum edition is usually too far advanced to need to be reminded that proof means experience , knot group , griefs grievances , envious malicious , fire enkindle , regard heed , in into , warn summon , etc. .

		These are now commonplaces of Shakespeare study that even undergraduates are supposed to know .

		If an editor goes in for this sort of thing he ought to define every word not employed in its modern sense .

		If in the clause `` since the quarrel will bear no color for the thing he is '' the word `` quarrel '' is defined , why is not the word `` color '' defined ?

		So in the sentence `` be not jealous on me '' on -LRB- of -RRB- is defined , but jealous -LRB- mistrustful -RRB- is not !

		At times the editor de - fines words , e.g. exhalations , that have their modern meaning or very nearly so .

		A variorum edition is not supposed to supersede the dic - tionary .

		And if Mr.
Furness	PERSON	thinks it neces - sary to mark certain definitions -LRB- e.g. quarrel -RRB- as obsolete , why does he not give us this infor - mation in other instances , e.g. degree -LRB- p. 77 -RRB- ?

		On the whole there is a tendency to super - fluous defining , paraphrasing , and commenting .

		No reader of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	needs be told that `` by
Caesar	PERSON	and by you '' means `` beside
Caesar	PERSON	and at your hands , '' or that `` in his way that comes , '' means `` in the way of him that comes , '' etc. .

		So some of the quotations from Appian -LRB- e.g. that on p. 167 -RRB- , from
Craik	PERSON	-LRB- on the word orchard -RSB- , etc. , are not necessary and do not tend to illuminate the poet .

		To compensate for this it may be mentioned as a great relief not to find in this volume constant references to monosyllables used as dissyllables , trisyllables as quadrisyllables , etc. .

		In only one instance of this kind has the editor sinned .

		On p. 37 , we are referred to
Walker	PERSON	for evidence that creature is often pronounced as a trisyllable .

		Considering that the word is not so pronounced anywhere in this play , why encumber the book with unnecessary information , and that infor - mation of such a trivial sort ?

		So , too , I con - sider it a fault to remind the reader in some half-dozen passages in which where occurs as a contraction for whether of that fact , and to refer him to Abbott or to
Walker	PERSON	, especially as the passages in question never leave any doubt as to the fact .

		The reproduction of the conventional coat-of - arms on the cover of this volume is an absurdity .

		That coat-of-arms is no more
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's `` coat '' than it is that of the
King of England	LOCATION	.

		At the cost of about one dollar the publishers could have a cut made of the arms assigned to the poet by the
College of Arms	ORGANIZATION	in
1596	DATE	and carved on his
Stratford	LOCATION	monument .

		To depict the
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	coat on the covers would be some sense , but to depict what is there repro - duced is not .

		Another matter that should have received more attention is the Index .

		The mass of extremely valuable and interesting informa - tion stored up in this volume is deserving of and calls for a good Index .

		Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	, for example , is quoted several times in the volume ; yet his name does not occur in the Index .

		The pagi - nation of the Folio ought to have been repro - duced , too , I think .

		If we turn from what may be called the mechanical aspect of the editorial work to the personal we find much to praise and , to admire .

		The editor 's keen commonsense , his scientific mental habit , his shrewdness , his freedom from affectation and mysticism , the extent of his knowledge , and the range of his literary inter - ests , have resulted in a large body of notes which are of the greatest value to the student .

		His quotations from
Ferrero	PERSON	,
Cicero	LOCATION	, and
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	are always suggestive and informing .

		His eye is keen in the detection of the errors and over - sights of his predecessors .

		He is keen in his comments on the far-fetched criticisms of men like
Moulton	PERSON	, etc. .

		The notes that particularly pleased me are those on
Jonson	PERSON	's enmity to
Shakespeare	LOCATION	; on the words `` Pardon ,
Caesar	LOCATION	;
Caesar	PERSON	, pardon '' ; on Statillius -LRB- p. 270 -RRB- ; on
Caesar	PERSON	's fictitious mantle ; on the alliteration in iii .

		1 .

		196 ; on the phrase `` the manner of it '' -LRB- p. 49 -RRB- ; on the Senatus-consulta -LRB- p. 168 -RRB- ; and on the effect of the monosyllables in iii .

		1 .

		155-156 .

		The attempted vindication of Brutus from the charge of having lied to
Messala	LOCATION	is not , me judice , successful .

		It is so easy to take refuge in the theory of a corrupted text that every such attempt must be regarded with sus - picion .

		The scene with
Messala	LOCATION	can not possibly
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 47 be omitted without woefully marring the scene .

		We may be sure there is good psychological reason for
Brutus	ORGANIZATION	's conduct .

		Brutus has every - where imposed on his critics by the high valu - ation he sets on himself , in other words , by his own blindness to his weaknesses .

		Brutus never admits or even thinks that he conspired against the life of his benefactor and friend because he was jealous of him and his growing power .

		He first decides that `` it must be by his -LRB-
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- death '' and then proceeds to find reasons for his determination .

		He rationalizes his unconscious motives , a disciple of the new -LRB- Freudian -RRB- psy - chology would say .

		That the reasons he as - signs to himself in ii .

		1 .

		are not the true ones is evident from the fact that in his quarrel with Cassius he assigns a wholly different reason .

		And when a man assigns different reasons for his acts we may be sure that neither is the true one .

		It is exactly as with Hamlet 's reasons for procrastination and lago 's reasons for conspir - ing against Othello .

		The `` new psychology '' might also very well be invoked to explain one or two points in the portrayal of
Caesar	LOCATION	.

		It has long been noted , and Mr.
Furness	PERSON	has some very interesting comments on it , that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	represents
Caesar	PERSON	as being `` temporarily '' -LRB- ? -RRB-

		deaf after his epileptic fit .

		Several explanations of this have been given , that it is only a touch of vivid por - traiture , that it is a symbol of
Caesar	PERSON	's obstinacy and refusal to heed the warnings , that it is not to be taken literally , etc. .

		No one , as far as I am aware , has ever thought of asking why Shake - speare departs from
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	in subjecting Csesar to an epileptic fit at the moment of the populace 's disapproval of his crowning .

		So , too , according to
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	,
Caesar	PERSON	's tearing open his doublet collar and offering his throat to be cut happened on another occasion , among his friends and in his own house .

		Nothing in all Shake - speare attests more convincingly the poet 's mar - vellous insight into the workings of the human soul than this incident .

		Shakespeare shows us in his unconscious way that
Caesar	PERSON	really never suffered from genuine epilepsy .

		Caesar 's falling sickness came on late in life ,
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	tells us , and the attacks occurred only after great emo - tional excitement .

		In the light of
Freud	ORGANIZATION	's rev - elations we may say that
Caesar	PERSON	suffered from a form of nervous disease called a '' psychoneuro - sis , `` the manifestations of which are determined by unconscious causes .

		From Stekel we learn that in cases of hysterical epilepsy the exciting cause of the attack is an unconscious criminal impulse .

		To prevent this impulse from becoming conscious the individual falls into a fit -LRB- which gives vent to the repressed energy -RRB- and loses consciousness .

		Caesar 's attack manifests his covetous desire of becoming
King	PERSON	and his hatred of the people for their disapproval of
Antony	ORGANIZATION	's action .

		This is the meaning of the convulsion and what followed ; not that it shows that
Caesar	PERSON	's fortune is waning or that the gods , too , conspire against him .

		Let us not resort to the supernat - ural when the psychological will serve .

		Caesar 's offer of his throat to the rabble and his fear that he may have said something amiss show what was in his mind before he fell .

		For the benefit of those who are not physicians it may be said that the reasons for not regarding
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's at - tack as genuine epilepsy are the following : the attack occurred by day ; it was preceded by emotional excitement ; his loss of consciousness was not complete ; he recovered consciousness very quickly and knew what had happened ; his mind was perfectly clear after the convulsion ; he was deaf -LRB- or deafened -RRB- on the left ear ; his attacks began late in life ; he was superstitious `` of late '' and presented many paranoiac ten - dencies .

		That the deafness was on the left side becomes significant when we bear in mind that in the language of the unconscious the left is the wrong , the sinful , the criminal .

		One is disappointed to find so acute a scholar as Mr.
Furness	PERSON	reproducing all the futile discussion -LRB- pp. 19 and 41 -RRB- as to the Shakesperean pronunciation of ``
Rome	LOCATION	'' and '' room . ''

		Who can doubt that a poet and a wit would force the pronunciation of any word a little for the sake of a rhyme or a word-play ?

		While on the subject of pronunciation , it is somewhat surprising that the editor does not inform us how Elizabethans pronounced the word '' spirit '' as a monosyllable , whether '' spir ' t '' or `` sprit . ''

		-LRB- Cf. p. 40 . -RRB-

		I am inclined to think that the word was often pronounced '' spreet , '' and often so printed .

		On p. 44 Mr.
Furness	PERSON	reproduces
Walker	PERSON	's note on the frequency of the interpolation of an s at the end of a word as being due to some peculiarity of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's handwriting .

		If we had an authentic and undoubted specimen of the poet 's handwriting this matter would be easily settled .

		But the only thing in this kind that we have is a portion of the MS. play of `` Sir
Thomas Moore	PERSON	'' preserved in the British Museum , which it is impossible to prove to be a genuine MS. from the poet 's hand , much as we may believe it is .

		This MS. and all other Elizabethan manuscripts show two distinct varieties of final s which can not be mistaken 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	for anything else ; nor is there any final char - acter in it or them that in any way resembles a final s .

		The same is also true of the poet 's will , which some believe to be holographic .

		The dramatist 's genuine signatures show no final stroke that could be mistaken for a final s. For which reasons I do not believe that the inter - polated final s originated in some peculiarity of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's handwriting .

		On p. 237 Mr.
Furness	PERSON	falls into a peculiar error which is very unusual for him .

		In con - nection with the vanishing of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's ghost after
Brutus	PERSON	had taken heart , he refers to '' Macbeth '' for an illustration of `` a similar example of an effort of will overcoming an hallucination . ''

		But the two incidents are not at all alike .

		Macbeth takes heart only after the Ghost of Banquo vanished ; his will had nothing to do with it .

		Witness his own words : '' Why , so ; being gone I am a man again . ''

		Psychologically the difference is very great .

		In `` Macbeth '' the Ghost is real , objective ; in this play the Ghost is subjective , the projection of
Brutus	ORGANIZATION	's guilty conscience .

		It is somewhat surprising to find Mr.
Furness	PERSON	, who is so alert in the detection of fine tonal effects , failing to point out the effectiveness of the words '' And kill him in the shell . ''

		The shortness of the line had received its comment , but no one , as far as I know , has pointed out how these monosyllabic words with their three short is and two short e 's produce an effect as if the speaker were delivering a fatal blow .

		Shakespeare was very happy in the production of such effects , in adapting sound to sense ; and every instance of it ought to be pointed out .

		Nothing finer in this kind has ever been produced than when
King Lear	PERSON	pronounces his own doom : `` So be my grave my peace as here I give her father 's heart from her . ''

		This review having already outgrown my intention I shall comment only on two or three other matters of minor nature .

		Brutus 's '' I do know you well '' -LRB- iv .

		2 .

		50 -RRB- does not mean `` since we are both intimate friends . ''

		It means , `` I know how excitable , rash , hot-tempered , and choleric you are . ''

		That is why he says , '' Cassius , be content ; speak your griefs softly . ''

		Mr.
Furness	PERSON	's emendation of `` increasing '' for '' encreaseth '' is unnecessarily '' botching Shake - speare , '' as Professor
Liddell	PERSON	would say .

		The passage -LRB- iv .

		3 .

		246 -RRB- is perfectly clear as it is , and no one has ever found any difficulty with it .

		Nor can I receive favorably
Walker	PERSON	's sugges - tion -LRB- p. 134 -RRB- that we stress the word `` of '' in the verse , '' He draws
Marc Antony	PERSON	out of the way . ''

		Imagine , if you can , any actor reading the line that way !

		Nor do I agree with Mr.
Furness	PERSON	in thinking that
Brutus	PERSON	's speech -LRB- i. 2 .

		26 -RRB- would read well if read , '' A soothsayer bids beware , '' etc. .

		The cacophony is harsh , and the meaning of the sentence is ruined .

		On the whole , the volume before us is one of the best editions of this play that has ever been published , and a worthy fellow to its predeces - sors in the ''
Furness Variorum Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	. ''


SAMUEL A. TANNENBAUM	PERSON	.

		JAPANESE COLOR-PRINTS .

		* As year by year the circle widens of those who are familiar with the exquisite fascinations of the finer Japanese prints , there are produced occasional volumes of a quality that would have been impossible twenty-five years ago , when neither adequate data about the prints nor adequate processes of color-reproduction were available .

		Nowadays the reader , however remote he may be from the great print-collections , may have at his command trustworthy information regarding the artists and a true impression of the beauty of the prints themselves .

		The books of
Fenollosa	ORGANIZATION	, von
Seidlitz	PERSON	, and the great illus - trated catalogues of the exhibitions at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs issued annually in
Paris	LOCATION	, have all contributed to this service .

		And now Mr.
Frederick William Gookin	PERSON	, whom one may regard as the doyen of Japanese print lovers in
America	LOCATION	, has produced , in his ``
Japan	LOCATION	- ese Colour-Prints and their Designers , '' a vol - ume that will find a place beside the finest of its predecessors .

		The magnificent colored illustrations of the volume catch one 's eye first ; and , unlike ordinary illustrations , they have a place of high import - ance in the total scheme of the book .

		People in general do not realize how difficult it is even to see , and how almost impossible it is to acquire , the really fine prints , the works that have given this field of art its high and just fame .

		The finest prints are widely scattered , as a rule , in the hands of private collectors ; and these fortunate possessors , though without known ex - ception they freely and gladly exhibit their treasures to all who ask , are not always easily * JAPANESE COLOUR-PRINTS AND THEIR DESIGNERS .

		By
Frederick William Gookin	PERSON	.

		A Lecture delivered before The
Japan	LOCATION	Society of
New York	LOCATION	,
April 10 , 1911	DATE	; to which is appended a Catalogue of a LoanCollection of Japanese Colour - Prints exhibited at the
Fifth Avenue Building	ORGANIZATION	,
April 19	DATE	to
May 19 , 1911	DATE	; together with Reproductions of Representative Prints included in the Exhibition .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Japan Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		1913 -RSB- 49 accessible to the general public .


Japan	LOCATION	itself is now almost bare of such works .

		One may go from one end of that country to the other , and though one search diligently , one will perhaps not see a single print of the quality of those which Mr.
Gookin	PERSON	reproduces .

		And so the value of these reproductions , in accurate color , of twenty-five of the supreme masterpieces of color-print design , is not small ; nor is the service to the public in reproducing them a superfluous one .

		The noble magnificence of Toyonobu and
Kiyonaga	PERSON	, the exquisite color of
Utamaro	PERSON	and
Shuncho	PERSON	, the colossal force of Sharaku , the spirituality of
Eishi	LOCATION	, and the delicacy of
Harunobu	LOCATION	, all address the eye from these pages with a power so intense that the book may well serve as the Bible of those missionaries who go forth to convert the world to the religion of Japanese prints .

		The history of the art of which these prints are the product is one of singular interest , and , until comparatively recently , of great obscurity .

		Mr.
Gookin	PERSON	reviews , with insight , judgment , and a fine sense of perspective , its curiously brief course .

		This Ukiyoe , or
Popular School	ORGANIZATION	, taking its rise , like a small stream , among the mountains of that older aristocratic art which
Japan	LOCATION	acquired from ancient
China	LOCATION	, began , at the
end of the sixteenth century	DATE	, in the time of the Tokugawa Shoguns , to swell into a broad river of gay and democratic artistic activity .

		The actor , the courtesan , the dancer , the man in the street , all began to find a place in an art that had hitherto been the select retreat of devotees of abstruse poetic allusion , venerable academic tradition , and almost incredible aes - thetic refinements .

		In a people fundamentally inartistic , like our own , the result of this swing toward the mob would have been a crude vulgar - ization .

		In the Japanese , it resulted in such a rendering of the passing world of everyday vigorous life which is what the word '' Ukiyo '' means as still charms us with an immortal vitality and beauty .

		One of the channels , and in certain ways the most interesting one , into which the life-stream of this popular school flowed was that of the color-print .

		Mr.
Gookin	PERSON	dates the production of the first color-print as the year
1742	DATE	, and attributes the invention of it to
Okumura Masanobu	PERSON	.

		This is debatable ground ; but on the debates we need not linger .

		Certain it is that from about this time on , year by year , and under many hands , the resources of the art expanded ; until by
1765	DATE	, in the work of
Harunobu	LOCATION	, practically all the possibilities of the technique had been realized .

		From then to the
last decade of the century	DATE	, the great period bloomed into amazing luxuriance ; until , when the brush fell from the hands of the supreme master
Kiyonaga	LOCATION	, there began that decline which , passing through intermediate stages of such hauntingly lovely decadence , was to lead to the point where the art died a dreadful death of coarseness , commonplaceness , and hideousness in the
second quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		After this , it came to life only once , for a brief renaissance in the hands of
Hiroshige	LOCATION	, the peer - less master of landscape ; and died again forever , with him , in
1858	DATE	.

		To avoid confusion , it may be pointed out in passing that the word '' Ukiyoe '' is the identical term which most writers , including Mr.
Gookin	PERSON	himself in his preface to
Fenollosa	PERSON	's monumental catalogue of
1896	DATE	, spell `` Ukioye , '' and that `` Eishi '' is the same person who has been gen - erally known as `` Yeishi . ''

		On the principle that the latest dicta of a prophet are the best , we follow the author 's change of opinion in this matter .

		The wide first-hand experience and sound dis - criminative judgments that are at Mr.
Gookin	PERSON	's command in his review of Ukiyoe history make it easily the best brief account in existence .

		His description of the technique of color-printing is , also , more illuminating than that of any of his predecessors .

		Von
Seidlitz	PERSON	's volume still re - mains the most comprehensive survey of the field ; but if one wished to give a layman a true and expressive picture of this region , and an alluring glimpse at the prints themselves in their authentic color , one would certainly choose this book as one 's medium .

		For the more experi - enced student , so brief a book is bound to have gaps that arouse regret .

		When so vast a field is to be covered , omissions are unavoidable ; and probably no two people would agree as to what could most properly be omitted .

		One may therefore legitimately and pleasantly quarrel with Mr.
Gookin	PERSON	for his decision to ignore such artists as
Shunman	PERSON	, the inventor of never - equaled harmonies in gray ; Toyohiro , whose aristocratic delicacy of design frequently takes him into a world which his more famous and more productive master
Toyokuni	ORGANIZATION	was never privileged to enter ; and
Kitao Masanobu	PERSON	, a creator of noble figures touched sometimes with a rare visionary quality that even the great Kiyonaga seems in certain moods to lack .

		But these are small quarrels , after all ; and the omis - sions are fully accounted for by the necessity of compressing the material into a one-hour 's lee - 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	ture , for delivery before the
Japan	LOCATION	Society of
New York	LOCATION	.

		Further , one finds compensation in the fact that the book contains no allusion whatsoever to
Kunisada	LOCATION	,
Kikumaro	PERSON	,
Yeizan	PERSON	,
Kuniyasu	PERSON	,
Shunsen	PERSON	, and all that heterogeneous horde whose works defiled the
second half of the nineteenth century	DATE	, and whose histories encum - ber the pages of too many previous treatises .

		But on the other hand , one could wish that the author had faced a little more squarely the difficult , perhaps impossible , task of defining in words those elements of beauty in the prints which , though they make so sharp an appeal to the eye of the expert , are not always so obvious to the layman .

		One regrets a little that the author has not told us frankly what these prints mean to him , and disclosed to us his diagnosis of the springs of their enchantment .

		But per - haps the day has not yet come for such an inter - pretation .

		Certainly no writer has yet appeared to do for these artists what
Walter Pater	PERSON	did for
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	,
Leonardo	LOCATION	, and
Watteau	ORGANIZATION	, positively enriching with his own perception of beauty the paintings of which he writes , and opening to a wider public the secret byways of a subtle and sensitive mind 's aesthetic experience in the country of loveliness .

		It will perhaps be said that these prints have a less definite spirit - ual content , and lend themselves less readily to such explorations .

		But I believe this is not true : the spiritual content may be more nebulous here , more implicit in line and mass and color , and less concerned with the subject treated ; but it exists , otherwise this would not be art .

		And to define it must be the ultimate aim of criticism .

		Toward such an expression , all pre - liminary work in this field must lead ; and even so finely expressive a book as the one before us will probably find its place ultimately with the treatises which , by sound scholarship and criti - cal justness , prepare the way for that spiritual interpretation of these designs which must some day be written .

		Or is this the biased view of a mere writer , of one who subconsciously wishes to reduce all the arts to the terms of the one he understands best ?

		Perhaps a painter would doubt the need , the value , the possibility of any such verbal rendering of another art .

		And yet one can not refrain from hoping that some day Mr.
Gookin	PERSON	will devote his rare equipment to the service of such a task .

		There are implica - tions in his writings leading one to conjecture that perhaps he already projects such an attempt .

		At any rate , the Japanese print itself has come to take a high and permanent place in the world of western aesthetic experience .

		As we look at such works , their very unfamiliarity of subject sets us free from our habitual preoccu - pation with mere theme , which is so great a curse to us in our approach to our own art .

		Where all is strange , and no sentimentality or interest of association enters to corrupt our feeling , we may see as in a vacuum , so to speak , the pure elements of artistic creation liberated from combination with elements of accidental and personal charm .

		For this reason , if for no other , the prints have a unique value to students of the fundamental principles of design .

		The finest specimens open to us new vistas of delight ; and even the poorest examples , if they date from the great period , have something to teach the westerner .

		But , as Mr.
Gookin	PERSON	points out , the student primarily needs such familiarity with the rare works of the golden age as will lead him to turn quickly aside from the crude pro- ducts of an extreme later decadence and the miserable late impressions made in vast numbers from the worn-out blocks of
Hiroshige	LOCATION	.

		Such repulsive prints are very common , and constitute , in the minds of most people , the whole body of Japanese art .

		Small wonder that these people look upon the collector as a queer faddist who finds beauty in discord and deformity !

		But anyone who desires to retain this unfortunate illusion should be wary enough not to look into Mr.
Gookin	PERSON	's volume .

		GEORGE ELIOT 'S INNER LIFE .

		* A little work of distinct importance for gen - eral readers of
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	comes to us from
England	LOCATION	in humble guise .

		Says Professor
C. H. Herford	PERSON	in his introductory note : `` A book which is wholly occupied with the obscure pre - paratory years of a great writer , which closes with her first signal triumph , and ignores almost wholly the salient events of her later career , may appear to be a case of biography truncated , and truncated at the more interesting end .

		Yet to the student of literary origins , '' he adds , `` the limited aim and scope of this essay will hardly need justification . ''

		Professor
Herford	PERSON	seems to have in mind not so much the actual content of the work as its somewhat unfortunate title .

		`` Early Life '' does indeed suggest a narrow scope and large emphasis on '' literary origins . ''

		But the book turns out to *
THK	ORGANIZATION	EARLY LIFE OF GEORGE ELIOT .

		By
Mary H. Deakin	PERSON	,
M.A. Manchester	PERSON	: At
the University Press	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 51 be a very good presentation of
George Eliot	PERSON	's whole personality .

		It covers the first forty years of her life , and indicates , at the same time , the very few developments of any import - ance which occurred later .

		One wonders just what `` salient events of her later career '' -LRB- that is , the last twenty years of her life -RRB- Professor
Herford	PERSON	had in mind assuming that salient events , in the case of an author , are those which either strongly illuminate his nature or affect him so nearly as to have an important result for his writings .

		Events of this quality , in
George Eliot	PERSON	's case , were chiefly antecedent to `` her first signal tri - umph , '' ``
Adam Bede	PERSON	'' they were , indeed , the means of making that triumph possible .

		They are comprised , very roughly speaking , within three periods : first , the initial twenty years of quiet country life , during which the girl 's mind was unconsciously accumulating the material of future novels ; then the decade spent in the town of
Coventry	LOCATION	, with its congenial and liber - ating influences ; and finally , the early period of literary activity in
London	LOCATION	, which brought to bear on
Marian Evans	PERSON	those external stimuli chief among them the affectionate appreciation of
G. H. Lewes	PERSON	so necessary to stir into full activity her hesitant genius for narrative .

		When
George Eliot	PERSON	finished ``
Adam Bede	PERSON	, '' she practically completed also her own inner development as an artist .

		By limiting itself to that development ,
Miss Deakin	PERSON	's book finds a place of its own between such sketchy biogra - phies of
George Eliot	PERSON	as Miss Blind 's and
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's on the one hand , and on the other hand
Cross	ORGANIZATION	's Life and Letters with its dreary tracts of lifeless details .

		Within her chosen field , moreover ,
Miss Deakin	PERSON	is guided by an exceptionally sympa - thetic insight into her author 's spiritual life .

		This sets her free from what may be called the '' intellectual fallacy '' in regard to
George Eliot	PERSON	. ''

		This woman author , '' remarks one who knew the late Professor
Dowden	PERSON	in student days , `` this woman author , with her chilly east wind of science and agnosticism , was a wintry frost to all of us , in those far-away days . ''

		* And as late as
1909	DATE	, Professor
Hugh Walker	PERSON	pronounces that ''
George Eliot	PERSON	sat upon a solitary throne which few cared to approach , '' a somewhat strange statement considering the large sale of her books .

		The fact is that the mass of general readers , undiscriminatingly viewing
George Eliot	PERSON	's art in toto , found her faults fairly easy to digest .

		Not so the critical .

		The generation * See THE DIAL ,
May 16 , 1913	DATE	, p. 405 .

		of critics and biographers a little later than
Dowden	PERSON	's was sufficiently liberated from
Vic	PERSON	- torian romanticism to feel the essential warmth of
George Eliot	PERSON	's view of life ; but not suffi - ciently to make due allowance for the over - intellectuality of her art .

		This fault of hers the unfortunate corollary of an intellectual quietude and precision recalling classic art and largely foreign to the age was harder to accept than
Dickens	PERSON	's sentimentality and
Thackeray	PERSON	's gossipy chatter , especially since it was not easy to reconcile with the sex of '' this woman au - thor . ''

		Consequently the centre of her art and individuality , essentially feminine as it is , was somewhat obscured .

		Now ,
Miss Deakin	PERSON	obviously belongs to a generation which has been considerably influ - enced by
George Meredith	PERSON	; to whom , she re - marks ,
George Eliot	PERSON	is closely akin , '' especially in her wide , human , understanding sympathy , and her mental attitude toward life . ''

		And it is apparent throughout the book that
Miss Deakin	PERSON	is an admirer of her author 's `` this-worldliness . ''

		As a result she is inclined to over-estimate
George Eliot	PERSON	's art , when this comes into ques - tion .

		But on the whole she avoids the critical standpoint , and keeps to her aim of dealing with the novelist 's works only in so far as they illu - minate her personality .

		And here
Miss Deakin	PERSON	's sympathy is of value .

		It enables her to escape the usual over-emphasis on
George Eliot	PERSON	's in - tellect , and to hold fairly firmly to what was central in her personality .

		This is especially evident in the writer 's treatment of that most interesting phase of
George Eliot	PERSON	's emotional development : her relinquishment of Calvinistic evangelicalism , and adoption , while at
Coventry	ORGANIZATION	, of a positivistic view of life .

		Miss
Deakin	PERSON	's achievement , then , has been to make clearer than before the harmony of
George Eliot	PERSON	's emotional and intellectual life .

		One wishes , however , that she had developed this subject more fully and explicitly ; she misses a number of excellent opportunities for doing so , as if unconscious of her mission .

		Further - more , her book presents several misinterpreta - tions ; and the style is faulty .

		These several defects , however , seem to the present reviewer venial in comparison with the shortcomings characteristic of the majority of minor biogra - phies which have been appearing during the past two decades generally in connection with some series or other .

		The writers of these little books apply to their material no other principle of selection , seemingly , than that of setting down whatever items , of a biographical or critical 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	nature , happen to pop into their minds .

		Un - less , as infrequently happens , the biographer 's own personality is of sufficient import to lend a continuous interest to his work , such a method is sterile , peculiarly so when applied to the majority of nineteenth century authors , whose lives were on the whole lacking in external inter - est , and demand a treatment radically different from the impressionistic and anecdotal .

		Fortu - nately this need is beginning to be perceived .

		A trend toward a more centripetal treatment has made its appearance .

		At length , affected , perhaps , by the predominant scientific attitude of mind , several minor biographers have shown signs of willingness to go through the mental labor necessary to discover the essential beneath the purely external and commonplace .

		Such an aim naturally leads to the placing of greater stress on the earlier lives of nineteenth century authors .

		In extreme cases , like those of Words - worth and
George Eliot	PERSON	, where almost nothing of inner significance occurs in the author 's later years , these may well be almost entirely ignored .


M. Legouis	PERSON	's `` La Jeunesse de
Wordsworth	PERSON	, ''
1896	DATE	, represents what may almost be designated a new literary genre .

		Miss
Deakin	PERSON	's book is a humbler representative of the same general type .

		It evinces , even though imperfectly , the three essentials which this variety of work must possess if it is to be as attractive , and as successful , as the best biographies of the more Boswellian type : keen and comprehensive study of all available materials ; deliberate concision ; psychological understanding of personality , attended with complete sympathy for the author under con - sideration .

		they might have had as much to say as our moderns , did not take up as much room to say it in .

		Many recent poets for instance have written as much as the combined work of Homer ,
Virgil	PERSON	,
Lucretius	PERSON	,
Pindar	ORGANIZATION	,
Horace	PERSON	, and Catullus .

		We can not rely on an Omar coming along to burn our libraries ; and as our authors will not themselves do anything to reduce their super - fluous avoirdupois , the business will have to be attended to for them .

		A beginning was made by
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	when he compressed
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	each into a small volume .

		He was successful with the first , whose work is easily divisible into good and bad ; but
Byron	PERSON	, who is always
Byron	PERSON	, can not be really represented by single pieces or extracts .


Richardson	PERSON	's interminable epic of sentiment , ''
Clarissa Harlowe	PERSON	, '' has also been condensed ; but it is more tolerable with all its original embonpoint than in the skeletonized presentment .

		But the largest effort which has been made to put English classics into limitation and con - fine is `` The Regent Library , '' some fourteen volumes of which have been issued , with more in preparation .

		The plan of this publication consists in giving the best short pieces or specimen extracts from the respective authors , with requisite apparatus of biographical and critical introductions , notes , testimonials and bibliographical appendices .

		As far as the three poets now included
Cowper	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and
Shelley	PERSON	are concerned , the result is all that could be desired .

		Practically everything is given of these writers which anyone save a professed student or a special enthusiast really needs .

		More than that , by the separation of their grain from their chaff these poets gain in value and efficacy .

		In
Cowper	PERSON	's case it may be noted that a very few pages suffice to contain the poetry which time has winnowed from his mass , and that the greater part of the book is given up to his letters , ``
Cowper	PERSON	's divine chit-chat . ''

		In regard to the essayists , also , we think the method of this set of reprints fully justifies itself .

		As much of
Johnson	PERSON	, the writer , is given as most human beings will want to read ; the far more important
Johnson	PERSON	, the talker , being always accessible in
Boswell	LOCATION	.

		The introduction to this volume is in Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's best style , a style which makes so many hits and yet so little impression .

		The volume devoted to
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	gives the finest wine of that exhilarating spirit , though the criticisms from `` Imagi - nation and Fancy '' can hardly be appreciated
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 53 without the poetry which they accompany and interpret .

		It was a good idea of the editor 's to include
Mary Wollstonecraft	PERSON	in the series .

		The quite full reproduction of the `` Rights of Woman '' of this pioneer of the woman cause ought to be of special interest to-day .

		The introduction is an admirable brief biography , and its enthusiasm for
Mary Wollstonecraft	PERSON	's noble character is borne out by her letters .

		Perhaps no English author needs a popularizing volume of this kind more than
Thomas Love Peacock	PERSON	.

		He can hardly be said to be hidden in excess of light ; but his fulness of thought , and his odd turn of wit , humor , and satire , have kept him from having any vogue .

		In regard to the novelists included in the
Library Richardson	LOCATION	,
Jane Austen	PERSON	, Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	,
Dickens	LOCATION	, we are more in doubt as to the value of the volumes .

		The art of novel writing is largely the art of dilution , and a glass of sea water does not become more con - centrated by being separated from its parent element .

		Extracts can not give the power and completeness of great characters , the building up of which is the novelists ' most triumphant work .

		Even so , however , such specimens are better than critical disquisitions or studies which fill a reader 's mind with second-hand impressions of authors of whom perhaps he may not have read a page in the original books .

		Such specimens may at least give him a taste , a flavor , which is keen in its kind , and which may lead him on to a full repast .

		The Library only goes afield for one volume , a partial reproduction of Charles Cotton 's trans - lation of the Commentaries of
Blaise de Monluc	PERSON	, sometime
Marechal	PERSON	of
France	LOCATION	.

		This is a fine record of fighting and adventure by a precursor of
D'Artagnan	LOCATION	, whose life had more of real war - fare in it and less of swaggering than that of
Dumas	PERSON	's hero .

		It seems to us that it would be an excellent thing if the projectors of this series were to extend its scope and let us have in translation volumes of specimens of many modern conti - nental authors .

		Lessing ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Heine	LOCATION	, Hugo , De Musset ,
Lamartine	LOCATION	,
Manzoni	PERSON	,
Leopardi	LOCATION	,
Carducci	PERSON	, and a score of others could thus be brought within the horizon of multitudes of English and American readers to whom in their own languages or in bulky translations they are sealed books .

		But there is still plenty of work to be done at home .

		Two English authors ,
Burns	PERSON	and
Cole	PERSON	- ridge , who are not included in the prospectus of the
Regent Library	ORGANIZATION	, would seem especially in need of its methods .

		Out of
Burns	PERSON	's three hundred pieces , long and short , not more than forty-five or fifty are of great value , have the stamp of immortality .

		It would be a service to him to separate these from the mass of mediocre verse and failures .

		Coleridge 's four or five best pieces are the most quintessential poetry in the language .

		There are a few other lyrics , three odes , and a number of translated passages which might go with these .

		His great criticism is already a chaos of fragments so it would be no sacrilege to select the best of it to make up a volume .

		The volumes of '' The Regent Library '' are well printed , of convenient and compact form , and sold at a very moderate price .

		Each volume contains a photogravure portrait .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Twilight j n the course of the last decade THE stretches T \ i r ^ i i in Greek DIAL has frequently commented upon religion .

		the historical and ethical significance of Greek religion , and upon the important develop - ments following the application of the methods and results of anthropology to the available material in that field .

		The day when the scholar settled the problems of Hellenic religious customs and feeling by referring only to the great authors of antiquity is definitely past ; and the twentieth century student is quite as likely to appeal to a Central Australian tabu as to a passage from ^ Eschylus .

		This tendency is seen very instructively in Professor
Gilbert Mur	PERSON	- ray 's '' Four Stages of Greek Religion '' -LRB-
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The brilliant author , as every - one knows , is a literatus of the literati , and he him - self still distinguishes in his preface between '' the anthropologist '' and '' the scholar '' ; but he has wel - comed the new light most heartily , and two of the main divisions of the volume depend very largely upon conceptions and postulates outside the old lit - erary range .

		Professor
Murray	PERSON	takes up first the primitive beginnings of religion in
Greece	LOCATION	, the Age of Ignorance ; secondly , the Olympian , or classical stage ; thirdly , the Hellenistic period , the `` Failure of Nerve '' ; and fourthly , the final pagan reaction in the time of Julian .

		In its treatment '' the book avoids the great illuminated places , and gives its mind to the stretches of intervening twilight . ''

		It is delightfully clear and intelligible , as well as pro- vocatively suggestive , and will amply repay thought - ful perusal .

		In the first two sections a reviewer could stir a quarrel on almost any page , particu - larly where conclusions are cheerfully based upon the author 's well-known theories about Homeric problems .

		Nothing could be more irritating to a disputant who can not share Professor
Murray	PERSON	's 54 THE DIAL confidence in their validity .

		However , these and all other differences are merely incidents of progress in a difficult subject , `` which is still changing and showing new facets year by year . ''

		In the third and fourth divisions the conditions of judgment are more stable , and the conclusions proportionately less con - trovertible .

		It was a most happy thought to include , as an authoritative statement of pagan doctrine in the
fourth century	DATE	, a translation of the little-known work of Sallustius , '' On the Gods and the World . ''

		The studies are written in the graceful English one associates with Professor
Murray	PERSON	's name , although in a few instances a sensitive ear will feel that facility of presentation has lapsed into carelessness .

		The working , '' The .

		Governments of
Europe	LOCATION	'' is of European the title of an interesting and in - aovernments .

		forming volume by Prof.
Frederic Austin Ogg	PERSON	of
Simmons College	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		It is the object of this book to promote the intelligent study of government by supplying working descriptions of the governmental systems of the various countries of western and
central Europe	LOCATION	as they have taken form and as they operate at the present day . ''

		It was the author 's intention to include all the European governments , but lack of space forced him to omit those of
Russia	LOCATION	,
Turkey	LOCATION	, and the
Balkan States	LOCATION	.

		Much has been written on Professor
Ogg	PERSON	's subject in recent years , but his work has certain character - istics that entitle it to a place in the literature of political science : it is historical as well as descrip - tive , and discusses forces as well as forms .

		Except in the case of the English government , the author has not found it necessary to sketch an extensive historical background , as nearly all the constitutions of modern
Europe	LOCATION	have seen the light since
1815	DATE	; still , he is careful in every case to trace the genesis of the prevailing system .

		Some attention is also given to governmental forces as organized in political parties .

		Most of the space is given to the central institutions , but local government is not neglected , though it must be said that this phase of the subject shows less skilful treatment .

		The discussion has been brought down to date on every subject : the book gives satisfactory accounts of the constitution of
Bosnia-Herzegovina	LOCATION	-LRB-
1910	DATE	-RRB- , of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	-LRB-
1911	DATE	-RRB- , of the republican constitution of
Portugal	LOCATION	-LRB-
1911	DATE	-RRB- , of the last English Parliament Act -LRB-
1911	DATE	-RRB- , and of the newer political issues that have disturbed European politics during the last few years .

		Though primarily intended for text-book purposes , Professor
Ogg	PERSON	's book will also prove serviceable for the general reader who wishes clear and concise accounts of how government is administered in the European states .

Hertford Houe	ORGANIZATION	.

		published by
L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	there is added a handsome volume entitled '' The Art of the
Wallace Collection	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Henry C. Shelley	PERSON	.

		It is now thirteen years since
Hertford House	ORGANIZATION	, where the late Sir
Richard Wallace	PERSON	gathered his matchless examples of French , Dutch , Flemish , and British art , was opened to the world as a public museum maintained by the English government in accordance with the terms of Lady
Wallace	PERSON	's will ; but no such popularly useful and interesting account of its treasures in painting , sculpture , furniture , arms , and armor as Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	has at last prepared has hitherto been available .

		His book opens with a short preface , then sketches the history of the
Wallace	PERSON	collection , with some account of
Lord Hertford	ORGANIZATION	, by whom was bequeathed to
Richard Wallace	PERSON	what was to constitute the best part of the now famous art treasures bearing the legatee 's name , and then pro- ceeds to describe the more remarkable features of the collection as they are to be seen in the various galleries of the museum .

		Illustrations from photo - graphs , forty-eight in number , help to call attention to what is most noteworthy ; and the book is well indexed at the end .

		A former keeper of the collec - tion , Sir
Claude Phillips	PERSON	, has very recently called attention , in the
London	LOCATION	`` Telegraph , '' to its peculiar importance and value .

		He says : '' If the French art of the eighteenth century is now much better known in
England	LOCATION	than it was a few years ago , the reason is that the
Wallace	PERSON	collection has permanently brought under the eyes of connoisseurs and the public much that is finest in the painting and sculpture , as well as the applied art , of that period . ''

		He also declares that
Watteau	PERSON	's art is here '' illustrated on a larger scale and in greater variety and brilliancy than in any gallery , public or private , save only those of the
Louvre	LOCATION	and of the palaces of
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Pottsdam	LOCATION	. ''

		Hence it is that one might reason - ably have expected in Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	's book a more marked emphasis on the Watteau feature of the collection , and more than his one illustration from that artist .

		But the volume is carefully prepared , shows the courage of the writer 's preferences , and is interesting .

		It is a hard saying , but much of the The story of a trouble in the civilized world to-day working woman .

		- , , , r rests upon ignorance of the condi - tions prevailing outside of the economic class to which each of us is assigned .

		The poor are ignor - ant of the grace and ease of living among the wealthy and refined , or by their very numbers they would make extravagances and excesses impossible ; the rich and cultivated are no less ignorant of the degradation involved in utter poverty , or merely for humanity 's sake they would take steps to alleviate it .

		Few in the community know the whole truth about both the classes which may be roughly grouped as '' poor '' or '' rich , '' and it is significant that those who do are largely devoting their lives to an ameli - oration of existing conditions .

		No better basis for imagining what it is that the very poor have to con - tend with , hour by hour , can be found than '' The Autobiography of a Working Woman '' -LRB-

August Bebel	PERSON	and

M.P.	LOCATION	.

		It is the story of the life of Mrs.
Adelheid Popp	PERSON	, a leader among German socialists , covering her entire memory of life until she found herself through sheer force of character in her present commanding position .

		Throughout her girlhood she was very poor .

		Her father drank himself into an early grave , leaving his family desti - tute of everything except the tender compassion of those no better off than themselves that wonderful charity of the poor toward one another , by which the rich , if they could realize it , would be shamed .

		Little by little , chiefly through an engrossing love for reading , the girl lifted herself intellectually out of the ignorance and superstition to which she was born .

		Socialism , chiefly in the form of benefiting mankind , took the place of her old religion , and by its ideals she shaped a new life .

		She married within the socialistic ranks and found there all her happi - ness , using the inspiration it gave her to elevate those still in the stratum from which she had extricated herself .

		The book shows no dogmatism and presents no minute facts which might tire a casual reader , but it is instinct with truth , and it presents that bitter sordidness which has been the destruction of count - less souls less strong than that unconsciously depicted by its author .

Atlantic	LOCATION	shore line was reached , and once , in

		A good map is provided , as also an appendix packed with statistical and other useful matter in condensed form .

		From his chapter on
Costa Rica	LOCATION	's capital , we quote in closing this bit of information concerning an institution one might not have expected to find in that little tropical city : `` The
Biblioteca Nacional	ORGANIZATION	, or public library , with about 50,000 volumes well housed , represents the literary side of life better than might be expected in an isolated land of 350,000 inhabitants .

Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is based upon the same author 's elaborate work , `` The Records of the
Federal Convention	ORGANIZATION	, '' already reviewed at length in the columns of THE DIAL .

		The `` Records , '' largely concerned with matters of textual criticism , made its appeal to the technical student ; `` The Framing of the Constitution '' is a summary of the impressions of the
Federal Convention	ORGANIZATION	derived by the author from his ten years ' labor in this special field of American history , and is intended for popular consumption .

		It is an example of what such a work ought to be ; for while the narrative is made simple , and references are omitted , the book is the result of a scholarly investigation , and in every page meets the tests of criticism .

		In this respect it con - trasts interestingly with the corresponding chapters in
Fiske	PERSON	's '' Critical Period , '' which present , for the most part , an interesting decoction of
Bancroft	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Farrand	PERSON	treats of the defects of the Confederation , the calling of the

Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, was one of the most interesting , most important , and unique characters of English history in the nineteenth cen - tury .

		He is now remembered chiefly as the orig - inator of certain very useful literary ventures , such as the Parliamentary History , the
State Trials	ORGANIZATION	, and the Political Register .

		But in his own day he was prominent as an opposition journalist , as a political pamphleteer of the radical type .

		Cobbett has re - cently found an enthusiastic biographer in Mr.
Lewis Melville	PERSON	, who has published his studies in the life and times of the great radical leader in two volumes under the title `` The Life and Letters of William 56 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	Cobbett in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		There have been earlier sketches of
Cobbett	PERSON	's life , but no one has hitherto attempted so complete a study as the one undertaken by Mr.
Melville	PERSON	.

		The author has had access to a great deal of unpublished material , chiefly letters , many of which have been embodied in the work .

		The volumes are not a biog - raphy as the term is usually understood : they are a collection of letters , with occasional pages of narra - tive where the documents fail to tell a clear or con - nected story .

		Mr.
Melville	PERSON	is an admirer of
William Cobbett	PERSON	, but his admiration has not left him blind to the defects of
Cobbett	PERSON	's character : proper emphasis is placed on his abilities and achievements , but no attempt is made to conceal his inordinate egotism or to justify his crude and violent methods .

		The au - thor has successfully avoided the appearance of par - tisanship and the temptation to act as an advocate .

		His work , however , will be of only slight interest to the general reader ; but the serious student of En - glish history will find it of great value for the light that the documents throw on the early history of British radicalism .

		Earnest essavs No other of .

		our latter-day essayists on serious approaches in combined incisiveness themes .

		an -LRB- j ponderosity Mr.
Francis Grier	PERSON	- son , whose latest volume , `` The Invincible Alliance and Other Essays '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , has just appeared .

		His style is at once a keen rapier and a crushing sabre , and he brandishes his dangerous weapon with mag - nificent assurance . ''

		It requires Anglo-maniacal ef - frontery to broach the subject of disarmament when dealing with a people like the Germans .

		Whence comes this effrontery ? ''

		The old dispensation , hav - ing survived six hundred years , he says elsewhere , is at an end , and we are at the threshold of a new civilization : `` Conditions will change to such a de - gree that in nothing will the coming dispensation resemble anything in the old . ''

		Again , `` To-day nothing but a hatch separates us from primitive barbarism . ''

		In subject , the essays range from `` Republic or Empire ? ''

		and `` Savonarola '' to `` The Psychology of Dress '' and `` The Soul 's New Refuge . ''

		All are serious in treatment , for the author is terribly in earnest even when his tone is bantering .

		Indeed , his pronunciamentos , though they indicate wide knowledge and observation and an active mind , too often suggest grimness and in - flexibility .

		Yet these very qualities have their value : Mr.
Grierson	PERSON	awakens the mind , starts long and often new trains of thought , through his unique rapier and sabre attack .

		Addresses Mr.
James Bryce	PERSON	's retirement to of an English .

		country after acting as its official representative at
Washington	LOCATION	for the last six years give especial interest and weight to the volume of public utterances `` University and Historical Ad - dresses '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which he has published as embodying the treatment of topics having an im - portance that is more than ephemeral .

		Twenty-two out of a far larger number of discourses delivered in
America	LOCATION	between
1907	DATE	and
1912	DATE	are thus repro - duced , with some changes , additions , and omissions , from the speaker 's notes .

		Naturally they are in most instances what we call `` occasional '' addresses , addresses commemorative of some historic anni - versary or in celebration of some literary or educa - tional festivity .

		Thus we find , among the more important subjects treated , `` The Beginnings of
Virginia	LOCATION	, '' `` The Landing of the Pilgrims in
1620	DATE	, '' ``
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	: Third President of the
United States	LOCATION	and Founder of the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` The Character and Career of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, '' `` The Study of Ancient Literature , '' `` Some Hints on Reading , '' and `` The Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		What the reader of literary tendencies will most like in the book is the repeated insistence on the importance of the `` humanities '' in all courses of higher education , and the warning against too early or too great specialization .

		Like apples of gold in pictures of silver is this fitly-spoken word .

		An incidental compliment of a high order to our public library system will be found near the begin - ning of the author 's remarks on reading .

		The ad - dresses are all excellent as literature which can not be said of most public speeches , and they preserve much of the charm of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's personality .

		Among the most temperate of re - cent estimates of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is the little volume entitled '' Goethe and the Twentieth Century '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , by Prof.
J. G. Robertson	PERSON	, of
the University of London	ORGANIZATION	.

		A long residence in
Germany	LOCATION	has given Professor
Robertson	PERSON	a genuine German appreciation of his author , yet he can not wholly overcome his native Scotch standards of reason and conduct .

		The little book tempts to much quotation , but it will be fairer to let English readers resort for themselves to so condensed and on the whole so fair a presentation of
Germany	LOCATION	's greatest exemplar .

		Professor
Robertson	PERSON	's argument is , that
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is peculiarly individualistic and there - fore continues to appeal to modern men .

		`` What - ever we may say of the futility , or even shallowness , of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's metaphysics ; however vague and elusive his religious thought may be ; however transient and unjustified by later developments his social and political theories , we have still to say that no thinker of modern times has spoken so wisely and with such finality on the conduct of personal life as Goethe . ''

		To all of which one might easily dissent , to the detraction as well as to the commen - dation .

		But nevertheless , this is a book well worth reading .


Alexander Baumgartner	PERSON	's `` Goethe : Sein Leben und seine Werke '' -LRB-
St. Louis	LOCATION	: Herdersche Verlagshandlung -RRB- is a work that commands respect for the thoroughness of its research and the frank - ness of its attack .

		As an antidote to the deification of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, so common among German critics and historians , it has its proper place .

		It must be said
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 57 that
Baumgartner	PERSON	is not wholly without admiration for the great German pagan , and treats him rather better than
Menzel	PERSON	.

		Perhaps no other biography of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is so coherent , diary-like , and useful for reference .

		The study I n '' The Cotton Manufacturing In - Ame g rican dustry in the
United States	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Har - industrv .

		vard
University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Dr.
Melvin T. Copeland	PERSON	, brings together the results of several years of investigation concerning the growth and present condition of a staple American industry .

		The first part of the study is devoted to the history and present organization of the industry , while in the second part the relative position of the
United States	LOCATION	with reference to other countries is taken up .

		The growth of the industry is traced from the establishment of the first successful cotton mill in this country , in
1790	DATE	, down to the present day , as evidenced by spinning and weaving , the making of lace and smallwares and knit goods .

		Then follow chapters on geographical distribution , technical de - velopment , labor , textile schools , scale of production and specialization , associations and combinations , the raw cotton market , the cloth market , export trade , import trade , and dividends and prices .

		The relative position of the
United States	LOCATION	is brought out by a first-hand study , and by comparison of the industry here with that in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	.

		As to export trade the conclusion is that the competition which American exporters will find most severe is that of the English .

		The study is both scholarly and interesting , and will prove of great value to the student of economic development .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Of especial appeal to American readers among the latest volumes in '' Everyman 's Library '' -LRB- Button -RRB- are
Crevecoeur	PERSON	's `` Letters from an American Farmer , '' with an interesting introduction by Mr.
Warren Barton Blake	PERSON	; and
Robert Buchanan	PERSON	's `` Life and Adventures of Audubon , '' with a reprint of Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	's essay on Audubon by way of preface .

		We trust that these two fascinating records of outdoor life in the early days of
America	LOCATION	may find many thousands of new read - ers in this convenient and inexpensive form .

		Few American publishing enterprises are deserving of such unqualified approval as the ''
Macmillan Stand	ORGANIZATION	- ard Library , '' which is making accessible in substantial and inexpensive form some of the best serious books of recent years .

		Two late additions to the series , typical of its general quality , are Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	's `` New Worlds for Old , '' probably the most lucid and convinc - ing outline of Socialism now available ; and Professor
Mahaffy	PERSON	's well-loved '' Rambles and Studies in
Greece	LOCATION	, '' which although issued nearly forty years ago still holds its own .

		This new edition -LRB- the seventh ^ seems to have been carefully revised , and contains a new preface by the author .

		A pretty little volume of '' Ancient Gems in Modern Settings , '' being versions from the Greek Anthology in English rhymes by various authors , has been compiled by Dr.
G. B. Grundy	PERSON	, and issued by the
Oxford publisher.	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
B. H. Blackwell	PERSON	.

		The compiler has frankly followed his own taste in the matter of the versions selected , and a liberal sprinkling of his own skilful renderings is included .

		The result as a whole is perhaps the most satisfactory presentation of the Anthology now avail - able in English .

		It seems to us that the translators ' names should have been appended to their work ; one does not like to have to refer constantly to a table of contents for information of this sort .

		But we can find no other ground for criticism of what is altogether a charming little book .

		The noteworthy ''
Loeb	PERSON	Classical Library '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , which was described and discussed in detail in our issue of
February 16	DATE	last , is making satisfactory progress .

		Of the later volumes that have reached us , only one belongs to the Latin section , the first of three volumes embodying
Cicero	PERSON	's Letters , in the rendering of Mr.
E. O. Winstedt	PERSON	.

		The Greek books comprise a two-volume Sophocles , translated by Mr.
F. Storr	PERSON	; '' The Greek Bucolic Poets , '' translated by Mr.
J. M. Edmonds	PERSON	; Appian 's Roman History , translated by Dr.
Horace White	PERSON	, in four volumes ; `` The Fall of Troy '' by
Quintus	ORGANIZATION	of
Smyrna	LOCATION	, translated by Dr.
Arthur S. Way	PERSON	; the second and concluding volume of '' The Apostolic Fathers , '' translated by Mr.
Kirsopp Lake	PERSON	; the `` Argo - nautica '' of Apollonius Rhodius , translated by Mr.
R. C. Seaton	PERSON	; and the first of three volumes comprising the Works of the
Emperor Julian	PERSON	, translated by Dr.
Wilmer Cave Wright	PERSON	.

		What libraries to visit in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, when the American librarian takes his vacation abroad , is a ques - tion not unlikely to arise ; and the answer will be found , succinctly given , in '' A British Library Itinerary '' -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
Grafton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
James Duff Brown	PERSON	, Borough Librarian of the
Islington	LOCATION	Free Libraries , pro- lific writer on library science , and initiator of a number of reforms in library administration .

		More than five - score libraries in
England	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, and
Wales	LOCATION	, chosen in such manner as to present all varieties of type with - out needless repetition , are arranged in groups , under such headings as '' Liverpool Centre , '' ''
Manchester Centre	PERSON	, '' ''
Edinburgh Centre	PERSON	, '' ''
London	LOCATION	Centre , '' etc. , with brief descriptions calling especial attention to char - acteristic features .

		The little guide is put forth in response to a demand for some such selective list from American and Colonial librarians , and seems excellently suited to its purpose .


Wilhelm Lamszus	PERSON	's booklet , '' The Human Slaughter - House '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , made its author known in
Germany	LOCATION	partly because of its character , partly also because the government authorities of his district tried to oust him from his teaching position for writing it .

		That he possesses literary power of the hysterical sort is suffi - ciently shown by these pages .

		The thing reminds one of '' The Red Laugh '' of Andreiff .

		The scenes it pictures from '' the war that is sure to come , '' though possible , are none the less imaginary and are not likely to inspire the average man with an aversion to war .

		Lamszus 's thesis , which is further developed in the excellent preface by Mr.
Oakley Williams	PERSON	, is that war is now no more a conflict between persons , and can no longer claim the benefits which are alleged to proceed from such conflicts ; it is to-day a conflict waged by machinery .

		The machine gun delivers wounded and dead men as another machine turns out buttons in a factory .

		All that is needed , thinks Lamszns , is some mechanical 58 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	device to bury the victims .

		It seems analogous to an Armour or Swift plant , hence the title , '' The Human Slaugh ter-House . ''

		The first volume of the
Truxton Beale Prize Essays	ORGANIZATION	, published by
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	, deals with
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's What Shall We Do Then ? ''

		It is not only notable as a most interesting departure in university publications and university incentives to thought , but the subject of the essays and the manner of treatment speak well for the social idealism which is permeating American university circles .

		The first essay in this col - lection of five is by Mr.
Bayard Hale Jones	PERSON	, and exhibits the social teachings of Tolstoy in relation to his personal experiences and the almost mediaeval state of the coun - try whose problems gave birth to
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's social ideal - ism .

		The second essay , by Mr.
Sheldon Warren Cheney	PERSON	, contains an interpretation and a critical application of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's ideas to the present-day social situation .

		The testimony of these and the other essayists whose work is included in the volume is a remarkable one to the suggestive as well as the inspirational value of
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		The translator is

		Coincident with the publication by Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	of the second volume of
Hauptmann	PERSON	's Dramas in En - glish , comes the news that '' political and intellectual
Germany	LOCATION	has not for years been so torn asunder as at the present moment over the action of the city of Breslau in banning
Gerhart Hauptmann	PERSON	's epic cen - tenary drama on the ground of its alleged unpatriotic tendencies , '' to quote a special despatch to the

		The despatch goes on to state that the play was taken off at the instance of the Crown Prince , and that the country '' is fairly divided into
Hauptmann	PERSON	and anti-Hauptmanu camps . ''

		Their charges and counter-charges fill the press , dominate private conver - sation , and are so all-pervasive that they have already obliterated the jubilee memories .

July 16 , 1913	DATE	LORD
MACAULAY England	LOCATION	's Greatest Historian , said in the
Edinburgh	LOCATION	Review `` When I devour the pregnant pages of
Ainsworth	PERSON	I am lost in amazement that his wonderful historical novels have not an abiding place in every house .

		A dabbler in history myself , I can fully appreciate the charm which his romantic style imparts to an often dry subject .

		His close adherence to established facts woven together in such attractive form renders his series of romances indis - pensable in the family circle .

		He always charms , but never misleads . ''


Ainsworth	PERSON	has done for English history what
Dumas	PERSON	pere did for the French : both wrote romances , interwoven with history , in such a way that they occupy the foremost place as historical romances in the literary annals of these countries .


Ainsworth	PERSON	spun his web of fiction about the courts of
Windsor	LOCATION	,
St. James	LOCATION	, the
Louvre	LOCATION	, and the Escorial , and he is never so happy as when picturing
Charles II	PERSON	and his madcap court at
Whitehall	ORGANIZATION	, his witty sayings and his galaxy of beauties , the piquant
Louise de Queroualle	PERSON	, the dazzling duchesses , poor bewitching
Nelly	PERSON	, and , large as life , Sir
Peter Lely	PERSON	a-painting of them .

		The gay court at
Paris	LOCATION	is shown at its most interesting period ;
Crichton	PERSON	, the Admirable , was a brilliant Scotsman , whose handsome person , accomplishments , and courage , earned for him that title .

		The scene is laid during the time of Catherine de '
Medici	PERSON	, and is full of the intrigues of
Henry III	PERSON	, the incognito adventures of ban
Henri of Navarre	ORGANIZATION	.

		Probably no more graphic accounts have ever been written of the Plague of
London	LOCATION	and of the Great Fire than those in `` Old Saint
Paul	PERSON	's , '' and few historical works contain the equal of the descriptive writing in `` Cardinal Pole , '' `` The Constable of the Tower , '' or `` The Star Chamber . ''

		In `` John Law '' is given an extraordinary interesting account of the
Mississippi Bubble	LOCATION	and of the varied career of the great promoter .

		To
Ainsworth	PERSON	's skill and energy we are indebted for brilliant pictures of the Tower of
London	LOCATION	,
Theobald	ORGANIZATION	's ,
Tower Hill	ORGANIZATION	,
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	,
Ranleigh Gardens	PERSON	, etc. , which he peopled with realistic portraits of the most interesting characters in English history of
Henry VIII	PERSON	, his wives , daughters , cardinals , and headsmen ; of
Queen Anne	PERSON	, of the
Duchess Sarah	PERSON	, and her Duke of
Marlborough	LOCATION	; of the Lord Mayor of
London	LOCATION	and his ` prentice-town ; etc. ,
Ainsworth	PERSON	, born in
1805	DATE	, carried on the work in historical romance ended by the death of
Scott	PERSON	.

		With
Ainsworth	PERSON	's death , in
1882	DATE	, there was sundered the last of the chain of a brilliant coterie of English novelists of the nineteenth century :
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Ainsworth	PERSON	.

		As an example of the fascinating and intensely interesting quality of these writings , there will be sent , upon receipt of request , absolutely without charge , a booklet apropos of

		92 ROBERT BRIDGES , POET LAUREATE .

		Two months ago , speaking of the English poets upon whose brows the laurel might con - ceivably be set , we referred to Dr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	as one living apart '' in a world of his own creation , '' and therefore probably to be passed by in favor of someone more likely to be adjudged fit for the laureateship in its patri - otic or ceremonial aspect .

		So high a concep - tion of the office as would be embodied in the appointment of Dr. Bridges we had not thought likely to be entertained by the existing English government , intensely preoccupied as it is with the very practical work of destroying the foun - dations of the English constitution , and setting the ship of state adrift upon uncharted perilous seas , .

		We had not taken sufficient account of the fact that Mr.
Asquith	PERSON	is a gentleman of culture and refined judgment , besides being a statesman committed by circumstance to a detestable political policy , and so we were sur - prised as well as delighted when it became known that he had made so admirable a choice .

		For it is the simple truth that no English poet now living carries on the great tradition of En - glish song , as previously upheld by
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	, with a finer sense of the poet 's mission in a blatant age than does this modest man of science and accomplished classical scholar .

		We call him `` Dr. Bridges '' because it is only courteous to give a man the title to which professional distinction entitles him .

		For this there is honorable literary precedent in the cases of Dr.
Thomas Browne	PERSON	and Dr.
Samuel John	PERSON	- son , of Dr.
Oliver Wendell Holmes	PERSON	and Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	.

		We notice , however , that cer - tain recent comment has used the title of Dr. Bridges for purposes of malicious emphasis , and as indicative of a sort of veiled resentment of the choice of a poet so little known to the average reader , and so serenely unconcerned with the issues upon which a poet , to secure popularity , must now make his appeal to the general public .

		For the new laureate is neither spectacular nor freakish ; he does not beat the big drum of the jingo , nor does he seek to make capital out of whatever form of sentimentalism happens to be 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	current .

		He is not a poet of imperialism or of democracy ; he is neither a society poet nor a slum poet ; he is simply an artist whose guiding spirit is sestheticism and whose work is con - ceived sub specie teternitatis .

		He writes of the enduring themes in the enduring manner , which of course invites the attack of horny-eyed phil - istines everywhere , and earns him the titles of old fogy and conservative and exploiter of old - world themes in outworn forms of expression .

		The philistine view of his appointment is voiced in such a paragraph as this , taken from a recent
Chicago	LOCATION	newspaper : '' Had Mr. Bridges been able to cast in his lot with the daring young poets who assail society in behalf of the under men , who argue for new forms of pageantry in which the beaten down men shall carry their banners in the procession , the honor now sug - gested for him must necessarily have passed him by . ''

		We are invited nowadays to accept as poetry so much crude didacticism and unlicensed experimentation that we are in danger of for - getting what poetry is and under what severe restraints the true poet is bound to labor at his creative task .

		The old idea of the laureateship has been so completely set aside during the incumbency of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	that we find it diffi - cult to realize that these ''
Bon Gaultier	PERSON	'' verses of seventy years ago truthfully expressed it . ''

		Who would not be The laureate bold , With his butt of sherry To keep him merry , And nothing to do but pocket his gold . '' ''

		Oh , that would be the post for me , With plenty to get , and nothing to do , But to deck a pet poodle with ribbons of blue , And whistle a tune to the Queen 's cockatoo , And scribble of verses remarkably few . ''

		The better modern idea of the office was that of
Queen Victoria	PERSON	, who regarded it `` as the official recognition of a distinguished poet , suffi - ciently susceptible to the form and pressure of the time to be proclaimed without absurdity as its poetical interpreter . ''

		We quote from `` The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' which goes on to say : `` It is not now a Laureate 's business to celebrate his time .

		All we require for the office is a poet conspicuously distinguished among his fellows upon whom an official decoration will not inde - corously sit . ''

		Dr. Bridges answers almost perfectly to this requirement .

		In his selection the choice lay between the abiding elements of beauty in the poetic art and those ephemeral characteristics which the fashion of the day or the caprices of popular taste may emphasize , and the choice has fallen upon a poet of the right type , even if not upon a poet of the rank of .

		his immediate predecessors .

		One of the loveliest poems that Dr. Bridges has written is `` Nightingales . '' ''

		Beautiful must be the mountains whence ye come , And bright in the fruitful valleys the streams , where - from Ye learn your song : Where are those starry woods ?

		O might I wander there , Among the flowers , which in that heavenly air Bloom the year long ! ''

		Nay , barren are those mountains and spent the streams : Our song is the voice of desire , that haunts our dreams , A throe of the heart Whose pining visions dim , forbidden hopes profound , No dying cadence nor long sigh can sound , For all our art . ''

		Alone , aloud in the raptured ear of men We pour our dark nocturnal secret ; and then , As night is withdrawn From these sweet-springing meads and bursting boughs of
May	DATE	, Dream , while the innumerable choir of day Welcome the dawn . ''

		The subtle cadences and the haunting music of this lyric are the predominant qualities in this poet 's artistry .

		They express at once his high creative gift , his exact knowledge of metrics , and his nice philological scholarship .

		Of his equipment on the side of science , his prose writ - ings give ample evidence , the introduction to his edition of
Keats	PERSON	, for example , or his paper `` On the Present State of English Pronuncia - tion . ''

		It is on the strength of the last-named paper that the shifty spelling reformers have claimed Dr. Bridges for their own .

		It is true that he here advocates a phonetic alphabet , but it is true also that he says that '' phonetic spelling is full of horrors , '' and he would certainly re - gard such abortions as `` thru '' and `` program '' as typically horrible .

		For his purpose is to save English speech from the degradation of pronunciation which it is generally suffering in the centres of population , and which such dread - ful perversities as the two just cited abet and encourage .

		His guiding principle is that we should fix our spelling '' as we judge words should be pronounced , and not as we foresee or guess they are coming to be pronounced in the normal process of unimpeded degradation . ''

		If the spelling deformers would but try to save or restore the phonetic values that we have lost
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 71 or are in danger of losing , there would be much to be said for them .

		But their attitude is to accept degradation as a fait accompli , and so they ask us to write '' fixt '' for `` fixed , '' although the sound of the '' d '' has by no means vanished from the speech of careful persons .

		The ten - dency which is causing unaccented vowels to lose their distinctive character , so that `` to '' and '' for '' and `` the '' and `` sublime '' and `` above '' become `` ter '' and `` fer '' and `` ther '' and '' serblime '' and `` erbove '' is the danger with which Dr. Bridges is chiefly concerned , and in this connection he relates an amusing anecdote of a hospital patient whose bed-card indicated that his medicine was to be taken three times a day , and who , reading the awful words ter die , '' whipped out of bed , and fled for his life , to add , no doubt , a new tale to the terrers of the hospital . ''

		If the simplified spellers can extract comfort from such advocacy as this , they are welcome to it .

		Those whom jealousy on behalf of the muse may make apprehensive lest the new laureate give to medicine what should belong to poetry may be reminded that Dr. Bridges retired from the practice of his profession more than
thirty years ago	DATE	, and has been exclusively a man of letters ever since .

		He has not sought for pop - ularity , and many of his poems , privately printed , have not come within the reach of the larger public .

		The
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	has , however , recently published a selected vol - ume of his lyrics .

		His longer poems include `` The Growth of Love , '' '' Prometheus the Fire - giver , '' '' Eros and Psyche , '' and eight classical plays .

		One of the most sympathetic criticisms of his work is that found in the '' Studies in Seven Arts '' of Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	.

		The fol - lowing paragraph is this critic 's summing up of the essential qualities of the poet : '' Here is an artist so scrupulous that beauty itself must come only in sober apparel , joy only walking tem - perately , sorrow without the private disfiguring of tears .

		Made , as it is , out of what might be the com - monplace , if it were not the most select thing in the world ; written , as it is , with a deliberateness which might be cold , if it were not at that quiet heat in which rapture is no longer astonished at itself ; realizing , as it does ,
Coleridge	PERSON	's requirement that poetry in its higher and purer sense should demand continuous admiration , not regular recurrence of conscious surprise ; this poe - try , more than almost any in English , is art for art 's sake ; and it shows , better certainly than any other , how that formula .

		saves from excess , rather than induces to it .

		So evenly are form and substance set over against each other that it might be said , with as much or as little justice , that everything exists , for form , or that nothing is sacrificed to it . ''

		CAS
UAL	ORGANIZATION	COMMENT .

		THE FICTION MONTH in the magazine world is
August	DATE	, a vacation month very well adapted to the sort of recreation found in reading stories , especially short stories .

		It was twenty-four years ago that the first fiction number made its appearance in that memorable issue of '' Scribner 's Magazine '' -LRB- as its publishers now take pleasure in reminding us -RRB- which contained Mr.
Harrison Robertson	PERSON	's `` How the Derby Was Won , '' Mr.
T. R. Sullivan	PERSON	's `` The Rock of Bdranger , '' Mr.
John R. Spears	PERSON	's '' The Story of a Lost Car , '' Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	's `` The Two
Mol	ORGANIZATION	- lies , '' and Miss
Margaret Crosby	PERSON	's '' The Copeland Collection . ''

		This year brings us , in the same magazine 's fiction number , a characteristic story by the new Ambassador to
Italy	LOCATION	, ''
George	PERSON	's Baptism , '' which , like ``
Marse Chan	PERSON	, '' presents the ever amus - ing and likable Southern darky as no one better than Mr.
Thomas Nelson	PERSON	Page knows how to depict him .

		Other stories by popular authors in the same issue are `` The Old Order Changes , '' `` The Mean Pi-Ray te , '' `` Wood-Ladies , '' `` The Pagan , '' `` The Bird in the
Bush	PERSON	, '' and `` Sonnie-Boy 's People . ''

		This month of
August	DATE	is the right time for quoting from `` The Newarker '' that eminently quotable '' house organ , '' as it calls itself , of the
Newark	LOCATION	Public Library the following defence of fiction - reading : '' Almost all the men who work as if they liked it , who move quickly , who use their brains and have brains to use , and who get things done , are fond of reading novels .

		I conclude from this that the story-teller has always had the attention of the wise men of his generation just as he has their attention now .

		I also conclude that the writer of novels to-day is as little harmful and as greatly cheering and helpful to vigorous and competent workers to-day as was the story-teller in generations past .

		Some find the romance too strong for their blood ; but this argues nothing against the excellence of romance .

		Let the weak refrain from taking that which does not fit their constitutions , and let them leave to all others their choice of books . ''

		The closing words recall
Darwin	PERSON	's professed inability to read novels because they excited him unduly and interfered with the calm and regular prosecution of his proper work ; also Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's way of stopping the reading aloud of a too-harrowing story in her home circle , and her exclamation , '' It is too dread - ful , I can not bear it ! ''

		We are reminded also of a very busy and energetic worker by day who relaxes the tension at night with allopathic doses of fiction of the most sensational character '' garbage '' he calls it , in good-natured derision .

		THE LOSS OF A PRICELESS MANUSCRIPT forms the subject of a Lincoln anecdote that is being told in this semi-centennial year of the great
Gettysburg	LOCATION	fight , and is especially worthy of repeating since the recent reproduction in a
New York	LOCATION	journal of what was alleged to be the original draft of the 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	famous address , one of the classics of American lit - erature , delivered by
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	on the field of
Gettys	LOCATION	- burg .

		This reproduction , showing the
White House	ORGANIZATION	stationery , clashes violently with the familiar tradi - tion that the speech was scribbled in haste on the back of an old envelope , while the speaker was on his way to the scene of its delivery ; but the discrep - ancy is explained by a son of the late Horatio King of
New York	LOCATION	.

		He says that in
1897	DATE	he went with his father to call upon
Andrew G. Curtin	PERSON	, the old war governor of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and that Governor
Curtin	PERSON	told them of his having been one of the party that accompanied Lincoln to
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, and that on the journey the President asked him if he had any writing paper .

		To this the other answered that he had not , but offered him several addressed envelopes , which he cut open in order to make more writing space .

		Lincoln took them and withdrew to a separate seat , where he busied himself with his pencil , but returned to
Curtin	PERSON	just before
Gettysburg	LOCATION	was reached , and , handing the scraps of paper to his obliging friend , asked him to have a clean copy made of what he had written .

		This was done at a hotel , and the transcript handed to
Lincoln	LOCATION	, after which , as Governor
Curtin	PERSON	expressed it , `` like a d d fool I threw the slips away .

		They would be priceless now . ''

		Mr.
King	PERSON	offers the explanation that
Lincoln	PERSON	had probably left his original manu - script behind him by mistake and wrote the penciled draft from memory .

		Another possible explanation would be that he wrote out the
White House	ORGANIZATION	copy after the delivery of the speech .

		A careful com - parison of the address as delivered and reported with this still extant copy in
Lincoln	LOCATION	's hand has of course long ago been made , and the findings of this examination might perhaps be turned to account in throwing some light on the question in dispute .

		THE PROPOSED LEGISLATIVE DRAFTING BUREAU IN THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS ought to be of great service in securing greater simplicity and uniformity and consistency in the bills introduced into the two houses of our national legislature .

		The defeat of so useful a measure is hardly conceivable , although the unexpected opposition encountered in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	illustrates once more that
august	DATE	body 's fondness for silly and senseless obstruction .

		One of the con - script fathers has even felt it his duty to rise in his place and denounce the bill as `` the most astonishing piece of legislation I have ever heard proposed in this body . ''

		The mere drafting of bills , as Senator Root explained in introducing the measure , would not be the only or most important function of the proposed bureau .

		This bureau would hunt up and digest all literature in the Library pertaining to the bill in hand .

		`` The fundamental idea '' of the so-called
Owen	PERSON	act for establishing the bureau , Mr.
Root	PERSON	made clear , '' is to give the benefit of a trained , experienced student in the preparation of bills ; not to take a bill after it has been passed upon , but to perform the function which is now performed to great advantage by the officers who are called counsel in the
British House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.

		The idea is to have a more or less permanent officer who is familiar with existing legislation and with the decisions of the courts , who can take a measure that has been drafted with the slender opportunity for examination and research which we have here , and see how it fits into the existing laws of the coun - try and what its effect will be under the existing decisions of the courts , and suggest better , clearer , more unambiguous , and more effective forms of expression . ''

		This is no leap in the dark , such as might inspire excusable terror in a timid
Senate	ORGANIZATION	; it is something that has already been tried in several of the
State	ORGANIZATION	legislatures , if we mistake not notably in that of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		VEST POCKET LIBRARIES seem to be rendered pos - sible by Dr.
Francois Dussaud	PERSON	's invention of '' cold light , '' as described by him in ``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine '' for
July	DATE	.

		A light that is more economic of electric energy than the ordinary incandescent burner is produced by making the pulsations or waves inter - mittent instead of continuous , thus greatly reducing the radiation of heat without diminution of light .

		Heat being thus largely eliminated , a greater con - centration of light on the inflammable celluloid film used in photography is made possible ; and the celluloid negative of a book-page , for instance , can be of almost microscopic dimensions and still easily thrown onto a screen in such size as to be readable .

		A year 's issue of Figaro , says the inventor , can be packed away in negatives occupying no more space than a match ; and the volumes for a quarter of a century can thus be put into a cigarette-case .

		A dozen large books could be photgraphed easily and cheaply , page after page on a continuous film , and the negatives tucked into the vest-pocket without making it bulge uncomfortably , whereas a dozen men would be required to carry the same number of glass negatives .

		Certain European libraries , says Dr.
Dussaud	PERSON	, have already made arrangements for the exchange of rare volumes in this way , in pho - tographic facsimile .

		Both the photographing and the reproducing apparatus appear to be inexpensive , of small bulk , and easily managed .

		May it not be that we have here a solution of the problem with which libraries are now confronted in the portentous accumulation of the increasingly enormous product of the printing-press ?

		One seems to hear the groaning bookshelves utter a sigh of expectant relief at this prospect of vest-pocket libraries in the near future .

		THE MAN OF A HUNDRED BOOKS , carefully selected and thoughtfully read , is a well-educated man .

		So said Mr.
Philander Claxton	PERSON	,
United States Commis	ORGANIZATION	- sioner of Education , at the recent annual conference of American educators at
Salt Lake City	LOCATION	.

		This was at the joint session of the library and rural schools departments of the
National Educational Associ	ORGANIZATION	- ation , at which the subject for discussion was `` The Library in its Relation to the
Rural Community	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Commissioner
Claxton	PERSON	declared literature to be the
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 73 most important of all school subjects , and then as - serted that whoever will read thoughtfully four good books a year will be well educated when he has read one hundred .

		Such persons are invaluable to their respective communities , they are open to progress , and they have windows in their souls .

		Mr.
Claxton	PERSON	made an eloquent plea for the county library system .

		He stated that of the thirty-five hundred counties in the
United States	LOCATION	, twenty-two hundred have no library of five thousand volumes .

		Notable also was the address of Mr.
Ole Rice	PERSON	,
State Library Clerk of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, who gave some interesting information about rural school libraries in his
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Teachers are required to pass an examination showing their understanding of such principles of library science and the use of books as will enable them to direct the reading of their pupils a branch of the teacher 's equipment which Mr.
Rice	PERSON	considers more important than algebra .

		In speaking of the selection of books for children , he incidentally exposed one fault in the ordinary story of school life : the scene is commonly laid in a boarding-school , not in the public school , and thus a desire to leave home is often unwisely planted in the public school pupil 's breast .

		Herein may lie a valuable hint to the writer of juvenile fiction .

		... AN OLD REVIEW UNDER NEW EDITORSHIP SOme - times takes a fresh lease of life with the changed conditions , and sometimes does not .

		What will be the result of the reorganization of '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' which is to go into effect at the end of
August	DATE	, remains to be seen .

		Mr.
Harold Hodge	PERSON	, its editor for fourteen years past , is to yield his chair to the chief proprietor , the Hon.
Gervase Beckett	PERSON	,
M.P.	LOCATION	, who will be assisted by Mr.
George A. B. Dewar	PERSON	as literary editor .

		Famous from the begin - ning for its addiction to caustic comment and un - sparing criticism one might appropriately call it '' The
Saturday	DATE	Slasher , '' in view of the tone of its book-reviews this well-known
London	LOCATION	weekly has in its time enlisted the services of many of
England	LOCATION	's best writers .


Freeman	PERSON	's excoriations of certain un - lucky authors made lively reading in the good old days ;
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	also wrote frequently for the paper ; and
J. R. Green	PERSON	contributed some admirable sketches of historic towns , and many other articles of value .

		The present political situation in
England	LOCATION	is thought to offer the ''
Saturday	DATE	'' a rare oppor - tunity to recover much of its lost prestige .

		THE FASCINATION OF THE FOLDER , glowingly descriptive of some railway route or steamboat line or summer resort , and lavishly illustrated with the most captivating scenes , a mountain landscape , the broad piazza of a palatial seaside hotel , the hand - somely upholstered interior of a Pullman palace car , the incredible vastness of a steamboat dining-room , or the voluptuous comfort of the same vessel 's private suites of rooms , would be irresistible were it not that each fresh one coming to hand seems more allur - ing , more full of promise , than the last , so that , after the manner of Buridan 's ass , only more harassed by conflicting desires than that poor beast , one balances the equiponderant attractions of mountain and sea - shore , or of grandly scenic railroad route and softly seductive sea voyage , and perhaps ends by staying at home and confining one 's
summer	DATE	travel to an arm-chair perusal of half a hundred of these artistically-made publications of the transportation companies and the hotel men .

		As it is a common experience to meet a man who , one feels sure , can - not possibly be as wise as he looks , so one is haunted by a doubt whether any of these beautifully-depicted routes of travel and resorts of wealth and leisure can be in reality what they seem in printed appearance .

		Better , perhaps , not to dispel the illusion .

		Better to let
Elmwood Heights	LOCATION	or Sunset Lake or
Idyl Island	LOCATION	remain in the mind 's eye the perfect para - dise it purports to be than to risk the disenchantment of actuality .

		Thus the folder becomes harmless lit - erature to him who has wisdom and restraint , its seductions seduce only in imagination , and one watches with interest each season its developing charms , its more artfully paraded attractions and allurements .

		... THE LATEST ADDITION TO THE INDEX ExPURGA - TORIUS is that spirited romance of Elizabethan times and Elizabethan mariners , '' Westward Ho ! ''

		The school committee of
Boston	LOCATION	has held earnest debate over
Kingsley	PERSON	's masterpiece and decreed that it shall be dropped from the supplementary reading list of the
Boston	LOCATION	high schools because , as we gather , the author 's treatment of the religious controversies of the time is likely to cause offense .

		Undoubtedly there is much with which readers of certain preju - dices and upbringing might disagree in the Anglican writer 's earnest utterance on certain points over which men have argued and fought for centuries ; but what romance-hungry young reader is going to let that fact spoil the story for him or her ?

		The condemned passages are more than likely to be skipped in any case , or to be hurried over with no thought but for the progress of the fortunes of
Amyas Leigh	PERSON	.

		Truly , if
Kingsley	PERSON	is dangerous read - ing , we had better confine our youths and maidens to the reading of ''
Sandford	PERSON	and Merton '' and '' The Parent 's Assistant , '' and bar their approach to the public library .

		... A PREMIUM UPON ILLITERACY might almost serve as a designation of that provision of the
Underwood	PERSON	tariff bill which , now that the Senators have tinkered it to their satisfaction , removes from the free list `` books and pamphlets chiefly in languages other than English . ''

		Stupid and harmful and utterly indefensible as was the original provision for taxing imported English books -LRB- with some grudging excep - tions in favor of libraries and schools -RRB- , this imposing of a duty on non-English books is an imposition indeed .

		Our last state will be worse than our first if this witless clause becomes a law ; for hitherto the advanced student could keep abreast of conti - nental European scholarship in his department with -
74	DATE
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
August 1	DATE	out being fined for his alertness and zeal , and the book-loving immigrant could send home for litera - ture in his native German or Swedish or Hungarian or other language -LRB- except English -RRB- and rejoice in his exemption from those custom-house formalities and delays and expenses that hamper and exasper - ate the purchaser of foreign books printed in En - glish .

		The window tax of early times was a senseless attempt to collect a revenue on light and air , bodily necessities , and deserved all the reprobation it re - ceived ; but this laying of a duty on the light and air of the soul and intellect bespeaks a density of blockheadedness -LRB- to call it nothing worse -RRB- that fairly passes conception .

		The authorship of this masterpiece of solemn stupidity has been intimated in the reports from
Washington	LOCATION	, but the name shall not here be held up to ridicule and infamy .

		It is to be hoped that early legislative or executive action will save that name from going down to posterity as a synonym for all that is smallest and stupidest , most reactionary and most injurious , in tariff legislation .

		THE NOVELIST IN QUEST OK HIS MATERIAL is too often tempted , especially in his beginning years , to go far afield .

		Ignotum pro magnifico seems to be the actuating principle before the eyes have been opened to the marvel and mystery of the familiar .

		When one reads in the columns of literary gossip that a certain novelist is going to
Transylvania	LOCATION	or
Mesopotamia	LOCATION	to obtain local color for his new book , the thoughtful person 's impulse is to advise him to stay at home and try to get his eyes open to the local color that is all about him .

		But there is a proverb about the eyes of a fool being in the ends of the earth , and our headstrong young novelist would of course refuse to listen to any such well - meant counsel .

		Let us quote here the words of one veteran novelist , as they may convey a hint as to how he gathers his material for his fiction without journeying to the ends of the earth for it .

		In a conversation reported very lately by Mr.
George Newell Lovejoy	PERSON	for the
Springfield	LOCATION	'' Republican '' Mr.
Ho	PERSON	wells says : '' I was never very strong bodily ; I have always been obliged to use my strength guardedly , so to speak , and yet I have been able to accomplish a great deal .

		I always endeavor to be systematic in all that I do .

		I usually pass my after - noons out of doors , walking , meeting people , observ - ing in a natural way all that is to be seen .

		I never tire walking our busy streets and meeting people of all nationalities .

		It is all so interesting to me ; and , do you know , I regard
New York	LOCATION	as far more inter - esting as a city than
London	LOCATION	or
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Here is a world in itself , of business activity and progress in all directions . ''

		The story-writer 's kingdom , like the kingdom of heaven , is probably much nearer home than he at first suspects .

		... PROVISION FOR THE LITERARY NEEDS OF AUS - TRALIAN SAILORS employed on Australian coasting vessels is made in the navigation act recently passed by the
Australian Federal Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		Character - istic of the radical and usually highly enlightened legislation of that young commonwealth is the clause requiring all ships licensed for the coasting trade to pay standard Australian wages to the men employed , while in Australian waters , and also to allow them free use of the books in the ship 's library unless a separate library has been provided for their benefit .

		Thus the merchant marine is being educated up to that praiseworthy and doubtless profitable practice of giving the sailor an antidote to the deadly tedium of a life on the ocean wave , which is now observed in the up-to-date navy .

		Ere long we shall expect to see our library schools offering special courses in marine bibliothecology , or library science for sea - farers .

		... A RE-INTERPRETATION OF THE CLASSICS , as Mr.
Henry Dwight Sedgwick	PERSON	points out in his dialogue on `` The Classics Again '' in `` The Atlantic Monthly '' for
July	DATE	, is urged upon us by the issue of `` The Loeb Classical Library . ''

		In the dialogue referred to , one of the speakers remarks : `` My point was that we accept the classics upon a wholly traditional valuation ; and I was going to add that one of the great services which Mr.
Loeb	PERSON	's classical library renders is that we are morally obliged to look at the classics , so far as possible , with our own eyes and make up our own minds about them .

		We must take the word classical down from its pedestal and see what it really means . ''

		With all the Greek and Latin classics put before us in a uniform edition and accompanied by a page-f or-page English translation , the old excuse of rustiness in our ancient languages , or the plea that the Greek and Latin authors are not readily available in satisfactory form , will no longer hold .

		An authoritative vernacular rendering , with the original on the adjoining page to help one to re - capture at least some flavor of the author 's style , is all that could be desired for an intelligent re-reading of our long-neglected
Virgil	PERSON	and Homer ,
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	and Thucydides .

		In a certain quarter , which need not here be named , protest has been made against reading the accepted masterpieces of literature simply be - cause they are accounted '' classics . ''

		Now is the time and the opportunity to determine anew , every reader for himself , whether they deserve that designation .

Committee on Trans	ORGANIZATION	- lations as the authorized literary committee of
the Society	ORGANIZATION	, its members to study old and new English translations of Scandinavian writers and publish the results of such studies .

		The
Committee	ORGANIZATION	was also au - thorized to offer the services of its members as special readers of manuscript translations to such publishing houses as are issuing translations of Scandinavian writ - ings : the Society recognizing the inadequacy of most

		LITERATURE AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR LIFE .

		-LRB- `` To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Miss
Corinne Bacon	PERSON	, head of the
Drexel Institute Library School	ORGANIZATION	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, I read in a recent issue of THE DIAL , declares that literature is of little worth as a substitute for life , and asks why it is necessarily a good thing to read at all : '' Is there anything sacrosanct about print ?

		Why is it considered a virtue to read ? ''

		She further inquires if it would not be a good thing for many of us to deal more with first-hand things and less with second-hand thoughts .

		She concludes with the remark : '' At the best , books are but a substitute for life . ''

		To this THE DIAL replies that one may have both life and literature , but that if it were necessary to choose one should , of course , choose life .

		This seems to me a feeble answer to a foolish ques - tion .

		It is impossible to choose literature as a substitute for life .

		We all must live , however closely we seclude ourselves .

		What Miss
Bacon	PERSON	really means is , that we should learn of life from people rather than from books .

		Now , in the first place , books are not a substitute for life at all ; on the contrary , they are a part , and a very important part , of life .

		We can learn at first-hand only as much of life as we encounter in personal experience .

		This knowledge is necessarily limited .

		If we could know only of those places which we view with our own eyes , most of us would be shockingly deficient in our knowledge of geography .

		We acquire our knowledge of life exactly as a doctor acquires his knowledge of medicine or surgery , partly by personal experience or experimentation , but chiefly by making our own the knowledge , the observation , and the experience of others .

		It is extremely unlikely that I shall ever visit
Iceland	LOCATION	, yet because others have done so and have recorded that experience in books , I know that
Iceland	LOCATION	exists .

		It is quite easy for me to become familiar with many of the physical characteristics of that country , its climate , its geological formation , its waterways , and so on , without going outside of my own door .

		The same thing is true of its social characteristics .

		This knowledge may be of great value to me or it may not .

		One thing is cer - tain : it can do me no harm .

		It is the same with all others matters of knowledge .

		Why , asks
Miss Bacon	PERSON	, is it considered a virtue to read ?

		It is not considered a virtue to read useless , inaccurate , frivolous , aimless literature ; nobody will contend that it is so considered .

		There is nothing vir - tuous in the mere act of reading , any more than there is anything virtuous in the mere act of guiding a pen across paper .

		The virtue of reading lies in the desire to learn , just as the virtue of laboring lies in the desire to be useful .

		To learn is to become efficient ; to be effi - cient is to be of use ; to be of use is to be virtuous .

		The very desire to be of use is commendable .

		To deny this is to deny every principle of Christian or even of civil - ized ethics ; nay , of any and all ethics known to man .

		Stupidity is a misfortune , but torpidity is a crime .

		To the question whether it would not be better for many of us to deal more with first-hand things and less with second-hand thoughts , I should answer no .

		There are not many of us who are more concerned with books than with men , and I do not believe the world would be any better if the few who devote themselves to litera - ture were to abandon it .

		It is well to remember that '' Men may be read , as well as books , too much . ''

		If our young people were content to learn more from books and less from life , we should not have so many social problems to vex us .

		The source of most of our present trouble with '' the social evil '' lies in the fact that so few young people are willing to believe what they are told until they have put it to the test .

		Literature teaches that vice carries penalties .

		Life teaches the same les - son ; but tuition in the school of experience is high , and of those who insist upon learning in that school there are few who are fortunate enough to graduate with honors .

		THE WIDENER LIBRARY AND THE HARVARD `` YARD . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It seems as though there would have been many voices of wail or of protest from
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	men all over the country if the conception had been grasped of what the college yard is to look like , when the beautiful but perfectly unassimilable new library building is com - pleted .

		The effect will approximate that of the olla podrida of
Copley Square	LOCATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	, but with no excuse , since authority could have controlled harmony in the
Cambridge	LOCATION	precincts .

		The old library building was pretty bad , though familiarized by custom .

		Since its destruc - tion the ensemble has been much improved , but of course the conditions are short-lived .

		With the Widener struc - ture , the last state will be worse than the first ; while the imagination has had an opportunity to picture what the grouping might be of a sympathetic edifice in the colonial manner that is our birthright , with
University	ORGANIZATION	, beautiful
Holden	PERSON	,

		* Dexterous weaver of fiction though Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	is , the loom that produced `` Jan
Vedder	PERSON	's Wife '' and The Bow of Orange Kibbon '' did not reveal its full capacity until the fabric of this popular novelist 's real life , rich in color and elaborate in pattern , was given to her readers .

		`` All the Days of My Life , '' as she names her autobiography , is a book more packed with in - cident and adventure , with strokes of good and ill fortune , with joy and sorrow , love and long - ing , strange coincidences , curious omens and warnings , and a variety of unusual experiences ranging from the comic to the tragic , than any romance that has come from the autobiographer 's prolific pen .

		Especially interesting and signifi - cant are the inner experiences , the spiritual agonies and ecstasies , that have fallen to Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	's lot , and that she relates with a noble can - dor and dignity that make them most impressive .

		When she tells us in her preface that not one of several apparent motives named by her has been the impelling motive in prompting her to write her life-story , and that the real reason must reveal itself to the reader , the inference must be that it is for the sake of its spiritual meaning , its lessons in the deeper things of the soul , that the book is sent out to the world .

		Its general tone and character are indicated in the very opening paragraph of the first chapter . ''

		This miracle comes not by observation ; no mother ever saw it take place .

		She only knows that at one moment her child was ignorant of her ; that at the next moment it was consciously smiling into her face , and that then , with an instinctive gladness , she called to the whole household , ' the baby has begun to notice . '

		Ulverston ,
Shipley	PERSON	,
Penrith	LOCATION	,
Kipon	PERSON	,
Castletown	LOCATION	in the Isle of Man , and
Whitehaven	LOCATION	are named as places successively dwelt in by the migratory preacher and his family .

		About two years ' experience of teaching fell naturally to the lot of the bright and intellectual and rather pre - cocious
Amelia	LOCATION	, and at nineteen she married
Robert Barr	PERSON	, a prosperous and promising young business man of
Glasgow	LOCATION	.

		But within three years certain mishaps in his commercial under - takings prompted the young husband to emi - grate with his wife and their two daughters to
America	LOCATION	, where began a series of wanderings and of struggles with adversity , brightened with occasional gleams of prosperity , that ended only with Mr.
Barr	PERSON	's death from yellow fever at
Galveston	LOCATION	, where two young sons likewise fell victims to the epidemic , and the widow with three surviving daughters , out of eight children that had been born within sixteen years , was left to support her family as best she could .


New York	LOCATION	was soon chosen as the scene of this struggle for existence , and after some essays in another direction writing was adopted as the calling most likely to prove both congenial and remunerative .

		Periodicals like `` The
Chris	PERSON	- tian Union , '' ``
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly , '' `` The New York Ledger , '' and `` The Illustrated Christian Weekly , '' as also , later , some of the best monthly magazines , showed themselves hospitable to the offerings of the new writer ; and though there were times when her purse became alarmingly light , and in one such season of stress her dearest piece of jewelry , a diamond ring placed on her finger by
Robert Barr	PERSON	in the old
Glasgow	LOCATION	days , had to be turned into food and raiment , the plucky young authoress won through unaided except by the offices of friendship , and climbed steadily and rather rapidly to that high rung on the ladder of literary fame whereon she now stands secure .

		Passing over the varied incidents that make the first half of Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	's book interesting and even thrilling , to the point of sensationalism , omitting the
Chicago	LOCATION	and
Memphis	LOCATION	and
Texas	LOCATION	episodes , which must be read in full as she herself has narrated them , we choose for special notice here a few events and associations from her literary life in
New York	LOCATION	, and will quote an early passage illustrating the manner of that life as ordered by her soon after she had got her bearings in the new environment .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 77 '' As soon as the house affairs were arranged , I went down to the
Christian Union	LOCATION	office .

		I took with me a paper called ` The Epiphany in the West Riding . '

		There was a Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	then in the working editor 's chair , and he read it at once and was delighted with it .

		He had such generous words of encouragement and praise , that I have yet the kindest memory of him .

		He was the first editor of the
Christian Union	LOCATION	, I believe , but he left the paper very soon , and I have never heard his name since . ''

		Mr.
George Merriam	PERSON	followed him , and he was the kindest and wisest editor I ever wrote for .

		He kept me rigorously up to my best work , but did so with such consideration and valuable advice , that I always felt it a great pleasure to see how much better I could make everything I wrote for him .

		He did me many favors , and among them he gave me my first introduction to the dear old
Astor Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		In this library I worked from morning to night .

		Mr.
Saunders	PERSON	the head librarian was an Englishman , a most wonderful general scholar , particularly intimate with English literature .

		We soon became good friends , and he gave me the use of one of the largest and sunniest alcoves in the Hall I frequented .

		For fifteen years I used this alcove with its comfortably large table , its silence and sunshine , and delightful atmosphere of books and scholars . ''

		She says further of this alcove that `` though it exists no longer , I see it as plainly as I saw it before it existed at all '' and proceeds to explain the italicized words by recounting how as a child of seven or eight at
Penrith	LOCATION	she had dreams of this pleasant nook in the big library and saw it in as definite detail as later when she actually entered it .

		The reminiscence is characteristic , for the book abounds in similar instances of strange coincidence , to call it nothing more , and curious premonition .

		Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	has all her life either been the victim of superstition or been endowed with unusual psychic powers .

		Some will explain the apparently supernatural parts of her history in one way , some in another ; but the simple , straightforward , unpretentious manner in which they are related disposes one to credit her with the strictest conscientiousness and care in her narrative , and to join with her in assigning to some little-understood cause or agency the otherwise inexplicable occurrences in her event - ful life .

		Among the glimpses of many persons of note which the book gives us , the following will serve as a welcome addendum to a recent biography of more than passing interest . ''

		About this time the brilliant scholar
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	was editor of the
Christian Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was a great man in every respect .

		If he only entered a room , it appeared to become lighter ; and in no other man have I ever noticed the radiation of the body so pro- nounced .

		He made me believe in the aureoles of the saints .

		Reverent to sacred things , he was still very much of an every-day man .

		He fearlessly spoke his mind , fearlessly opposed what he disapproved ; and was not , I suspected , an admirer of Mr.
Beecher	PERSON	.

		I remember thinking that if the two men came to an active dispute , I should like to be present .

		Professor
Tyler	PERSON	soon left the newspaper world , and went to his place in
Michigan University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many years afterwards he wrote me some hearty letters , praising the work I had done , and telling me he knew I would do better still . ''

		As illustrating Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	's industry , the record of her year 's work for
1882	DATE	, while she was still comparatively new to her calling , is significant .

		It includes '' one hundred and thirty-one poems , eight stories , two of which were long enough to be called novelettes , and twenty-five articles referring mostly to remark - able people , places or events . ''

		Concerning the
year 1899	DATE	we find a note that further strengthens confidence in the writer as a truthful historian , sane of mind and calm of judgment .

		She says : '' The first three months the doctor forbid me to write , and I amused myself by reading everything I could find on the new cults and ' isms ' then clamoring for recognition .

		Theosophy for a few weeks fascinated me , but
Christian Science	ORGANIZATION	never for one hour made any impression .

		I thought it only a huge misunderstanding of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		Spiritualism I had examined many years previously , and discarded its pretentions at once .

		Truly God speaks to men , but when He so favors any soul , He asks no dollar fee , and needs no darkened room , veiled cabinet , nor yet any hired medium to interpret His message ... And when I had satisfied my foolish curiosity , I was sorry and ashamed , and with deep con - trition asked only to be permitted to say once more , ' Our Father / ' Going back to my
Bible	LOCATION	was like going back home , after being lost in a land of darkness and despair . ''

		Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	is eloquent in pleading the cause of women .

		`` I am for the enfranchisement of every slave , '' she declares . ''

		I am for justice , even to women . ''

		All the more remarkable , therefore , is the fact of her evident sympathy with the South in the war for the negro slave 's emancipation .

		But her home was then in the South , which explains much .

		In the style of her book one can not fail to note , in addition to what are manifestly printer 's errors , rather frequent proofs of her frankly confessed ignorance of grammar , which in this instance includes punc - tuation .

		Almost any schoolgirl , however , can easily master the rules of grammar ; not one in a hundred thousand can achieve Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	's well-deserved fame in literature .

		Her book is well supplied with portraits , and has a view of her home on the
Hudson	LOCATION	, `` Cherry Croft . ''

		It is more variously interesting , richer in romance and strange adventure , than is usual with the lives of literary folk .

		It holds the reader under its spell from beginning to end .

		78 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	THE MYSTERY OF DREAMS .

		* In the Interpreter 's house are many mansions , and of these the seat of dreams is one of the most extraordinary , as to disorder .

		The dream has been , to the interpreter , everything , from a revelation of the mysteries and a portent of the fates , to the efflux of a feast celebrated not wisely but too well .

		Interpretations have sped with fancy or crawled with fact , ever outrunning or falling short of that needful conspectus of the whole dream , which so envisages at once its character , cause , and effects that the whole and each part may by means of the vision be pro- duced , destroyed , increased , minimized , directed , controlled .

		In bald English , there has been no satisfactory science of dreams .

		Now comes Freud with the joyful gospel of such a science , with the claim to dispel the mys - tery and to give law to the fact .

		In his gospel , the ancient role of the dream is topsy-turvied .

		First of all , it is not a disturber of sleep ; it is a protector of sleep .

		Then it is not providence of the future ; it is reminiscence of the past .

		And finally , it is not a punishment or reward determined from without ; it is the fulfilment of some wish , determined from within .

		Dreams are at once defence , purgation , and satisfaction , the mind 's device to protect itself against itself .

		The mind 's device to protect itself against itself !

		It is the inward discrepancy of the stream of life that is the point of departure of this theory .

		Freud accepts the popular , and for that matter the philosophic and religious , conceptions of human nature as a conflict be - tween a higher and a lower part .

		To Plato , for example , man is at once a protean beast , a lion and a man , and man , with the help of the lion , must rule the beast and keep it obedient .

		To Christian opinion man is at once flesh and spirit , and the former must be chastened that the latter may maintain its righteous own .

		To modern humanitarian sentiment man is head and heart , and each must hold the other in check .

		To contemporary psychology , a similar inner conflict is apparent ; not , however , as an eternal triangle , or di-wrangle , but as a vast pluralism .

		The mind is conceived as an assemblage of con - flicting interests , impulsions , desires , feelings , each with its own adherents , associates , and emotional tone , each tending to fill the field of consciousness , to dominate the waking life and to constitute the actual character of the person * THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS .

		By
Sipmund Freud	PERSON	, LL.D .

		Authorized translation from the third Ger - man edition , with introduction , by
A. A. Brill	PERSON	, Ph.B .

		.

		M.D.
New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		whose life it so constrains .

		Any one of these active centres is called in the Freudian termin - ology a '' psychic complex , '' and it is such com - plexes that he makes the units of explanation in his theory of dreams .

		Their essence is that they are not and can not be at peace with one another , that they make of our minds a theatre and of our lives a drama of which they are at once the protagonists and directors .

		And the catastrophe of this unceas - ing drama is always that one or more of those `` complexes '' is driven from the stage of the overt life .

		It may be that external conditions the social order , commercial necessity , intel - lectual urgency , allies of other `` complexes '' will drive it off ; it may be that its own intrinsic unpleasantness will banish it , put it out of mind ; but whatever the cause , it is put out .

		Putting it out does not , however , end the drama ; putting it out serves only to complicate the drama .

		For the `` new psychology '' shows that whenever an interest or desire or impulsion is put out of the mind , it is really put into the mind ; it is driven from the conscious level of existence to the unconscious level , but it is not destroyed .

		It retains its force and direction , only its work now lies underground .

		Its life henceforward consists partly in a direct oppugnance to the inhibitions that keep it down , partly in burrow - ing beneath and around them and seeking out unwonted channels of escape .

		Under these con - ditions of the mind 's drama the protagonists get new names .

		The fellow in the cellarage is called by Freud the `` lower instance , '' the visible Hamlet on the stage , the `` upper instance '' or `` censor . ''

		Whatever henceforth ensues tends to be the outcome of a compromise between the censor and the lower instance .

		Hysteria , wit , and dreams are some of the compromises that emerge .

		They are the armed neutrality of these inveterate enemies .

		This they are , yet not so simply .

		For life is long and suppressions accumulate , until the mass of our existence of feeling and desire tends to be composed entirely of lower instances , layer upon layer , and every complex in the layer striving to enter the daylight of consciousness without disguises .

		Disguise it must have , how - ever ; and when by virtue of the disguise , it appears in dream , it appears not alone , but in a fellowship in which the suppressions of infancy are likely to be even more important than those of later life .

		Dreams tend to gratify the whole of our mentality of the cellarage without offense to the censor .

		To the technique of this gratification , Freud
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 79 assigns the term `` dream-work , '' distinguishing in it the processes of `` over-determination , '' or `` condensation , '' `` displacement , '' and `` sec - ondary elaboration . ''

		These are , so to speak , the devices in the makeup of the disguised sup - pression , which under its makeup goes by the name of `` latent dream content . ''

		The stuff of the makeup is derived from the day 's events .

		The overt dream which disguises this '' con - tent '' is over and above everything else a thing seen ; it is a vision , and an enacted vision .

		Consequently it can contain little that is literal or direct ; every one of its elements tends to be an indirection and a symbol .

		It can not , to begin with , as an enactment , directly present the past : the past must be symbolized by some present dream-event .

		It can not , again , present abstractions , like logical relations , such as if , but , because , and so on ; these again must be symbolized by some concrete dramatic dream sequence : thoughts appear as actions .

		This concretion of abstractions , into dominant visual and dramatic terms is the most imme - diate attribute of the '' dream-work . ''

		Now each element of the explicit content of the dream may be , and generally is , the gratification of a large number of suppressed wishes ; it is thus as
Freud	PERSON	says , '' over-determined , '' a `` conden - sation '' of the multitude into its visual unity , and in this way a symbol of them all .

		Again , what it symbolizes , be it remembered , is out - lawed from the waking life .

		In order that it may pass the censor it must not only be dis - guised , it must be disguised in innocency .

		To attain such disguise means to substitute the trivial for the important , to enter consciousness , if I may say so , tangentially .

		Such substitu - tion and tangentiality is what Freud means by '' displacement . ''

		This , together with over - determination and condensation , is the direct product of the suppressed complexes .

		The role of the censor in the creation of the dream-drama has been thus far only inhibitive and regulative .

		Its positive contribution consists of certain in - terpolations and amplifications which give the dream a superficial coherence and rationality .

		This contribution Freud calls '' secondary elab - oration . ''

		It can be distinguished from the fig - ments of the suppressed wishes in that it is more easily forgettable , is not so vivid , and serves , as a rule , to connect and unify outlying or dis - crepant portions of the dream .

		This service resolves on slight scrutiny into absurdities .

		Dreams exhibit moreover not alone the paradoxes incidental to secondary elabora - tions .

		These vary with the occasion .

		One par - adox occurs uniformly and regularly in every dream .

		It is that profound and overwhelming emotions appear attached to or caused by the most trivial and disproportionate things : that events most extraordinary in horror or dramatic importance seem to evoke pleasure or to leave the mind indifferent .

		The phenonemon is one of displacement .

		Freud explains it by the observation that the only unconverted and unconvertible element in the dream is its emo - tional content , its `` affect , '' as he calls it .

		This comes into the overt life out of the unconscious in its original integrity .

		In sum , then , a dream is a vicarious gratifi - cation of a suppressed wish by means of sym - bolic dramatic action the mechanism of which is devised at one and the same time to satisfy the subterranean need and to pass the psychic censor .

		The one unchanged actuality in the dream is its emotional tone .

		It will follow inevitably that if this formula does envisage the essence of dream - life , certain dreams will be common to all man - kind , will occur widely , will make use of the same symbolism and be interpretable in the same way .

		Freud indicates as such , among a possible many others , dreams of flying , falling , water-dreams , fire dreams , and so on .

		The analyses of such dreams are not , however , as they here appear , convincing .

		This is perhaps due to the fact that
Freud	PERSON	arrived at his theory of dreams through years of clinical treatment of neurasthenics , hysterics , and persons of otherwise unnormal mentality .

		He discovered , in the course of this practice , that if he caused his patients to explore their memories , letting all ideas that arise run a free course , absolutely uncensored , they would inevi - tably bump on predisposing influences , wishes chiefly , and that these , if once faced , would be dissipated , and the patient cured , or at least im - proved .

		The treatment is cathartic , its method `` psychoanalysis . ''

		Exposition and proof of this theory of dreams is offered as the outcome of the method , and the method , conversely , is justified by the theory , in terms of numerous analyzed dreams .

		The circularity is patent , and aggravated by the character of the dream-analyses which con - stitute it .

		There is additional difficulty because of the unproved general assumptions concerning the behavior of the mind of man from which the analyses derive .

		The assumptions seem to be used to justify the analyses , and the analyses to ground the assumptions .

		Again a circle .

		Now these assumptions concern the prepon - derant nature of the governing impetus that is the 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	core of each complex , and the psychic principle by which dream-contents and hysteric forms are analyzed .

		In
Freud	LOCATION	's view the impetus is pre - ponderantly sexual ; the principle is that of the association of ideas .

		Both have been violently attacked , and the former awakens a natural , often a defensory , resentment .

		It has been said that the sex-postulate may hold in
Vienna	LOCATION	, but need not elsewhere , and so ad nauseam .

		An overwhelming presumption in its favor exists nevertheless ; but it arises from considerations quite extraneous to the dream-analyses offered in this book .

		These , too , often seem consciously forced and inconclusive , perhaps because of Freud 's delicacy and reticence about what showed itself as actually efficacious and causal , perhaps on account of too great compactness , ob - scuring relations and connections .

		Whatever the reason , the forcing and inconclusiveness are un - questionable .

		Presumptions favoring the sex - postulate come from considerations concerning human nature and the character of civilization , which depends much on the regulation , control , and conversion of sex-impulses .

		When such impulses find a free channel of discharge in terms of mind rather than in terms of physical instinct they become the power of the creative imagination that generates the illusions of romantic love ; they reenforce with their own energies whatever form of the life of the spirit they may press themselves into .

		This mode of releasing a suppressed complex by its alliance with and reenforcement of a higher and freer interest ,
Freud	PERSON	calls `` sublimation , '' and it is a sociological commonplace that civilization is in no small degree the `` sublimation '' of sexual energy .

		But presumption from such considera - tions as these is not proof from the consideration of dreams , and on the basis of the material Freud offers in their interpretation the conclusion to their erogenetic character is unwarranted .

		The use of the `` law of association of ideas '' presents together with its advantages peculiar difficulties .

		It permits us , and there is good warrant for exercising the privilege , to con - ceive the mind as a sort of network of ideas .

		Each is a node from which radiate innumerable strands connecting it with other nodes .

		If , now , any one of these nodes has , for whatever reason , to be suppressed , it pulls down with it , as it goes into the unconscious regions of our mentality , very many other nodes .

		-LRB- This , according to
Freud	LOCATION	, is the basis of forgetting and all the variety of forms of the '' psych opathology of the daily life . '' -RRB-

		The psychoanalytical method con - sists simply in getting hold of some node lying near the surface and by means of its connecting strands lifting to the surface those deeper down .

		Now it is clearly very difficult to determine which of these nodes or complexes that is lifted up has been the efficacious or significant one in the dream .

		Four-fifths of our lives belongs to the unconscious ; and if the analyst is persistent or clever enough , he can raise up the very lowest strata of suppressions , those of our infancy .

		But it is a leap from their unpleasantness , as indicated by the resistance to their coming up , to their actual activity below the level of con - sciousness , and the argument for it has logically the character of a circulus in probando .

		Logically , indeed ,
Freud	ORGANIZATION	is open to attacks on all sides .

		It is easy to demonstrate that he selects his facts to suit his theory , that his total operation is one vast begging of the question .

		It has been done .

		But it has also been done to the Darwinian theory .

		The ultimate test of Freudism lies not in argument but in its clinical adequacy , and in the ease and simplicity with which it applies to other problems and illumi - nates other obscurities in the psychological jungle .

		To me , at least , this `` interpretation of dreams '' is quite acceptable in principle and inconclusive in concrete detail .

		How much this may be due to the redundancies and repetitions , obscurities of style and confusion of thought , I can not say .

		The German editions of which this book is largely an amplified restatement impressed me similarly .

		They seemed full of false starts and wrong scents , the work of a man somewhat over-eager to prove something with data of whose meaning he was not quite sure .

		This impression is reenforced , in the translation , by difficult English , often , in spite of Dr.
Brill	PERSON	's conscientious efforts and evident pains , En - glish that is German , all too German , a diction in which literalness is mistaken for accuracy .

		Many readers of Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's latest book will tend toward the confession theory ; for despite the craft , perhaps even the genius , which .

		has brought together these various papers written during twenty years , there is still an outstand - ing pathos of distance .

		They do not strictly make a book .

		The '' mellowing of time , '' be - * THE PATHOS OF DISTANCE .

		A Book of a Thousand and One Moments .

		By
James Huneker	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 81 spoken in their favor , is not always uniform , one must remember ; for too frequently colors fade unequally .

		The sub-title , `` a book of a thousand and one moments , '' is of course a genial and ingenious '' tale of a tub '' thrown out to divert the very sort of comment here made .

		In one of the more recent essays , `` The Playboy of Western Philosophy , '' the title is a boomerang which cuts shrewdly with a double edge .

		The `` Playboy '' is Professor
Bergson	PERSON	; and he is a `` playboy '' because , Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	says , his philosophy consists of beautiful images with which he dazzles our eyes and hypnotizes our judgment .

		The speciousness of this phrase proclaims its formulator himself as an image - maker , and a maker of false images , too ; for while there is much clever writing in the arraignment of
Bergson	LOCATION	, no understanding is evinced of
Bergson	ORGANIZATION	's biology .

		`` I recall a lecture of his at the
College de France	ORGANIZATION	, though the meaning of his talk has quite escaped my memory because I was studying the personality of the man . ''

		Here is the confession of the phrase-maker : it is not necessary to understand a scientist , one needs merely study his person - ality .

		`` The Playboy of Western Philosophy '' is a clever title , but not a true one .

		So with `` A Philosophy for Philistines , '' by which Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	means pragmatism .

		Alliteration , that trustworthy servitor to phrase-makers , has here betrayed him ; for it is evident from a reading of the paper that the writer does not credit the phrase .

		But in a deeper sense this `` Playboy '' is a boomerang .

		His treatment of
Bergson	ORGANIZATION	pro- claims Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	loudly as the
Playboy of Western Critics	ORGANIZATION	.

		Having ramped genially over the pastures of art , music , and painting -LRB- in - cluding that thing called Impressionism -RRB- , and letters , he leaps boisterously into the field of philosophy without troubling about the gate of science .


Bergson	PERSON	's `` Creative Evolution '' is nothing much to him except an incentive to study the personality of the philosopher , which is human but not critical .

		This `` per - sonal '' element in recent criticism is much run to seed .

		It is the same with his comment on art and letters , though here the chattiness and charm lead one to forgive .

		There is in the volume a very complete and illuminating catalogue of Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	's likes , which as autobiography is delightful .

		For instance : Apropos of
Bergson	PERSON	's `` Le Hire , '' `` I prefer
George Meredith	PERSON	's less metaphysical but more illuminative essay on Comedy . ''

		-LRB- Of course !

		But
Meredith	PERSON	is not metaphysical , and Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	is now doing metaphysics . -RRB-

		Again : '' Said the wise Goethe the wisest man since Montaigne '' ; `` Im - perial-minded Goethe reserved for philosophy but a small province in his vast intellec - tual kingdom . ''

		Compare the foregoing with this : '' .


Ernest Newman	PERSON	has knocked
Wagner	PERSON	's philosophical pretensions to smithereens , as did
Dmitri Merejkowski	PERSON	the hollow sham of
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	's prophetic and religious vaporings . ''

		Now it is all very interesting to know that Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	thinks Montaigne a wiser man than
Kant	PERSON	or
Carlyle	PERSON	or Lincoln or
Emerson	LOCATION	; also that
Tolstoi	PERSON	is a sham ; also that
Baudelaire	PERSON	is a stupendous poet , since he added new material to poetry ; also that
Nietzsche	PERSON	and Villiers de 1 ` Isle Adam are favorites ; also that he is willing to line up with Mr.
Harry Thurston Peck	PERSON	in the dictum that ''
George Moore	PERSON	is the greatest lit - erary artist who has struck the chords of English since the death of Thackeray . ''

		One calls to mind the great
Bentley	PERSON	's remark to Pope , `` Very good , Mr.
Pope	PERSON	, but not Homer . ''

		Very good , Mr.
Huneker	PERSON	, but not criticism .

		In these evaluations there is almost as much serious judgment as in Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's remark that no writer since Homer , not even Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	, filled him with such intel - lectual contempt as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		In `` Matisse ,
Picasso	ORGANIZATION	, and Others '' there is some real criticism which should be helpful to any who confess a curiosity in regard to that trio of phenomena , Cubism , Futurism , and Impressionism .

		Here the writer is at home ; if one were inclined to be hypercritical , it might be said he is a trifle too much at home , he is utterly neglige .

		What , for instance does this mean ?

		`` It is not alone the elliptical route pursued by
Matisse	ORGANIZATION	in his desire to escape the obvious and suppress the inutile , but the crea - tive force of his sinuous emotional line .

		It is a richly fed line , bounding but not wiry , as is
Blake	PERSON	's . ''

		Here are perfectly good English words dripping from the pen of an artist and splashing over the ordinary lines of denotation .

		Such writing grows out of a doubtful conception of the purpose and value of the literary art .

		It is itself the highest ; and compelled to furnish copy of other copies it becomes degraded .


Ruskin	PERSON	's `` finest writing '' was in his early so-called word - painting , of which we remember he grew ashamed later ; his finest writing , however , is in `` Sesame and Lilies , '' `` Fors Clavigera , '' and elsewhere , as he developed the deeper art of 82 THE DIAL -LSB-

		which have recently appeared will be likely to find numerous readers .

		Since the trustworthy sources are limited in number and material , the two books tell the same story , even in many cases to the choice of the same trifling details .

		The most significant difference is that Mr.
Fy	PERSON	vie narrates the story vividly and clearly , while Mr.
Garner	PERSON	's account is ill digested , lacking in relief , and burdened with wearisome details and numerous unnecessary cynicisms at the expense of modern social conditions .

		The Father of Evil himself is not so black as some have painted him ; and
Pope Alexander	PERSON	, who was very generally supposed to have been in alliance with that able but unsctupulous poten - tate , and to have sold him his soul for certain pecuniary considerations , had some very excel - lent traits , chief of which was his tender and devoted love for his children .

		This was perhaps even his strongest characteristic , avarice coming only second ; but like many another virtue , it became the undoing of millions , because it left free reign to the devouring ambition of his son
Caesar	PERSON	, a man who would murder his nearest and dearest , and disregard the most sacred ob - ligation , if he saw the slightest advantage be - yond .

		But the Borgias were not all Caesars , or even Alexanders .

		Mr.
Fyvie	PERSON	dwells delightedly on the pleasant
second half of Lucrezia	DATE	's life , the years spent as a faithful wife and loving mother in
Ferrara	LOCATION	.

		There is no doubt that her early youth was almost as free from scruples as to the value of human life or female virtue as that of her mother or her father 's indescribable mistress Giula Farnese , whose face -LRB- and what more poignantly horrible picture of the state of society in fifteenth century

		is said to be copied in the face of
the Virgin	LOCATION	, by
Pinturicchio	ORGANIZATION	, which appears over the door of one of the rooms in the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	.

		But when , after having lost two husbands , one by divorce and the other at the hands of her brother , she was married to
Alfonso d'Este	PERSON	, who at the death of his father became
Duke of Ferrara	ORGANIZATION	, a change took place at once remark - able and edifying , even if it was not so absolute as some historians who love paradox have main - tained .

		Certainly the most interesting , and probably the most valuable , part of Mr.
Fyvie	PERSON	's book is the pages dealing with manners and cus - toms in the
Duchy of Ferrara	ORGANIZATION	under the excellent
Ercole	PERSON	and his son and successor Alfonso .

		The story is full of vivid contrasts .

		Caesar married a Princess of
Navarre	LOCATION	for purely poli - tical reasons , left her in a few weeks to return to
Italy	LOCATION	, and never , as far as we are able to
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 83 learn , either saw her again or exchanged a line of writing with her .

		But his daughter by this marriage , whom he thus never set eyes on , married that paragon of gallantry , virtue , and generosity , the
French Chevalier Bayard	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lu - crezia , the tenderest of mothers in
Ferrara	LOCATION	, left in
Rome	LOCATION	a three-year-old son by her murdered second husband , and never bothered her charm - ing head about him again .

		And most striking of all , perhaps , is the fact that the unspeakable
Alexander	PERSON	's great-grandson ,
St. Francisco	LOCATION
de Borja	PERSON	, who was born only seven years after the death of his great-grandfather , was not only a man of blameless character , but the most rigor - ous ascetic and most clairvoyant mystic of his generation .

		As a member of the Society of Jesus , he showed such self-forgetful zeal that even
Ignatius Loyola	PERSON	was obliged to restrain his suicidal devotion , and there is little or no exaggeration in the phrase that characterizes him as `` the most illustrious of all conquerors of the appetites and passions of our common nature . ''

		There is no denying the surpassing ability of both
Pope Alexander	PERSON	and his terrible son .

		The year in which
Columbus	LOCATION	found
San Salvador	LOCATION	was also a memorable year in the history of the
Papacy	LOCATION	, for the day when the Spanish cardi - nal
Rodrigo Borja	PERSON	set the Papal crown on
Alex	PERSON	- ander 's head marked the beginning of a new era in the Papal advance toward secular power .

		With a succession of Popes like Alexander VI. , the fiction of Papal supremacy over mere tem - poral rulers might have become a reality .

		And
Caesar	PERSON	, as general of the Papal forces , though he never won a real battle and was perhaps not a great general in the narrow sense of the word , was the most incredibly skilful of strategists .

		His Machiavellian artifices made
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	himself gasp with admiration .

		While father and son worked together , the world in arms was no match for them ; and it required the hand of a mysterious malady probably the plague and possibly poison , which carried off the Pope in

		THE ENGLISH EPIC .

		* At no time in the history of poetry , compared with to-day , could we meditate on the nature and future of the epic with more healthy bewilderment and sound profit .

		We have been told by men as far apart as Brunetiere , the seasoned foe of realism , and
Frank Norris	PERSON	, the young American realist , that the epic has modulated into the novel .

		Yet Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	, with his dangerous but many-colored facility , seems almost to improvise his '' Drake : An English Epic '' in little more than a year , and publishes it serially in a magazine before arriving at the age at which
Longfellow	ORGANIZATION	uttered his noble self-doubt in '' Mezzo Cammin . ''

		We have been told by
Poe	PERSON	and Jby countless followers , with variations of various degrees of absurdity , that a perfect long poem is an impossibility to both its creators , the singer and the reader .

		Yet the long poem , just now , is beginning to attract not only the buoyant younger singers but the most wary and cunning craftsmen .

		We are told by
Benedetto Croce	PERSON	and his disciple Professor
Spingarn	PERSON	that the classification of poems into epics and other genres is futile .

		Yet under the guardian - ship of Professor
William Allan Neilson	PERSON	and Mr.
Oliphant Smeaton	PERSON	are appearing two admirable groups of books on literary types luminous as much from their method as from their mature and learned authors .

		And among the very best of these books I do not hesitate to place Professor
Dixon	PERSON	's `` En - glish Epic and Heroic Poetry . ''

		Before we consider the English epic through an examination of Professor
Dixon	PERSON	's volume , let us have a word with the iconoclasts .

		To those who believe that the novel has supplanted the epic let us recommend a rereading of the '' Idylls of the King '' more discriminating and more richly appreciative than has ever been accorded the poem either by its most ardent admirers at the zenith of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's acceptance or by its modish foes in this period of temporary reaction ; let us recommend a careful re - consideration of the long silences between the spa - cious epic ages of the past ; and let us recommend at least an open-minded curiosity towards the later - day renaissance of the long narrative poem from the dreaming epic episodes of the young Celts to the bluff realism of Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	.

		To those who are satisfied with the neurotic theory of the short poem let us recommend a careful reconsideration of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's '' On Translating Homer , '' espe - cially his words on the sustained nobility of Homer .

		With those who deny the reality of the genre we can scarcely permit ourselves such impertinent brevity .

		Let us state their case , as fairly as we may , with a concise and sweeping paragraph from Professor
Spingarn	PERSON	's `` The New Criticism . '' ''

		We have done with the genres , or literary kinds .

		Their history is inseparably bound up with that of the classical rules .

		Certain works of literature have a general resem - * ENGLISH EPIC AND HEROIC POETRY .

		84 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	blance and are loosely classed together -LRB- for the sake of con - venience -RRB- as lyric , comedy , tragedy , epic , pastoral , and the like ; the classicists made of each of these divisions a fixed norm governed by inviolable laws .

		The separation of the genres was a consequence of this law of classicism : comedy should not be mingled with tragedy , nor epic with lyric .

		But no sooner was the law enunciated than it was broken by an artist impatient or ignorant of its restraints , and the critics have been obliged to explain away these violations of their laws , or gradually to change the laws themselves .

		But if art is organic expression , and every work of art is to be interrogated with the question , ' What has it expressed , and how completely ? '

		there is no place for the question whether it has conformed to some convenient classification of critics or to some law derived from this classification .

		The lyric , the pastoral , the epic , are abstractions without concrete reality in the world of art .

		Poets do not write epics , pastorals , lyrics ; they express themselves , and this expression is their only form .

		There are not , therefore ^ only three , or ten , or a hundred literary kinds ; there are as many kinds as there are individual poets .

		But it is in the field of literary history that this error is most obvious .

		Shakspere wrote '
King Lear	PERSON	, ' '
Venus	PERSON	and Adonis , ' and a sequence of sonnets .

		What becomes of Shakspere , the creative artist , when these three works are separated from one another by the historian of poetry ; when they lose their connection with his single creative soul , and are classified with other works with which they have only a loose and vague relation ?

		To slice up the history of English Liter - ature into compartments marked comedy , tragedy , lyric , and the like , is to be guilty of a complete misunderstanding of the meaning of Criticism ; and literary history becomes a logical absurdity when its data are not organically related but cut up into sections , and placed in such compartments as these / ' To many this argument will reveal itself porous with fallacies .

		Yet it aims at a mortal centre , and it has a plausible ring .

		We may , however , note imme - diately the injustice of the phrase `` to slice up the history of English Literature into compartments '' when we realize that the relation of one writer 's works with another 's is often marked by a contin - uity at least almost as close as the relation between two works of the same author .

		The relation be - tween
Malory	PERSON	's `` Morte Darthur '' and
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Idylls of the King '' is surely as '' organic '' as the relation of the `` Idylls of the King '' and `` Maud '' ; the glittering currents of
Ariosto	PERSON	's ``
Orlando Fu	LOCATION	- rioso '' flow far more unbrokenly than the youthful play of modesty and pride of `` The Shepheards Calender '' and the affected sombreness of `` The Complaints '' in Spenser 's `` Fae `` rie Queene , '' and flow with a fuller swell .

		The line of causation from ''
King Lear	PERSON	'' to
Geoffrey of Monmouth	ORGANIZATION	is as inexorable as the line that leads us back to `` Venus and Adonis . ''

		We may believe all this without being as impatient of the individual as
Taine	LOCATION	, or as cocksure about the annihilation of the individual at death as a scientist .

		Moreover the classification into genres does not necessitate a neglect of an author 's other works ; on the contrary the writer of a book on the short-story would prob - ably find himself forced to touch upon
Hawthorne	PERSON	' * `` Scarlet Letter '' and
Poe	PERSON	's poems , and , of a cer - tainty , De Maupassant 's ''
Pierre	PERSON	et Jean '' with its critical preface .

		To say that there are as many forms as poets is to dazzle us with a valuable but dangerous half-truth , which may lead straight into that romantic anarchy which Professor
Babbitt	PERSON	has so well diagnosed in his `` New LaokoOn . ''

		`` Poets do not write epics , '' says Professor
Spingarn	PERSON	, `` they express themselves . ''

		Truly a good epigram to warn a Ronsard as he approaches his Franciade ; good counsel for a
George Seude	PERSON	` ry , a
Blackmore	LOCATION	, a
Joel Barlow	PERSON	!

		But is it quite enough to say that
Virgil	PERSON	and the feudal rhapsodist of the Chanson , iron , brave , pious , and
Milton	PERSON	with his immense and lifelong purposes sought merely to express them - selves ?

		The laws of the neo-classical critics were inadequate for the romantic poets .

		So is the Mosaic law for a twentieth century captain of industry .

		Is law then a ridiculous impossibility ?

		Doubtless we must always have our literary dualism , our Ormuzd and Ahriman , classicism and romanticism , eternally warring `` lest one good custom should corrupt the world . ''

		But laws may be at once flexible and mighty ; and the epic , a vast struc - ture , like De Quincey 's cathedral leagues long , though we can not always outline its immensity , is no phantom .

		Professor
Dixon	PERSON	, in his first chapter , takes issue perforce with the literary anarchists .

		He quotes
Croce	PERSON	's onslaught on `` the theory of literary and artistic classes '' and , while considering him `` in the main , no doubt right , '' deems it `` convenient to place together for purposes of comparison the Iliad and
Beowulf	LOCATION	,
Virgil	PERSON	and
Milton	PERSON	, to discuss under the same title poems which resemble each other , have points in common , follow the same models , aim at giving the same kind of pleasure . ''

		`` Such a method , '' he insists , `` has its uses and can not be abandoned . ''

		It is interesting to place cheek by jowl Professor
Spingarn	PERSON	's notions of the significance of art as expression and Professor
Dixon	PERSON	's . ''

		If art is organic expression , '' avers the disciple of
Croce	PERSON	, `` and every work of art is to be interrogated with the question , ` What has it expressed , and how com - pletely ? '

		there is no place for the question whether it has conformed to some convenient classification of critics or to some law derived from this classifi - cation . ''

		One can but vote this word `` expression , '' which Professor
Spingarn	PERSON	uses with such finality , a very slippery term when he reads in Professor
Dixon	PERSON	's book that `` the offer made by the artist is simply the offer of expression ; he professes form , and by form he must be judged . ''

		Professor
Dixon	PERSON	compromises a little , calling the criticism of the genres scientific , as opposed to aesthetic criticism to which he would give other values .

		I would protest against this as a misleading classification and retort that the term aesthetic may well be given to the criticism which considers any aspect of what Pater happily called `` mind in style . ''

		But this is not so disappointing as the rather hesitant attitude that shadows Professor
Dixon	PERSON	's learned and shrewd ac - count of `` The Idea of Epic '' as revealed in scores of poets and critics .

		It is too bad that Professor
Dixon	PERSON	does not assume magisterial robes and define the epic roundly .

		One thinks of
Arnold	LOCATION	's memor - able definition of the
Grand Style	ORGANIZATION	.

		Doubtless Pro- fessor
Dixon	PERSON	has the academician 's fear of an early
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 85 shipwreck .

		To be sure , literary history is strewn with the flotsam and jetsam of definitions ; but we should be kindled by the names that have been illumined with nothing more than the bright frag - ments of definitions .

		We should remember Buffon on style .

		To the creative critic there is no challenge more alluring than the challenge of definition .

		We can but suggest in passing that Professor
Dixon	PERSON	's structure begins to totter in his discussion of the epic of growth and the epic of culture or art , a classifi - cation made memorable by
Theodore Watts-Dunton	PERSON	in his great essay on poetry , but a classification that leads to sure confusion .

		Professor
Dixon	PERSON	is unusually wary in his treatment of it , but the critic who will give us the great definition of epic in our time will recognize it as a Charybdis that no one can gaze into , however guardedly , without growing dizzy .

		He will approach Charybdis with deep-sea mines and will blast it .

		One could analyze Professor
Dixon	PERSON	's reflections here , and quibble with page after page as he is whirled about in
Charybdis	LOCATION	; but one should add that few have managed the matter with more caution and discernment .

		He sees his way out of it when he writes that `` Homer , to whom
Virgil	PERSON	was confessedly a debtor , owed , who can say how much , to previous bards , nor was the process by which the poet of culture moulded his work wholly and absolutely dissimilar from that which Homer , the last of his line , himself employed . ''

		He goes so far as to assert that `` To draw between authentic and literary epic a final distinction , if possible , is not desirable . ''

		But he sinks back with a justification of the old classification which , though ingenious and unhackneyed , is certainly not final .

		Then there is Scylla to be reckoned with the old turmoil about epic and romance .

		Here again , Professor
Dixon	PERSON	, on the plea that `` it may please us to distinguish , to untwist and unlay the composing strands , but no one can indicate the moment at which poetry ceases to be heroic because it is too romantic , '' shows how well he has learned caution from the romantic dis - ruption of Augustan dogma but -LRB- may the reviewer repeat it without appearing to urge Hector to the fight only to disappear like the false god in the guise of Deiphobus ? -RRB-

		it is high time for the critic , with his new and spacious perspective , to lay down the law boldly in this matter .

		Nor would I concede that my sterner method would lead to a position half as stifling as that to which Professor
Dixon	PERSON	, for all his flexibility , finds himself led when he maintains that `` restriction rather than inspiration belongs to the nature of criticism , to warn rather than prescribe , '' a concession that critics as far apart as
Boileau	PERSON	and
Lessing	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	would certainly have united in questioning and a concession that many a richly endowed `` artist '' would gratefully honor them by spurning .

		We must pause frequently to reiterate our admiration for Professor
Dixon	PERSON	's care - ful attempt to legislate without allowing his keel to grate in the shallows of pedantry . ''

		The rules , like that for the exclusion of the marvellous or fantastic element , laid down by the critics , would have excluded from the role of epic poets , if rigidly applied , names the most brilliant , had they not indeed made of it a total blank .

		Yet impatience , however justified , of the ab - surd demands and manifest contradictions of the law-givers has its danger if it hurry one into a contempt for all rules of art .

		Like Nature , art too has its laws ; the difficulty is to ascertain them .

		They are not written large upon its sur - face , nor are
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's , yet we may perhaps believe them in part discoverable , even if subtle and withdrawn . ''

		But Professor
Dixon	PERSON	's new laws , if laws they may be called , are hinted with an avowed diffidence that will disappoint many who are now starving for critics who will seek those laws with something not only of the scientist 's patient and cautious experi - mentation and collection of data but something of his noble arrogance .

		Let us take an example of Pro- fessor
Dixon	PERSON	's unbalanced caution .

		He would give up '' principles which lead to exclusion '' but '' seek principles of inclusion '' -LRB- a timid judicial attitude the dangers of which we need not dwell upon in passing -RRB- ; and he urges even these principles of inclusion with noticeable hesitancy of phrase .

		And after outlining such laws , for all his rich learning and his sane individual thinking of the first-rate academician , we are not surprised to find them summed up rather palely in a kind of definition full of that uncertainty which the foes of the humanist are constantly over-urging against him .

		But little uncertainty dims the author 's catholic appreciation of his vast materials .

		To one who has seen our American academicians make `` Beowulf '' a curious and stupid gargoyle for the sophomore student of the history of English literature , to one who has heard a majority of teachers admit com - placently that Spenser bored them , and who has felt in many scholastic publications that the masterpieces were simply tolerated as the material for a `` discov - ery , '' it is most refreshing to breathe the spirit of this English scholar who can relish both
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	and
Scott	PERSON	, who writes of all periods with a verve that stimulates even when the comment is established truth , and who , without the aid of `` discovery '' or paradox , can write for the most part with sound individuality .

		Professor
Dixon	PERSON	's style is at times rather heavy .

		On the other hand he can marshal the vexed and intricate problems of the ballad with an admirable breadth ; and when he grows eloquent over such a poem as `` Beowulf , '' which , thank Heaven , he is not afraid to call incomparable , he writes with vigor and glow of phrase .

		A discerning sympathy is indeed almost omnipresent .

		To be sure there are some who , remembering in the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	`` Judith '' the wild banquet-scene , the nobility and strange devout ferocity in the portrait of the heroine , the clash of the last battle , will be loath to admit the poem `` tamer in spirit '' than the Old English `` Genesis '' or even the `` Exodus . ''

		But seldom will the lover of English literature find nig - gardly appreciation .

		It is easy , for instance , after
Arnold	PERSON	has led the way , to make a shrewd cut at the 86 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	Puritan .

		It is not easy to write of the comrades of
Milton	LOCATION	in terms as sure and eloquent as these : '' Clearly the Puritan suffered from disabilities , but as clearly he gained heights of seriousness .

		Baxter dates one of his epistles , '
London	LOCATION	at the door of Eternity . '

		Such a mood , even if it be disinclined to dip its pencil in the hues of the rainbow , often rivals in imaginative passion the in - spiration derived by secular poets from love or patriotism or heroic enterprise . ''

		It is but inevitable that the reader should occa - sionally question a detached generalization or a comment .

		To one who is not so skeptical , in the midst of the scattered reaction against the study of race-traits as to deny
Arnold	LOCATION	's attribution to the
Norman	PERSON	of `` the love of strenuousness , clearness , and rapidity , the high Latin spirit , '' and
Taine	PERSON	's exuberance over
Norman	PERSON	polish ,
Norman	PERSON	wariness ,
Norman	PERSON	flexibility , the rose-window , simple , yet like the flower itself , the clusters of columns fusing solidity and grace , in fine , the facile mind , copious , inquisitive , chivalrous , to such a one it seems a dubious comment to dwell upon that period of con - fusion which marked the first meetings of such a spirit with the noble but monotonous
Saxon	PERSON	grandeur as '' degradation '' when the discords were so soon to be resolved into such mellow concords .

		We wonder why this book should tell us of
Mannyng	ORGANIZATION	's `` Handlynge Synne '' and nothing of his quaint , garrulous adaptation of Langtoft 's chronicle .

		In asserting that the episode of Sin and Death is the only mediaeval lapse in '' Paradise Lost '' where '' for the rest ... is a world in which the laws of beauty and of taste prevail , '' Professor
Dixon	PERSON	is hardly just to what may be without paradox called the ugly magnificence of the famous allegory , and he seems to forget such cruder imaginings as the periodical transformation of the devils into serpents devouring apples of ashes as well as many details in the great battle-scene , in the description of
Eden	ORGANIZATION	in its blessed - ness , and in the eloquent but interminable preaching of
Raphael	PERSON	.

		Professor
Dixon	PERSON	considers the method of the chronicle plays the '' reverse of epic , '' and quotes with too much sweep
Pater	PERSON	's generalization that ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	's kings are not , nor are meant to be , great men , '' whereas he should have found one of his richest climaxes in an elaborate discussion of the great trilogy on
Henry IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
Henry V.	PERSON	, of which the last play is less of a drama than a mirac - ulously sustained epic ode aglow with the exaltation of the hero from a variation of the '' male Cinder - ella '' type -LRB- so dear to English democracy in
Beowulf	LOCATION	,
Havelok	LOCATION	,
Gareth	PERSON	, and a hundred others -RRB- , to the most majestic and kindly and English of
England	LOCATION	's kings .

		Perhaps it is a special and a warped interest that makes me question the proportions of a discussion of seventeenth century heroic poetry which chooses the '' Davideis , '' '' Gondibert , '' and '' Pharonnida '' as the types , and does not even mention the far greater religious epics of the
Fletchers	ORGANIZATION	.

		But even if this is voted a crotchet of mine , I can at least add that it is perhaps this omission that betrays Professor
Dixon	PERSON	into a glaring error when he acclaims '' Para - dise Regained '' as '' the first attempt , outside of Scripture narrative , to draw the portrait of the
Founder of Christianity	ORGANIZATION	.

		I have gone beyond all bounds in my janglings with a book to which I owe a profound gratitude .

		The epic of mediaeval and modern literature has generally daunted the scholarly critic , as it has tempted the belletristic trifler to indulge in general - izations which make a lover of epic inarticulate with rage .

		Since Professor
Ker	PERSON	's '' Epic and Romance '' I know of no study of this kind as good as Pro- fessor
Dixon	PERSON	's `` English Epic and Heroic Poetry . ''

		Dare I add now , in this very moment of contrition over my brawlings , that I am consumed with a de - sire , which space forbids , to break lances with Pro- fessor
Dixon	PERSON	over
Spenser	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	?

		Professor
Dixon	PERSON	has , to a certain extent , broken away from the epicure distaste for
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's allegory , that for most romantic readers began with
Hurd	ORGANIZATION	and culmi - nated in
Lowell	LOCATION	's brilliant Luciferian utterances .

		But Professor
Dixon	PERSON	is , from my special angle , too sympathetic still with those who , like
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	and
Lowell	PERSON	, hold `` The Faerie Queene '' to be a mere gallery of pictures for the luxurious dilettante ; and he is too hesitant in accepting the results of much recent work on
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	's allegory which , when treated synthetically , will give Spenser credit for a high seriousness at present more than half denied him by most critics except that rare spirit just departed ,
Edward Dowden	PERSON	.

		And I can but regret that Professor
Dixon	PERSON	has keyed his account of
Tennyson	PERSON	's `` Idylls of the King '' to
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's whims , which have inoculated us in this age of tem - porary depreciation of
Tennyson	LOCATION	.

		I should rejoice in writing here an elaborate apologia for
Tennyson	PERSON	that would heighten Professor
Dixon	PERSON	's own judicious praise , and would go as far as to hold a brief for the '' Idylls of the King '' as the epic of nineteenth century
England	LOCATION	.

		Yet since this is material for a book and not for a review , I can not do better than quote these words of Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	's : '' If a critic has , as he ought to have , any of the functions anciently attributed to a prophet , it ought not to be difficult for him to prophesy that
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	will pass through a period of facile condemnation and neglect before we arrive at a true appreciation of his work . ''

		And since I know that many -LRB- especially those with whom it has become a fashion to retail Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's now conventional jeer against
Tenny	PERSON	-
eon	ORGANIZATION	's
Arthur	PERSON	as a conventional country curate of
Victorian England	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will raise their eyebrows at my last assertions , I will cover my retreat with two more suggestive quotations from Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	. ''

		That
Tennyson	PERSON	felt that lyrical enthusiasm could be de - voted to established customs , to indefensible and ineradic - able national constitutions , to the dignity of time and the empire of unutterable common sense , all this did not make him a tamer poet but an infinitely more original one .

		Any poetaster can describe a thunderstorm ; it requires a poet to describe the ancient and quiet sky . '' ''

		The constitution \ n '' An Economic Interpretation of economically the Constitution of the
United States	LOCATION	interpreted .

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Professor
Charles A. Beard	PERSON	makes the point that , as in natural science no organism is pretended to be understood so long as its merely superficial aspects are described , so in history no movement by a mass of people can be comprehended until that mass is resolved into its component parts .

		He shows that during the period of the
Federation	ORGANIZATION	commercial conditions in the
States	LOCATION	were becoming progressively worse .

		The interest on governmental paper was unpaid , and the value of such documents was reduced to a minimum .

		There was a tendency to repudiate public debt , and to issue depreciated paper money as legal tender .

		The call for a revision of the Articles came chiefly from the commercial centres ; and the agitation was largely kept up by the creditor class , who realized the insecurity of their interests under the existing conditions .

		A large proportion of the members of the Constitutional Convention were holders of such paper as would be increased in value by the pro- posed organization .

		He examines minutely into the individual holdings of the members , by means of the records in the
Treasury Department	ORGANIZATION	and similar documentary evidence , showing who favored and who opposed the various proposals .

		He reviews the campaign for the adoption of the Constitution , and shows that the well organized commercial classes were leaders throughout in favor of the document .

		On the other hand the opposition came chiefly from the farmer and debtor classes .

		In the popular vote for delegates to the
State	ORGANIZATION	ratification conventions , only about one-third of the adult males voted , and the Constitution was ratified by a vote of probably not more than one-sixth of the adult males .

		It was not ratified by the whole people , nor by the States , but by the consolidated group of interests who knew no state boundaries .

		Under such circumstances it was natural that the Constitution should be essentially a commercial document .

		Un - fortunately , in regard to some of his points , the author seems more like the holder of a brief than an impartial seeker for truth .

		He tells us that in the
Connecticut	LOCATION	ratification convention , out of one hundred and twenty-eight men who voted for ratification sixty-five were holders of public securi - ties , their names being given ; but he does not tell what proportion of the opponents held such papers .

		In the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	convention we note that eigh - teen out of the forty-seven who voted for ratification were men of education ; while only two of their twenty-three opponents are thus characterized , and of one of these it is recorded , `` In deference to his constituents he did not sign the ratification . ''

		Pro- fessor Beard does not call attention to this fact ; but is it not possible that the supporters of the new Constitution , because they were men of broader education , therefore realized more fully the neces - sity for the Constitution ?

		Many of the opposition were men of means also .

		Only among the opposi - tion was there objection to the prohibition relative to the impairment of contract .

		May not the framers of the Constitution have been more actuated by a desire for honesty than by sordid reasons ?

		We fear that the ultimate effect of Professor Beard 's work may be harmful , because of its singleness of view it tends to give an erroneous impression and to foster unjustified class antagonism .

		Roval masques In her volume entitled `` Court Mas - in the days ques of James L : Their Influence on of
James I. Shakespeare	PERSON	and the Public Thea - tres '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , an absorbing wealth of material regarding the Jacobean masque is presented by Dr.
Mary Sullivan	PERSON	, who has been investigating a field hitherto little known to students of English litera - ture .

		The chief theme of the book is thus indicated : `` In a monarchy so personal as that of
England	LOCATION	under
James	PERSON	, everything done by the monarch or by any of his family had a diplomatic as well as a social bearing , and in the case of the masque the diplomatic , under cover of the social , seems to have been of greatest significance .

		To know this signifi - cance , one must discover , with accurate historic detail , the diplomatic relations of the countries con - cerned . ''

		The first four chapters of the book are devoted to a somewhat over-leisurely recital of the way in which
England	LOCATION	's favor was accorded first to
Spain	LOCATION	and then to
France	LOCATION	, through the medium of invitations and other special honors connected with the royal masques .

		The last two chapters discuss the cost of dramatic productions in the court , and , briefly , the influence of diplomatic conditions upon literature .

		With the enthusiasm and tireless energy of the critical scholar , Dr.
Sullivan	PERSON	has pursued her researches , and has brought together , in footnotes and in a copious appendix , a host of letters and other documents , public and private , to support her statements .

		It is this material , reprinted carefully in the original English or French , which will be of greatest interest ; for here is matter , pleasantly en - dited , full of references to the pomp and circum - stance of the presentation of masques .

		In flashes one discovers , now a hint of the rivalries and piques of statesmen ; now , the inordinate vanity of the noble performers ; now , the wanton extravagance of the English in jewels , costumes , and scenery .

		These precise facts about
King James	PERSON	,
Queen Anne	PERSON	, and
Prince Charles	PERSON	, and the allusions to the `` Masque of Blackness '' or to the `` Masque of
Queens	LOCATION	'' and others , give the reader a keen sense of being a wit - ness of the performances , and of observing in per - son the men and manners and masquers .

		Possibly the book is rather too sternly academic , and presup - poses too much knowledge of masques to make it attractive to the general reader ; but the student of drama will appreciate very warmly this contribution to dramatic criticism .

		The publishers announce that two companion volumes by this author are in preparation , `` Court Masques of Elizabeth '' and `` Court Masques of Charles I. '' 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	A half-forgotten The brave and modest patriot of hero of the whom
Horace Greeley	PERSON	said , '' The Country 's salvation claims no nobler sacrifice than that of
James S. Wadsworth	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, '' has long deserved a biography as carefully compiled and as handsomely published as Mr.
Henry Greenleaf Pearson	PERSON	's large , illustrated octavo which worthily commemorates the citizen-soldier 's benefi - cent life , under the title , ''
James S. Wadsworth	PERSON	of
Geneseo	LOCATION	, Brevet Major-General of United States Volunteers '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The
Connecticut Wads	ORGANIZATION	- worths are known to fame especially through those three illustrious representatives of the name , Captain
Joseph Wadsworth	PERSON	, of Charter-Oak renown , General
James Wadsworth	PERSON	, who distinguished himself in both the French and Indian War and the Revolution , and Colonel
Jeremiah Wadsworth	PERSON	,
Commissary General	ORGANIZATION	under
Greene	PERSON	when the latter took charge of the quartermaster 's department .

		Of the same sturdy stock as these men was
James Samuel Wads	PERSON	- worth , eldest son of
James	PERSON	, who had early left
Connecticut	LOCATION	to acquire lands in the
Genesee	LOCATION	valley , and
Naomi Wolcott	PERSON	, cousin of
Oliver Wolcott	PERSON	,
Secre	PERSON	- tary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	in
Washington	LOCATION	's cabinet .

		A few years of study at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and in the
Yale Law School	ORGANIZATION	, in
Daniel Webster	PERSON	's office and in that of
McKean	PERSON	and
Denniston	PERSON	at
Albany	LOCATION	, preceded his settlement at
Geneseo	LOCATION	to look after the extensive family estates ; for though he was admitted to the bar in
1833	DATE	, he never practised his profession .

		Of his intelligent and generous aid to sundry good causes , his services to his country in war-time , especially his gallantry in the battles of Bull Run -LRB- first battle -RRB- ,
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, and the Wilderness , and his death from a mortal wound received when trying to rally his men in the last-named engage - ment , Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	writes with adequate fulness and from the most authoritative sources .

		With so little in the way of personal or family records to rely upon , the wonder is that he has pieced out so com - plete a biography .

		Portraits , maps , footnotes , ap - pended matter , and index are all provided in due form and proportion .

		The book is of permanent value and also of especial interest in this semi-centennial year of one of the great battles it describes .

		Hard-won A. hard wrestle with death , prolonged convictions of , , , , .

		j r , spiritual during several months , induced some realities .

		very serious thinking in Sir
Francis Younghusband	PERSON	, and these meditations on the deep things of existence are presented by him in a volume entitled `` Within : Thoughts During Convalescence '' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Tossed and trampled by that twentieth - century monster , the automobile , the writer under - went far more than the agony of the average death , but his strong constitution and will to live brought him through with an incidental store of inner expe - rience that was well worth relating .

		Somewhat in the manner of Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	's analysis and description of his two years ' struggle with nervous prostration , familiar to readers of `` Thy Rod and Thy Staff , '' this victim of an almost complete physi - cal collapse paints his sufferings in a few strong and telling strokes , and then proceeds to deduce the moral , so far as it seems to him to be deduci - ble .

		Like Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, he too emerges from the soul-trying experience with strong convictions of an eternal something not ourselves ; or , rather , in the present instance this undying principle is felt to be an impersonal force of which we are a part , while with Mr.
Benson	PERSON	it takes the form of an external personal deity .

		The force as conceived by Sir
Francis Younghusband	PERSON	, however , is not blind and purposeless , but intelligently striving to perfect itself ; it is , he says , `` a vital , propelling impulse vibrating through us all , expressing itself and fulfill - ing its purpose through us , and uniting us together in one vast spiritual unity . ''

		The same thought has , of course , already received more elaborate expres - sion elsewhere , as in Professor
Royce	PERSON	's `` The World and the Individual , '' but taken in connection with the circumstances that led to its formulation , this creed of Sir
Francis Younghusband	PERSON	's is interesting reading , and it has that tone of conviction which comes only from an unforgettable personal experi - ence .

		The writer 's clear and readable style is marred by a few imperfections , due evidently to insufficient care .

		When he tells us that `` there is a higher kind of courage than physical courage .

		We feel that moral courage is of a higher degree '' -LRB- the italics are his -RRB- , he seems quite needlessly to confuse two very different things , kind and degree .

		He also disfigures his pages with the repeated use of `` will '' for `` shall , '' and of `` would '' for `` should . ''

		Manners and p ew can now fi n -LRB- j the time , even if morals in the .11 .1 T .

		i .1 eighteenth * ne y have the inclination , to read the century .

		voluminous letters and memoirs of Sir
Horace Walpole	PERSON	, unsurpassed though his pleasant pages are as a picture of the age in which he lived and of the notable persons with whom he was ac - quainted .

		Hence the value of Miss
Alice Drayton Greenwood	PERSON	's compendious volume , ''
Horace Wai	PERSON	- pole 's World : A Sketch of
Whig Society	ORGANIZATION	under
George III	PERSON	. ''

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book 's nine chap - ters treat of
Walpole	LOCATION	himself , the literary activities of his hours of leisure , the taste of the period in which he lived , travel , ways and means , French society before the Revolution , king 's ministers and king 's friends , some of
Walpole	LOCATION	's high-born lady friends , and , finally , the '' legend '' of
Charles James Fox	PERSON	, a legend of statesmanlike qualities and achievements which the writer refuses to take on trust .

		Walpole 's friends and acquaintances , and such incidents and anecdotes as throw light on his times , are skilfully and in a scholarly manner intro - duced as occasion makes fitting .

		Curious is it to note
Walpole	LOCATION	's complaint of the increasing cost of material and labor when he was building Strawberry Hill a century and a half ago . ''

		You would be frightened at the dearness of everything , '' he writes in
1762	DATE	; '' I build out of economy , for unless I do now , in two years I shall not be able to afford it . ''

		Miss
Greenwood	PERSON	's praise of the literary style of the
1913	DATE	-RSB- 89 period under discussion seems a bit excessive to those less enthusiastic in their admiration for graces of rhetoric so carefully studied .

		More might have been made of the famous friendship of the two Horaces ,
Walpole	LOCATION	and
Mann	PERSON	; but of this Mr.
Sieve	PERSON	- king has lately written at length .

		The occasional familiar ''
Horry	PERSON	'' as a designation of
Walpole	LOCATION	could perhaps have been dispensed with in a book dealing with the dignified and formally correct eighteenth century .

		Good portraits and views adorn the volume , its frontispiece reproducing a hitherto unpublished pastel of
Walpole	LOCATION	by
Rosalba	PERSON	, the pro- perty of the late Lady
Dorothy Nevill	PERSON	.

		Miss Green - wood has packed into her two hundred and fifty pages a great amount and variety of instructive and entertaining matter .

		Her task was worth under - taking , and she has performed it well .

		Before the Mr.
Weedon Grossmith	PERSON	, son of Behind the d
George Grossmith	PERSON	the successful footlights .

		journalist , lecturer , and entertainer , whose fame was at its height forty or fifty years ago , brother of the late well-known actor , manager , and playwright , Mr.
George Grossmith	PERSON	, and uncle of two actors of the
Grossmith	PERSON	family and name , has won for himself distinction as an artist , actor , theatre - manager , and playwright , and in his volume of rem - iniscences , `` From Studio to Stage '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , shows himself to be an author with an entertaining , often amusing style , and well furnished with the where - withal to make a very readable book .

		On his last page he gives as his motto , '' Nothing matters , '' which of course must be taken with considerable deductions ; but his good-humored readiness to ex - pose his own youthful follies , and to tell amusing stories at his own expense , proves at any rate that he is not one to over-estimate the importance of trifles .

		His account of his schoolboy escapades , his study of art and his successes as a portrait-painter , the run of hard luck that caused him to forsake the palette and brush for the stage , and his ups and downs in the precarious profession of a public entertainer , is all told with humorous frankness and a quite engag - ing interest in his own performance in the drama of life .

		In a characteristic passage he informs us : `` My dear old friends
Toole	PERSON	and Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	used to be greatly amused with my
Music Hall imi	ORGANIZATION	- tations .

		I was called upon frequently to give them , and no one seemed to enjoy them more than the First gentleman in
Europe	LOCATION	, before whom I gave them more than once . ''

		These amateur imperson - ations paved the way from the studio to the stage ; but that one who had had a number of paintings exhibited at the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	should look back with some regret at the change of calling , is not surprising .

		Several of his pictures are reproduced for his book , which has also the illustrations suitable to an actor 's autobiography .

		The very name `` Gros - smith '' on the title-page is enough to ensure the readable quality of the volume 's often piquantly personal contents .

		,1 i , ,1 the eighteenth lectual conditions in the eighteenth century .

		century that Mr.
E. S. Roscoe	PERSON	, in his new volume entitled '' The English Scene in the Eighteenth Century '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , should treat of only three cities as embodying the life of the time , and that one of these cities should be important as a mere social appendage of one of the others and the third should be significant more of the next century than of the eighteenth .


London	LOCATION	was the
England	LOCATION	of the time , Bath was its pleasure resort , and
Liverpool	ORGANIZATION	was the seaport which connected it with the Colonies and marked the way towards the greatness of the Empire .

		Its population is consid - ered with almost equal simplicity .

		The nobility was socially and almost politically supreme ; the middle class was just beginning to make itself industrially felt , but did not yet bulk very largely on the national consciousness ; the tradesman was ignored .

		Conse - quently we obtain in a comprehensive glance a pretty intelligent view of the whole period , and , presented attractively as it is by Mr.
Roscoe	PERSON	, a very pleasant one .

		We are made acquainted with the great lords and ladies , the
Duke of Grafton	ORGANIZATION	, who would adjourn a cabinet meeting for a race meeting , and the Duchess of Devonshire , who made
Sheridan	PERSON	's political career , at least in its beginnings , possible ; we visit Bath , more tyrannically ruled by
Beau Nash	PERSON	than ever was
England	LOCATION	by the Stuarts ; we meet the ladies and gentlemen who worked and played at literature ; and we watch the
Wedgwoods	PERSON	rise to prominence through their industrial energy and inventiveness .

		It is on the whole a very enlivening picture .

		There is no attempt to go beneath the scene , to penetrate into the thought of the century as
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	did , or to dwell upon its history as did Lecky .

		The literary judgments are appreciative and occasionally dilettante .

		When one has finished reading the book , one realizes that the people of the eighteenth cen - tury enjoyed life , and rarely let their morals inter - fere with their enjoyment .

		A Jesuit ^ on J uan de
Austria	LOCATION	, the gifted and on the hero ill-starred illegitimate son of Charles ofLepanto .

		t h e pif ^ o f s pa i nj has received so relatively small a share of attention from
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	historians that Lady
Moreton	PERSON	's translation of Padre
Luis Coloma	PERSON	's `` Story of Don
John	PERSON	of Aus - tria '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- provides the English-speaking public with a certain amount of new material .


Padre Coloma	LOCATION	's election to membership in the
Spanish Academy	ORGANIZATION	was due largely to this book , which was hailed in
Spain	LOCATION	as a new departure in the use of the method of the romance for the sake of adding interest to historical writing .

		The novelty consists in the occasional resort to the expedient of suspense , and in frequent discussion of mental processes which must be for the most part gratuitous conjecture .

		The author refrains , in general , from citing author - ities , although the engaging progress of a really eloquent narrative is interfered with occasionally 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	by the insertion of one of
King Philip	LOCATION	's tedious and turgid epistles , or of Don
John	PERSON	's loyal and involved responses .

		The author 's position is frankly that of a patriotic Spanish Catholic , who can see no good in Moorish infidels or Dutch heretics ; in casuistry , that of a thoroughgoing Jesuit , he qualifies the intrigue that resulted in the capture and assassina - tion of a Moorish chieftain , as '' a plot which would have been iniquitous had it not been against such a scoundrel as
Aben Humeya	PERSON	'' ; and of an enthusiastic and determined eulogist , whose work , if on the whole fairly trustworthy , nevertheless paints his hero a little brighter , and his hero 's enemies a little darker , than do other authorities .

		An interesting addition to the copies of portraits with which the book is generously illustrated , is a paragraph of discussion of each , dealing both with the subject and with the original painting .

		The translation is somewhat amateurish .


Ravenna	LOCATION	: it ,
Ravenna	LOCATION	has always played a great greatnett and part in the history of
Europe	LOCATION	; of ittbeautv .

		one period the confused and half - barbaric centuries that lie between antiquity and the Middle Age it is now the only surviving monu - ment .

		Why a city so solitary , so inaccessible , so remote , should have had such unique importance is the question which Mr.
Edward Hutton	PERSON	sets himself to answer in his delightful volume ''
Ravenna	LOCATION	: A Study '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		He defines his purpose as `` an essay in memoriam of her greatness , her beauty , and her forlorn hope . ''

		Beginning with
Ravenna	LOCATION	's first entrance into history when
Julius Caesar	PERSON	chose it as his headquarters while treating with the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	before crossing the Rubicon , continuing through the epoch of the great tragedy of the decline and fall of the Roman administration , the story is brought down through the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, through the period when it was beloved of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Boccaccio	PERSON	, down to our modern time , as the favorite of
Byron	PERSON	,
Carducci	PERSON	, and poetic souls gen - erally .

		Very beautiful indeed are the illustrations by Mr.
Harald Sund	PERSON	, both in color and in line drawings .

		Three sketch maps add to the book 's value , especially for the tourist .

		Few writers seem capable of self - re8 t raint when Ital y is their Subject .

		But
M. Andre * Maurel	PERSON	, in the second volume of his `` Little Cities of
Italy	LOCATION	-LRB- Putnam -RRB- , outdoes even the customary extravagance in writing .

		Take for example such a feverish passage as this : '' I am fascinated , lost , my limbs are weak , my heart empty .

		I am exalted and dejected , at the same time staggering and walking on air .

		I no longer know anything , my eyes burn , and when I shut them I see the hundred thousand fires of a kaleidoscope turning round under my eye-lids .

		Is it possible ?

		Was such magnificence ever created ?

		Did men ever exist capable of conceiving such visions and realizing them as fixed things ? ''

		In straightforward speech , this means that the author has arrived in
Ravenna	LOCATION	the night previous and is about to sally forth to see the city , his state being , to quote again , `` Why wish to understand ?

		It is so sweet to feel ! ''

		Naturally this Post-Impressionist attitude of mind in litera - ture results , as it does in art , in offering pictures with blurred outlines and colors all running into each other .

		However , the painter usually has the goodness to affix a tag to his canvas which furnishes something of a clue to the beholder .

		Not so Mon - sieur Maurel .

		His table of contents consists of such chapter - headings as `` The Nettle , '' `` The Labyrinth , '' `` The Nuptial Flight , '' `` The Muscles of Hercules , '' etc. ; and it is only by dint of much searching -LRB- since the volume has no index -RRB- that one finds that these captions describe
Pavia	LOCATION	,
Piacenza	LOCATION	,
Parma	LOCATION	,
Bologna	LOCATION	, etc. .

		The forty illustrations from photographs by
Henry H. Burton	PERSON	are uncommonly fine .

		Despite the title , Mr.
Wilfred S. Jackson	PERSON	's `` Cross Views '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- is rather less paradoxical than informal essays usually are .

		Indeed , '' Selfishness and Other Virtues '' is almost the only example of the normal upside-down or inside-out type of essay ; and even in this case the author 's mental agility lands him squarely on his feet beside the rest of us .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's views cross to change a bad figure to a worse like the threads of a spider 's web , seeming very intricate yet being very simple , particularly if you watch the wonder-worker while at his task .

		Personally , Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	is a highly agreeable hu - man being , sober , conservative , flexible , genuinely humorous , just the man , in fact , with whom to spend `` A Wet Day , '' whether in town or country , while he chats about `` Woman , '' `` Marriage and Divorce , '' ``
John Bull	PERSON	, '' `` The Man of the World , '' and anything else that his full mind proposes to pour comment on .

		He knows his
England	LOCATION	intimately , and knows the Continent tolerably .

		His acquaint - ance with queer sesquipedalian verbal monsters would drive you to your dictionary if he did not hurry you past to safety with a significant wink .

		And his book is by no means innocent of Latin .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A type facsimile of the '' Kilmarnock ''
Burns	PERSON	of
1786	DATE	, supplied with editorial apparatus by Mr.
M. S. Cleghorn	PERSON	, appears as one of the neat
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	reprints of English classics published by Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	. ''

		Everyman 's Library '' will have to look to its laurels if the publishers of ''
Bonn	LOCATION	's Popular Library '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- go on with their reissue of those volumes in shilling form .

		It is a most welcome enterprise , and we trust the demand will be such as to effect a transfor - mation of the entire library into this acceptable and inexpensive form .

		Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	's well-known '' American High - ways and Byways Series '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is now being republished at a lower price in editions intended to appeal especially to tourists .

		Three volumes of this
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 91 reissue are now ready , '' The Rocky Mountains , '' '' The Great Lakes , '' and '' The
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	. ''

		A note embodying specific information and suggestions for the intending traveller is appended to each chapter .

		The fine series of pictures from Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's camera is retained in these new editions .

		To its interesting series of exact type-facsimiles of famous poetical first editions , the
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	has recently added
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's Poems published in
1842	DATE	, and
Wordsworth	PERSON	's Poems published in
1807	DATE	.

		To the sentimental book-lover there is a decided fasci - nation about these beautifully-produced facsimiles , while their value to the literary student is of course consider - able .

		Three new volumes have just been added to the same publisher 's pocket series of `` World 's Classics , ''
John Gait	PERSON	's `` The Entail , ''
George Eliot	PERSON	's `` Romola , '' and
Milton	PERSON	's English Poems .

		The attractive little series of Canadian booklets com - piled by Mr.
Lawrence J. Burpee	PERSON	and published by the
Musson Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	of
Toronto	LOCATION	, reviewed in our issue of
January 1	DATE	last , has lately received the addition of two new volumes '' Scouts of Empire '' and '' Humour of the North . ''

		The former is made up of six sketches of famous Canadian explorers .

		The latter is a little anthology of representative Canadian humor , in which
Thomas Chandler Haliburton	PERSON	-LRB- ''
Sam Slick	PERSON	'' -RRB- , the Hab - .

		itant poet
William Henry Drummond	PERSON	, and
George Thomas Lanigan	PERSON	-LRB- of '' Ahkoond of Swat '' fame -RRB- occupy most of the space .

		A combination text-book in English has been prepared by Mr.
Alfred Hitchcock	PERSON	.

		It is entitled `` Rhetoric and the Study of Literature , '' and is published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Planned for the upper high school years , it includes a brief review of rhetoric , a series of chapters upon the study of the chief literary forms , and a condensed survey of the history of English literature .

		A series of questions on typical masterpieces will be found useful by teachers who are working with the eight works selected for analysis .

		Helps for the teacher are , indeed , abundant throughout this suggestive and thoughtfully-prepared work .

		From his three volumes of '' Wayfaring in
France	LOCATION	, '' published several years ago , Mr.
Edward Harrison Barker	PERSON	has selected such passages as present '' a plan of travel in better conformity with the sequence of ideas and purpose than the distribution of the same matter in the original works '' ; and this material , with some retouches , is now issued in a single volume -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The work is a pleasantly written chronicle of journeyings on foot in
Southwestern France	LOCATION	, through the valley of the
Dordogne	LOCATION	from
Auvergne	LOCATION	to the
Bay of Biscay	LOCATION	.

		Many of the archaic looking , yet well executed , wood - cuts from the original edition are retained here .

		Most children in our elementary schools study the history of the
United States	LOCATION	without any background whatever .

		To provide them with a very elementary compendium of the facts without which our very modern history is meaningless has been the task of Mr.
Wilbur F. Gordy	PERSON	in his '' American Beginnings in
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Among these beginnings are the
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan enterprise , the fall of
Constantinople	LOCATION	, the cru - sades , the Roman empire , the empire of
Alexander	PERSON	, and the civilization of
Greece	LOCATION	.

		All those things have to be described very simply , of course , and Mr.
Gordy	PERSON	has done the work in a way that must hold the interest of any intelligent child .

		The most difficult thing to do is to find a place for such a book as this in our stiff schemes of elementary teaching .

CHICAGO	LOCATION	An impressive account of the struggles of a woman who undertakes to earn her own livelihood .

		Will be read with interest by all who are concerned with the great problem of the woman toiler .

		Dr.
Jones	PERSON	says in his introduction .

		Here is the story of a ' ` working woman ' ' who has felt the bitterness of hard , unrelenting toil , and out of the agony of such a life has been brought into sympathy with the
Gospel	ORGANIZATION	side of co-operation .

		By bitter tears the eyes were cleared to read the illuminating message of the great democratic movement that assumes the name `` socialism '' in many quarters .

		That working men and women will read this book with bated breath and tearful sympathy goes without the saying .

		But it is a book for the employer more than for the employee , for the more favored rather than the less favored .

		It is a book that ought to find a place among the religious books on the center-table of the rich .

		121 THE MIDDLE-CLASS MIND .

		Mr.
Sydney Brooks	PERSON	, who is one of the most fair-minded and intelligent students of Amer - ican society and politics , makes the following pertinent observations upon the intellectual life of this country : `` While the sum total of American intelligence is un - doubtedly impressive , it is more by reason of its quantity than its quality .

		I mean that the educational system of the country has rather raised a great and unprecedented number of people to the standard of what we in
England	LOCATION	should call middle-class opinion than raised the standard itself , and that as a consequence the operative force of American politics is middle-class opinion left pretty much to its own devices and not corrected by the best intelligence of the country .

		And middle-class opinion , especially when left to its own devices , is a fearsome thing .

		It marks out the nation over which it has gained control as a willing slave of words , a willing follower of the fatal short-cut , a prey to caprice , unreasoning sentiment and the attraction of ' panaceas , ' and stamps broadly upon its face the hall-mark of an honestly uncon - scious parochialism .

		Such , to be quite candid , appears to me to have been too much its effect in
America	LOCATION	.

		I know of no country where a prejudice lives so long , where thought is at once so active and so shallow and a praiseworthy curiosity so little guided by fixed stand - ards , where a craze finds readier acceptance , where policies that are opposed to all human experience or con - tradicted by the most elementary facts of social or eco - nomic conditions stand a better chance of captivating the populace , or where men who are fundamentally insignif - icant attain to such quaintly authoritative prestige . ''

		It is a character-study of Mr.
Bryan	PERSON	that leads Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	to make these striking generaliza - tions .

		It was , we believe , observation of Brit - ish middle-class opinion concerning the war between
Russia	LOCATION	and
Turkey	LOCATION	that led
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, in
1877	DATE	, to deliver himself of the fol - lowing comment : '' That wonderful creature , the British philistine , has been splashing about during the war in a way more than worthy of himself .

		That is what is peculiar to
England	LOCATION	and what misleads foreigners ; there is no country in the world where so much nonsense becomes so public , and so appears to stand for the general voice of the nation , determining its government . ''

		Viewed in the light of this reciprocal criticism , honors would seem to be easy as regards the two countries concerned , since the philistine mind and the middle-class mind may be taken as mutually convertible terms .

		With all its intellectual shortcomings , and its deplorable lack of idealism , this type of mind 100 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	is one of the most substantial assets of any nation , and it is only when it plants itself as an obstacle in the path of progress , or when it blindly turns from the light that shines for the vision '' purged with euphrasy and rue '' that it becomes an object of derision .

		Nor is it without its specific virtues and its peculiar , if narrow , idealism .

		It makes for stability in the social order , and it sets bounds which are on the whole salutary to the unlicensed strivings of the intel - lectual order .

		It has an eye for the practical and the concrete , and looks askance at whatever is abstract or speculative .

		The mechanism of society needs a '' governor '' to save it from being torn to pieces by its internal energies , and this controlling influence is supplied by the middle - class mind .

		Philosophical historians assure us that the middle-class element preserves societies from disintegration , perpetuating the institu - tions which are its bone and sinew .

		It saved through the middle ages what was best worth saving from the wreck of the Roman Empire ; the weakening of its power was responsible for such tragic catastrophes as the partition of
Poland	LOCATION	and the French Revolution .

		It organ - ized the Reformation and evolved the
Hanseatic League	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its sturdy resistance to oppression overthrew the Stuart despotism and achieved the Italian Risorgimento .

		It saved the Amer -
ican Union	ORGANIZATION	in the dark years of the sixties .

		It is to-day stoutly opposing imperialistic oppres - sion in
Finland	LOCATION	, aristocratic predominance in the Scandinavian countries , and military heroics in the German Empire .

		It expresses the solid cen - tral mass of the people in nearly every modern nation ; its individual units are neither of the servile caste nor of the highly-placed , but of the sober and self-respecting class which pays the bills of society and keeps its course in safe chan - nels . ''

		Its steady-going habit , '' says
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, '' leads at last , as I have said , up to science , up to the comprehension and interpre - tation of the world ... Doors that open , windows that shut , locks that turn , razors that shave , coats that wear , watches that go , and a thousand more such good things , are the inven - tion of the philistines . ''

		We may use
Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's epithet derisively , as the Frenchman uses the epithet '' bourgeois , '' but we must recognize in the class thus described the steadying force which normally keeps society in its grooves , and which , when those grooves are seen to be out - worn , does not shrink from the heavy task of setting it into new ones .

		The idealistic mind , impatient with the slow march of progress , can not do full justice to these qualities , and we must confess that Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's arraignment strikes a responsive chord in our consciousness .

		Every phrase of it brings up suggestions of things that are deplorably wrong , and that shake even a robust faith in democracy as we see it applied to our society .

		How true it is that the best intelligence of the country seems quite unavailing to correct these evils .

		How often are we made to realize that our public is `` a willing slave of words , a willing follower of the fatal short cut , a prey to caprice , unreason - ing sentiment , and the attraction of panaceas . ''

		Let the meteoric career of the
Progressive Party	ORGANIZATION	during the past year attest the justice of this criticism .

		How '' the hall-mark of an honestly unconscious parochialism '' is visibly stamped upon the meddlesome legislation which seeks to regulate our eating and drinking and clothing , which imposes an ignorant police censorship upon our art and literature and amusements .

		The long life of unreasoning prejudice , the shal - lowness of popular thinking , the lack of fixed standards for our conduct , the amazing success with which crazes fix themselves upon us , the way in which we fly counter to all the teachings of experience in our public policies , are matters which force themselves upon us with painful frequency , and almost make us despair of our civilization .

		And all these unlovely phenomena are the direct outcome of the workings of the middle-class mind , and are daily illustrated in the pages of its favorite newspapers , and in the utterances of its popular preachers and poli - ticians .

		It is middle-class taste and intelligence that maintain gutter journalism , and the imbecility of musical comedy , and the inane novel , and the ragtime song , and the comic supplement .

		Indeed , where any form of artistic expression is concerned , the middle-class mind is hopelessly at sea , and remains wedded to its ugly idols despite all the assaults made upon its citadel .

		As
Moody	ORGANIZATION	once wrote in a letter : `` Calliope is the one Muse we recognize , and she has a front spare bedroom and unlimited pie . ''

		Especially does it lay its blighting touch upon the fine art of education , and under its control our public schools become every year more soddenly inef - ficient .

		The democratic society in which its ideals prevail has only contempt for the finer manifestations of the human spirit , and makes no secret of its hatred for every kind of real distinction .

		Thus we see that the middle-class mind has the defects of its qualities , and even to the vision not wholly jaundiced the defects may loom so large in the foreground as to
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 101 obscure the sterling qualities that lie behind .

		Such as it is , we have to reckon with it every day of our lives , and we can never quite escape from the consciousness of its clammy hold upon our limed souls struggling to be free .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE VISIT OF
JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL	PERSON	TO
CHICAGO	LOCATION	in
1887	DATE	, and the unfortunate controversy resulting from his substitution of an address on Shakespearean criticism for the address on American politics which was expected of him , was the subject of an article published
July 1	DATE	in this journal .

		One of the by-products of that visit was a small volume of veiled scurrility , published anonymously soon afterward , the work of Mr.
Frank M. Bristol	PERSON	, a Methodist minister then living in this city , who was one of the most vociferous and vituperative of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's assailants .

		The title of this volume was `` Richard the Third and the Primrose Criticism . ''

		We have lately received a deeply interesting letter on the subject from one of
Lowell	LOCATION	's friends who does not wish to be named , and from which we print the following extracts : '' I read to-day with great pleasure your article , ' A Page of Ancient History . '

		A life-long intimate friend of Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	, I knew the pain the circumstances gave him , and I have always regretted that there was no full public record of his position .

		I have almost equally regretted during the last five years an extraordinary mistake that is con - nected with Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's
Chicago	LOCATION	visit .

		In the ' Variorum ' edition of ` Richard the Third ' -LRB-
H. H. Furness	PERSON	, Jr. -RRB- , pub - lished in
1908	DATE	, there is a note on p. 581 attributed to
J. R. Lowell	PERSON	.

		This note expresses opinions precisely opposed to those held by Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	.

		I wrote at once to Mr.
Furness	PERSON	expressing my astonishment at this -LRB- to me -RRB- utterly indefen - sible and injurious carelessness , and pointing out that Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's views were distinctly stated in his essay on ' Richard the Third , ' published in the -LRB- posthumous -RRB- volume , ' Latest Literary Essays ' -LRB- 1898 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Furness	PERSON	wrote to me in answer -LRB-
Dec. 30 , 1908	DATE	-RRB- : ' You are quite right .

		The '' Primrose Criticism '' is not by
J. R. Lowell	PERSON	, but by
F. M. Bristol	PERSON	, as was pointed out to me by a correspondent shortly after the publication of my volume of Richard III .

		I was misled by a copy of the book in which the name of ''
Lowell	PERSON	r ' was written on the title page in pencil .

		No other name appears throughout the book , nor is
J. R. Lowell	PERSON	mentioned by name : though the whole work is evidently a violent attack on his
Chicago	LOCATION	lecture .

		-LSB- It is certainly odd to make a long and important citation without reading the work containing it . -RSB-

		I have corrected the error in the second edition , which is to appear early in the new year . '

		I have not seen this second edition , and do not know how properly he corrected this atrocious error , but I think it very insufficient action .

		I had said to him that I thought he ought immediately to declare the error -LRB- I implied with an apology to
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's memory -RRB- in the ' Nation . '

		-LRB- I did not know THE DIAL as well then as now . -RRB-

		Those who own the first edition are little likely to see the second , or to become aware of the correction in a note , and I have never seen any notice of it .

		I enclose the passage from Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	's essay most worth printing in contrast to the note . ''

		The passage , as written in
1883	DATE	, is as follows : '' I believe it absolutely safe to say of Shakespeare that he never wrote deliberate nonsense , nor was knowingly guilty of defective metre ; yet even tests like these I would apply with commendable modesty and literary reserve , con - scious that the meaning of words , and still more the associa - tions they call up , have changed since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's day ; that the accentuation of some was variable , and that Shake - peare 's ear may very likely have been as delicate as his other senses .

		... I am convinced that if we had Shake - speare 's plays as he wrote them ... we should not find a demonstrably/aw/ty verse . ''

		HOT - WEATHER BEADING ought , for the sake of one 's physical comfort , to be of such a nature that its stimulus will fall short of excitement , its argument run not to heated disputation , its imagery tend to evoke cooling rather than calorific mental visions , and its narrative have an equable flow like the stream of a shaded meadow brook .

		Attention has been called to the peculiar fitness of
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	's novels for hot-weather reading .

		Theirs is a gentle surface titillation that never stirs the depths ; the heroes and heroines tear no passion to tatters ; the happy ending , with due apportionment of rewards and punishments , can be counted on to a certainty .

		Among other excellent dog-day books , it may be permitted to mention
Franklin	PERSON	's ever-entertaining aucobiography -LRB- a good edition of which is now to be had , at small expense , in `` Everyman 's Library '' -RRB- .

		The calmness and evenness of its style are unsur - passed .

		Admirable was the method its writer adopted to avoid needless friction and heat in con - versation and debate , denying himself the use of such positive expressions as `` certainly '' and `` un - doubtedly , '' and substituting instead the less pro- vocative `` I conceive '' or `` I apprehend , '' or `` I imagine , '' or `` so it appears to me at present . '' ''

		And this mode , '' he says , '' which I at first put on with some violence to natural inclination , became at length so easy , and so habitual to me , that perhaps for these fifty years past no one has ever heard a dogmatical expression escape me . ''

		Cooling to one of fervid temperament is the account he gives of the way he won over an enemy in the
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Having heard that he had in his library a certain very scarce and curious book , I wrote a note to him , expressing my desire of perusing that book , and requesting he would do me the favour of lending it to me for a few days .

		He sent it immediately , and I returned it in about a week with another note , expressing strongly my sense of the favour .

		When we next met in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, he spoke to me -LRB- which he had never done before -RRB- , and with great civility ; and he ever after manifested a great readiness to serve me on all occasions , so that we became great friends , and our friendship continued to his death . ''

		Truly , the pages of this admirable book seem to waft cool breezes as one turns the leaves on a warm
summer	DATE	day .

		... UNPOETIC DEVOTIONAL VERSE , glowing , it may be , with religious ardor and throbbing with ecstatic emotion , but abounding in inappropriate or even ludicrous imagery , in clumsy expressions and faults of rhyme and rhythm , can easily be cited by anyone familiar with the hymns of the church .

		Opening this moment that well-known hymnal compiled by Dr.
Charles S. Robinson	PERSON	and entitled `` A Selection 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	of Spiritual Songs , '' we chance upon
A. R. Cousin	PERSON	's `` Immanuel 's Land , '' near the end of which the writer avows his intention to ga/e , not at glory , `` but on my King of Grace not at the crown he gifteth , but on his pierced hand . ''

		Is `` gifteth '' chosen in preference to `` giveth '' because of a fancied superiority in elegance or spirituality , or is it simply a misprint ?

		In the same book , hymn
1005	DATE	, there is a sounding couplet about '' the effluence of uncreated light '' that might without excessive harsh - ness be called mystical nonsense .

		A correspondent wrote the other day to a certain religious weekly published in
Boston	LOCATION	asking for help in finding a dimly-remembered hymn which contains the ignobly - jubilant refrain , `` Nothing more have I to do ; Jesus paid it all . ''

		Somewhat akin to the mood inspiring this is that which prompted the couplet -LRB- said to oc - cur in an old Methodist hymn , and , according to Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	, keenly relished by
Charles Lamb	PERSON	-RRB- , `` Come needy , come guilty , come loathsome and bare ; you ca n't come too filthy come just as you are . ''

		In a late number of `` The English Review '' Professor
W. H. D. Rouse	PERSON	writes on `` Our ` Melancholy ' Hymnal , '' deploring the inferior quality of much of the devotional verse now in use , and selecting for censure certain familiar hymns .

		After pointing out sundry faults in one of these , he says : '' The rest of the hymn is of like doggerel .

		It would be only too easy to multiply examples of these childish devices .

		It is unlucky that piety seems so fond also of mix - ing metaphors ; so that a voice is spurned , the Deity is at once a rock and a creature with wings , a stream , a support , a covering .

		Bonar makes a staff and buckler guide , Keble compares the Holy Dove to a gale ; even an accomplished scholar like
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	fills his verses with senseless padding and vulgar tags , and appears to be amply satisfied . ''

		Nevertheless , with all their shortcomings , our hymns of to-day are far superior to those in use a century ago , and the improvement is still in progress .

		WHAT THEY READ IN THE PHILIPPINES is partly indicated by the latest number that has reached us of the `` Bulletin of the Philippine Library '' -LRB- Vol .

		I. , No. 9 -RRB- .

		Nine and one-half double-column pages are filled with titles of `` recent accessions , '' while two more pages announce the '' duplicates in the
Filipiniana	LOCATION	division offered for sale or exchange . ''

		Standard works , chiefly in English or Spanish , with a few in Latin in the departments of philosophy and religion , and a considerable number of books on '' the linguistics of the
Philippine Islands	LOCATION	, '' make up the greater part of the list of late additions to this young but evidently vigorous public library .

		Its users are now in the fortunate position of being able to choose between
Michaele Sanchez	PERSON	's '' Cursus Theologiae Dogmaticse '' and Mrs.
Alice Caldwell Hegan Rice	PERSON	's '' Romance of Billy-goat Hill , '' or between Sophocles in
Plumptre	LOCATION	's translation and
Mark Twain	PERSON	's '' Old Times on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	'' with other alternatives too numerous to mention .

		The opening pages of the Bulletin are devoted to '' School Libraries in
the Philippines	LOCATION	. ''

		We quote the first paragraph : '' During the last six or eight years the library movement in the Philippine schools has developed into an important factor among the aids to education .

		Beginning as it did in a tenta - tive effort to gather a few books together in a con - venient place for the use of students , it has now reached the stage where ' our library ' is a matter of pride with nearly every student .

		Few schools in
Manila	LOCATION	are so unprogressive as not to own some sort of a library usually provided by the work of the students themselves , while the movement has spread to the provinces , making such rapid headway that nearly a year ago the
Bureau of Education	ORGANIZATION	found it necessary to get out a bulletin of forty pages entitled ' Libraries for Philippine Public Schools . ' ''

		THE CLASSICAL STYLE OF DR. ROBERT BRIDGES ,
England	LOCATION	's new poet laureate , is made the subject of comment -LRB- usually laudatory -RRB- in various quarters .

		Mr.
Henry C. Shelley	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	literary correspondent of the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' writes in the following strain concerning Mr.
Austin	PERSON	's successor : `` He is , above all things , a scholarly poet , an experimenter in metre , and a restorer of classical models .

		As a metrist he is accounted among the most subtle of modern days and learned even to difficulty .

		In blank verse he is regarded as the equal of Ten - nyson ; he was the first to re-introduce the triolet into English , while in such a poem as his ' Ode on Peace ' he illustrates his command of Alcaics .

		Now a poet who sets himself to write English verse in classical metres must of necessity handicap himself , but a consciousness of that fact has not deterred Mr. Bridges from indulging his personal preference .

		To all this has to be added the further obstacle that he has few purple patches or brilliant epigrams ; one of his greatest admirers has confessed that ' his charm is subtle and wins gradually on the ear and on the mind .

		His fragrance is not that of `` voluptuous garden roses , '' but delicate , natural , wilding .

		His note is unforced .

		He has little or no rhetoric .

		His colors are true and tender , not gaudy or hot . '

		Moreover , the themes which appeal to Mr. Bridges are hardly those which capture the most attention .

		True , he touches now and then upon love in a restrained manner , but his preference is .

		for such subjects as lend themselves best to the use of classical scholarship and a spirit of philosophical musing . ''

		Whether he is one 's favorite sort of poet or not , his poetic gift is unquestioned , and his appointment is made the subject of no such jesting comment as was noticeable when his predecessor took the place left vacant by
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	.

		LOCAL HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS such as many libraries , especially State university libraries in the West , pride themselves on making as completely representative and illustrative of their particular section as possible , form the rich mines in which future historians will delve with profit and pleasure .

		Nineteen years ago the library of
the University of Illinois	ORGANIZATION	made its first systematic and earnest attempt
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 103 to get together all that was valuable and available in the written history of the surrounding region ; and since then gratifying progress has been made in this work .

		The historical collection formed under the direction of Dr.
Reuben Gold Thwaites	PERSON	at
Madison	LOCATION	is widely known among students and writers of history .


Minnesota	LOCATION	and
Kansas	LOCATION	have at their State universities similar collections of great and ever - increasing value ; and other regions are equally for - tunate .

		In the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Chicago	LOCATION	the department of regional history is notably strong , and that at
the University of Chicago Library	ORGANIZATION	has very recently been strengthened by the addition of the Durett collection on the early history of the vast region to the westward of the
Alleghany Mountains	ORGANIZATION	.

		From published accounts of this collection , which is said to number nearly thirty thousand volumes , it appears to contain complete files of many early western newspapers , the manuscript autobiography and journal of
George Rogers Clark	PERSON	, the journal of
Thomas Walker	PERSON	, first of Englishmen to cross the
Mississippi	LOCATION	valley , that of the French explorer ,
Celeron	ORGANIZATION	, the
McAfee	ORGANIZATION	and
Shelby	PERSON	papers relating to
Kentucky	LOCATION	, papers of General
Wilkinson	PERSON	, English and Spanish transcripts of early documents , and diaries and letters of many now forgotten early explorers of the great West .

		With its other like collections of material for the study of local and more widely regional history ,
Chicago	LOCATION	now becomes more than ever attractive to those interested in the story of western American discovery and settlement and progress ... SHAKESPEARE IN
GERMANY	LOCATION	, if one is to believe what a high authority , Professor
Alois Brandl	PERSON	, of the
University of Berlin	ORGANIZATION	, said in his late address before the British Academy , has an even greater vogue than with those who speak his own language .

		His spirit appears to be verily alive among the Teutons , where , on an average , there are four per - formances of his plays every night throughout the year .

		Innumerable repertory companies are always at work on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and there is no sign of any diminution of interest in his dramas ; rather is this interest increasing and spreading through the coun - try , fostered especially by the municipal theatre with its regular and well-trained company of actors .

		In
Germany	LOCATION	it seems to be considered a reproach for a town not to have a theatre of its own ; and as for demanding rent for its use , the city fathers would blush at the mere suggestion , so eager are they to help rather than to hinder the cause of the drama in its best and worthiest examples .

		And so no small share of the attention of the municipal theatre is devoted to adequate presentation of Shake - speare .

		Thus it has come about , it is said , that Shakespearean phrases and quotations have a re - markable vogue in
Germany	LOCATION	, and Shakespearean and other English studies are encouraged in the schools and universities .

		In this connection we recall our pleased surprise on hearing , in long-ago student days in
Berlin	LOCATION	, our landlady 's ready and apt quotation from
Hamlet	LOCATION	's soliloquy in the course of the table-talk one morning soon after our arrival .

		How many English or American landladies will one hear quoting Shakespeare to their boarders at the breakfast-table ?

		... A PUBLISHER 'S PROTEST against a protective tariff on books ought to have greater weight with our government authorities than the protest of a book - buyer , although even the latter 's remonstrance is worthy of respectful consideration .

		Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, returning recently from
London	LOCATION	, and learning of the threatened imposition of a tax on importations of books in foreign languages , ad - dresses a letter to the chairman of the
House	ORGANIZATION	Com - mittee on Ways and Means , in the course of which he says : `` I am writing on behalf of the
American Publishers ' Copyright League	ORGANIZATION	to make clear to your
Honorable Committee	ORGANIZATION	that the publishers and the book trade generally consider such a tax unnecessary , undesirable , and inexpedient even on the basis of a protectionist policy , while its enactment would consti - tute a material inconsistency in the policy announced by the present Congressional majority and the Ad - ministration .

		We look with confidence to your Com - mittee to decline to give favorable consideration to any such suggestion .

		I am myself a printer and a book-manufacturer as well as a publisher , and I am expressing not only my individual judgment and that of my firm , but that of the American publishers generally in the statement that we have no need of any special assistance from the
United States Gov	LOCATION	- ernment to maintain the foundations of our business . ''

		What possible pretext , then , can there be for laying any sort of duty on literature ?

		The revenue accru - ing will be inconsiderable in any event , while those from whose pockets it is taken are as a rule least able to bear the extortion .

		THE OPENING OF THE NEW STATE LIBRARY OF
NEW YORK	LOCATION	at
Albany	LOCATION	is cause for congratulation to all concerned .

		In addition to a full description of the new
State Education Building	ORGANIZATION	where the Library has its home , there is published a smaller illustrated pamphlet setting forth the numerous modern con - veniences and admirable equipment of the library quarters recently thrown open to the public .

		The reader is thus ushered into this palace of literature : '' From the main entrance the public reading rooms are reached by a staircase twenty-five feet wide , leading directly into the central rotunda , the most striking feature of the building .

		It is cruciform , like an Italian church .

		Both the nave and the transept , as they may aptly be termed , are vaulted and at the crossing are crowned with a dome which runs up through three stories .

		The centre of this rotunda forms the architectural centre of the building , and from there access is had to the five principal reading rooms ; or better stated , perhaps , a group of five special libraries law , medicine , periodicals , legis - lative reference and public documents , and the principal reference room .

		The latter seems likely 104 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	to rank as one of the handsomest and most satisfac - tory reading rooms in the country .

		One hundred and twenty-five by one hundred and seven feet and fifty-five feet high , extending through the second and third floors , it is an adaptation of the reading room of the
Bibliotheque Rationale	ORGANIZATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		The descriptive pamphlet extends to twenty-eight pages of matter especially interesting to librarians and library architects ... THE BOOK TO WHICH ENGLISH LITERATURE is MOST INDEBTED is , of course , the
Bible	LOCATION	; and the extent of that indebtedness will be at least partly realized by readers of Professor
William Gilmer Perry	PERSON	's article on the subject in the
August	DATE	`` North American Review . ''

		Amusing is the story he tells to illustrate
Macaulay	PERSON	's early employment of scrip - ture phrase , which all the world knows the great historian and essayist later used so often and to such excellent effect .

		Finding one day that the maid had disarranged the pebbles marking off his little garden , the boy Macaulay exclaimed : `` Cursed be Sally !

		For it is written , ` Cursed be he that re - moveth his neighbor 's landmark . ' ''

		Significant is the fondness with which the English-speaking world clings to the phraseology of the
King James	LOCATION	version of the
Bible	LOCATION	and refuses to accept any later and , philologically , more accurate rendering .

		Mrs.
Barr	PERSON	, in her recently-published autobiography , takes plea - sure in fortifying her own preference for the old version by relating her conversation with one of the authors of the `` Revised Version '' who always carried a New Testament in his pocket and declared his attachment to the little volume , which , on examina - tion , proved not to be the translation in which he had himself collaborated , but the much older and less scholarly one that it was designed to supersede .

		THE PROBLEM OF THE LEATHER BINDING , the best way , if there be any way , to preserve its flexi - bility and prevent its going to pieces at the hinges , is instructively touched upon by Miss
Janet C. Lewis	PERSON	in the current issue of `` Special Libraries . ''

		But she withholds the most valuable and practically useful part of her knowledge on the subject ; for , after relating her varied experience with leather bindings and holding our breathless attention to the point where , after much unsuccessful experimenting , she at last `` obtained an animal and vegetable oil combined which owing to its penetration has proved to be an excellent lubricant and food for the leather , '' she abruptly and unkindly leaves us to guess if we can the magic formula used by her in the composi - tion of this elixir of life for leather-bound books .

		Nevertheless , some of the observations that precede this cruel betrayal of our faith are worth quoting .

		She says : '' Surface lubricating is of very little real avail , as in the use of vaseline or lucelline or like mineral oils , which lack the essential penetrating qualities owing to their being of a mineral nature .

		An animal or a vegetable oil is the only kind which the leather really absorbs . ''

		We are further cau - tioned not to shut up our leather-bound books in glass cases or where there is insufficient circulation of air .

		Perhaps it is only with benevolent intent that
Miss Lewis	PERSON	leaves us to the uncertainties , the disappointments , the suspense , and the anxiety of experimentation , in order that ours may be the full joy of final success if perchance we achieve it .

		A NOTEWORTHY BIT OF TOMBSTONE VERSE , from the hand of a distinguished poet , may be read on the slab that marks the grave of
J. A. Howells	PERSON	, lately deceased , brother of Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	.

		The early life of the eminent novelist , poet , and essayist , his boyhood experience of newspaper work in the office of the
Ashtabula	LOCATION	'' Sentinel , '' which his father edited , and his early contracting there of a fondness for printer 's ink , which has never left him , is too old a story to need repetition here .

		His brother ,
J. A. Howells	PERSON	, succeeded in due time to the editorship of the `` Sentinel , '' and on the `` make-up '' stone long used by him in his work as printer are now inscribed the lines that commemo - rate his fifty years ' connection with the paper .

		His death occurred at
Jefferson	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, and there his grave and his tombstone are to be seen .

		The epi - taph runs as follows : '' Stone upon which with hands of boy and man He framed the history of his time until , Week after week , the varying record ran To its half - century tale of well and ill , Remember now how true , through all these days , He was friend , brother , husband , son Fill the whole limit of your space with praise .

		There needs no room for blame blame there was none . ''

		ART AND JUSTICE are conceived of by the author of '' Jean-Christophe '' as sustaining a peculiarly close relation to each other .

		Mr.
Alvan F. Sanborn	PERSON	, in a thoughtful article on
M. Romain Rolland	PERSON	in the
August	DATE	'' Century , '' quotes him as maintaining that '' he who can see injustice without trying to combat it is neither entirely an artist nor entirely a man , '' and tells us how his artist-soul was aroused to protest by the
Dreyfus	ORGANIZATION	episode and by the Boer War .

		It is largely to this spirit of revolt against observed acts of injustice that we owe the hero biographies which he gave to the world with these stirring words : '' The air is heavy about us .

		Old
Europe	LOCATION	is waxing torpid in an oppressive and vitiated atmosphere .

		A materialism devoid of grandeur cumbers thought and fetters the action of governments and of individuals .

		The world is dying of asphyxia in its prudent and vile egoism .

		The world is stifling .

		Fling the win - dows wide open !

		Let the free air rush in !

		Let us inhale the vivifying breath of the heroes ! ''

		And the same spirit helps to animate the ten volumes of his famous '' Jean-Christophe . ''

Masaharu Anesaki	PERSON	, of the
Imperial University	ORGANIZATION	, Tokio , to fill the chair , is another evidence of the praiseworthy readiness of the West to sit as a dis - ciple at the feet of the older East .

		At present engaged in teaching the science of religion at the Tokio institution , Professor
Anesaki	PERSON	is reputed as well versed in the history and doctrines of
Chris	PERSON	- tianity as in those of his own faith , Buddhism ; and though still comparatively young , having been born in
1873	DATE	, he is the author of a number of works of oriental learning , such as `` The History of Indian Religions '' and `` The Personality of Buddha , '' and has distinguished himself also in less serious depart - ments of literature in his native Japanese .

		Even short stories are credited to his versatile pen , and he is said to write almost as well in French and English as in his own language .

		The special sub - ject to which he has of late devoted himself has to do with the
Pali	ORGANIZATION	texts of Buddhism and their Chinese counterparts .

		THE CRITICAL BOOKSELLER , tradesman , and pro- fessor of literature combined , more joyful over the sale of one good book than over that of a hundred best-sellers of the passing hour , is rarely or never met with in real life ; hence our pleasure in greeting him in the person of the idealist hero of Mr.
How	PERSON	- ells 's story , '' The Critical Book Store , '' in the
August	DATE	''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' and our regret that this example of what a bookseller ought to be so soon lost faith in his mission and sold out to one inspired with less exalted ideals .

		But of course the plan was too good to succeed except in a bookshop endowed and conducted as a public educational institution somewhat like the public library , which , untainted by commercial greed and managed by well-educated and high-minded officers , is in a position to accom - plish much that no tradesman , dependent for support on the profits of his business , can ever hope to achieve .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		SIMPLIFIED SPELLING ONCE MORE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In your gracious and discriminating editorial on ''
Robert Bridges	PERSON	, Poet Laureate , '' speaking of spelling - reform you say that Dr. Bridges would '' certainly regard such abortions as ' thru ' and ' program ' as typically horrible . ''

		If '' program '' without the wasted ending me is hor - rible , why should not '' epigram '' and '' monogram '' be also restored to their Gallic rights ?

		If we must have the sporadic and unnecessary u in '' honor '' and '' par - lor , '' why not in '' tenor '' and in dozens of other words of similar Latin derivation ?

		Why not indeed found a society for Decorative Spelling ?

		I have a book in which
Milton	PERSON	's `` sovran '' -LRB- `` plain in its neatness '' -RRB- is spelt '' soueraygne , '' and nearly every other word has accretions which would rejoice the most conservative of conservatives .

		5Tet every once in a while in books of the same period there are examples of typical simplifi - cation which would rejoice the fiery heart of the learned and genial Dr.
Scott	PERSON	t used for ed , `` tho '' for `` though , '' and the like .

		Indeed scarcely one of the recommenda - tions of the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	can not be sup - ported by pre -
Johnsonian	DATE	printers .

		The dislike of any given spelling is merely a matter of prejudice , and after a while the absurd and inconsistent vagaries of the present system will seem as ridiculous and awkward as would an ichthyosaurus or a pterodactyl strutting round in a barnyard .

		It is a fact , 1 believe , that a vast majority of the best English scholars approve of reformed spelling ; and while personally I should find it difficult to adopt the transmogrifying system recommended by the English Society , I do think that the majority of the simplifica - tions contained in the revised list of the
American Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	are in the line of a much - needed improvement .


Germany	LOCATION	has within a few years successfully simplified some thousands of words , and no one can doubt that the general superiority of German students over the American and English -LRB- even with the terrible handicap of stupefying beer -RRB- is due to the earlier age at which they can begin really to study , while our children are obliged to spend many months in trying to master an illogical and absolutely unscientific spelling-book .

		As Superintendent
Maxwell	PERSON	of
Manhattan	LOCATION	says , it tends to make the mind unethical to find no analogies , and has a bad effect on the morals .

		So although he detests `` thru '' for '' through , '' and similar guillotinements of words , he would for the sake espe - cially of the immigrants cause simplified spelling to be adopted by the Public Schools of
New York	LOCATION	if it were in his power to do so .

		I realize how useless it is to argue against a prejudice , especially in trifling matters .

		Marriages have been ruined by the finical crook of a little finger or the curl of a mustache , and words are dear to those that use them .

		I think I lost the friendship of a fine Englishman because I preferred to spell ''
Tolstoi	PERSON	, '' while he wanted to reform it backwards to '' Tolstoy . ''

		I recognize the insuperable difficulty of a phonetic method of repre - senting English -LRB- with all the varieties of local or na - tional pronunciation -RRB- ; but it is better to reform some vices , even if one ca n't cure them all , than to go on forever dragging the chain of obvious crudities and anachronisms .

		A little light is better than total dark - ness , and I rejoice every time I see a '' thru '' and a `` quartet '' and a `` program . ''

		It is a step in the right direction .

		-LSB- Our correspondent attempts no defense of `` thru , '' and so we are not called upon to explain how such a spelling destroys the proper pronunciation of the word .

		The reason why we consider '' program '' horrible is that it inevitably leads to a pronunciation which accents the first syllable , and reduces the second to an inconsiderable caudal appendix .

		We hear the word pronounced '' prd-gram '' every day with the '' gram '' almost lost .

		We know of no way to keep the full value of the second syllable -LRB- which means preserving the dignity of a fine old word -RRB- without spelling it in the orthodox way . ''

		Epigram , '' '' monogram , '' and '' telegram '' are not cases in point , for the excellent reason that they are three - syllabled words , which makes it almost impossible not to give 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	the '' gram '' its full value in their pronunciation .

		This is so elementary that we are almost ashamed to write it .

		As to the general question of a forced simplification of spelling upon logical lines , we do not consider it arguable , because it is so essentially a matter of taste .

		Such '' arguments '' as are advanced in behalf of the '' reform '' seem to us too shallow to be deserving of serious consideration .

		EDITOR THE DIAL . -RSB-

		THE VARIORUM `` JULIUS C ^
SAR	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read with interest and profit the review of the latest addition to the '' New Variorum '' Shake - speare , in THE DIAL of
July 16	DATE	.

		This impresses me as in some respects the most thorough , candid , and just review of a book that has appeared in your columns in many moons .

		The reviewer lists a dizzy number of errors in spell - ing , punctuation , etc. .

		It seems to me that Dr.
Furness	PERSON	went from one extreme to another when , after making in five plays a text of his own , he adopted the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	text not only as to words , but also as to the old style spelling and even type forms .

		While I can understand that '' what Shakespeare wrote depends very largely upon a knowledge of the peculiarities of the language of his day , that Elizabethan English is a wholly different thing from modern English , and that the poet 's linguistic peculiarities were the peculiarities of his age , '' it seems to me that if our `` New Variorum '' editor would supply extracts from the writings of lin - guists explaining these peculiarities to the uninitiate and at the same time would give the text in modern form ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's meaning could not only be more easily studied but such errors as your reviewer cites could not occur .

		The editor would also profit in that he would be required to give less attention to the mechanical side of his work , and the appeal of the Shakespeare spirit in him would be more fully emanci - pated .

		Scholarly and varied as are the suggestions of your reviewer , it seems curious to me that one who appre - ciates the dramatic effect that was served by the inven - tion of
Caesar	ORGANIZATION	's deafness in the left ear , should have apparently accepted the following statement from Mr.
Furness	PERSON	unchallenged : `` He -LSB- Csar -RSB- is a braggart , inflated with the idea of his own importance ; speaking of his decrees as of those of a god . ''

		It seems to me that the son has here departed from the editorial atti - tude of the father in obtruding a dogmatic view of a character .

		It has been often said that Dr.
Furness	PERSON	accepted the Werder theory of Hamlet , but there is not one word in his Preface to the play that warrants such ` citation ; although Dr.
Ernest Jones	PERSON	cites the vol - umes as his authority for such a statement , and Dr.
Rolfe	PERSON	dwelt upon the amount of space given the Werder views after having cited Dr.
Furness	PERSON	as having accepted them .

		The point is that here , as in all the other plays , Dr.
Furness	PERSON	maintained the editorial attitude that wel - comes all views of any merit whatever but adopts no one as a final solution .

		It was this attitude that , in the last analysis , found sustenance in that sense of humor in which
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's own unobtrusive ego was so easily and delightfully felt .

		I do not believe that ``
Julius Caesar	PERSON	apparently held a prominent place as an historic character in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's regard '' any more than I believe that
Antony	PERSON	and
Cleopatra	PERSON	held a like place in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's regard ; and we know that
Miss Repplier	PERSON	, a life-long friend of Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, never could under - stand the admiration that Dr.
Furness	PERSON	had for the
Shakespearean Cleopatra	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps she could not sep - arate the historic character from the wonderful uni - versal woman that , in our poet 's `` brightest heaven of invention , '' made his Cleopatra an elder sister of his Juliet .

		What the Ghost was to the play of '' Hamlet , ''
Julius Caesar	PERSON	was to the play that bears his name ; and what seems to us the '' braggart '' in Csesar may be only a result of the theatrical atmosphere created by the poet for the purpose of making the character dominate the play .

		It was not the historic character that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	had chiefly in mind , but a play in which he was seeking for dramatic elements .

		The Ghost in '' Hamlet '' was not more affectionate and noble than was
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Csesar ; and we might go on , if we had space , and show by dramatic incidents and similarity of language that the two plays were written almost in the same mood of mind , the contemporary interests of the
London	LOCATION	crowd always transcending the poet 's interest in the classic history of Roman plebeians .

		It seems to me that in the notes to the new `` Variorum '' edition , especially at the close of the book , too much attention is given to the play in its historic bearings and not enough attention to the play as a

		One morning in the year
1868	DATE	,
Benjamin F. Taylor	PERSON	, a well-known writer of the days of the Civil War and thereabouts , who spent much time in or near
La Porte	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	, paid a call at the home of Judge
William Piatt Andrew	PERSON	of that village , under whose roof Mr.
Ogden Ross	PERSON	, father of Mrs.
Andrew	PERSON	, was fast nearing his ninety-seventh birthday .

		As Mr.
Ross	PERSON	was somewhat indisposed , Mr.
Taylor	PERSON	offered to leave a summons at the nearby office of Dr.
N. S. Darling	PERSON	, as he should pass down the shady street .

		THE MERMAID COMPANY .

		* Two of the greatest English poets now living have found in the Mermaid Tavern a rich source of poetical inspiration .

		What theme , indeed , could be more fruitful than that of the meeting - place of Shakespeare and his fellow-wits in the spacious days when all Englishmen breathed the air of romance , and the world seemed won - derful beyond all past experience in the light of the new learning and the new art and the new adventurous enterprise that burst forth in that flowering of the human spirit which we call the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	.

		Inexhaustible must have been the poetical inspiration of that glorious time , and the very thought of it still has power to widen man 's horizon and set his imagination aglow .

		Some fifteen years ago Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	-
Dunton	PERSON	published his magnificent lyrical master - piece , `` Christmas at the Mermaid , '' and this year Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	, in whom the hope of English poetry is now chiefly centred , has given us , in his `` Tales of the Mermaid Tavern , '' a work so shining with beauty , and so opulent in poetical power , that it is difficult to find words with which to do it justice .

		The scheme of this work comprises nine numbers , and in the course of them all the chief manners of verse - composition lyrical , narrative , and dramatic find masterly illustration .

		In the opening pages , we find ourselves in the full tide of the mighty current that is to sweep us through the volume with an exhilarating sense of heightened capabilities and enlarged vision . ''

		Marchannt Adventurers , chanting at the windlass , Early in the morning we slipped from

		Till that strange fire which seamen call ' Castor and
Pollux	PERSON	' we beheld , '' An evil sign of peril and death , Burning pale on the high main-mast ; But calm with the might of Gennesareth Our Admirall 's voice went ringing past , '' Clear thro ' the thunders , far and clear , Mighty to counsel , clear to command , Joyfully singing , ` We are as near To heaven , my lads , by sea as by land . ' ''

		In `` A Coiner of Angels , '' the second num - ber of the cycle , the Mermaid wits have great sport in baiting
Richard Bame	PERSON	, the zealot whose name history has preserved because of his scur - rilous attack upon
Marlowe	PERSON	.

		Bame intrudes upon their revels with his pious snuffle , and is told of a pretended counterfeiting scheme where - by they all hope to make their fortunes .

		They fool him to the top of his bent , and he eagerly accepts their proposition to take the part of a stool-pigeon in the conspiracy .

		Number three is the `` mad sea-tale '' of `` Black Bill 's Honey - moon , '' sung to a goodly company by
John Davis	PERSON	.

		But there is even more excellent fooling in the preface , for
Francis Bacon	PERSON	has strolled into the tavern and discourses patronizingly on the art of poetry . '' '

		He said to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, in a voice that gripped The Mermaid Tavern like an arctic frost : ' There are no poets in this age of ours Not to compare with Plautus .

		They are all Dead , the men that were famous in old days ' 1 Why so they are , ' said Will .

		The humming stopped .

		I saw poor
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, a shy gentle soul , With haunted eyes like starlit forest pools , Smuggling his cantos under his cloak again . '

		There 's verse enough , no doubt , '
Bacon	PERSON	went on , ' But English is no language for the
Muse	ORGANIZATION	.

		Whom could you call our best ?

		There 's
Gabriel Harvey	PERSON	, And
Edward	PERSON	,
Earl of Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then there 's
Dyer	PERSON	, And Doctor
Golding	PERSON	; while , for tragedy ,
Thomas	LOCATION	,
Lord Buckhurst	PERSON	, hath a lofty vein .

		And , in a lighter prettier vein , why , Will , There is thyself !

		But where 's Euripides ?

		1 Dead , ' echoed
Ben	PERSON	, in a deep ghost-like voice .

		And drip drip drip outside we heard the rain Miserably dripping round the Mermaid Inn . ''

		Later on ,
Bacon	PERSON	thus admonishes Shakespeare : '' ' Will , couldst thou use Thy talents with discretion , and obey Classic examples , thou mightst match old Plautus , In all except priority of the tongue .

		This English tongue is only for an age , But Latin for all time .

		So I propose To embalm in
Latin	LOCATION	my philosophies .

		Well-seize your hour !

		But , ere you die , you '11 sail A British galleon to the golden courts Of Cleopatra . ' '

		Sail it ! '

		Marlowe roared , Mimicking in a fit of thundrous glee 108 THE DIAL -LSB-

Pharaoh	ORGANIZATION	's pyramids , And hale white
Egypt	LOCATION	with their tarry hands Home to the Mermaid ! ' '

		In `` The Sign of the Golden Shoe '' we find the high-water mark of the poet 's creation .

		This is the scene in which news of the death of
Marlowe	PERSON	comes to his friends in the Mermaid Tavern , and his genius is extolled by his friends . '

		`` Ah , then Kit , ' Said
Chapman	PERSON	, ' had some prescience of his end , Like many another dreamer .

		What strange hints Of things past , present , and to come , there lie Sealed in the magic pages of that music Which , laying strong hold on universal laws , Ranges beyond these mud-walls of the flesh , Though dull wits fail to follow .

		It was this That made men lind an oracle in the books Of
Virgil	PERSON	, and an everlasting fount Of science in the prophets . ' ''

		It is
Nash	PERSON	who tells the tragic story of Mar - lowe 's death in the arms of a wanton . ''

		What if his blood were hot ?

		High over all He heard , as in his song the world still hears , Those angels on the burning heavenly wall '' Who chant the thunder-music of the spheres .

		Yet , through the glory of his own young dream Here did he meet that face , wet with strange tears , '' Andromeda , with piteous face astream , Hailing him , Perseus .

		In her treacherous eyes And in dark pools the mirrored stars will gleam . ''

		Here did he see his own eternal skies ; And here she laughed , nor found the dream amiss ; She bade him pluck and eat in Paradise . ''

		Here did she hold him , broken up with bliss , Here , like a supple snake , around him coiled , Here did she pluck his heart out with a kiss , '' Here were the wings clipped and the glory soiled , Here adders coupled in the pure white shrine , Here was the Wine spilt , and the Shew-bread spoiled . ''

		From
Nash	PERSON	's elegy , which closes the superb poem , we take these stanzas : '' The wine that God had set apart , The noblest wine of all , Wine of the grapes that angels trod , The vintage of the glory of God , The crimson wine of that rich heart , Spilt in a drunken brawl , '' Poured out to make a steaming bath That night in the Devil 's Inn , A steaming bath of living wine Poured out for Circe and her swine , A bath of blood for a harlot To supple and sleek her skin . ''

		But he who dared the thunder-roll , Whose eagle-wings could soar , Buffeting down the clouds of night , To beat against the Light of Light , That great God-blinded eagle-soul , We shall not see him more . ''

		The fine and passionate intelligence with which Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	has discerned and vitalized the very essence of
Marlowe	ORGANIZATION	's genius makes this tribute worthy to be linked with '' In the Bay , '' and we can imagine
Swinburne	PERSON	smiling from the gold bar of heaven upon the kindred soul who henceforth must be reckoned with him as the poet 's panegyrist .

		Passing over '' The Companion of a Mile , '' we come to ''
Big Ben	PERSON	, '' which tells of the excite - ment at the Mermaid when
Jonson	PERSON	lies in New - gate prison , and of the men 's boisterous reception of their comrade when he reappears after his enlargement , accomplished through the efforts of
Selden	PERSON	and
Camden	LOCATION	, playing upon the
King	ORGANIZATION	's prejudice against tobacco .

		A few apt quotations from
Ben	PERSON	did the business with His Majesty . ''

		` Ah , ' said the shrewd
King	PERSON	, goggling his great eyes Cannily , ' did he not defame the Scots ? '

		` That 's true , ' said
Camden	PERSON	, like a man that hears Truth for the first time . '

		O ay , he defam 'd 'em ' The
King	PERSON	said , very wisely , once again .

		` Ah , but , ' says
Camden	PERSON	, like a man that strives With more than mortal wit , ' only such Scots As flout your majesty , and take tobacco .

		He is a
Scot	PERSON	, himself , and hath the gift Of preaching . '

		Then we gave him

Timothy Scarlet	PERSON	, tells a weird tale of the inter - ment of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	in the vault at
Peter	PERSON	- borough , of how the Queen was buried secretly at night the official funeral of the next day being a farce with an empty coffin and of how that night the ghost of Chastelard forced its way into the vault and mourned the beloved of his youth .

		Interspersed in this narrative are some of the loveliest lyrics that Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	has ever penned . ''

		Ah , stained and ever stainless , Ah , white as her own hand , White as the wonder of that brow , Crowned with colder lilies now , White on the velvet darkness , The lilies of her land !

		One of the actors in this scene is Ford , who '' Fell short of that celestial height Whereto the greatest only climb , who stand By

		The entire passage is too long to quote , but it constitutes a magnificently penetrating char - acterization of the author of `` The Broken Heart . ''

Dick Whittington	PERSON	and the cat that brought him riches and the love of the fair

		It was
Virgil	PERSON	who plucked out the infinite sad - ness that lies at the heart of all such scenes as this when he wrote the immortal line , '' Sunt lacrymse rerum , et mentem mortalia tangunt . ''

		Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	has not failed in his epilogue ; he has found just the right note upon which to end his cycle of song .

		We have let this great work speak for itself , as far as the limitations of space would permit , and no commentary can do much to heighten the sense of its power and beauty , of its rich and varied life , of its crowded action and poetic fire .

		Comparisons are idle ; those that chiefly suggest themselves are with
Browning	PERSON	and
Swinburne	PERSON	and Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	has the dramatic vitality of
Browning	PERSON	, the lyrical rapture of
Swinburne	LOCATION	, and the poetic energy of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	.

		We do not find in him the per - fect finish of Tennysonian art , and
Tennyson	PERSON	is perhaps the only one of the great Victorians whom his performance does not challenge .

		Certainly , we have no other poet now living whose work can measure up to these '' Tales of the Mermaid Tavern , '' and no age of English poetry is so rich that it might not be proud to reckon this work among its greater glories .

		The author 's special bete noire is the `` native son '' of the Golden West , whose portrait is drawn in strong colors and with sharp contrasts .

		But the perspective of our would-be literary cubist is sadly amiss .

		His fault-finding eye is evidently much too close to a few annoying indi - viduals to make it possible for him to sketch in true proportions the real Californian , native born or adopted .

		Neither do his experiences of Western life , as portrayed in his work , lend any weight of authority to his jeremiads .

August 16	DATE	is too cold and too hot , too sunny and too foggy ; it is either too windy or there is not wind enough to blow away the mosquitoes .

		There is no game , and '' game hogs ' ' abound .

		So runs the record of `` one of the happiest years I have ever spent '' !

		Doubtless all of these and the author 's many other doleful observations may be abundantly verified in numerous specific instances by any - one attuned to the disagreeable elements of life , and keenly sensitive to the raw and crude ways of the frontier in a land of strong contrasts .

		But the picture is incomplete , and the colors are all from the wrong end of the spectrum .

		Of the real
Calif	LOCATION	ornians who are subduing the desert , who brought water through mountain ranges and across the sands to
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, who rebuilt
San Francisco	LOCATION	after earthquake and fire , and who are slowly but surely throttling the vicious elements in their midst and banish - ing the saloon and road-house -LRB- whose infre - quency our peripatetic writer so bemoans -RRB- , Mr.

		His evaluation of nature is more generous , but equally erratic and insignificant .

		Little wonder that he opens his description of Mt.
Shasta	PERSON	, the Fujiyama of
California	LOCATION	, with a fulsome discussion of the spit - toons of the thirteen saloons of
Sisson !	ORGANIZATION

		Such a book as this serves no useful purpose , except possibly as a counter-irritant to the freely dis - tributed , generally more trustworthy , though more optimistic and , it may be , fulsome , printed matter of exploitation .

		An introduction to out-of-door
California	LOCATION	, written by one who , evidently in search of health , has found pleasure , comfort , and enjoy - ment in the mountains and deserts , and who has followed with zest the dusty roads and winding trails , is Mr.
C. F. Saunders	PERSON	's `` Under the Sky in
California	LOCATION	. ''

		The book professes `` to give nothing more than a hint of the joy and interest that attend travel by unbeaten ways in
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia , of leisurely residence in the tourist belt .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	is still so young among American commonwealths , and her wide territories are still so little settled , that the lineaments of that virgin landscape which so de - lighted the pioneers , are yet far from obliterated .

		One may still camp on Fre ` mont 's trail in surroundings practically unchanged from those which the great Path - finder himself described sixty-odd years ago ; may stumble over perhaps the selfsame stones that
Pio Pico	PERSON	's horses kicked on the Spanish highroads that lead across the passes down to the desert and Old
Mexico	LOCATION	; may tread in the very footsteps of the
Mission Fathers	ORGANIZATION	from
San Diego	LOCATION	to
San Francisco Bay	LOCATION	; may look out from some peak of the
Sierra	ORGANIZATION	's crest upon forests as yet unscarred by the lumberman and upon sage brush plains where the red Indian still dwells and sets up his thatched wickiup . ''

		It is this nearness to the fresh morning of romance that gives a special zest to life under the sky in
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia , while one 's physical frame is ever grateful for the ease with which one may come from such ventures into the wild , back to the comforts of a civilized life , there to talk it all over with one 's friends , to rest and repair and to go again . ''

		It is not the
California	LOCATION	of the tourist who follows the beaten trail from one hotel to the next that is here revealed , but rather that dis - covered by two nature lovers of limited physical strength but with an aptitude for exploring and courage to try the unknown in desert and moun - tain wilderness .

		Its scenes are laid mainly in
Southern California	LOCATION	, but they might be enacted with equal pleasure in the central valleys and the foothills and forests of the
Sierras	LOCATION	and
Coast Ranges	ORGANIZATION	to the north ; for the same favor - able climatic factors , with some differences as to temperatures and seasons , prevail throughout the length of
California	LOCATION	.

		One section of Mr.
Saunders	PERSON	's book is de - voted to the desert when it blooms in the
spring	DATE	, another to camping in the Yosemite and a unique account of the `` candle lighting '' among the Diegan Indians at
Mesa Grande	LOCATION	on All Souls ' Night .

		Whatever advantages in speed , avoid - ance of your own dust , and indescribable sense of superiority may attend the tourist who sees
California	LOCATION	from the automobile , there still re - main some otherwise unattainable pleasures attached to the more plebeian carriage or camp - ing wagon .

		The wayside trees and flowers , one 's fellow-wayfarers afoot and astride , and the more leisurely appreciation of the local color reward the leisurely travellers .

		Spring - days in a carriage between
Los Angeles	LOCATION	and
San Diego	LOCATION	, with visits to the Missions at
Capistrano	LOCATION	and
San Luis Rey	LOCATION	, and to the home of
Ramona	LOCATION	, seem more attractive than fleeting visions from the speeding motor .

		Many practical suggestions for travellers who desire with comfort and safety to see something of
California	LOCATION	's wilder side will be found in this book , as well as readable ac - counts of ways and means of camp cooking , of bungalow life , and of making a living in the land of sunshine .

		The volume will be a helpful one to many inquirers , and a guide and inspira - tion for a wider appreciation and enjoyment of nature in

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL ill NATURAL , THEOLOGY WITHOUT THEISTIC IMPLICATIONS .

		* In the days of my academic and intellectually irresponsible youth , a favorite diversion in the metaphysical way was to speculate about the con - sequences of turning the orthodox Darwinian evolution formula end for end .

		According to this formula , progressive evolution of living things has been accomplished by the continued natural selection of the individuals best adapted to the environment in which they found them - selves .

		The fact that living things are to a high degree adapted to the circumstances in which they live is evident .

		The classic simile of biological literature is to the effect that the organism is adapted to the environment as the key is to the lock .

		But what if one looks at the whole matter the other way about ?

		Is there not quite as much justification , so far as the objective facts of nature are concerned , for one to say that the environment is adapted to the organism , as there is for him to make the converse proposition ?

		It is as necessary for the lock to fit the key as for the key to fit the lock .

		But while natural selection is , formally at least , a most efficient craftsman in shaping the living key to the environmental lock , it is by no means so clear that it could have effected the nice adjustment of the lock itself .

		In fact the principle of natural selection , in any form as yet conceived , or any other mechanistic hypothesis , utterly fails before such a colossal explanatory task .

		Which consideration com - pletes the creation of a very choice and baffling metaphysical morsel for the delectation of one 's fellow graduate students .

		It is by no means to be supposed that so splendid an argument ad majorem gloriam Dei as that outlined would have been overlooked by the exponents of natural theology .

		It was not .

		Whewell and
Prout	PERSON	, in their Bridge water Treatises , loaded some of their heaviest artil - lery with precisely this brand of philosophical powder .

		Since the
Bridgewater	LOCATION	Treatises are no longer classified by the librarians as `` pop - ular '' fiction , it is perhaps worth a little space to show how
Prout	PERSON	, for example , used the argu - ment in his `` Chemistry Meteorology and the Function of Digestion Considered with Refer - ence to Natural Theology . ''

		He says : '' For instance , the hydrogen in water , and the chlorine and sodium in common salt , not being , in their simple state , required in the economy of nature ; the properties * THE FITNESS OF THE ENVIRONMENT .

Biological Significance of the Properties of Matter	ORGANIZATION	.

The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		of these elements have not been made compatible with organic existence ; and the whole attention -LRB- if such a term may be applied to the operations of the Deity -RRB- , has been directed to the properties of the compounds , water , and salt .

		Thus , on the one hand , where required , we have the most striking adaptation of property ; while on the other , where not required , this adaptation of property has not been attended to : nor is this true of water and salt only , but of almost every other compound in nature .

		Nay , what is more , the incongruities of the whole system have , with the most consummate skill , been thrown , as it were , among those properties not re - quired .

		Hence , the arrangements of nature viewed in this light , not only exhibit novel evidences , but some of the most striking evidences of design , which we possess . ''

		In the three-quarters of a century and more which has passed since the day of the
Earl of Bridgewater	ORGANIZATION	's piously intended bequest there has been no systematic attempt at an examina - tion of the specific fitness of the basic elements of the environment for the requirements of organic life .

		To this problem Dr.
Lawrence J. Henderson	PERSON	has devoted a number of years of thought and research , with results now set forth in a volume entitled `` The Fitness of the Environment . ''

		The result is in many ways a remarkable one .

		It is conclusively shown that for living things constituted as are the only living things we know about , it would be impos - sible , with the physical agencies and chemical compounds now known , to construct an envi - ronment in fundamental respects better adapted to the needs of organisms than is the environ - ment which exists on this earth .

		For the sake of clearness of thinking and to keep the whole inquiry within reasonable bounds , the author makes certain initial limitations of the problem .

		A keen analysis reduces the most fundamental and essential characteristics of life to three , namely , complexity , regulation , and metabolism .

		The most essential features of the environment which is to be capable of support - ing mechanisms with these three characteristics are the presence of water and carbonic acid . ''

		Obviously it is in the physical and chemical attrir butes of these two compounds and their constituent elements that we find very many of the conditions which make life possible upon the earth .

		They are material , provided and mobilized automatically , out of which liv - ing things undoubtedly can be formed .

		Moreover , if we limit our study to the physico-chemical properties of water and carbonic acid , and to the compounds of carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen , we shall greatly simplify our problem . ''

		The bulk of the volume is taken up with a thorough examination of the known physico - chemical properties of water , carbonic acid , and organic compounds .

		An immense mass of data is critically digested .

		The physical and chem - ical properties taken into consideration include 112 THE DIAL -LSB- A ugust 1 G nearly all those known to be of biological im - portance , or which appear to be related to complexity , regulation , and metabolism .

		The collection and treatment of this evidence can only be regarded as a masterly contribution to scientific synthesis .

		It firmly establishes the following conclusions : '' There are no ether compounds which share more than a small part of the qualities of fitness of water and carbonic acid ; no other elements which share those of carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen .

		None of the char - acteristics of these substances is known to be unfit , or seriously inferior to the same characteristic in any other substance .

		Therefore the fitness of the environ - ment is both real and unique . ''

		The author goes on to say : '' In drawing this final conclusion I mean to assert the following propositions : '' I .

		The fitness of the environment is one part of a reciprocal relationship of which the fitness of the organ - ism is the other .

		This relationship is completely and perfectly reciprocal ; the one fitness is not less important than the other , nor less invariably a constituent of a particular case of biological fitness ; it is not less fre - quently evident in the characteristics of water , carbonic acid , and the compounds of carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen than is fitness from adaptation in the charac - teristics of the organism . ''

		II .

		The fitness of the environment results from characteristics which constitute a series of maxima unique or nearly unique properties of water , carbonic acid , the compounds of carbon , hydrogen , and oxygen and the ocean so numerous , so varied , so nearly com - plete among all things which are concerned in the problem that together they form certainly the greatest possible fitness .

		No other environment consisting of primary constituents made up of other known elements , or lacking water and carbonic acid , could possess a like number of fit characteristics or such highly fit charac - teristics , or in any manner such great fitness to promote complexity , durability , and active metabolism in the organic mechanism which we call life . ''

		At this point the book as a contribution to natural science comes to an end .

		A final chapter is devoted to a consideration of the philosophical consequences of the scientific dem - onstration of the earlier pages .

		While this is very well done , it seems to the reviewer , at least , to fall short , in compelling logical force , of the purely scientific part of the work .

		Dr.
Hen	PERSON	- derson shows clearly enough that existing science is totally incapable of giving any satis - factory mechanistic explanation of the mutual fitness of the environment and the organism .

		He considers it well in the present state of knowledge , however , not to affirm finally the impossibility of such an explanation .

		In the meantime he suggests a devitalized teleology in the form of a purposive '' tendency working steadily through the whole process of evolution , '' as at least conceivable , '' however small its bearing upon science , provided , like time itself , it be a perfectly independent variable , making up , therefore , with time the constant environ - ment , so to speak , of the evolutionary process . ''

		This '' tendency '' is not something which can be weighed or measured , but is an original property of matter and energy , '' assuredly not by chance , which organizes the universe in space and time . ''

		Lack of space forbids further discussion of a brilliantly written and altogether notable book . ''

		The Fitness of the Environment , '' in respect of the chapters before the last , is a logical sequel to the '' Origin of Species . ''

		As an intellectual achievement , it invites and cred - itably sustains comparison with that milestone marking the progress of human knowledge .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 113 across the face of
Europe	LOCATION	; alarums and excur - sions ; `` and what the Swede intend , and what the French . ''

		Not among the great correspondences of literature , these letters are nevertheless full of interest when placed in their historical setting .

		Just here appears a defect of Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	's admirable edition .

		Reprinting , as it does , the text of
Steuart A. Pears	PERSON	's translation -LRB-
London	LOCATION	:
Pickering	LOCATION	,
1845	DATE	-RRB- , it might well have reprinted also
Pears	ORGANIZATION	's historical notes .

		These , which add greatly to the value of his version , might have been placed at the end of the present volume , so as not to spoil the page .

		Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	's Intro - duction does not wholly supply their place .

		In all that relates to text and typography , however , the present edition compares favorably with the old .

		The editor has numbered the letters , and has in many places quietly improved Pears 's punctuation , spelling , grammar , and sentence - structure .

		The type-page , though somewhat attenuated , and though its rubrication will not appeal to all , is open and clear , and scarcely inferior to that of A Idi discipulus anglus .

		The last of
Sidney	PERSON	's letters is dated
1578	DATE	; those he wrote between that year and
1580	DATE	are lost .

		It happens that during these years , in all probability , he composed the ''
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' which circulated actively in MS. until
1590	DATE	, when the first edition -LRB- quarto -RRB- was printed .

		This first edition it is that
M. Feuillerat	PERSON	has chosen to reprint ; and , he says -LRB- Prefatory Note -RRB- , his `` choice has proved simple enough . ''

		So it would appear ; and yet there are reasons why a different choice would have been preferable .

		These reasons are bound up so closely with the evolution of the several versions of the ``
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' that their full force can be under - stood only by the reader who will take the pains to inform himself fully about this evolution * ; still , they can be indicated briefly here .

		There are now extant three distinct versions of the ``
Arcadia	LOCATION	. ''

		The first is what
Sidney	PERSON	wrote originally , during or before
1580	DATE	a finished story in five books .

		This original or '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' has never been printed entire .

		The second version is an incomplete revision of the `` Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' carried rather less than halfway to the end .

		It was printed in
1590	DATE	-LRB- quarto -RRB- , and is now textually corrected and reprinted by
M. Feuillerat	PERSON	.

		The third version , printed
1593	DATE	, is composed of the revised ver - * See
Bertram Dobell	PERSON	, `` New Light on
Sidney	PERSON	's
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' '' Quarterly Review , ''
July , 1909	DATE	, pp. 74-100 ; and my '' Greek Romances in Elizabethan Prose Fiction . ''


New York	LOCATION	,
1912	DATE	, pp. 344-353 .

		sion as far as that goes , together with Books III. , IV. , and V. of the `` Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' so joined to the revised version as to piece out the story , though not without a gap between , , ^ - j 1 .

		The original or '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' as written during or before
1580	DATE	, was permitted by
Sidney	PERSON	to remain in active circulation in MS. for five years , more or less , until his death in
1586	DATE	.

		It was not at any time withdrawn or suppressed ; nor was it even superseded by the incomplete revision printed in
1590	DATE	and now reprinted ; for this version covers only a part of the story which the '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' told entire .

		So the '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' remains an integral part of
Sidney	PERSON	's works , and as such .

		demands a place in any edition that professes to be complete .

		2 .

		In intrinsic literary merit , the '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' holds its own with the unfinished revision .

		It is a complete romance , in five books , with beginning , middle , and end , quite simple in structure , and agreeable to read .

		The quarto of
1590	DATE	now reprinted is a partial recen - sion , or rather an unfinished attempt at an entirely new version , of the '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' which
Sidney	PERSON	was able to carry only to a point somewhere in the third book .

		It thus lacks both middle and end ; moreover , it is inter - rupted by many distracting episodes , is exces - sively inverted and complex in structure , and can hardly be read without considerable diffi - culty .

		3 .

		The Quarto of
1590	DATE	is already accessible in photographic facsimile -LRB- ed .

		H.
Oskar Sommer	PERSON	,
London	LOCATION	,
1891	DATE	-RRB- , not to mention the numerous old editions still current , and a recent edition by
E. A. Baker	PERSON	-LRB-
London	LOCATION	,
1907	DATE	-RRB- , all of which embody the text of the quarto substantially , as part of the composite version -LRB- see below -RRB- .

		The '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' exists in
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		no less than five of which three are in
England	LOCATION	and two in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		It could scarcely have been difficult for a scholar of
M. Feuillerat	ORGANIZATION	's standing to get permission to make a text by the collation of the best of these
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		It does not appear that he has tried .

		4 .

		In
1593	DATE	appeared the third or composite version above mentioned , consisting of the revised portion already printed in
1590	DATE	, and the last three books of the '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' together with such minor changes in the text , and such transitions , as were needed to link the two versions together .

		The
1593	DATE	edition has often been reprinted , and is the current form of the romance .

		Now M. Feuillerat promises 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	to print in his next volume '' that part of the original
Arcadia	LOCATION	-LSB- viz .

		Books III. , IV. , and V. -RSB- which was added in
1593	DATE	.

		Thus , the incon - gruity of blending two incompatible forms has been avoided without omitting what is , after all , an interesting part of Sir
Philip Sidney	PERSON	's works . ''

		This argument would require , even more insistently , the reprinting of Books I. and II .

		of the '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' together with Books III. , IV. , and V. , that is , the reprinting of the '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' entire .

		5 .

		There are in Elizabethan literature many allusions to the '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' and several direct borrowings from it .

		All these will remain unintelligible to the vast majority of readers and scholars until the '' Old Arca - dia '' as a whole is accessible in print .

		Fur - thermore , the differences in structure between the Old and the revised ''
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' are im - portant in the evolution of the English novel .

		The chief structural qualities of the revised version that are not possessed by the '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	'' are amplitude , complexity , and chro - nological inversion .

		Now the revised '' Arca - dia , '' handed on in the composite version of
1593	DATE	, is the only piece of Elizabethan fiction whose influence survives into the eighteenth century ; it presides at the birth of the novel ; and may well have endowed the novel with pre - cisely these structural qualities .

		Apart , there - fore , from our intrinsic interest in having before us for comparison an earlier and a later version of the ''
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' the reprinting of the first ver - sion is thus required by the claims of literary history .

		What the present editor ought to have done was to print in his first volume the '' Old
Arcadia	LOCATION	, '' from the MSS. ; to print , in his sec - ond volume , the revised version of
1590	DATE	; and to add thereto , by way of textual variants , the changes and the transitions made by the com - posite edition of
1593	DATE	.

		It is to be hoped that before the issue of his next volume he may see his way clear to putting into it the material which for so many reasons ought to have gone into his first .

		FROM a literary point of view , at least , the '' book of the season '' this year will undoubtedly be the two - volume collection of
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	's Letters , which
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish .

		The selections from this correspondence already printed in '' Scribner 's Magazine '' have given some indication of the wealth that awaits us in the complete work .

		The same publishers also announce '' Some Letters of
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	, '' edited by Mr.
Daniel G. Mason	PERSON	, which also promises a feast of good things .

		HOPES AND PROPHESIES FOIt AMERICAN LIFE .

		* No better augury for the slow and peaceful de - velopment of humankind , especially in this country , can well be imagined than the armful of books , representing every shade of political opinion , which here indicates the tendencies of the time .

		There is a spokesman in this group for every class in our wide national community ; and all express them - selves with a certain dispassion , fervent though some of the statements may be , which is of the essence of a self-governing and progressive people .

		It may be worth while to speak here , since none of the books themselves touch upon this phase of our political history , of the high idealism which has characterized all our national partisan utterances , based as American ideas must be upon the
Decla	LOCATION	- ration of Independence and its self-evident truths .

		So based , no party has identified itself with a single economic class without inviting its own destruction , and has only been able to do so covertly and in antagonism to its professed principles .

		All are na - tional , in the sense of making a nation-wide appeal to men in every situation in life ; none is merely economic , with the exception of the
Socialistic Party	ORGANIZATION	, which has not yet been fairly tested by success .

		Nor , with this exception , has every party failed to include within its ranks men of every shade of economic opinion there is no party of employers , or of employees , none of clerks and another of laborers , but in each and all a fusion which has permitted the discussion of nearly all economic questions freed from the acrimony of partisanship .

		The harm that can be done by the identification of economic and partisan interests is fully exemplified in the tariff , which from the beginning has been a prolific cause of ruin to every party that has used it for merely partisan purposes .

		Every one of these books reflects this national attitude .

		In each case the author shows himself possessed of a wider outlook upon national affairs than any thorough-going partisan is likely to obtain .

		Whatever his prepossessions , his statements are those of the judge speaking after due weighing of the evidence , rather than of the advocate seeking a fav - orable decision .

		Perhaps this shows most clearly in Mr.
Walter Lippmann	PERSON	's '' A Preface to Politics , '' the work of a socialistic leader and writer who is , never - theless , more interested in providing an ideal which all may work toward than a creed which must be * A PREFACE TO POLITICS .

Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL professed as an essential of salvation .

		He is fully aware that the present period is revolutionary ; and he is equally satisfied that it is readily responsive to idealism .

		What he seeks is to present a vision , something higher and nobler than the evils he sees about us clamoring for remedy ; and his text is , `` A God wilt thou create for thyself out of thy seven devils . ''

		More than most , Mr.
Lippmann	PERSON	dis - believes in the old puritan attitude that the world finds betterment through the turning of personal sins into statutory crimes a point of view partic - ularly welcome now that the injection of large masses of women-voters into our body politic has given unnecessary encouragement to the opposing party .

		He is for construction , for positive incentives to right conduct , for the conversion of the energies which are turned toward destruction into forces which make for righteousness , and his remarks upon the tabu of merely prohibitive legislation are as sound as they are shrewd .

		Dr.
Howerth	PERSON	, who holds the chair of sociology in the
University of California	ORGANIZATION	, has made a suggestive and readable book from a series of public addresses delivered at various times and places during recent years .

		Its first value , perhaps , lies in the fact that it is the work of a university professor who is far more interested in seeing the world bettered than in having it maintained as it is .

		Dr.
Howerth	PERSON	, neither plutocrat nor socialist , holds no brief for anything except the ideals which his reading and experience have shown him to be practical ; and he is at one with Mr.
Lippmann	PERSON	in seeking to moralize existing forces , many of which are anti-social through self - seeking .

		He particularizes in regard to these , leading the reader through discussions of the social problem and the various solutions proposed for it , including the existing competitive system , on to the individual problem of getting a living , the problem of our cities , and the effect of education upon labor , until he reaches a statement of the social ideal , with con - siderations of a wider patriotism and a broader religious outlook .

		Realizing , as more ardent parti - sans do not , that progress is along the diagonal of the opposing forces of individualism and collectivism , he finds both the line of least resistance and of the highest human efficiency in voluntary cooperation , which is also the goal of both the philosophic anar - chist and the militant socialist .

		The nation has suffered in the past from lack of radical sentiment among its college youth , most of whom are graduated with the conservative views of elderly bank presi - dents ; and such open-mindedness as this book pro- claims should make a welcome addition to every curriculum certainly in every institution of learn - ing which is concerned as much with things-as-they - might-be as with things-as-they-are .

		A single sentence from the book , properly understood , states the whole matter : `` We must not lose sight of the fact that the object of Capital is profits ; the object of Labor is life . '' ''

		The New Morality '' of Mr.
Isaacson	PERSON	wanders far from the beaten track in offering as a solution for most of our existing evils a definite remedy , neither individualistic nor socialistic , but Utopian however much the author disclaims the Utopian in - tention .

		He would separate civilized mankind into two sharply defined classes .

		One , to which repro - duction of the species shall be solely confided , is to be a yeoman body , bringing forth not only the chil - dren of mankind but its food products in their raw state .

		Experience teaches , the writer urges , that it is among favorable yeoman conditions that the healthiest children are born and reared , and he re - gards it as a waste of human effort that any but those best fitted for it should bear children at all , seeing no possibility of meeting the Malthusian objections and complying with the demands of evo - lutionary eugenics without such a delimitation of effort .

		The rest of the race will be self-condemned to sterility , and will engage in part in the cruder forms of agriculture , but chiefly in commerce and manufacturing , mining and transportation .

		These will be city-dwellers for the most part ; and it did not need the author 's eloquence to demonstrate the advantages of a city in which no children are per - mitted to enter except as visitors , and then only occasionally and under restrictions .

		Mr.
Isaacson	PERSON	meets the woman problem and solves it in a manner which will probably satisfy others more than the women , his prime concern being the elimination of a leisure class among them , including the childless woman , whether married or unmarried , who has commerce with men ; making , however , full allow - ance for the declared and self-sustaining spinster .

		So stated , it will be seen that some primary instincts of mankind will have to be widely diverted from their present status , and the impossibility of doing so fundamental a task with any thoroughness con - stitutes the manifest objection to his plan .

		But it would be most unfair to end with such a statement ; the book is thoughtful and well-considered , well worked out , even to the diagrams which support the author 's position , and provocative of thought through the very novelty of its point of view .

		The Rev. Dr. Strong 's `` Our World '' is a broad - ening of a previous work , `` Our Country , '' and is itself to be followed by another work still broader in its scope .

		It is , of all the books here under con - sideration , the only one with what may be termed an orthodox bias ; its author believes that the
Chris	PERSON	- tian religion as professed by the evangelical churches contains the solution of the difficulties of the world , individual and social .

		Existing troubles are referred to this touchstone , with the result that , as the most radical reformers are aware , nothing can bear such possibilities for thorough-going change as the prac - tice of the precepts of Jesus .

		The book is no mere tract , however , but an honest and manly reckoning with the world as it is , with all the possibilities that science is opening out to humanity .

		It states in terms with which few will disagree a new world - tendency , a new world-industry , a new world-peace , and a new world-ideal .

		It follows these with an acute and sympathetic discussion of the new world - 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	problems in industry , wealth , race , the individual and society , lawlessness and legislation , and the new problem of the city .

		In regard to this last , Dr. Strong takes an unusual position in holding that all attempts to return men to the land are worse than futile , that the cities are here and have grown at the expense of the country everywhere and will so continue to grow , and that we might better face the fact than attempt to delude ourselves with a contrary belief .

		He does not in the least take into account the enormous artificial stimulus given city growth through railway abuses and tariff pabulum in recent years , and that these causes for the relative loss of rural population are already in the way of being remedied ; nor does he consider the waste which permits good immigrant farmers to become poor city operatives through lack of intelligent direction , which is also remediable wholly or partially .

		But by way of compensation for this he plainly tells us that `` the problem of the city is nothing less than the problem of civilization , the problem of building in the earth the
New Jerusalem	LOCATION	. ''

		Here he is in agreement with the best thought of the age .

		How this problem is to be solved is reserved for consid - eration in another volume .

		`` Crowds , '' Mr.
Gerald Stanley Lee	PERSON	's latest book of practical idealism , is the most striking volume of our group .

		It is much more strikingly written , and both arrests and holds the attention better .

		And its method is so simple that it is difficult to disagree with it , no matter where it leads .

		Briefly stated , Mr.
Lee	PERSON	delights in showing us just how far the most open-minded and generous-souled men among us have actually -LRB- not theoretically -RRB- gone toward solving the problems of every-day living , following this by the suggestion that we move up beside them and enjoy the feeling of actual , veritable , demon - strable progress .

		It is difficult to deny the charm of such an invitation , nor can there be any desire to deny it .

		We are not dealing with dreamers except those that have made their dreams come true , and the temptation is necessarily strong to go to work to prove that our dreams are just as good as those of these other men .

		Where others hold that man - kind is moving in a circle , and that it is impossible to strike a tangent until this , that , or the other has been done , Mr.
Lee	PERSON	points out that this , that , and the other has been done and is doing , and persuades us into the procession .

		He believes in saying `` Do ! ''

		and not `` Do n't ! ''

		He points out that nearly all our evils come from lack of vision , and he musters the visions that have become realities to prove his case .

		He seems to look upon ignorance of existing facts as the prime cause of lack of advance and retro - gression which is obvious enough ; but he demon - strates that ignorance is curable by showing how much has been cured already by those who have knowledge .

		In one aspect the book is a catalogue of the exhilarations of civilization as it is , and its perusal leaves the reader almost as much exhilarated with practicalities as the writer was when he wrote it or as other reformers are by visions unrealized .

		More than any other writer whose books are read , Mr.
Lee	PERSON	seems to be absolutely convinced that democracy is never a process of levelling down but of raising up , and he has the faith of a Jefferson in human perfectibility .

		As the cover of the volume proclaims , it is `` a book for the individual , '' but for the individual as the one essential component of all '' Crowds . ''

		It is cordially recommended to every reader who is interested in the world 's getting for - ward , chiefly as a further incentive for him to `` go forwarder . ''

		When it is recalled that this group of varied and various works are written by Americans for Ameri - cans , that they are the appeals of men of vision to the nation which had the highest vision possible to humanity granted it at the moment of its birth , that not one of them betrays a sign of self-seeking or per - sonal exploitation or desire to profit by the mistakes of mankind except for mankind 's future betterment , that they represent the work of men of families long in the country and of families entering the country only yesterday , that they are free from almost every bewildering bias and misconception that has clouded the eyes of earlier generations , and that their single and universal message is of material betterment solely as a means for spiritual enlightenment , the faintest-hearted among us should take courage for the long fight and go forth newly armed and armored to gain the victory .

		WALLACE RICE .

		BKIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Prehittoric Dr '
Rob 61 ^ Munro	PERSON	's bulky volume , lake-dwellings `` Palaeolithic Man and Terramara in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Settlements in
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- , constituting the latest contribution of an inde - fatigable worker to his favorite field , is composed of the
Munro Lectures	ORGANIZATION	in Anthropology and Prehistoric Archaeology , delivered during
February	DATE	and
March , 1912	DATE	, in connection with the
University of Edin	ORGANIZATION	- burgh .

		They form the first course given after the foundation of the Lectureship , which appears to be permanently endowed .

		It is now more than thirty years since Dr.
Munro	PERSON	published his first great work , `` Ancient Scottish Lake-dwellings or
Cran	PERSON	- nogs . ''

		At rather regular intervals since then , he has made other and various important contributions to archaeological science .

		Only the special student realizes what significant advances have recently been made in this field of study .

		Within ten years , one may say that the known number of skulls and other skeletal remains of ancient man has been doubled , and the more recent finds have been of unquestion - able authenticity and extraordinary interest ; so of relics of ancient culture , no more startling and illuminating discoveries have ever been made than those of the past fifteen years .

		So rapidly have discoveries crowded upon one another that even the specialist keeps pace with them only by diligence and with difficulty .

		The ordinary reader has had no means of knowing of this wealth of new material
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 117 save through the misleading cursory references in occasional sensational newspapers .

		Dr.
Munro	PERSON	has then done a very real service in his new book .

		Upon the two special and quite separate topics which he has chosen to discuss , he gives us the latest discov - eries , facts , and theories .

		Thus , in regard to palae - olithic man , he briefly describes and states the facts concerning all those recently discovered remains which have caused such a stir in the world of science ; to give completeness , he of course restates the facts regarding the earlier finds the Neanderthal skull , the Spy remains , the Naulette jawbone but his special service is in informing us of the Mousterien finds so lately made by
Otto Hauser	PERSON	, the remarkable skeleton of Chapelle-aux-Saints , and wonderful jaw - bone from
Mauer	PERSON	; he summarizes all the older infor - mation regarding the scratched designs on bone and horn from
Magdalenien	LOCATION	caves , but he also presents to us the even more interesting ivory and bone sculp - tures which
Piette	ORGANIZATION	found in cave deposits of yet older age .

		He presents an admirable summary of the astonishing incised and painted representations of animals upon the walls of Pyrenean caverns , and the remarkable frieze of sculptured horses and other animals in the rock-shelter of Cap-Blanc .

		In a fine chapter upon the so-called hiatus between Palaeolithic and Neolithic cultures of
Europe	LOCATION	, he brings together a mass of interesting and recent evidence to prove that there is no actual gap .

		The second part of the work deals with Italian terramares and related struc - tures in other countries .

		Dr.
Munro	PERSON	's specialty has been lake - dwellings , terramares , crannogs , and kin - dred forms .

		In connection with this part of his book he presents a bibliography of Italian literature upon the subject , extending from
1822	DATE	to
1911	DATE	and including 212 items .

		The Italian terramares have been a considerable problem ; they were somewhat like the lake-dwelling villages of
Switzerland	LOCATION	, but their pile-supported huts were over low-lands or swamps and not over open lakes , and they were sur - rounded by an artificial moat and dike .

		Dr.
Munro	PERSON	sketches the history of study of the terramares , describes them , investigates their purpose and the culture which they represent , and works out their relation to lake-dwellings all this in
Italy	LOCATION	; he then traces the occurrence of similar or analogous con - structions elsewhere , and deals with the question of origins .

		One readily sees that the book is at once interesting and important .

		In fact , there has been no equally important contribution to European pre - historic archaeology , in English , for years .

		Taken as a whole , Mr.
Robert W. KSSSSSi Garden	PERSON	's `` Michelangelo : A Record of his Life as Told in his Own Let - ters and Papers '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a monotonous re - cital of petty tribulations .

		Obviously Michelangelo 's constant preoccupation with three other arts largely accounts for the fact that his deepest self could find but scant expression through the written word .

		In - frequently does he pen a sentence without a practical and commonplace motive behind it .

		Such motives , unfortunately , were supplied in exceptional abun - dance by the pressure of everyday anxieties .

		These arose on the one hand from the needs of his father 's family , to whose precarious welfare he devoted a lifetime ; and , on the other hand , from the capricious desires of his high patrons .

		If a Renaissance pope or cardinal were not demanding an impossible num - ber of statues '' more beautiful and better wrought and finished than any modern figures to be found in
Rome	LOCATION	to-day '' -LRB- page 17 -RRB- , the payment for which was often doubtful , why then a heedless brother or nephew was in need of aid , or a word-thrashing .

		By the time the reader reaches page 256 , he is ready to be surprised at discovering what seems , from its opening , a spontaneous letter of friendship to an old Florentine crony but which , as too soon appears , was actuated primarily by a desire that the recipient should keep a critical eye on the mistrustful artist 's young nephew .

		Again , in reply to an importunate admirer ,
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	gives utterance to his feelings on the principles of sculpture and painting ; but he brings the letter to a hasty close , pleading lack of time and energy .

		In short , those various aspects of an artist 's inner life which the reader expects to find recorded in a collection of his letters are scarcely represented .

		So that the work is actually , notwith - standing its promising title , very narrow in scope , and would sadly mislead the unprepared reader .

		On the other hand , one who is well acquainted with the great artist 's biography and with his works , may be willing to wade through the book for the sake of occasional passages of vital interest otherwise inac - cessible outside of the archives : passages redolent of the master 's grim humor , large generosity , and rugged force of intellect and emotion , as well as of less attractive but quite characteristic qualities .

		Be - tween the lines , too , such a reader can find constantly a poignant pathos , especially toward the close of the long story when , still full of high plans for art and beset as ever with tribulations , the old man has to confess that '' I have reached the twenty-fourth hour of my day , and no project arises in my brain which hath not the figure of Death graven upon it .

		The incidents are not told as marvels , since they happened , in the view of 118 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	the narrator , in due course of nature ; and there is no effort to convert skeptics to a belief in airy spirits .

		Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's interest in fairy lore is not controversial .

		Rather it is aesthetic spiritual and sensuous by turns .

		These things happen to him ; in that sense assuredly they are true ; and their real interest , he feels , lies in their being genuine human experiences with creatures of another order of life creatures of superhuman loveliness , capable of fierce joy , impulsive , active , unmoral , yielding obedience to no known law but that of being .

		Inci - dentally to his fairy experiences , Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	gives inviting glimpses of his boyhood , and he theorizes entertainingly about the duality of human nature that brings poetry , high adventure , romance , and vision into the drab commercial prose of life .

		Scorn - fully does he demolish the hypothesis of those who insist on judging others by themselves or regarding humanity as essentially uniform , and denying all realities which they have not experienced .

		The chapter on '' Windows '' puts one on the lookout for odd vagaries in one 's fellows , awakens sym - pathy with vagrant , inexplicable impulses , with odd turns of thought and unexpected depths of feeling .

		There is something of fairy in many humans , accor - ding to Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	; and the discovery of these wild , shy sprites and the luring of them into the open of intercourse will be , for most , perhaps , of Mr.
Hewlett	PERSON	's readers , the finest flower of his ini - tiation of them into the lore of the fairy kingdom .

		Some years ago Mr.
Frank Arthur	PERSON	M mby developed a plan to illustrate certain phases of Tudor history by the use of contemporary letters .

		He began to carry out his plan by publishing a volume on `` The Girlhood of Queen Elizabeth '' ; this has recently been followed by another on `` The Youth of
Henry VIII	PERSON	. ''

		-LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- ; and Mr.
Mumby	PERSON	hopes to continue the series until the entire history of
England	LOCATION	is illustrated in this way .

		The letters published are taken chiefly from the
Calendars of State Papers	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- English -RRB- ; but various other collections , both English and French , have also been used .

		Of editorial comment there is very little , only what is necessary to bridge the gap between the successive documents .

		As not all the documents are accessible elsewhere in printed or translated form , the work may prove of some value to the historical student ; but the general reader is seldom attracted to documentary materials in undi - gested form .

		The account begins with
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's birth in
1491	DATE	, and closes with the secret marriage of his sister
Mary	PERSON	to
Charles Brandon	PERSON	in
1515	DATE	.

		The larger part of the work is devoted to diplomatic intrigues of which international relations were full in that age , and to domestic matters , especially mat - rimonial negotiations and plans ; of the new English life in commeice and industry very little is said .

		Mr.
Mumby	PERSON	's work has no discernible point of view , and shows no bias : the author does not attempt '' to pass judgment on controverted topics '' but tries `` to allow each side to state its case in its own words . ''

		His opinion is , however , rather favorable to the young Henry : he was '' spoiled a little , perhaps , by flattery , but even when due allowance is made for exaggera - tion , a splendid figure of a man ... '' The work contains eight good portraits , all but one of which are of members of the
Tudor	PERSON	family .

		further ^ third volume of Dr.
Sven Hedin	PERSON	's researches `` Trans-Himalaya : Discoveries and in
Tibet	LOCATION	.

		Adventures in
Tibet	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- continues his detailed and illuminating account of his adventures among the nomads and pundits of the high plateaus about the sources of the Indus , in the highlands of
Western Tibet	LOCATION	, and the Sutlej valley .

		These are regions some of which have never been trodden before by the foot of any white man , and the author takes this occasion to defend his claims to discovery which have been questioned by some on the basis of previously published maps .

		An ex - tensive review of these earlier publications and an exhaustive examination into their sources afford the occasion for a review of previous explorations and explorers of this remote part of the world , as well as an opportunity for a vigorous and seemingly successful defense .

		The ancient Aryans enveloped this world of impenetrable mountains in a tissue of legends and lyrics .

		Through this fabric of myths there runs a slender thread of geographic fact , coiled and twisted by each succeeding narrator , even to the present .

		Dr.
Hedin	PERSON	has at last explored and thoroughly mapped the mystic Lake Manasarowar in spite of treaty provisions of the
Great Powers	ORGANIZATION	, the prohibitions of the Lama and his subordinates , and the great physical obstacles of all but impassable barrier mountains , great elevation , the risks of fail - ing food supply , and the dangers of attack by nomad robbers .

		The author reiterates his thesis of the great similarities of form between Catholicism and Tibetan Lamaism , quotes extensively from other authorities in defence of his view , and seems to have quite demolished the ultra-montane objectors .

		Illus - trations from photographs and the author 's facile pencil abound , and a good map and an ample index maintain the high order of bookmaking established in the first two volumes of this , the fullest account of
Tibet	LOCATION	yet published .

		Measuring Dr -
Frederick Adams Woods	PERSON	, the the influence author of `` Mental and Moral Her - of monarch * .

		edity in Royalty , '' has carried the thought of this book through to a logical conclusion in his new volume , `` The Influence of Monarchs : Steps in a New Science of History '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The earlier work consisted in accumulating facts relating to royal families and those of the first nobility , with two ends in view : One , the ascer - tainment of the power of heredity over circum - stance ; the other , the securing of material for a scientific study of the causes by which history moves .

		The present book is characterized as '' the first application of the methods of historical meas - urement -LRB- historiometry -RRB- to the larger questions of
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 119 national growth and decline . ''

		The method is a scientific one , consisting in taking a consensus of historians regarding the qualities of the rulers of fourteen European nations from the beginnings of the middle ages to the opening of the nineteenth century , and comparing this consensus with the progress made under these monarchs ' respective rules .

		An agreement is found between the capaci - ties of sovereigns and actual progress in three - fifths of the cases , the number of correspondences being largely increased if incapacity and lack of progress or retrogression are taken into account .

		By this method
England	LOCATION	, significantly , shows little or no relation between the qualities of its sovereigns and true progress since the time of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, indicating that democracy and the power of self-government more than offset the influence of monarchs .

		Gen - erally speaking , Dr.
Woods	PERSON	's later work confirms the conclusions of the earlier , to the effect that heredity is a stronger governing factor than envi - ronment among the monarchs considered , and that the royal families of
Europe	LOCATION	show an unduly large proportion of talent and even genius when com - pared with all others .

		It is Dr.
Woods	PERSON	's intention to provide a firm statistical foundation for a true philosophy of history , whereby correction can be made of the personal estimates of historians and deductions follow which will place the new science of '' historiometry '' upon a scientific basis , through something analogous to a laboratory method .

		The book is instructively interesting throughout , not the least curious of the reflections it induces arising from its democratic summoning of these centuries of crowned majesty before the examining board of science , there to receive a grading not unlike that given a potential freshmen class .

		T - > - n \ in psychical gestion -LRB-
Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
Peter Reilly	PERSON	-RRB- research .

		Mr.
E. L. Ash	PERSON	attempts an essay in apologetics , common enough but reminiscent of an escape from danger that was '' almost providen - tial . ''

		Mr.
Ash	PERSON	argues that cures of illness by appeal to religious faith , though fairly well accounted for by suggestion , are almost miraculous .

		He pre - fers to believe them so , and tries to ease his logical conscience by bringing in a pointless tale of a young woman whose case was diagnosed by some as tuber - culous and by others as hysterical , and who after visions of religious import ceased to be an invalid .

		Assuming that she was really tuberculous and not hysterical , she had a real illness from which she was miraculously cured ; and the photograph of the room in which the visions took place is exhibited in circumstantial evidence .

		The book is a type of the gleanings in the field of '' psychical research , '' in which the gleaner takes comfort in the view that by liberal concessions one may believe both in faith and in suggestion ; the latter as an accredited psy - chological process answering for the ordinary occa - sions ; and the former for extraordinary ones .

		Entertaining a crude view of the antagonism between the '' materialists '' and the '' spiritualists , '' he offers a crude special plea for the justification of the latter and the discomfiture of the infidel .

		Similarly - minded readers may gain a feeble reflection of the satisfaction which the author enjoyed in overcoming by faith and suggestion his lingering doubts of the inadequacy of his position .

		Alaska of ^ e author of ``
Alaska	LOCATION	: An Empire to-day and in the Making '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , to-morrow .

		Mr j j
Underwood	PERSON	, has spent four - teen years in the far north and has gathered a fund of trustworthy information pertaining to the natural resources of this great territory , its govern - mental inadequacies , its economic problems , and its industrial and agricultural possibilities .

		The por - trayal is in journalistic style , and the facts are mar - shalled in effective and often startling array , with a completeness and scope that make the book a veri - table up-to-date encyclopaedia of things Alaskan .

		It is far more , however , than a dry recital of statistics , for it is full of human interest from cover to cover , and affords an interesting picture of life in the sea - ports and mining camps of this far northwest .

		The widespread impression prevails that
Alaska	LOCATION	is cold and barren , a land of mountains or swamps , of in - terest only to the transient prospector or occasional sportsman .

		A broader vision of its latent possibil - ities is opened here , of undeveloped fisheries , of wheat fields as yet untilled , of potential meat supply in reindeer and caribou , of copper , iron , and coal awaiting industrial exploitation , and of water power inexhaustible .

		The author has the conventional local view of the desirability of capitalistic exploitation and of the conservation craze .

		It is to be hoped that the book will do something towards expediting Congressional action which shall provide adequate local self-government and permit a sane and regu - lated development of the great resources of this territory , rich in food supplies and in fuel for the western world .

		Governmental The tenth Volume f '' The Journal of records of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Burgesses of
Virginia	LOCATION	, ''
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		edited by Mr < H > R > Mcllwaine , the
State Librarian	ORGANIZATION	, and published by the
Library Board	ORGANIZATION	of the
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	, covers the seven ses - sions of the
House of Burgesses	ORGANIZATION	held from
1702	DATE	to
1712	DATE	, the period being almost exactly that of the reign of Queen
Anne	PERSON	.

		During this time three governors
Nicholson	PERSON	,
Nott	PERSON	, and
Spottswood	PERSON	represented the Queen in
Virginia	LOCATION	.

		The capital at
Jamestown	LOCATION	having been destroyed by fire , the seat of government was removed to
Williamsburg	LOCATION	, where for a time the sessions were held in
William	LOCATION	and
Mary College	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Journals here published are from copies in the English public record office , and have never before been printed .

		The contents throw light upon governmental practices in the colony of
Virginia	LOCATION	, the methods and extent of taxation , the disputes between governor and council and the popular house , the problem of imperial control , the tendency of the lower house to extend its powers at 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	the expense of governor and council , and colonial law-making .

		These volumes continue to present material of great value for the study of the devel - opment of English constitutional government in the
New World	LOCATION	, and the extension of English methods of local government into new fields and under con - ditions unknown in the mother country .

		The work of editor and printer continues to maintain the high standard set by the previous volumes .

		Wonders of Miss
Agnes C. Laut	PERSON	knows
America	LOCATION	, the American from
Hudson Bay	LOCATION	to the
Gulf of Southwest	ORGANIZATION	.


Mexico	LOCATION	, and from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		She has wandered far and wide , with seeing eyes , an open mind , and a gift for extracting information from everyone with whom she comes in contact .

		What she has learned , from men and books , she has made good use of in persuading the people of
America	LOCATION	that they need not leave their own con - tinent to find romance and picturesqueness , dramatic episodes , stirring history , or even ancient ruins .

		She has written in the past of the exploits of French explorers in the north and the west ; of the lives and adventures of fur-traders and trappers ; of the one - time empire of the Hudson 's Bay Company ; and what she has written has been both entertaining and informing .

		In the latest of perhaps a dozen volumes , she takes her readers '' Through Our Unknown Southwest '' -LRB-
McBride	PERSON	-RRB- that wonderful region of mountain , desert , and forest , of mile - deep canons , of Spanish missions and prehistoric ruins .

		She takes us through the enchanted
Mesa of Acoma	LOCATION	, the Painted Desert , and the Petrified Forests ; she shows us the cave dwellings of neolithic man in the
Jemez Mountains	LOCATION	, the ancient city of
Taos	LOCATION	, and the Spanish mission of
San Xavier	LOCATION	at
Tucson	LOCATION	; and she asks , not without reason , why 120,000 Americans yearly go to
Europe	LOCATION	in search of the picturesque when their own land teems with it .

		She tells of a young American who , after he had graduated from
Harvard	LOCATION	, set out on a round-the-world trip in search of that old-world interest that he did not dream of looking for in his own intensely modern country .

		In
Nagasaki	LOCATION	a learned little Jap staggered him by asking eagerly about the antiquities of his own
Southwest	LOCATION	; in
Egypt	LOCATION	he learned from an English traveller that
America	LOCATION	possessed monuments much more ancient than the Sphinx ; and , as he wandered among the ruins of
Pompeii	LOCATION	, he was asked `` how
America	LOCATION	was progressing excavating her ruins . ''

		It is .

		well that we should be reminded , and reminded as effectively as Miss Laut does in this book , that we have within comparatively easy reach a vast region of limitless interest to the archaeologist , the historian , and the simple every-day traveller .

		So universal is the renaissance of the drama * -
< %	PERCENT	that W ?

		are intel '' ested in the manifestation of the dramatic spirit wherever it appears .

		Accordingly we are ready to welcome Mr.
Addison McLeod	PERSON	's `` Plays and Players of Modern
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Sergei	PERSON	-RRB- for giving a pretty full treatment of the Italian drama .

		The point of view is that of an Englishman who has seen many performances in
Italy	LOCATION	and who looks at them as a student of the theatre rather than of lit - erature .

		There is necessarily a good deal of the outlining of plot , which is dull writing and duller reading when unenlivened by apt quotation and com - ment .

		From such dulness Mr.
McLeod	PERSON	is compar - atively free , though at times he is neither very interesting nor very clear .

		He brings out well the more striking differences between the Italian and the English actor , and shows how the audiences naturally react upon the performers .

		He has ap - preciative studies of the great Italian actors , some of whom -LRB-
Duse	PERSON	and
Salvini	PERSON	, for example -RRB- are well known on this side .

		On the whole , the book gives an impression of the author as thoroughly interested in the drama and in love with the Italian acting .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		The Everyman Encyclopaedia '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , of which two volumes are now before us , is published in the familiar form and at the low price of the other works in '' Everyman 's Library . ''

		There are to be twelve vol - umes of the complete set , which means that an English - man can acquire for three dollars , and an American for four , a really satisfactory work of general reference .

		The volumes contain approximately half a million words each , which marvel is accomplished by double - columned pages and small but by no means illegible type .

		Roget 's '' Thesaurus , '' in two volumes , is another new accession to the reference section of '' Everyman 's Library . ''

		Professor
William Bateson	PERSON	's ''
Mendel	PERSON	's Principles of Heredity '' -LRB-
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	; imported by Putnam -RRB- still remains the standard handbook of Men - delism , notwithstanding the fact that the very rapid advance of knowledge in this field since the appearance of the enlarged
second edition three years ago	DATE	has ren - dered some portions quite out of date .

		A third impres - sion of this notable book has recently been issued , with a few pages of additional matter designed to remedy in some measure the defect mentioned .

		What is needed , however , as the author recognizes , is an entire re-writing of considerable portions of the original text .

		In this day and generation when women are coming into their own , such a book as Mr.
Willis	PERSON	J Abbot 's `` Notable Women in History '' -LRB- Winston -RRB- , giving in brief and handy form the chief facts in the lives of seventy-three celebrated female characters , ancient and modern , is assured of a considerable circulation , and will be especially appreciated as a book of reference for women 's clubs and for the use of those preparing papers on the woman movement or some kindred theme .

		Under seven heads '' A Group of Classic Dames , '' '' Many
Queens	LOCATION	and Some Martyrs , '' '' Women of Wit and Pleasure , '' '' Priestesses of Woman 's Cause , '' '' Some Women of the Footlights , '' '' Women in Arts and Letters , '' and `` Women Who Stand Alone '' and with a space varying from three to ten pages devoted to each character , these little biographies are attractively pre - sented , and are in many instances accompanied by a por - trait from either a painting or a photograph .

		The book seems especially adapted to the needs and the re - sources of our smaller public libraries .

August 16 , 1913	DATE	`` A masterly setting forth of a series of the most fascinating stories in the nation 's history . ''

		The
Herald	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
NewYork	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Truth is Stranger than Fiction A S a rule , probably because we know it only through reading the old-fashioned dry-as-dust L \ works , we are apt to consider history as heavy reading , but the modern historical writer - A -- | L - goes below the surface and seeks out the motives , often hidden , that bring about events , and gives us men and women who were the actors in them , as they really were , human , with all their merits and faults , their loves and hates .

		Thus they bring to the eye and mind a panorama of past events in just the way the stage does .

		In life-like pictures of the sort all the romance in the story of our country is set before us in the delightful way of the historical novelists , with the advantage that truth is indeed often stranger and more romantic than fiction .

		Few of us , for example , care greatly about our early squabble with
France	LOCATION	, but how interesting we all would find the story of our brilliant diplomat who bravely followed
Napoleon	PERSON	into the snowy wastes of
Russia	LOCATION	in the effort to obtain redress for certain wrongs and who died in a lonely village near
Cracow	LOCATION	.

		We would all probably confess that our idea of the conquest of
Mexico	LOCATION	is one that is all of war and bloodshed and of some unnatural demigod-like beings ; but the story of
Marina	LOCATION	, the beautiful native , and her part in
Cortes	PERSON	's life as viceroy , shows us that they were very human .

		Woman 's influence on man has played a much more important part in American history -LRB- in the
White House	ORGANIZATION	as well as elsewhere -RRB- than a reading of the ordinary histories would lead one to suppose .

		But the fact is , a frivolous woman holds General
Howe	PERSON	inactive in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	while a noble one sends a warning to
Washington	LOCATION	at
Valley Forge	ORGANIZATION	;
Sacajawea	ORGANIZATION	helps and encour - ages
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	; another Indian maiden foils
Pontiac	LOCATION	's conspiracy ; a belle of
Baltimore	LOCATION	stirs up
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's rancor against
America	LOCATION	; a
Dolly Madison	PERSON	cheers up the disheartened while the British are within cannon shot of
Washington	LOCATION	; a woman uplifts
Burr	PERSON	, another makes him unhappy , still another supports him in his dotage , and so on in hundreds of cases .


Catherine Motour	PERSON	and
Mary Surratt	PERSON	make us shudder , while
Jeanne Mance	PERSON	and
Helene de Champlain	PERSON	,
Arabella Johnson	PERSON	and
Margaret Brendt	PERSON	, excite our admiration .

		A true history of
America	LOCATION	, just as any true picture of life , must show the dark as well as the bright side in our story .

		And so up to date and progressive authors , casting aside dry tradition , have given in this series accounts that palpitate with life of the peoples of
America	LOCATION	; all told , as a leading
London	LOCATION	journal says , in a fascinating and brilliant way that is at once entertaining and instructive .

		To illustrate this series , there has been prepared a series of about fifteen hundred facsimiles in colors and black and white .

		Many of the originals , never reproduced before and now issued for the first time , can not be procured in any other way .

		To give an idea of how interesting these are we will send gratis upon receipt of request a collection of these subjects , the whole forming an instructive souvenir of the history of
America	LOCATION	that can not be procured for any price in any other way . ''

		156 LIBRARY THEORY AND PRACTICE .

		One of the puzzling questions repeatedly confronting the library worker , as well as all the rest of mankind , is how to keep theory and practice within some measurable distance of each other .

		The ideal and the real are perpet - ually playing at hide-and-seek in this world of ours , so that for the greater part of the time the one is completely out of sight of the other .

		Systems that work charmingly on paper prove elsewhere as disinclined to go as was Obstinate to leave the
City of Destruction	ORGANIZATION	.

		Rules and principles that seem to the library-school stu - dent in his library-school days so beautiful and at the same time so important and so practic - able that all the world of books and readers ought to find its highest pleasure in conforming thereto , have a mysterious way in after life of developing an unexpected and highly unwel - come inapplicability to concrete cases .

		But what is the use of two laborious years , or it may have been three , at
Albany	LOCATION	or the
Pratt Institute	ORGANIZATION	if one is to fall back ignominiously at last on plain common-sense or rule-of - thumb or other unsanctioned substitute for the printed precept and the approved formula ?

		And is it a thing to be contemplated with equanimity that one should actually be tempted to laugh at one 's former zeal in learning certain grand general principles and a multitude of minute details that somehow fail afterward to demon - strate their intimate relation with the every - day duties of a hard - worked librarian ?

		But conscientious endeavor to live up to the very letter of library law is fraught with the danger of making oneself a ridiculous , stiff-jointed pedant instead of a pleasing , popular , and pliant servant of the book-reading public .

		Memory retains , with most of us , indelible impressions of those beautifully engraved lines at the top of our copy-book pages , that served as models on which we shaped our early exercises in penmanship .

		In the remote past of the eighties and seventies and sixties , it was the gracefully sloping Spencerian caligraphy that we painfully imitated , with tongue in cheek and head inclined at an angle of forty-five de - grees .

		Later decades have seen the rise of the uncompromising up-and-down or vertical style 132 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	of handwriting , intolerant of meaningless cur - licues and having in general , with all its prim regularity , something of the plainness of a board fence .

		But the persistence of either manner in the penmanship of a person who has arrived at years of discretion is something that makes one smile and form an immediate and not altogether complimentary opinion of that person 's force and originality .

		Why , then , are we taught to write in a fashion that we are expected to cast aside a few years later ?

		Obviously , because there is no other advisable course for all con - cerned than to teach the '' faultily faultless '' style to begin with , and then leave it to the pupil to develop his own characteristic varia - tions on the model as he approaches maturity .

		So with library theory ; a method unworkable in all its details in any single public library , but beautifully adapted to the ideal library in an ideal community , is the only possible one for teaching purposes , while the variations and irreg - ularities , the short-cuts and the novel adjust - ments and the temporary expedients , must be left to evolve for themselves -LRB- with the alert and resourceful librarian 's aid -RRB- in the storm and stress of actual library service .

		The story is well known of the learned college professor who awoke one night in a cold sweat from a nightmare in which he dreamt of being compelled , in order to retain his chair , to pass the entrance examinations at the institution where he taught a test that taxed his powers to the breaking point .

		How many of our fore - most librarians would thoroughly enjoy taking the examinations required for a diploma at the
Albany	LOCATION	library school ?

		And how many of those who every year pass these examinations most brilliantly will ever be heard of again as heads of the leading large libraries ?

		Few prac - tising physicians would undertake to compete successfully with seniors at the medical school for academic honors , and not many veteran lawyers would face with entire confidence a searching test in
Blackstone	ORGANIZATION	and Kent .

		In Trollope 's novel , '' The Eustace Diamonds , ''
Arthur Herriot	PERSON	, a young and as yet briefless barrister , is represented as always carrying about with him a volume or two of Stone and
Toddy	ORGANIZATION	's `` Digest of the Common Law , '' at which he grinds away industriously ; while his friend
Frank Greystock	PERSON	, who has already achieved success and enjoys a lucrative prac - tice , hardly ever gives a thought to the law . ''

		The best of the legal profession , '' declares the author , '' consists in this that when you get fairly at work you may give over working .

		An aspirant must learn everything ; but a man may make his fortune at it , and know almost nothing .

		He may examine a witness with judgment , see through a case with precision , address a jury with eloquence , and yet may be altogether ignor - ant of the law .

		But he must be believed to be a very pundit before he will get a chance of exer - cising his judgment , his precision , or his elo - quence .

		The men whose names are always in the newspapers never look at their Stone and Toddy care for it not at all have their Stone and Toddy got up for them by their juniors when cases require that reference shall be made to precedents . ''

		That is rather cynical and flippant , even though it may be not without a grain of truth , and the contempt felt by
Trollope	ORGANIZATION	's successful lawyer for Stone and Toddy need not argue a like contempt for
Dewey	ORGANIZATION	and Cutter on the part of the successful librarian .

		Let it not be sup - posed that any part of the purpose of this article is to throw discredit on the training school of any profession .

		The ideally perfect system of library economy has to be taught before the more or less faulty practice can be taken up to the best advantage ; and , after all , what working librarian who has entered his profession by the way of
Albany	LOCATION	or the
Pratt Institute	ORGANIZATION	or other approved route , does not look back most grate - fully upon that preliminary drill in the theory of his calling ?

		In that enjoyable sheaf of alumni memories included in the recent pamphlet -LRB- `` The First Quarter Century of the
New York State Library School	ORGANIZATION	'' -RRB- issued at
Albany	LOCATION	, occurs a significant passage from the pen of Mr.
Edwin H. Anderson	PERSON	, who has lately succeeded Dr. Billings as Director of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Having been , '' he says , `` some years out of college when I entered the school , I naturally found the close study of the many details of library work , and especially the minutiae of cataloguing , very irksome .

		When I tried to learn to write catalogue cards in ' library hand , ' I felt like an elephant trying to do fancy needlework .

		I shall never forget the gory red of the reviser 's corrections on my cards .

		I was inclined to cavil at many of the minute , not to say fussy , details of cataloguing .

		I still think some of them were fussy ; but I had not been long engaged in practical library work before I saw reasons for most of those minute details .

		I suppose there is no more assured maker of col - lege curricula than the freshman , and I remem - ber that during my first term in the school I had little doubt that I could vastly improve its curriculum .

		Now , after twenty years ' experi -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 133 ence as a librarian , during which I have had more or less to do with the management of three library schools , I am not so confident . ''

		This conflict , whether real or only apparent , between theory and practice in every profession is , of course , merely one manifestation of a strife as old as humanity ; and undoubtedly neither idealists nor realists , neither Platonists nor Aris - totelians , will ever succeed in having things all their own way .

		But it is remarkable how within the twenty-five years of library-school history the ready jibe at school-made librarians has died on the scorner 's tongue , and the school itself has won its right to stand unchallenged beside the other professional schools , which in their turn were once compelled to show reason why they should be suffered to exist .

		Thus the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns ; and to what still undreamt-of achievements library theory shall break the road for timid and doubting practice , remains to be seen .

		CAS
UAL	ORGANIZATION	COMMENT .

		HOME BEADING , both for pleasure and for profit , receives in these days the encouragement offered by an increasing production of books at prices which , especially in the case of reprints , are within the reach of nearly all , by the steady growth of the public library system and the attention now given to bringing the books almost to the very doors of the people , by the extension of university instruction , and by other agencies tending to implant a thirst for book-knowledge .

		Nevertheless the reported instances of a decrease in the circulation of public library books are becoming rather frequent , and one wishes to know the reason why .

		The
James V. Brown	PERSON	Library of
Williamsport	LOCATION	,
Pa.	LOCATION	, is among the latest to announce a marked and rather puzzling falling-off in the home use of its books .

		The libra - rian , in his current Report , gives a considerable number of what he regards as contributory causes , such as the increasing vogue of all sorts of pastimes , the multiplication of societies and clubs of many kinds , the spread of nature-study , the enlistment of the young in the army of Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls , and the demands made on the time of those who , especially in the
summer	DATE	season , feel it their duty as well as their pleasure to attend out-door con - tests of various sorts and to give a vociferous moral support to the side they wish to see victorious .

		These numerous distractions may well operate in the manner indicated by the
Williamsport	LOCATION	librarian .

		Two other possible factors in the situation may here be brought to notice for what they are worth .

		The improved facilities for reading and study within the library itself , with its well-equipped reference rooms and expert attendants , invite the visitor to pursue his researches and even to read his favorite novelist within the library precincts instead of carry - ing the books home and back .

		Secondly , though this may have but little effect on the final result , the re - vival of the long-winded novel has made it impossible for the fiction-lover to read as many current novels as twenty years ago , when the pocket size of romance was in favor .

		The 625 pages , in rather close print , of `` The Amateur Gentleman '' would make three novels of the size of `` The House of the Wolf , '' or six of the dimensions of ``
Mademoiselle Ixe	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Mr.
De Morgan	PERSON	, Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, Mr.
Henry Sydnor Harrison	PERSON	, and many others of their guild , are now giving us in their books good measure , pressed down and shaken together and run - ning over ; and as fiction figures more largely in a public library 's circulation than any other class of literature , the ponderous bulk of the novel of the day may be a not wholly negligible factor in bring - ing about a diminution in the number of books drawn for home use .

		LITERARY CRITICISM THAT STIMULATES is the kind that seems to have been dealt out to Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	, who , in a recent interview , is reported as saying in regard to the relation between author and critic : '' The total result of this relation may be broken into many partial results .

		One is that the sympathies of the body of critics pass by way of the books over to the great body of creative workers .

		This is the first and chief value of such criticism that it puts new life into the authors .

		This result is direct and positive and of incalculable value to the body of workers . ''

		To have one 's book reviewed by one hundred and fifty critics , working independently , and to find , as Mr.
Allen	PERSON	has often found , one hun - dred and forty of them in substantial agreement , he declares to be an amazing experience , `` as amazing as would be the verdict in an imaginary case at law in which one hundred and fifty jurors should sift the evidence , each in solitary confinement , and then march back to the court-room to give a verdict of acquittal or the reverse .

		Such a result as this could not possibly be reached unless these one hundred and fifty human minds were working sincerely and intelligently .

		The knowledge that they do so work makes the author one in humanity with these work - ers , not one of whom he will possibly ever meet .

		There is no measure of how vital such an experience is .

		Simply by it we acquire faith in human nature .

		And the more faith an author has in human nature , the better his work will be .

		The less faith he has , the worse his work will be .

		All real literature is faith in human nature . ''

		Between this pleasing pic - ture of a sympathetic bond uniting author and critic , and the vision of a Keats done to death by a Quar - terly Reviewer -LRB- though , fortunately , that famous legend has no historical basis -RRB- , what a contrast !

		MILTON 'S TESTIMONY IN THE SHAKESPEARE -
BACON	PERSON	CONTROVERSY ought to be of weight , for his life and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's overlapped each other by eight years , and the author of '' Paradise Lost '' was eighteen years old when
Bacon	PERSON	died .

		Therefore we 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	follow with interest Sir
Edwin Burning-Lawrence	PERSON	's argument to prove that
Milton	PERSON	was a Baconian .

		The proof is simple and unanswerable .

		In the great poet 's tribute to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, beginning , `` What neede my Shakespeare for his honour 'd bones , '' Sir
Edwin	PERSON	favors in the fourth line the less common reading , '' starre-ypointed , '' instead of '' starre - ypointing , '' and `` a starre-ypointed Pyramid '' is obviously a beacon ; and if the word beacon was not pronounced bacon in
Milton	LOCATION	's time , it surely ought to have been , to make perfect this beautiful proof that
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	wrote
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Sir
Edwin	PERSON	is to be congratulated on having discovered this convincing bit of evidence in the great question .

		But we have recently hit upon an even more remarkable , because more adroitly concealed , expression of opinion on the burning issue .

		Coming down two centuries from
Milton	LOCATION	to
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, we find in the latter 's sonnet on Shakespeare irrefutable proof that this distinguished poet of the nineteenth century dis - cerned , even though he did not venture openly to proclaim , the real authorship of the works attributed to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the last line of the sonnet note the poet 's subtlety in choosing the very last line as a hiding place for his cryptogram we find the name of Bacon very cleverly concealed ; and no small part of the cleverness lies in the fact that there is just enough method in the scheme to show design , and just enough irregularity to suggest mere chance .

		But no accidental juxtaposition of words and letters can account for what we will now disclose .

		The last line reads , '' Find their sole speech in that victorious brow . ''

		Now note that the very last word begins with b , the third word from the end contains the vowel a , the fifth from the end has the letter c , the third from the beginning has the vowel 0 , and the first word has the consonant n .

		There we have the name
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	complete .

		If anyone objects that in all this there is nothing but chance , and not the faintest trace of design , we would ask whether any tossing about of the words of the dictionary for a million ages would ever be likely to result in just the combination of words the poet has here written in his closing line .

		We trow not .

		* THE OUTRAGED ORTHOEPIST gives public expres - sion to his feelings from time to time in magazine or newspaper articles urging a reform in our habits of speech , a less clipped and slurred pronunciation of our words .

		Americans are notorious , the world over , for their faulty articulation ; and this unwise economy of vocal energy has not only disfigured our language to the ear , but has also given aid and comfort to the so-called reformers of our spelling .

		If the word programme , for instance , is repeatedly heard as program -LRB- or progrum -RRB- , with strong accent on the first syllable and almost no vowel sound in the second , why , it is asked , should it not be written as it is pronounced ?

		No wonder that our country takes the lead in '' spelling reform , '' having already so effectually divorced the spoken from the written language .

		Strange and startling are the tricks that mispronunciation plays with spelling .

		Lamentably common is it to meet with the expression `` would of '' for '' would have '' in the correspondence of the careless in speech .

		The now all but universal use of will for shall and of would for should is prob - ably due largely to the greater ease of saying '' I will , '' or `` I 'll , '' `` we will , '' or `` we 'll , '' `` I would , '' or '' I 'd , '' '' we would , '' or '' we 'd , '' than of articu - lating '' I shall , '' '' I should , '' etc. .

		Thus the evil results of slovenly utterance show themselves in grammar as well as in spelling , and the stately structure of our ancestral tongue is slowly but surely yielding to the insidious assaults of carelessness , abuse , indolence , mistaken zeal in efforts at reform , and other influences .

		Will a better and more ser - viceable instrument of communication be evolved in the distant future , through this process , or will the language , by clipping and slurring , be reduced to a system of monosyllabic grunts , helped out by gesture and facial expression ?

		Certain present indications seem almost to warrant the assertion that our speech is passing , as
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	might express it , from a relatively definite , coherent heterogeneity to a relatively indefinite , incoherent homogeneity .

		INADEQUATE SECURITY TO MANUSCRIPT COLLEC - TIONS , as indeed to collections in general , both of books and of paintings and of the miscellaneous treasures gathered together in museums , is far more common than the perfect safeguarding of such col - lections from the risks of fire and other dangers .

		The
Virginia State Librarian	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
H. R. Mcllwaine	PERSON	, calls attention , in the '' Ninth Annual Report '' of the
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	, to an unsatisfactory con - dition that he almost succeeded in remedying , but failed by a single vote in the upper legislative cham - ber at
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		Responsible for the custody of a valuable collection of manuscripts , Mr.
Mcllwaine	PERSON	bestirred himself to secure an appropriation for fire - proof quarters .

		His own account of his fortunes in the attempt is worth quoting .

		He says : '' I regret to report , however , that failure was my portion , though representatives of all the patriotic societies in the
State	ORGANIZATION	worked for the attainment of the same object .

		A special bill was drawn up by a committee of the Sons of the Revolution calling for the appro - priation of
$ 6000	MONEY	for this object , and when the advocates of the bill were given a hearing by the
Senate Finance Committee	ORGANIZATION	a large and cultivated audience of ladies and gentlemen assembled and strong appeals were made .

		The bill , however , was not reported .

		Nor was the item included in the appropriation bill as reported to the two houses .

		In this emergency I was instructed by the executive committee of the
Library Board	ORGANIZATION	to use my best en - deavors to have the item inserted in the bill both on the floor of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and on the floor of the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the
House	ORGANIZATION	my efforts met with success , and they came within one vote of being successful in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, where the proposed amendment to the bill received a vote of twenty .

		Twenty was a majority of those present , but not a majority of the
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 135 total membership of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, which , it was ruled by the chair , the amendment must have in order to carry . ''

		And so the Sisyphean task must be renewed with the next
General Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fire at
Albany	LOCATION	should have taught a lesson to all concerned with
State	ORGANIZATION	libraries , but there is still a tendency to defer the locking of the garage door till the automobile is stolen .

		m t , PRELIMINARIES TO LITERARY STUDY , the mas - tering of one 's own language and of the rudiments of at least a few foreign tongues , should of course receive attention in the adolescent period , even though one may , like Cato and Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	, take a fancy to Greek at a later season in life and pursue its study with relish and profit .

		The President of
Amherst	LOCATION	, in a recent utterance on the subject of preparation for college , urges that all merely dis - ciplinary studies should be completed at school . ''

		Whatever acquaintance , '' he says , '' with other languages a student may need in college should be given him during those earlier years when the mind is better adapted to acquiring them .

		The college should be free to lead the student into the thought and experience of foreign peoples by means of the languages in which the people have expressed them - selves .

		In general , the merely disciplinary studies should be finished in the school .

		Admission to col - lege should imply that the student already has a mind trained to the intellectual attitude , and which is now to be strengthened , enlarged , and made skil - ful by activity within the fields for which it was prepared . ''

		In this connection it is interesting to note how much longer the period of docility , of teachableness or ability to learn , extends with some persons than with others .

		Some harden early into a mental rigidity that forbids the attempt to acquire new knowledge , and others are to their dying day like
Portia	PERSON	in her youth , happy in this that they are not yet so old but they may learn .

		Wise and excellent as are the foregoing words of President
Meiklejohn	PERSON	, those are fortunate who never outgrow their capability of finding enjoyment and improve - ment even in disciplinary study , by which are opened new paths of learning .

		BOOK-BUYING AND BOOK-BORROWING are both commendable practices , even though the grave Polonius does counsel his son Laertes to be neither a borrower nor a lender ; but that was in the days before lending libraries .

		Some well-considered ad - vice on what books to buy and what to borrow , in this age when so small a proportion of all the good books published can be bought by any one reader of average means , is contributed to the
London	LOCATION	`` Book Monthly '' by a writer signing himself or herself '' D. Mere , '' who names as examples certain old authors and sundry anthologies and other handy compilations that pay handsomely for their lodging and maintenance by the pleasure they confer .

		But the free use of the lending library , whether public or subscription , is urged upon him who would be wise in both his buying and his borrowing of books .

		Emerson 's adage , that a good book should be kept in circulation , certainly gives countenance to the unabashed borrower of others ' books ; and if it is not yet a proverb that the fool keepeth his books on his shelves , but the wise man carryeth them in his head , it ought to be and some day will be .

		Conscious of having all the standard authors in his library , accessible at any moment , many a well-to - do householder never gets beyond a distant acquaint - ance with the great writers , knowing them merely by sight , that is by binding , whereas if he were forced to go a few blocks for his Macaulay , his
Ruskin	PERSON	, or his
Thackeray	PERSON	, he might be impelled to read them .

		And with some , though not with all , it is a matter of conscience to read promptly a borrowed book , and then return it .

		A strong case could be made out for the inadvisability of owning too many books , and the consequent advisability of frequent and copious borrowing .

		No sensible man of means keeps all his money in his house , but most of it in the bank .

		The public library is the wise man 's literary bank .

		UNIVERSITY ACTIVITIES IN
TEXAS	LOCATION	deserve notice .

		A legislative reference bureau , that useful wing lately added to the public library edifice , has been established by one of the professors at the
State University	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- which , it will be recalled , has its seat at the
State	ORGANIZATION	capital -RRB- for the benefit of the
Texas	LOCATION	legis - lators in their drafting of bills and passing of laws .

		This bureau is an innovation in the
Southwest	LOCATION	, though not new to the country at large , and can not fail to prove its usefulness .

		Another professor has given his expert assistance to the organization of a land-credit banking association , another innovation in that part of the country and possibly of less as - sured success than the legislative reference bureau , although we are not in a position to speak with authority concerning this .

		In various other ways the young and vigorous
Texas University	ORGANIZATION	is widen - ing its activities , and is meeting with corresponding encouragement from the community which it serves .

		So rapid , in fact , has been its recent growth that it has been compelled to erect temporary wooden buildings for additional classrooms , laboratories , and offices .

		To secure the permanent buildings so much needed , a legislative provision recently submitted to popular vote authorizes the university to issue bonds on the security of its permanent endowment , the interest and sinking fund to be provided for out of the income from the two million acres of public land which it holds .

		The
Lone Star State	ORGANIZATION	bids fair to rival in the near future such States as
Wisconsin	LOCATION	,
Michigan	LOCATION	,
Minnesota	LOCATION	, and
Illinois	LOCATION	in the size and varied usefulness of its chief educational institution .

Sept. 1	DATE	now in its fifty-eighth volume and approaching its three thousandth issue ; and as civilization is a changeable thing , it is fitting that this , its hebdom - adal exponent , should change with it .

		Its new form , with reduced page-size and altered style of illustration , its various other proposed departures from ancient usage , its enlightened attitude on the woman question , its hopes for success in an earnest appeal to the better class of readers most of this is touched upon by the editor in his printed `` Program '' and elsewhere in the attractive first issue under his direction .

		In matters more especially literary he thus promisingly expresses himself : `` In the treat - ment of books the same plan will be followed .

		We shall make no effort at reviewing everything , or nearly everything , as we do not care to load the paper with discussions of what has no interest ; but we shall be sharply on the watch for books that signify , and shall point out to our readers why we think these particular books ought not to be over - looked ... Fiction will appear only as an element in the variety of human interests .

		We do not wish to push it too much to the front , because we desire to have the paper in its proportions reproduce the interests of the most energetic and important class of Americans ... We are not to be a high-brow publication , in the limited sense , but we do not intend to collect a lot of low-brows . ''

		The general effect of the new `` Weekly '' is one of animation , alertness , straightforwardness , searching analysis in criticism and comment , novelty in pictorial illustration , and , throughout , a high degree of readability .

		THEMES FORBIDDEN THE BRITISH STAGE have commonly included biblical subjects and those otherwise of a sacred or religious character , and , of course , the royal family .

		Nevertheless it ap - pears that Sir
Herbert Beerbohm	PERSON	Tree is now to be allowed to place
Joseph	PERSON	and his brethren in the glare of the footlights .

		A compatriot of his who has suffered from the strictness of official censorship is reported as exulting in this unhoped-for victory of the drama over the censor .

		`` This is a clever mana - gerial coup d'etat , '' declares Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, `` and he has now once and for all ` drawn the bad - ger , ' which can never again retreat into its hole .

		Henceforward , unless the Censorship should prove itself even more illogical than in the past , the great field of Old Testament history lies open to the poet , a field not less fertile than the Greek . ''

		This recalls Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	's clash with the constituted authorities when he undertook to dramatise the story of
Jephthah	ORGANIZATION	's daughter and was forced to shift his scene to
Greece	LOCATION	and name his heroine Icle ; and although the Hebrew legend has its close parallels in Greek as in the story of Idomeneus , king of
Crete	LOCATION	, and in that of Agamemnon and
Iphigenia	LOCATION	he lamented the hard necessity imposed upon him .

		Jephthah , however , is no stranger to the stage , and must have been often seen by theatre - goers in the past .

		Brewer 's '' Reader 's Handbook '' gives a number of English plays on the theme .

		THE INCOHERENT LETTER - WRITER is known to us all .

		His , or more often her , serene disregard of syntax , and sometimes of grammar as well , together with a restraint in the use of punctuation - marks that verges on total abstinence , would be amusing if it were not for the resultant unintelli - gibility of what is written .

		In a contribution to `` The Outlook '' from Mr.
Edward Bok	PERSON	, on the question , '' Is the College Making Good ? ''

		there are given some surprising examples of epistolary com - position from the pens of young ladies on the point of graduation from college , with fifteen or sixteen years of school training behind them .

		To the question , what the college has done for her , physi - cally , socially , and intellectually , one of these near - graduates replies , in part : `` For in college we have societies and houses to keep in order .

		We have dinners and parties to superintend and cook and all for fun . ''

		Is there some subtle design in the chiastic arrangement , '' dinner and parties to super - intend and cook '' ?

		Another young lady writes : `` She uses her brain in other words .

		And finally I think most of them have won a vision at least of what marraige may mean .

		College brings out the best that is in one , it makes us stand up for the best and noblest things in life and developes all our faculties . ''

		Such examples of what American edu - cation can do for the American young woman give us pause .

		A FAMOUS AUTHOR 'S NURSE becomes an object of public interest when she has been immortalized by that author 's pen .

		Miss
Alison Cunningham	PERSON	, who recently died at the good old age of ninety-two , was noted for her inexhaustible fund of tales and legends , which she drew upon freely for the amuse - ment of her frail little charge , the infant
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	; and he repaid her loving care and patient tendance with a lifelong affection and esteem .

		To him she was always the `` Gummy '' of his lisping childhood , and he has left written evi - dence of his attachment in both prose and verse .

		A letter addressed to her in his youth contains the following significant passage : `` Do not suppose , Cummy , that I shall ever forget those long , bitter nights , when I coughed and coughed , and was so unhappy , and you were so patient and loving with a poor , sick child .

		Indeed ,
Cummy	LOCATION	, I wish I might become a man worth talking about , if it were only that you should not have thrown away your pains . ''

		Touching and beautiful are the dedi - catory lines , `` To
Alison Cunningham	PERSON	, from her Boy , '' prefixed to `` A Child 's Garden of Verses . ''

		THE GROWTH OF THE INTER-LIBRARY LOAN SYS - TEM proceeds with encouraging acceleration .

		At the
Williams College Library	ORGANIZATION	, for instance , where we remember an order of things in which coopera - tive action extending beyond the college precincts was unknown , the literary resources of other insti - tutions are now freely drawn upon , and similar loans are made to them .

		The librarian , Mr.
John 1913	PERSON	-RSB- THE DIAL 137
Adams Lowe	PERSON	, writes in his annual report , just issued : `` The courtesy of inter-library loans brought for the use of professors twenty-seven books from
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Recently the resources of the
New York State Library	ORGANIZATION	have been re-opened to us , for two hundred thousand volumes have been gathered since the
fire two years ago	DATE	.

		We have taken pleasure in response to requests from libraries to loan sixty-seven volumes for study purposes .

		We deem it a privilege if we may render some service to the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	by extending the courtesies of the library to those whose limited funds prohibit the purchase of books already on our shelves .

		Probably the most important contribution we were able to make in this line this year was the loan of the manuscript letters of
Jean Paul Richter	PERSON	to
Wilhelmine von Kropf to Yale University Library	ORGANIZATION	for the use of the German exchange professor , who is a co-editor of a new edition of
Richter	ORGANIZATION	's works . ''

		LITERARY INCOMES IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		About once a year one of the
London	LOCATION	papers opens its columns to the fascinating subject of authors ' incomes .

		Usually this takes place on the publication of a novel by Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	or Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	the two writers who are commonly regarded as the commercial heads of the great profession which they have adorned so long .

		Indeed , it is not a little remarkable to note how regularly each new book of theirs is the signal for a column or more of information as to the habits , rec - reations , sorrows , or profits of a class that is permitted to work unobtrusively enough during the rest of the year .

		The publication of a new novel by Mr.
Caine	PERSON	or
Miss Corelli	PERSON	is , of course , a Literary Event , likely in itself to stimulate discussion on literary subjects in general .

		But it commonly happens , by some curious chance , that some untoward accident takes place , either just before or immediately after its appearance , which has the effect of focussing public attention on the author .

		Miss
Corelli	ORGANIZATION	has a quarrel with the critics , and refuses to permit copies of her book to be sent out for review ; Mr.
Caine	PERSON	is justifiably annoyed at finding the circulating libraries have placed a black mark against his name as a purveyor of literature unsuitable for the eye of the
Young Person	ORGANIZATION	.

		Forthwith appear letters , interviews , leading articles on one side and the other ; when the novel is at last safely launched the struggling journalist , feeling that literary subjects are still in the air , bethinks himself of floating off one or two of those informative articles that have been lying idle in his desk since the last suitable occasion . ''

		Lit - erature as a Road to Wealth '' appears accordingly in one of the cheaper morning papers , offering a text on which it may be interesting to say a few words out of the fulness of personal experience .

		It is calculated by the writer of the article that a moderately successful novelist in this country can make money at the rate of ten pounds an hour of his working time .

		A man of established reputation receives twenty to twenty-five per cent royalty on the published price of his book ; a sale of ten thousand copies would therefore bring in to the fortunate author of a six shilling novel the reasonable sum of seven hundred and fifty pounds .

		Add to this another five hundred for serial rights , and assume that the ordinary successful novel has a selling life of ten years after publication , and the sum is worked up to quite a respectable figure .

		And then there are the dramatic rights , and -LRB- though they are not mentioned in this article -RRB- the cinematographic rights , to say nothing of translation .

		I forget into how many languages Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's latest work has already been translated , but I think I counted fourteen , including Japanese and Yiddish .

		We come at last to the conclusion that Miss Corelli must have made twenty thousand pounds at least from each of her novels , and that Mr.
Caine	PERSON	has certainly made much more than this .

		Clearly , from the commercial point of view , the career of a successful novelist , even if he restricts himself to the production of only one book a year , compares favorably with most of the learned professions .

		I do not trust implicitly the calculations of the intrepid journalist on matters of this kind .

		But he is probably correct enough when he states that there are barely ten novelists in this country who earn more than five thou - sand pounds a year from fiction alone .

		The names that he gives -LRB- somewhat rashly , for it is quite as easy to con - fine oneself to general statements -RRB- of these happy pluto - crats of letters are as follows :
Caine	PERSON	,
Wells	ORGANIZATION	,
Garvice	PERSON	,
Stacpoole	LOCATION	,
Conan Doyle	PERSON	,
Kipling	LOCATION	,
Miss Corelli	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		I confess the introduction of Mr.
de Vere Stacpoole	PERSON	's name surprised me .

		No doubt it is a compliment to be included in a list of this kind , but I am expecting some of these gentlemen to write letters of protest and renunciation : the honor may be all very well , but the attentions of the Income Tax Assessors are not so pleasant .

		And an average income of twenty-five thousand dollars a year , from fiction alone , means a large number of readers in these days of circulating libraries , when there are a dozen or more borrowing readers for a single buyer .

		The late
George Meredith	PERSON	, I believe , never received so much as a thousand pounds in any one year of his lifetime from the sale of his novels .

		He wrote for posterity ; but many of those who aim stead - fastly at an immediate popularity fail to reach his modest figures .

		The writer in the
London	LOCATION	'' Daily Express '' from whose article I am quoting declares roundly that not more than fifty living British novelists make an average income of five thousand dollars .

		The fact is , that of late years every change that has been made in the world of publishing and bookselling has been in favor of the few big sellers and against the author with a small , if select , audience .

		The cheap six - penny and sevenpenny editions of recent novels are all to the good of the popular writer : they give his book another lease of life , and himself another set of royal - ties ; more than this , they assist in spreading his name and fame among a class of readers whom he had not reached before .

		But these cheap novels , excellently produced as they are , and eagerly welcomed by the rail - way traveller and the lover of fiction who can not afford to buy crown octavo volumes at six shillings apiece , get sadly in the way of the less successful novelist who is accustomed to receive his fifty or a hundred pounds in advance of royalties .

		The latter finds the sales of his six shilling novels dwindling year by year .

		Five or six years ago he used to sell something between two and three thousand copies ; now he finds his sales have decreased to fifteen or sixteen hundred .

		He does not retire from the business , because , perhaps , he is one of those who write from the point of view of the artist .

		He feels an impulse to express himself through this 138 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	medium .

		And if he is a true artist , as sometimes he is , there is probably somewhere a certain little ring of read - ers who appreciate his work and would be sorry to lose him .

		But it is becoming a serious matter to him , this steady cheapening of fiction .

		I have often wondered how some of our great novelists would have survived had they been born in the age of reprints .

		Meredith himself was fortunate enough to produce most of his fiction under the old system of the three-volume novel , a system that ensured some monetary return for good though not necessarily popular work .

		If a new Meredith were to arise to-day it is not unlikely that the publishers would get tired of producing his books at a loss before he had succeeded in educating a sufficient section of the reading public into a suitable appreciation of his genius .

		Several causes have conspired of late to chill the enthusiasm of those gallant readers who used to lay out their money in new fiction at six shillings -LRB- four shillings and sixpence net -RRB- per volume .

		He -LRB- or she , for the great novel-readers have generally been the women -RRB- used to buy them on the bookstalls when they were setting out on a railway journey ; they sometimes were known to go into a book-shop and order as many as a score at a time if they were going abroad or up to
Scot	PERSON	- land for the shooting season .

		Now , instead of travelling by rail , they are whirled away in their motor-cars , where reading is a vexation of the spirit if not a frank impos - sibility .

		Indeed , these motor-cars , and the growth of the week-end habit , have pretty nearly killed the gentle practice of novel-reading among the wealthier classes .

		The bulk of readers now are drawn from a different stratum of society altogether from the finished prod - ucts of the primary schools .

		Coming fresh into the field of fiction , it is only to be expected that their taste should at first be for the simple and straightforward story of incident and adventure rather than for the more subtle school of character-analysis .

		The servants ' hall and the parlor of the small tradesman absorb the great majority of the cheap sixpenny editions that go to build up these incomes of five thousand a year .

		Possibly in time their taste will develop : they may turn to the novels of Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	or of Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	.

		It seems to me sometimes that in the wealthier classes of our society there is less reading of any kind every year .

		There are , of course , other fields of literary activity than this of fiction .

		One of the most popular forms of recent years has been the semi-historical monograph , in which the writer takes some personage of importance in literary or other circles fifty or a hundred years ago , and rewrites the story of his life , paying generally par - ticular attention to those more human elements in his character which the old-fashioned official biographer was content to leave in the background .

		Some writers , as , for example , Mr.
Francis Gribble	PERSON	, have established a reputation for work of this kind : their happy hunting - ground lies among the love affairs of the not too dis - tant past ; they range from the shadowy -LRB- and shady -RRB- history of
Catherine	PERSON	of
Russia	LOCATION	to that of the late Lord Byron .

		Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	himself is perhaps the chief of his industrious tribe ; he possesses a pleasing and caustic wit , and can conduct a post mortem on a desiccated heart as well as any man alive .

		I do not know that I have much personal predilection for books of this type , occupying as they do a position midway between historical documents and the chronique scandaleuse .

		But from the commercial point of view they do well .

		Hand - somely printed and adorned with a few photogravures from old pictures , they are sold to the libraries at fifteen shillings or a guinea net , and the more successful speci - mens bring in as much as three hundred pounds apiece to their fortunate authors .

		It is a sort of work that demands a certain amount of research : the writer must know the most likely quarries for his material .

		More serious biographies , even in recent years , when good biographies have not been too common , have still produced respectable rates of pay .

		Lord
Morley	PERSON	is said to have received ten thousand pounds for his
Life of Gladstone	ORGANIZATION	; Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	, our present
First Lord of the Admiralty	ORGANIZATION	, had eight thousand and a share of the publishers ' profits for the biography of his father , the late
Lord Randolph Churchill	ORGANIZATION	.

		These prices compare not unfavorably with the cheque for 20,000 which Lord Macaulay received for his History of
England	LOCATION	, a sum of money which marked an epoch in the history of literature .

		The Minor Poet has always been the Cinderella of the literary family .

		But now and again , at intervals of ten or twenty years , there seems to sweep over the country a wave of poetic feeling : thin volumes of verse , tastefully printed , begin to appear and what is far more remarkable to be bought ; while the critics take on an unwonted vein of appreciation and gravely discuss the prospect of some of these young men reaching their -LRB- poetic -RRB- majority .

		There are actually one or two poets at the present moment who have attained to a certain sale .

		Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	is one , Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	another ; these stand out from a goodly host of smaller fry .

		And we possess in
England	LOCATION	to-day an unusually large number of capable writers of light verse , of whom Mr.
Owen Seaman	PERSON	, editor of `` Punch , '' may be regarded as the chief .

		These merry jesters find a more ready market for their wares than their more serious brethren .

		Indeed , we live in an age which takes nothing more seri - ously than it can help .

		Great poets have seldom an acute sense of humor .

		If they had , it is probable that they would not write great poetry : they would be tempted to turn round occasionally and laugh at them - selves and their rivals , a practice that makes the reading public nervous and distrustful .

		The man with a reputation as a comedian needs not to consider his dignity : he laughs at everything , and the daily papers accept his jests with gratitude and at a reasonable rate of pay .

		I see it stated in the article from which I quoted above that really happy light verse is paid for at the rate of a shilling a word .

		I think the writer must have meant a shilling a line , but perhaps he had in mind some veritable lion of the profession .

		Sixpence a line is the ordinary rate for good light verse in most of our papers at the present time .

		It may not sound very much , but it forms a very useful addition to the incomes of young and struggling apprentices to literature who have not yet reached the Olympian heights of the big

		KATHARINE TYNAN -LRB- Mrs.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 139 A VICTORIAN STATESMAN AND REFORMER .

		* The great orator and statesman , parliamenta - rian and reformer , humanitarian and free-trader , whose life Mr.
George Macaulay Trevelyan	PERSON	pre - sents in an ample volume of attractive appear - ance , is one of those characters that appeal unfailingly to the human nature in us all , and that we can not read about or hear about too often .

		Sentences and phrases from
John Bright	PERSON	's many public speeches have obtained currency by reason of their homely wisdom and epigrammatic force . ''

		A free breakfast table '' is as familiar to advocates of unrestricted trade between nations as is '' the full dinner-pail '' to those who profess to believe that the working man 's welfare depends on a protective tariff . ''

		You can not get twenty wagons at once through Temple Bar , '' is remembered as the apophtheg - matic utterance of the member for
Birmingham	LOCATION	in withdrawing one bill in order to facilitate the passage of another .

		`` Force is not a remedy , '' he declared with reference to certain disturb - ances in
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		A glance at the list of previous Bright biog - raphies shows that there is abundant room for such a work as Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	's .

		The great work of Mr.
George Barnett Smith	PERSON	, '' The Life and Speeches of the Right Honourable
John Bright	PERSON	,
M.P.	LOCATION	, '' in two substantial volumes , was issued eight years before Bright 's death and confines itself almost entirely to the political and historical aspects of its subject , with but the briefest reference to the private life and personal characteristics of the picturesquely interesting
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	manufacturer and orator .

		Other and more recent biographies are but short monographs or designedly inexhaustive treatments of the theme , and the ample collec - tions of Bright 's formal speeches and public letters that have been issued do not go far toward supplying the need of a full and intimate biography .

		The present endeavor in that direc - tion does indeed result in the portrayal of a man who seems always to have been before the public and to have spent the best of himself in parlia - mentary activity , rather than of one with a rich and significant personal history that the reader would fain become acquainted with ; but we do get more of the man

		*
THK	ORGANIZATION	LIFE OF JOHN BRIGHT .

		By
George Macaulay Trevelyan	PERSON	.

		Dlustrated .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The biographer 's warm interest in his theme and the facilities afforded him for its adequate treat - ment are indicated in these opening sentences of his preface : '' The pleasure of writing a biography id dependent on three things : the sympathy of the biographer for his subject ; the interest of the new material which he has to handle ; and his relations to those who have honoured him by trusting to him the memory they revere .

		In all three respects I have been most fortunate , and wish to express my gratitude to the family and relations of
John Bright	PERSON	, who have smoothed the path for me by forbearance , by encouragement , and by much active help . ''

		Entering his father 's business of cotton - spinning , at
Rochdale	ORGANIZATION	in
Lancashire	LOCATION	, when he was fifteen years old and had had seven or eight years of schooling in various educational estab - lishments of the Friends ,
John Bright	PERSON	continued the training of his mind by reading history and poetry , and by studying and debating the poli - tical questions of the day .

		A room in the upper story of his father 's counting-house , as he has recorded , he fitted up as a study , and there he `` often read a good deal before breakfast and was undisturbed . ''

		No strict conformity to
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	rules was insisted upon in the family , and in the outside world the young man showed a pliancy and adaptability , in externals and non-essentials , that facilitated his rise to promi - nence in public life .

		In his thirty-fourth year we find him dropping the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	forms in his correspondence , except with Friends .

		Of his environment and his interests in early manhood we read : '' Throughout the ` thirties the absorbing passion of these brothers and sisters was neither religion nor busi - ness , still less the forbidden dances and pleasures of the world , but politics .

		Preoccupation with affairs of
State	ORGANIZATION	was then very uncommon among Friends ; many were studiously neutral , many patiently Conservative , and many , like old
Jacob Bright	PERSON	, were strong but quiet Liberals , neither speculative nor active in such matters .

		Ever since the death of
Penn	LOCATION	, the sect had avoided politics as being more beset with worldly snares for the children of light than the common business transactions in which so many of them managed to thrive without endangering their principles .

		Such seclusion from public life had been natural in former times , when power was monopolised by the landlord class and by the adherents of the
State Church	ORGANIZATION	, but in the new and more liberal age now dawning , a closer relation to politics was to be expected in people so actively philanthropic as the Quakers .

		... As the years went on , and drew
John Bright	PERSON	deeper and deeper into a merely political life , these worldly entanglements evoked , as we shall see , much criticism from the older and more religious mem - bers of his society , including some who loved him best .

		But prior to his marriage in
1839	DATE	his interest in politics met with no such discouragement , for the family of which he was already the real leader was self-sufficing and saw relatively little of other Friends .

		The Meeting 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	at
Rochdale	LOCATION	was neither large nor remarkable , and the Brights of
Greenbank	ORGANIZATION	were a law unto themselves . ''

		Thus , with his increasing absorption in public affairs , the significance of
John Bright	PERSON	's life , as his biographer observes , '' derives from ' the condition of
England	LOCATION	question , ' as
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	in
1840	DATE	dolefully called it , and in particular from those parts of the question with which Bright concerned himself as an agitator the landlord power , the Corn Laws , and the franchise . ''

		Although Bright 's name and that of his famous co-worker and close friend ,
Richard Cobden	PERSON	, are deservedly associated with the anti-Corn Law agitation that eventually gave untaxed wheat and other cereals to the starving poor whose cause the two men had so warmly espoused , neither of them was , as a matter of fact , among the original founders of the
Anti-Corn Law Association	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- organized at Manchester in
1838	DATE	-RRB- which soon changed its name and became famous as the
National Anti-Corn Law League	ORGANIZATION	.

		But Bright 's name was in a short time added to the ''
Provisional Committee	ORGANIZATION	'' actually a few days before
Cobden	PERSON	's , Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	says .


Jacob Bright	PERSON	,
John	PERSON	's father , pledged himself for fifty pounds on the first of those noted subscription lists that were to play so prominent a part in overthrowing the landed oligarchy ; and the son started a
Rochdale Anti-Corn Law Association	ORGANIZATION	, chiefly of working men , and could boast of a petition '' for a total , immediate repeal of the accursed corn-laws , '' with nine thousand seven hundred signatures , or those of '' almost every male adult of the town . ''

		Such were the begin - nings of the movement that seven years later resulted so fortunately for the nation 's subse - quent prosperity .

		About this time came the romance of the young reformer 's life , his courtship of
Eliza	PERSON	- beth
Priestman	PERSON	, described by Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	as of lively and open disposition , almost worshipped by the members of her family , and possessed of qualities that would have insured her playing an important part in her husband 's life if she had lived .

		But she left
John Bright	PERSON	a heart - broken widower less than two years after their wedding day .

		His second marriage ,
six years later	DATE	, to
Margaret Elizabeth Leatham	PERSON	, who `` had inherited from her father a considerable portion , '' which , '' at a time when the
Rochdale	ORGANIZATION	business was a very lean affair , was a valuable help to her husband , '' does not picture itself in the roseate tints of the first love affair .

		But the well-portioned wife presented her husband , first and last , with seven pledges of her affection , and is said to have taken '' a constant and sym - pathetic interest '' in his work .

		She died in
1878	DATE	, eleven years before Bright breathed his last at the age of seventy-seven .

		One daughter by the first wife should be named in giving the number of his children .

		Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	's famous kinsman ,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	, appears on the scene more than once , and not always in the most becoming of attitudes .

		For instance , after the Whig statesman had '' in - censed the Leaguers because , while declaring himself a Free Trader , he urged the League to join hands with the Whigs on the fixed duty compromise , which he himself regarded , not as the best , but as the best that would be practi - cable for years to come , '' we find Bright writing to a friend : '' Doubtless the Whigs hate us nobody denies it and yet what can be done that is not done ?

		Most of their hatred is laid to the charge of the
Leaguers of Edinbro	ORGANIZATION	' because they bothered
Craig	PERSON	and
Macaulay	PERSON	, and yet I can see no wrong you did to goad on the shufflers .

		Macaulay came into the
House	ORGANIZATION	the night of the Corn Law debate and laid -LSB- sic -RSB- down on a bench up in the gallery not far from the entrance into the Library and slept or appeared to sleep there I believe for hours the front Whig bench was wholly unoccupied during the whole night , and the whole question was treated by the Whigs and by
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	among the rest with the utmost contempt and doubtless his vote was only secured by your compulsion . ''

		Bright 's position in regard to legal restric - tion of the hours of labor is made plain by his biographer , who insists that the great reformer never opposed the passing of laws to protect child workers from the cruelties of unfeeling task-masters , though in general he deprecated legislative interference between contracting parties , and `` looked instead for an improve - ment of hours and conditions by agreement be - tween the employers on one side and adults of both sexes on the other . ''

		This confidence in the kindliness and fairness of employers and in the bargaining ability of the employed was characteristic of a benevolent manufacturer so wholly free from evil intent himself .

		With a parting glimpse of
John Bright	PERSON	in his home and among his friends we will here take leave of him . ''

		The life and conversation of which he was the centre at home or in the larger world was always simple in greatness , and truth was its keynote .

		He eschewed the small conventional falsehoods of which the rest of us are often guilty .

		He never strove to seem more friendly or more clever or better informed than he really was .

		If he did not know something , he would ask , without an attempt to hide his ignorance .

		If he did not like his interlocutor , the fact was usually apparent ... The interest of his conversation , apart from the terse vigour of his language , his humour , and his good stories , arose from the fact that he never said more and seldom less
1913	DATE	-RSB- 141 than the whole of what he thought about any subject or any person . ''

		The Oxford philosopher ,
T. H. Green	PERSON	, has called him `` a great ` brick , ' '' and `` simple as a boy , full of fun , with a very pleasant flow of conver - sation and lots of good stories . ''


Caroline Fox	PERSON	, in her `` Journals '' speaks admiringly of his varied conversation and unreserved manner ; `` and then there is such downright manliness in the whole nature of the man , which is refreshing in this rather feeble age . ''

		These and other testimonials to the charm of his personality are to be found in the biography .

		Scholarly in its design and painstaking in its execution , rich in pertinent quotations from Bright 's speeches and letters , well illustrated and carefully indexed , the book is about all that could be asked for in a biography of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	statesman ; and the debt that
America	LOCATION	owes him for stoutly upholding the cause of the
Union	LOCATION	when other prominent Englishmen were express - ing sympathy with secession should give added interest to Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	's work on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
R. M. Theobald	PERSON	declares that

		Other Baconians have given the greater part of Elizabethan lit - erature to
Bacon	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Castle	PERSON	says the plays were written by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, assisted by a lawyer probably
Lord Bacon	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
G. G. Greenwood	PERSON	prefers to attribute them to a Great Unknown , a lawyer , but not

		But this is not all .

		After the Baconians have gone to so much trouble and expense of spirit , Professor

New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		thunder and wreathes the lightning crown of Shakespearean authorship about the head of
Roger Manners	ORGANIZATION	,
Earl	PERSON	of
Rutland	LOCATION	.

		The thing has become a screaming farce .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	, au - thor of `` The Baconian Heresy , '' does not des - pair of seeing Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	, who was a good classical scholar and must have known consider - able law , championed as the true ,
Simon	PERSON	Pure poet of the plays .

		Probably a school of critics will arise in the future who can only see in the galaxy of the Virgin Queen and her mighty counsellors and starry poets , a myth , the forgery and coinage of some after poet 's brain , like
King Arthur	PERSON	and his Table Round , or
Chatterton	PERSON	's circle of Bristowe worthies .

		Perhaps it might be well to let the Baconians mutually destroy themselves .

		Largely this is what has been done .

		Scholars have stood aside in amazement , disgust , and indignation .

		The Baconian books have been many and ponderous , from those of
W. Henry Smith	ORGANIZATION	and
Delia Bacon	PERSON	, the two `` only begetters '' of the craze , through Judge
Nathaniel Holmes	PERSON	, Mr.
Donnelly	PERSON	, the two Theobalds ,
Senator Davis	PERSON	, down to Judge
Stotesenburg	PERSON	, with others too numerous to name .

		The Shakespearean side has been represented by very able men ,
Grant White	ORGANIZATION	,
Edward Dowden	PERSON	, Mr.
Devecmon	PERSON	,
Churton Collins	PERSON	, and
Andrew Lang	PERSON	; but , with the exception of the last-named , the attention they have given the matter has been brief , special , or by the way .

		Now , however , Mr.
J. M. Robertson	PERSON	, who has already distinguished himself in Shakespearean criticism , comes forward with a book compared with which all preceding Shakespearean hand - ling of the matter is as a spread of appetizers to a banquet of seventeen courses .

		It is not an easy book to review .

		Mr.
Robert	PERSON	- son 's own part is written with uncommon vigor and wit , but probably half of the six hundred pages is a serried mass of quoted lines and words and parallel passages .

		We shall be reduced to statistics to give some idea of the length , breadth , depth , and all-satisfying completeness of its refutation of the most singular delusion of modern times .

		Nothing has done more to give color to and obtain credence for the Baconian theory than the asserted legal learning in the plays .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	shows that the law court was to the Tudor age almost what the newspaper is to-day , a source of general entertainment , a thing of universal interest .

		And not only did the people at large like to hear law cases , but they entered into them on the slightest provocation .

		Shake - speare 's father was one of the most litigious of 142 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	men .

		He was concerned in one way or another in sixty-seven cases .

		Shakespeare himself , with his property interests , unquestionably had much experience of law .

		The frantic prepossession of the Baconians as to the extent of legal knowledge in the Shake - spearean work is based on
Lord Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's examination and judgment in the matter .

		He was not a Baconian , and his brief was written to substantiate the idea that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	might have been an attorney 's clerk in his youth , an idea which we believe is probable but which his Lordship winds up by deeming doubtful .

		He declares that in fourteen of the thirty-seven dramas attributed to Shakespeare there is no trace of legal learning .

		As a matter of curi - osity , we abridge from Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	a list of the number of law references in the other plays . ''

		Macbeth '' 1 , '' Merry Wives of
Windsor	LOCATION	'' 3 , '' Measure for Measure '' 3 , '' Comedy of Errors '' 2 , `` As You Like It '' 5 , `` Troilus and Cres - sida '' 2 , `` Much Ado About Nothing '' 1 , '' Love 's Labor Lost '' 1 , '' Midsummer 's Night 's Dream '' 1 , `` Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' 5 , `` Taming of the Shrew '' 3 , '' All 's Well That Ends Well '' 1 , '' Winter 's Tale '' 2 , '' King John '' 1 , ''
Henry VI	PERSON	. ''

		3 , `` Henry IV . ''

		4 , `` Lear '' 4 , `` Hamlet '' 4 , `` Othello '' 5 , `` Antony and Cleopatra '' 1 , '' Coriolanus '' 1 , `` Romeo and Juliet '' 1 .

		With some twenty law phrases which occur in the Sonnets , there is a total of about fourscore examples of legal phraseology and usage .

		The works of all the contemporary drama - tists ,
Greene	PERSON	,
Nash	PERSON	,
Dekker	PERSON	,
Peele	PERSON	, Mas - singer ,
Heywood	LOCATION	,
Chapman	PERSON	,
Ben Jonson	PERSON	,
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	, are strown thick with law words and law matter .

		In Lyly 's '' Mother Bombie '' there are thirty law refer - ences .

		In Massinger 's '' City Madam '' there are six , and in '' A New Way to Pay Old Debts '' thirteen .

		In
Webster	PERSON	's '' The Devil 's Law Case '' there are about thirty-five distinct legal phrases and references ; in his '' Appius and
Virginia	LOCATION	'' twenty-six .


Ben Jonson	PERSON	's `` Epicsene '' has nine ; his '' Devil Is an Ass '' eleven ; and his '' Magnetic Lady '' forty .

		In all
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's works there is probably four or five times as much law as in all
Shakespeare 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		None of the dramatists named is known to have been a law - yer ; nor were earlier writers such as
William Langland	PERSON	,
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	,
Spenser	PERSON	, and
Latimer	PERSON	, who use legal terms glibly enough .

		Many of the Elizabethan playwrights show a special fond - ness for trials and scenes in court .

		Three of
Webster	PERSON	's plays turn on formal law trials ; and
Ben Jonson	PERSON	has a number of them .

		Most of these are more realistic , nearer to actual pro- cedure , than
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's idealized effects in that sort , which reach a sublime height of in - difference to true legality in the court scene of '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	gives an amusing exposure of the legal falsity of this scene ; but we think he hardly goes far enough .

		In the first place , Shylock 's case would at any time have been thrown out of any court in
Christendom	LOCATION	.

		It was plainly murder , and no court or
State	ORGANIZATION	would have authorized it .

		But if the bond had been allowed , then
Portia	LOCATION	's quibbles would have gone for nothing .

		A prin - ciple carries its consequences with it ; and even if flesh and blood are not one and indissoluble , Shylock was entitled to any means necessary to get his forfeit .

		Nor is there any reason why he should have been compelled to take his pound of flesh at one stroke .

		He could have taken less , or cut and come again , until he got the exact amount .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	notices the theory which considers
Portia	PERSON	in the light of an Italian podesta ; but surely no podesta or English referee ever acted as attorney for the defence , judge , and jury all at once .

		The legal phraseology in the Shakespearean Sonnets is on a little different footing from that in the plays .

		In
1593	DATE	were published
Barnes	ORGANIZATION	's Sonnets .

		Their similarity to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's in many respects is remarkable , and it is difficult to believe that the latter did not read and imi - tate them .


Barnes	PERSON	was a protege of the
Earl of Southampton	ORGANIZATION	, as was
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		His sonnets are loaded with legal diction to an extent far surpassing those of Shakespeare .

		One more point may be noted in this legal controversy .


Richard Grant White	PERSON	, the most absolute scorner of the Baconian doctrine , never - theless swallowed whole
Lord Campbell	ORGANIZATION	's thesis as to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's legal knowledge , and backed it up by some examples of his own .

		The chief of these is the Shakespearean use of the word `` purchase , '' implying all means of obtaining property save that by inheritance .

		Mr.
Rob	PERSON	- ertson shows that this was the primary and usual meaning , and gives 135 quotations from English writers , from
William Langland	PERSON	to
Beaumont	LOCATION	and
Fletcher	PERSON	, in evidence .

		He grows weary of demonstrating by piled-up proof that Shake - speare 's usage of legal or quasi-legal words was on all fours with that of practically every other author of his age .

		The classical erudition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is the next matter which engages Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's attention .

		What air and water were to the physical life of the Tudor times , classical knowl -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 143 edge -LRB- often , indeed , intermixed with mediaeval matter -RRB- was to its intellectual existence .

		After the revival of learning , all
Europe	LOCATION	was saturated with the classical spirit .

		Particularly no one could begin poet without a stock of myths , leg - ends , commonplaces , drawn from classical an - tiquity .

		Without giving Shakespeare the benefit of any Latin School training at
Stratford	LOCATION	, or the `` little Latin and less Greek '' of
Ben Jonson	PERSON	, it can be shown , as Dr. Farmer proved to the satisfaction of his generation , that practically all the instances of classical learning in his works can be traced to English sources .

		The contrary thesis , however , has been revived in recent times by two strongly anti-Baconian scholars , Pro- fessor
Fiske	PERSON	and Professor
Churton Collins	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	's demonstration of their error is as complete and brilliant as need be .

		Lord Penzance , who is the Baconian champion of their view , attached great weight to the opinion of Mr.
Donnelly	PERSON	.

		Now Mr.
Donnelly	PERSON	had no classical scholarship whatever .

		Dr.
Theobald	PERSON	also follows Mr.
Donnelly	PERSON	, and Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	examines minutely the twenty-one examples of classic scholarship given by him .

		All of them are phrases , maxims , or references to myths which are to be found in English sources an - terior to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		A book called `` The Classical Element in Shakespeare '' by another
Theobald	PERSON	, a cousin of the former , is also ex - amined , and the sixty-four instances are simi - larly shown to be in wide use by previous English writers .

		In the matter of classical vocabulary , Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	, quoting mainly from Judge
Willis	PERSON	, gives an examination of 223 words alleged to show classical scholarship .

		As usual , previous English usage is shown for practically all of them .

		Coincidences of expression between Shake - speare and Bacon have been weapons most bravely brandished by the Baconians .

		Mr.
Donnelly	PERSON	is amazed to find that such strange words as `` quintessence , '' `` eternize , '' `` grav - elled '' are used by both writers .

		Nay , words like '' mortal , '' '' ape , '' '' infinite , '' '' scour , '' `` fan - tastical '' are common to both ; as are metaphors about the sea , ocean , scum , dregs , clouds .

		It would be hard to find any writing where these are not common .

		Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	gives many pages of quotations from other
Tudor	LOCATION	authors , where the expressions and ideas which amaze Mr.
Donnelly	PERSON	and Dr.
Theobald	PERSON	are existent .

		Owing to the lack of a concordance to
Bacon	LOCATION	's works it is impossible accurately to estimate the number of words used by him , or how they differ from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's vocabulary .

		But Mr.
Rob	PERSON	- ertson gives some partial lists which seem to show that the two vocabularies do vary greatly , as is but natural from their subject-matter , and that
Bacon	PERSON	's is the larger of the two .

		The author of the plays shows practically no sign of
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's predominant interest in science .

		He was no fulminator against atheism , no zeal - ous flatterer of
King James	LOCATION	, no striver against scholasticism .

		There are but a few scraps of Latin in the plays , whereas in
Bacon	LOCATION	for many pages together Latin occurs continually and classical scholarship is predominant .

		Bacon spoke more than once in dispraise of stage plays , and the only kind of theatrical work he seemed to care for was the didactic .

		Acting as Com - missioner for Suits ,
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	declared against a petition of the
King 's Players	ORGANIZATION	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's company .

		In his comparison between the style , the manner of expression , of the two writers , Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	opens up a new vein , one which we are surprised has not been worked before .

		What he says of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's verse is fine and just .

		Shakespeare is the king of poetic rhythm , and he does with blank verse more than any succeeding poet has been able to do with the aid of rhyme and varied metres .

		His caesura flies from syllable to syllable , as the foam leaps from crest to crest to call the incoming billows to follow its plumed onset .

		Take only two lines for example , those of Coriolanus , '' That , like an eagle in a dove-cote , I Flutter 'd your Volscians in Corioli . ''

		Note how the huddling rush of the first nine syllables is followed by the proud pause of the tenth , and then by the wavering motion of the second line , which answers in sound to the image .

		To compare such versification with the scant efforts of
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's wooden Muse is foolish .

		It is in their prose that we get the measure of their difference .

		Bacon 's prose is static , Shake - speare 's dynamic .

		Bacon 's is bewigged , be - ruffled , formal , and ceremonious ;
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's is naked , lithe , as free in movement as a Greek athlete .

		For once we must part company with Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	when he gives the superior meed of praise to formal , to so-called periodic , prose .

		And we must challenge his judgment when he declares that poets are not good prose writers .

		They are the best .

		Instinctively they put as wide a separation as they can between poetry and prose .

		They know that poetry is an expres - sion of passion and exalted moods , and that music in all the meaning of that word ordered movement , harmony , correspondence of rhythm 144 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	and sound belongs to it and to it alone .

		They know that prose is the expression of ordinary life , that its norm is the colloquial .

		And they write or try to write a prose which , however brilliant and glittering it may be in its ideas and images , is yet as easy as an old shoe .

		In our language
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is the golden master of this prose style .

		Congreve is a near rival , and
Dryden	PERSON	, Gray ,
Goldsmith	PERSON	, and
Sheridan	PERSON	are great practitioners of it .

		After the eclipse of this style by the stuffed and stiff Johnsonian sentence ,
Hazlitt	PERSON	revived it , and from him derive all our later masters of light and easy prose ,
Macaulay	LOCATION	,
Dickens	PERSON	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Bagehot	PERSON	,
Steven	PERSON	- son ,
Birrell	PERSON	, and the rest .

		That easy , racy , idiomatic colloquial prose is the central prose we hold to be axiomatic ; but it does not follow that the other kind , the prose which tries to approximate to poetry , is bad .

		Only it is off the track , or trying to run on two lines at once .

		Of this style
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	is by no means the supreme master that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is in his .

		He has been far surpassed by later writers , by
Jeremy Taylor	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	, De Quincey , and
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		So far in his book Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	has been accumulating evidence , but in his final chapter he turns to argument and discusses all the prob - abilities of the case .

		Other writers have pre - ceded him here ; and though he handles the matter with great skill , so that almost any one of the points he presents is enough to carry conviction , yet the chief value of the book is in the original investigations of which we have tried to give a brief account in the foregoing review .

		In his preface Mr.
Robertson	PERSON	makes a plea for charity and courtesy for the erring Bacon - ians .

		Yet , as he proceeds , their colossal ignor - ance and ineptitude for logic move him more and more to wrath , until he uses as strong expressions as we who are unregenerate could desire .

		It was an accusation against the old English witches that they removed the bound - aries of people 's property at night , a most irritating proceeding .

		To wake up in the morn - ing and find that landmarks had been changed and woods and pastures which were in one manor or parish were now included in another , must have been destructive of all social continuity .

		The Baconians have essayed a like necromancy in the intellectual world .

		As the Shake - speareans do not call out for their punishment by the stake , the boiling cauldron , or the duck - ing pond , a few verbal ebullitions may surely be pardoned .

LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		AN ARTIST IN THE SOUTH SEAS .

		* By temperament and education
John La Farge	PERSON	was peculiarly qualified to appreciate and enjoy the charm of the
South Sea Islands	LOCATION	.

		Not only was he keenly sensitive to the beauty of the tropical scenery and of the rhythmic movements of the natives , whether dancing for his entertainment or following their ordinary avocations , but his remarkable freedom from race prejudice enabled him to meet these peoples with sympathetic understanding , to win their regard and to make many friends among them .

		Withal their leisurely ways appealed to him ; for , though always a hard worker , he was one who never liked to do anything in haste .

		The visit to the South Seas which he made in company with Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	in
1890	DATE	and
1891	DATE	was of nearly a year 's duration .

		It was a year filled with many and rare delights .

		Some hardships there were , for Mr. La Farge had not fully recovered his strength after a long and serious illness , and the fetes given in his honor were not infrequently protracted until they be - came for him extremely fatiguing .

		But aside from this and a few other minor drawbacks , none of which really interfered with his enjoy - ment , the experience was an enchanting one from start to finish .

		Nor was the impression made upon him by what he saw a fleeting one .

		Years after his return he was fond of talking for hours about the islands and their peoples .

		They had always fascinated him from the time when , as a boy , he had eagerly read the narratives of Cook ,
Bougainville	LOCATION	, and
Wallis	PERSON	, and had revelled in the tales of
Melville	LOCATION	and
Stoddard	PERSON	.

		The record of this year of travel is in part made up from the diary kept by Mr.
La Farge	PERSON	with a view to its publication , and partly from his letters to his son , Mr.
Bancel	PERSON	La Farge .

		In his friend Mr.
Henry Adams	PERSON	he had a thoroughly congenial companion .

		Both were content to journey in the most leisurely manner .

		And the reader who is content to read without hurrying , and to linger over the pages of this book , will find it most engaging .

		It is not merely a book of travel .

		It is that and something more .

		The style is contemplative rather than descriptive .

		There is much thoughtful comment upon the things seen , and much illuminating information .

		And there is rich treasure in curious tales and legends , all of them entertaining , and some , like `` The Story of the Fish Hook War , '' highly amusing .

		A number of these tales were related * REMINISCENCES OP THE SOUTH SEAS .

New York	LOCATION	:
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 145 to Mr. La Farge and Mr.
Adams	PERSON	by
Queen Marau of Tahiti	ORGANIZATION	.

		This old lady , the head of the ancient house of the Tevas , graciously adopted her two American friends into the line by con - ferring family names upon them , and then made them acquainted with the heroic deeds of the great
Chiefs of Amo	ORGANIZATION	from whom they might now claim descent .

		Then , too , the genealogy of the family was laid before them ; and among the
South Sea	LOCATION	islanders genealogy indicated `` not only one 's importance but one 's right to land . ''

		Of course the honor conferred upon Mr.
La Farge	PERSON	and Mr.
Adams	PERSON	was not intended to be more than a compliment ; nor could it be , for , as Mr. La Farge tells us : '' The entire aristocracy is a real one , the only one I know of .

		It is impossible to enter into it , though one may be born into it .

		With our ideas of more or less Germanic origin we suppose a ruler gifted with the power of bestowing part of his value upon certain men lower than himself and actually making such people essentially different .

		A Polynesian knows no such metaphysical subtlety .

		The actual blood of physical descent is essential to supremacy , except in a most vicarious and momentary manner , or as by marriage so that the children may become entitled to whatever the sum of the blood of parents represents . ''

		These words were written before the visit to
Tahiti	LOCATION	and were in explanation of the attitude of the Samoans toward the chief
Malietoa	PERSON	, whom the
Berlin	LOCATION	Conference made king , and toward the deposed ruler
Mataafa	PERSON	, who , because of his more distinguished pedigree must be regarded as the greater chief even though arbitrarily despoiled of his power .

		For Mataafa , Mr. La Farge entertained very high respect .

		During the months spent in
Samoa	LOCATION	they met frequently , and the American visitors were deeply impressed by the ex-king 's intelligence and courtly man - ners .

		Mr.
La Farge	PERSON	's words about him are worth quoting : `` I see no picture about me more interesting than the moral one of my next neighbour the great Mataafa .

		To see the devout Christian , the man who has tried to put aside the small things that tie us down , struggle with the antique prejudices necessary ones of a Poly - nesian nobleman , is a touching spectacle .

		When a young missionary rides up to his door , while all others gently come up to it , and those who pass move far away out of respect ; and then when the confident youth , full of his station as a religious teacher , speaks to the great chief from his saddle ,
Mataafa	ORGANIZATION	's face is a study .

		Over the sensitive countenance , which looks partly like that of a warrior , partly that of a bishop or church guardian , comes a wave of surprise and disgust , promptly repelled , as the higher view of forgiveness and respect for holy office comes to his relief . ''

		But
Mataafa	PERSON	is not only a chief of chiefs , he is a gentleman among gentlemen .

		My companion , difficult to please , says , ' La Farge , at last we have met a gen - tleman . ' ''

		The travellers ' longest stay was in
Samoa	LOCATION	, where they made excursions in many directions and were everywhere received with warm hospi - tality .

		At each village as they approached they were welcomed by the
Taupo	LOCATION	, or official virgin ; and in spite of the disapproval of the mission - aries a performance of the sitting siva dance was usually given for their entertainment .

		Mr.
La Farge	PERSON	has much to say about this dance , which is the Polynesian 's natural form of ex - pression of joy in life .

		The lithe , rippling move - ment of the body is exquisitely graceful in its pulsing rhythm .

		Upon the American artist it made a deep impression .

		Seeing it danced for the first time he wrote : '' The memory of all that beauty which we call
Greece	LOCATION	, the one beauty which is to outlast all that is alive , comes over me like a wave of mist , softening and putting far away into fairyland all that I have been looking at . ''

		In addition to the written record , Mr.
La Farge	PERSON	used his brush and pencil assiduously to make a pictorial one , and the volume contains excellent reproductions of many of his sketches .

		It would be pleasant to follow the travellers throughout their entire progress , first to Hono - lulu and thence around the island of
Hawaii	LOCATION	; next to
Samoa	LOCATION	, where they were paddled from village to village by native boatmen ; thence to
Tahiti	LOCATION	; and lastly to
Fiji	LOCATION	, where , after an ex - pedition into the mountains of
Vita Levu	LOCATION	, the trip came to an end .

		But the reviewer can only point this out , and leave the pleasure to the readers of the book .

		THE NEW ILLUSTRATED FLORA .

		* The natural history of a country passes through three stages .

		In the first , the period of the pioneer explorers , everything is new .

		In the second , knowledge accumulates , many books and papers are written , and the whole subject becomes too complex and difficult for one who has not access to large libraries and collections .

		In the third stage , a fairly complete treatment of the plants and animals emerges from the apparent chaos of diverse contributions and con - flicting opinions , and it is possible for the first time to see the whole field at a glance , with nothing of much importance for such a survey * AN ILLUSTRATED FLORA OF THE NORTHERN UNITED STATES ,
CANADA	LOCATION	, AND THE BRITISH POSSESSIONS .

		By
Nathaniel L. Britton	PERSON	and
Addison Brown	PERSON	.

		Second edition , revised and enlarged .

		In three volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	omitted .

		In the first period , the main object appears to be to describe the newly discovered species .

		In the second , classification becomes as important as description .

		In the third , the broad outlines of the system having been laid down , and the accumulated data collected and arranged , the field lies open for biological work of all kinds .

		It is in the third period that the amateur comes to his own , and those who believe that it is good for many people to study nature must rejoice in the appearance of such works as the one now reviewed .

		The first edition of
Britton	PERSON	and
Brown	PERSON	's '' Illustrated Flora '' appeared in the years
1896	DATE	to
1898	DATE	, containing descriptions and illustra - tions of all the then known plants of the
Eastern United States	ORGANIZATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	.

		It was very expen - sive to produce , and would hardly have been attempted but for the financial support of Judge
Brown	PERSON	, who appears as one of the authors .

		Con - trary to expectation , the first edition of six thou - sand copies readily sold out , and the book was a financial success .

		This is a significant fact , showing that there are thousands of people in this country sufficiently interested in botany to buy a rather high-priced technical work ; and from the other point of view , that books of this kind can be safely undertaken by publishers in
America	LOCATION	as well as in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It is probable that before very many years it will be possible to issue a similar illustrated Flora covering the whole of
North America	LOCATION	, and that when issued this larger work will also pay for itself .

		The time is hardly ripe for such a Flora at present , owing to our still very incomplete knowledge of the plants of many parts of the country .

		In the meanwhile , however , a condensed North Amer - ican
Flora	LOCATION	, without illustrations , is slowly ap - pearing in parts ; prepared , like the present work , at the
New York Botanical Garden	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the first edition of the Illustrated Flora appeared , we supposed it nearly complete ; but the second edition contains more than 500 species not given in the first , and in addition notes on a number of others considered more or less doubtful , or discovered too recently to be treated in full .

		The second edition also differs from the first in the names of about 175 genera , necessitating new names for several hundreds of species .

		Of course many of these changes have been made in other publications between the dates of the two editions ; and in fact several , ostensibly new in the second edi - tion , were really published previously by other authors .

		When we consider all these changes and additions , and remember that in many ways the treatment is very different from that of the Harvard botanists , and even from the work of some of the other botanists of the
New York Garden	LOCATION	, it seems doubtful whether we have after all reached the third stage in our evolution .

		It is indeed true that we have not yet reached a condition of stability as to many names and details of classification ; but , on the other hand , the plant species are on the whole well known , and with the aid of such an excellent guide the amateur should have little difficulty in recog - nizing them .

		Fortunately , the pictures and descriptions are just as good , whether or not we approve of the names applied to them , so that the main object , the accurate recognition of the plants , is attained .

		There are times when one is half inclined to regret the existence of good botanical and zool - ogical manuals .

		These are when we find people wholly satisfied with them , looking for what is described in them , and looking no further .

		According to the way they are used , manuals may serve to bind or to liberate .

		They serve to bind and to hinder progress if they are thought of as covering the field , leaving nothing of im - portance to be done .

		They are , however , great causes of progress if they simply serve to make available the work of the past , so that upon it can be built the work of the future .

		We may judge that the first edition of the Illustrated Flora served in the latter way , as is shown by the great progress made since its publication .

		Nevertheless , it must be confessed that amateur , and even professional , botanists in
America	LOCATION	have not yet adequately realized the richness of the field before them .

		Once the species , in the broad sense , are sorted out and defined , all kinds of work on the biology , physiology , and varietal taxonomy of the plants may usefully begin .

		Of course work of this type has been carried on since the beginnings of botany in this country , but taken all together it does not do much more than open up the immense field for research .

		Perhaps the most fascinating subject of all is that of experimental breeding , to which Dr.
Britton	PERSON	calls attention in his preface .

		Any - one who has a small garden , by concentrating on a single group of plants , can do valuable work of this type in the course of a few years .

		Condensed as it is , the Illustrated Flora re - quires three large volumes .

		Necessarily , much interesting matter had to be left out , but , we regret the total absence of reference to several critical researches of recent years .

		* Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	's new novel , `` The Inside of the Cup , '' offers an intensely serious treatment of an immensely important subject .

		As a novel , the charge lies fairly against it that the author is so weighed down with the sense of his mission and so zealous in the bearing of his testimony that he neg - lects art for the sake of didacticism , and fills the greater part of his five hundred pages with discus - * THE INSIDE OF THE CUP .

		sion and argument that belong in a sociological or theological treatise , and have no proper place in a work of fiction .

		Having made successful use of the novel as a vehicle for historical exposition , he evi - dently thinks it may be used with equal fitness as a vehicle for the exposition of liberal theology and for the ideas that form the basis of the modern propa - ganda for social and economic betterment .

		In this belief , and in the practice which it dictates , he has of course , many examples to which he may point in justification .

		Anything may be put into a novel nowadays , and many readers have got into the habit of appraising novels with regard to their sheer intellectual content rather than with regard to their rhetorical equipment or to the success with which they handle the formal problems of character de - velopment and dramatic action .

		The intellectual content of this novel is substantial , and it has besides enough of the attributes of the novel as an art-form to lighten if not to enliven its somewhat ponderous progress .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's theme is the relation of the church to modern life , and its thesis is that the church as an organization must frankly recognize that its old dogmatic foundations are no longer ten - able , and that it must rediscover and reassert the spirit of Christianity with little regard for creeds or formal doctrines if it may hope to survive .

		The cup must be cleansed within as well as polished without if it is to serve the true spiritual needs of man .

		The church must be converted from an organ - ized hypocrisy into an active agency for social wel - fare , and its inner motive of action must become an unshaken conviction that the essence of Christianity is the realization of human brotherhood rather than belief in any miracle or lip-service to any creed .


John Hodder	PERSON	, Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	's protagonist , is called from a sleepy
New England	LOCATION	parish to
St. Louis	LOCATION	, where he ministers to the congregation of a fashion - able church .

		Here the social problems which he had previously known only from afar are forced upon his attention , and he soon comes to realize that he can not be a true shepherd of souls under the conditions which his vestry would impose upon him .

		He also begins to have doubts about the validity of the dog - mas in which his mind has been shackled , and a course of reading in the higher criticism soon shows him how artificial have been his theological beliefs .

		When the time is ripe , he speaks out , and the sermon in which he states his new convictions is thrown like a bomb into his congregation .

		The explosion dis - rupts the church , alienates the magnate who is its chief supporter , arouses the sharp antagonism of the vestry , cuts off his salary , and threatens a trial for heresy .

		Hodder stands firm upon his canonical rights , and refuses to be moved by the argument that he is violating his contract when he refuses to preach the doctrines which he has been engaged to preach .

		It is the old question of whether the church may best be reformed from within or from without , and Hod - der is resolute in holding it his duty to work from the inside .

		When the book closes , the threatened trial for heresy has been averted , and new allies have 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	rallied to his cause , but we feel that the struggle has only begun .

		Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	champions the cause with such sincerity and force of conviction that we can not hold its eventual triumph in doubt .

		It is evident that this book is a new ''
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	, '' but two important points of difference must be noted .

		So much water has flowed under the bridges during the past thirty years that in the depiction of such a struggle between reason and prejudice it is possible to blow a more resounding note of hope upon the slug-horn than Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's knight of the spirit could command at the forbidding portal of his dark tower .

		And the accent of the argument is noticeably shifted .

		It is no longer placed upon dogmatic theology , for the Zeitgeist has already brought that pretty well into solution .

		It is placed instead upon the mission of the church as a social agency , and upon its prac - tical rather than its intellectual derelictions .

		In taking this course Mr.
Churchill	PERSON	is clearly the child of an age in which social sympathy is aroused as it has never been before , and , although the course takes him close to the reefs of sentimentality , he does not seem to be in danger of shipwreck upon them .

		Will the American civil war , we wonder , continue for another half-century to supply the romantic novelist with inspiration as abundantly as it has in the half-century just ended .

		The end of the output is by no means in sight , as we are reminded by several novels of the past year , and now particularly by Mr.
Marriott	PERSON	's `` Sally
Castleton	PERSON	, Southerner . ''

		The type of this kind of novel is now pretty defi - nitely fixed , and the present example conforms to it .

		There is a dashing Union officer , and a patriotic Southern girl intensely devoted to the cause of the Confederacy .

		The girl loves the man against her will , and has to sacrifice something of her patriotism to rescue him from the fate of a spy .

		The scene is in
Virginia	LOCATION	, and the operations about
Richmond	LOCATION	supply the historical material .

		The outcome is the familiar one , and sentiment has the last word .

		A foundling adopted by a
New England	LOCATION	country physician is brought up as one of the family , and becomes the professional assistant of ' his patron .

		He is given the name of
Varge	LOCATION	, and is devoted to Dr. and Mrs.
Merton	PERSON	.


Horace Merton	PERSON	, their degen - erate son , quarrels with his father , and kills him in a fit of passion .

		Varge thereupon , to spare the woman who has been as a mother to him , makes the preposterous self-sacrifice of assuming the guilt of the crime , and is sentenced to the penitentiary for life .

		His character and conduct are such that his custodians are convinced in their hearts of his inno - cence , but no persuasion can wring the truth from him .

		He becomes a `` trusty , '' and wins the love of the warden 's daughter .

		Then he contrives to escape , reaches the coast of
Maine	LOCATION	, and there unexpectedly encounters the fair
Janet	PERSON	.

		She is ready to flee with him , and to share the peril and ignominy of a hunted existence , but he will not accept the sacrifice , and gives himself back into the hands of the law to save her from such a life .

		Finally , Mrs.
Merton	PERSON	dies , the guilty son makes a confession and then shoots himself , and
Varge	ORGANIZATION	is free to take up the life of freedom and love .

		It makes an interesting and even exciting story , but the reader revolts at
Varge	ORGANIZATION	's indefensible and impossible heroism .

		Mr.
Frank L. Packard	PERSON	is the author , and '' Greater Love Hath No Man '' is the title . ''

		The Dragoman '' is a piece of crude literary carpentry , but it contains a story .

		An Englishman who is the heir to large estates in
Egypt	LOCATION	, and who has lived on the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	all his life , boards a nonde - script steamer on its way up the river , and learns that it is conveying a consignment of rifles and machine guns by way of the
Blue Nile	ORGANIZATION	to
Abyssinia	LOCATION	.

		It is chartered by an American named
Hilken	PERSON	who , with his beautiful daughter , is on board .

		There have recently been ominous suggestions of a native uprising and a holy war , which make Randall suspicious , and he learns that the arms are really destined for use in such an enterprise .

		This fact , and the possible fate that may await the American girl in the Soudan , determine
Randall	PERSON	to take a hand in the affair .

		He is an adept in the native disguises and dialects , and he succeeds in imperson - ating the Egyptian leader of the expedition , of whose person he disposes in a highly ingenious way , taking his place on the steamer .

		It is a desperate adventure , and one does not see how he is going to get out of it , but his schemes prove successful , and , without revealing his true character to the girl , he rescues her from her villainous captors , punctures the revolutionary plot , and gets back to
Cairo	LOCATION	, where he reaps his fitting reward .

		The story has no style to speak of , but its movement is swift and spirited , its knowledge of the
East	LOCATION	adequate , and its out - come romantically satisfying .

		Mr.
George K. Stiles	PERSON	is the author .

		Her real name is
Stella Blount	PERSON	, but she is fancifully christened
Stella Maris	PERSON	, because her room looks out on the English Channel , and the sea is her confidant and familiar .

		When we make her acquaintance , she is fifteen , and she - has never left her room , because she is the victim of a spinal disease which keeps her flat on her back .

		We are led to suppose that she will never leave her bed , which does not seem to promise well for the heroine of a novel .

		She lives in a world of illusion , created for her by the tender solicitude of her loved ones , who have so kept her , like lolanthe in the Danish lyrical drama , from all knowledge of the evil of the world , that sin and ugliness have no meaning for her .

		Chief among those who watch over her are two young men , for whom she is the centre about which the universe revolves .

		One is an actor , the other a journalist , and for the latter life has been made ghastly by an imprudent early marriage .

		His wife has developed from a shrew into a fiend , and just as the story opens , has been convicted for torturing a little maid-servant , and condemned to three years of imprisonment .

		Of all this
Stella	PERSON	has no hint , and in the fairy realm of her imagination
John Risca	PERSON	is a prince living in a beautiful marble palace which her imagination con - structs in detail from his description .

		Now this
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 149 situation is one that inevitably lends itself to senti - mentality of handling , and of sugary sentiment there is no lack in its portrayal , but somehow Mr.
Locke	PERSON	keeps it from becoming either maudlin or mawkish , and develops it so beautifully that we come to accept it , despite an initial protest .

		About midway in the book , things begin to happen .

		Stella , growing toward womanhood , shows signs of recovering the use of her limbs , and after a year or so of convalescence , is restored to the conditions of normal existence .

		This requires a readjustment of her scheme of life , and an opening of her eyes to actuality .

		She learns all the wretched story of
John	PERSON	's life , and has a hard struggle to preserve her mental balance under the shock .

		Meanwhile , the hideous cause of all this misery has served her term , and after her release , devotes herself with cold-blooded malignity to hound - ing
John	PERSON	-LRB- who is still legally her husband -RRB- and the maid-servant whom
John	PERSON	has rescued from an insti - tution and made his ward , and even
Stella	PERSON	, whom she seeks out , and poisons with the foul effluvium of her mind .

		The creature is so steeped in depravity that it is hard to accept her as a human being .

		Finally , the little maid whom
John	PERSON	has protected , and in whom he has inspired the most doglike de - votion , makes a great resolution .

		She will clear the path for his happiness by putting the horrible woman out of the way .

		She does this at the cost of her own life , because when the deed is done , she shoots herself .

		Then follow all kinds of heroics ; the two young men , both of whom love
Stella	PERSON	as a woman , indulge in the most approved style of
Damon	PERSON	and Pythias performances , and at last the author , out of sheer wantonness , makes
Stella	PERSON	choose the other man , although every indication of the story up to this time has pointed to
John	PERSON	as the one to be rewarded in due time .

		We can not forgive Mr.
Locke	PERSON	for this breach of faith with us , which converts an appealing romantic action into a meaningless farce , and we refuse to take these last pages seriously .

		There is more substantial stuff concerned with motive and character in this book than Mr.
Locke	PERSON	is wont to deal with , and , despite the interest of the present narra - tive , it is not as fine a performance as the works of whimsical intellectualized comedy with which he has hitherto regaled us .

		It was inevitable that Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	should write a novel about the war in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		The greater part of his work has concerned itself with the British dependencies , and he is one of the most impassioned of imperial patriots .

		Popular opinion in this country on the subject of the Boer War has been so warped by prejudice and so poisoned by perverse fallacies that it is highly important to have the matter set before us in its proper light .

		Nothing could be more grotesquely mischievous than the notion that this war was an act of brutal oppression waged for the purpose of crushing the liberties of two weak and defenseless republics .

		Those who know the facts of its history understand well enough that it was a struggle in behalf of the funda - mental principles of human freedom , flouted and mocked at by a vicious and rapacious oligarchy .

		It was a war forced upon the English people by intolerable tyranny and wanton aggression .

		That Sir
Gilbert	PERSON	makes this clear is a matter that goes without saying .

		We do not get to the war until `` The Judgment House '' is nearing its close , but the whole work leads up to it by an inevitable logical process .

		The hero is
Rudyard Byng	ORGANIZATION	, one of the financial rulers of
South Africa	LOCATION	, who has returned to
England	LOCATION	and is occupying a conspicuous position in English society .

		He wooes and wins
Jasmine Grenfel	PERSON	, an ambitious beauty who for his sake dis - cards
Ian Stafford	PERSON	, the diplomat-lover to whom she has been engaged .

		After the glamour fades , she becomes unfaithful to her husband , and yields her - self to
Stafford	PERSON	.

		Then the scene shifts to
South Africa	LOCATION	, and in the fiery furnace of the war the three persons chiefly concerned find their higher selves , and learn that life is something more than the gratification of petty ambition and personal desire .

		Stafford sees his sin face to face , and redeems himself from it by self-sacrifice and a heroic death .

		Byng , who never learns of his wife 's faithlessness , regains her love by the splendid qualities of man - hood which the war brings out in him , and
Jasmine	ORGANIZATION	, purified by suffering , makes full atonement for her lapse from virtue .

		It is all a little sophisticated and more than a little melodramatic , but poetic in exposition and romantic in emotional coloring ^ We have given hardly a hint of the complicated plot , or of the tense dramatic situations in which the narrative abounds .

		Suffice it to say that all these things together make it a novel of enthralling inter - est , weaving many strands of intrigue and passion and heroism into its gorgeous pattern .

		In the matter of style as well as in those of invention and char - acterization , it stands upon Sir
Gilbert	PERSON	's highest level of achievement .

		A novel of unusually fine texture and power of characterization is offered by Mr.
H. F. Prevost Battersby	PERSON	in `` The Silence of Men . ''

		It is the story of
John March	PERSON	, an official of the Indian government , and
Lynne Ashburton	PERSON	, a fascinating young woman whom he encounters on his return voyage from a visit to
England	LOCATION	.

		Lynne is going out to occupy a business position that she has accepted by correspond - ence , and when she reaches her destination finds that the firm has failed , which leaves her stranded .

		March , learning of her plight , persuades her to re - main , and make her home with him and his sister in the country district which is the scene of his labors .

		From this situation to a seemingly happy marriage the transition is not difficult .

		But the marriage is kept secret , and this enables
Lynne	PERSON	, who tires of
March	DATE	and becomes infatuated with another man , to desert him , to contract a second marriage , and to return to
England	LOCATION	with her new husband in fancied security .

		March bears the blow in silence , and takes no step in interference .

		Returning to En - gland himself , he meets the right woman , and wins her love , but of course realizes that he can not marry her .

		The complication is disentangled when it tran - 150 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	spires that the versatile
Lynne	PERSON	had contracted a marriage in
England	LOCATION	previous to her voyage to
India	LOCATION	, and that the first of her three husbands had died between the dates of her second and third weddings .

		Thus the third marriage is manifestly legal , while the second is seen to interpose no obstacle to
March	DATE	's new-found happiness .

		This ingenious plot is enough in itself to make a good novel , and it is made a very good one by the author 's admirable style , his powers of description , and his skill in the analysis of character and motive .

		`` At the back of his mind there was an idea .

		What it was he never knew , because it never pre - sented itself to his consciousness .

		He only knew that it was there .

		It continually reminded him of its existence .

		In the course of ordinary conversation , or when reading a book , there was the insistence of the idea trying to find expression .

		It was as though something was continually knocking at the door of his consciousness for admission .

		But he did not know what it was that knocked , nor did he know how to unlock the door . ''

		We came across this paragraph in an essay in `` The New Statesman '' just after reading Mr.
Charles Marriott	PERSON	's novel , `` The Catfish . ''

		The paragraph was not written with any reference to the book , but it supplies us a characterization of the hero .

		The mystery of the title is not explained until the last chapter is reached , where we read : `` At one time the North Sea fishermen brought their cod to market in the holds of their vessels .

		In the tanks the cod lived at ease , with the result that they came to market slack , flabby , and limp .

		Some genius among fisher - men introduced one catfish into each of his tanks , and found that his cod came to market firm , brisk , and wholesome . ''


George Tracey	PERSON	, who grows up in an English provincial town , goes to
London	LOCATION	as a clerk in his father 's banking business , and returns to his native town to establish a cooperative enter - prise a sort of department store on idealistic lines , represents the cod in this parable .


Mary Festing	PERSON	, whom he meets as a child , is his catfish , and exer - cises a subtle influence over his life , even after he is happily married to another girl .

		He is an introspective youth , and is always busy with self - analysis , trying to discover why he does not see things with other people 's eyes .

		He does not quite find out , but he achieves something like the sort of success for which he has been groping .

		The story is almost wholly devoid of exciting happenings , but it reveals to us a singularly interesting mind real - izing itself under commonplace conditions , and it has a quiet compelling charm that sets it high above the level of ordinary fiction .

		`` The
House of Spies	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Warwick Deeping	PERSON	, is a romance of the south coast of
England	LOCATION	in the days when the Emperor 's forces massed at Boulogne threatened the safety of the island , and when the whereabouts of Villeneuve and
Nelson	PERSON	were the subject of much anxious speculation .

		A fanatical English scholar , who has come to regard
Napoleon	PERSON	as a champion of human liberty , and has conspired with the French to further their invasion , is the occupant of the old manor-house which the title of the book describes .

		Unfortunately for his nefarious designs , he has a pretty daughter , who is quite inno - cent of complicity in the treachery , and of whom a young neighboring squire becomes enamoured .

		There is an authentic villain of the best-approved type who has made the English scholar his dupe , and who is also an aspirant for the love of the fair
Nance	PERSON	.

		How the squire thwarts his plans , and rescues the girl from his clutches as he is about to kidnap her and carry her away to
France	LOCATION	after the news of
Trafalgar	ORGANIZATION	has made his plottings futile , is told us in thrilling fashion by Mr.
Deeping	PERSON	whose skill as a romantic novelist we have had occasion to praise upon several previous occasions .

		We fear that the author is by way of being a cynic where women are concerned , for he says such shameless things as these : '' Most women have a desire to dazzle and to devastate .

		It is the utter inability of the majority to do anything of the kind that gives such a feline viciousness to their morality . ''


Nance	PERSON	, however , is an exception , for she is as dazzling and devastating as the most romantic taste could wish her to be .

		Swashbuckling adventure has given place to modern comedy in Mr.
Justin Huntly McCarthy	PERSON	's '' Calling the Tune . ''


Wickliff Hersham	PERSON	, returning from
South America	LOCATION	to
England	LOCATION	after an absence of twenty years , has made up his mind to have a good time .

		He has the wherewithal , being possessed of a suspiciously-gotten fortune amassed in
Buenos Ayres	PERSON	.

		His thoughts turn toward a friend of his youth ,
Gregory Winbush	PERSON	by name , who had been his rival for the affections of a certain fair Gondoline , and had carried off the prize .

		He is discovered in his secluded suburban home , where he is engaged in the invention of a stabilizer for air-ships , secretly conducting his experiments within a mysterious shed of corrugated iron .

		The Gondoline of their youth has long since passed away , but a second
Gondoline	PERSON	, an exact replica of her mother , greets the surprised gaze of the returned wanderer .

		Upon her he promptly fixes his affections , devising for her a round of the gaieties for which she has been pining , and showering her with gifts .

		Then a young rival appears upon the scene , and it looks as if
Hersham	LOCATION	were to be discarded in his favor .

		But when he is unmasked as a secret agent of the German govern - ment , spying upon
Winbush	PERSON	's secret , he is ignomin - iously routed , and the fair Gondoline yields to her elderly wooer .

		Her essential girlishness and up-to - date slanginess on the one hand , and his imper - turbable self-confidence on the other , make the pursuit and the capture highly diverting .

		The climax is inimitable : '' ' Come ,
Gondoline	PERSON	, will you have a husband who is also a lover , pretty clothes , jewels , theatres , restaurants , travel , all kinds of good times .

		Think of the Minarets .

		Why , you can be the queen of Brindleaf , if you like .

		Will you marry me ? ' ''

		Gondoline denied him as fiercely as before . '' '

		No , no , no ! '

		she cried on a rising scream .

		1913 -RSB- 151 '' As she uttered the third ' no ' she rose from her chair and threw herself into
Wickliff	PERSON	's extended , inviting arms . '' '

		Oh ,
Wicky	PERSON	, ' she said , as she felt his clasp about her , ' do you really think we shall ever be happy together ? ' ''

		Wickliff answered cheerfully , caressing her : '' ' Oh , yes , I think we shall .

		I 'll see to that . ' ''

		Miss
Beatrice Grimshaw	PERSON	has annexed a new coun - try to the kingdom of romance , an achievement for which we should be duly grateful in these days when the jaded literary palate welcomes anything having the flavor of novelty .

		The island continent of
New Guinea	LOCATION	is her chosen scene , and she writes of it from first-hand knowledge and with an unusual power of vivid realism .

		Her former novel , `` When the Red Gods Call , '' was a work of almost brutal power that made an almost unpleasant impression ; its present successor , `` Guinea Gold , '' has no less force , but is softened and humanized in its interest , besides hav - ing a well-developed plot .

		The hero is a
Belfast	LOCATION	engineer , out to seek his fortune in the gold-field , and armed with a manuscript , accidentally fallen into his possession , giving directions for the location of a gold-bearing reef in the savage wilderness of the island interior .


George Scott	PERSON	takes two men into his confidence , and together they fit out an expedition , and are successful in their quest .

		The enterprise entails incredible hardships , and the struggle between man and nature has not often been described with such thrilling interest .

		The Papuan native , also , is made out of an ethnological specimen into a human being .

		An infinitely pathetic and alluring figure is that of
Charmian Ducane	PERSON	, more sinned against than sinning , whose life has been placed under a cloud by malice and treachery , whom
Scott	PERSON	rescues and loves , and who follows him into the wilderness to escape her persecutors , and whose death in the mining-camp turns his exultation to bitterness .

		The author is impelled to award her this fate out of con - sideration for a certain colorless
Janie	PERSON	, who is left awaiting
Scott	PERSON	in
Belfast	LOCATION	, and whose image in his mind Charmian completely displaces .

		After Char - mian 's death , we are told that
Scott	PERSON	goes back to Bel - fast with his gold and weds the forgiving
Janie	PERSON	, but we refuse to believe it .

		The playful savagery of the Papuans and the physical features of their island are impressed upon us in unforgettable descriptive pages , and the white derelicts who people these pages are given incisive individual characterization .

		The book is one in which boys will find their account as a marvellous story of adventure , and in which older readers will find enough else of deep human interest to reward them richly for their pains .

		A new story of the Scarlet Pimpernel , that ex - traordinary adventurer whom the
Baroness Orczy	PERSON	has created for the delectation of lovers of romance , will find a host of eagerly expectant readers .

		There seems to be no sort of a fix from which he can not extricate himself , and one is kept guessing how he will do it -LRB- with the comfortable assurance that he can not fail -RRB- until the end is reached .

		His exploit in `` El Dorado '' is the rescue of the dauphin from the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	, which is accomplished with neatness and despatch .

		The rescuer gets himself into the toils , and how he gets himself out of them provides material for a most exciting narrative .

		Even the hackneyed nature of the material does not prevent the author from contriving a new plot with consid - erable freshness of interest .

		The secondary interest is found in a love-story in which sentimentality -LRB- runs riot .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The poet - ^ e ' n tne Verv ver g e * naturalist ninety , has the great interpreter of ofSerignan .

		fa Q mysteries of insect life , whose `` Souvenirs Entomologiques '' are now first fairly getting themselves read , come into his own .

		His jubilee of three years ago was quickly followed by the long-deferred recognition of his merits as a writer , his books achieved a greater circulation in a few months than in all the preceding years , trans - lations began to appear in other languages , and now a devoted disciple has prepared a sympathetic and touching biography of the modest and gifted man who at last is hailed by the world as `` the insect 's Homer . ''

		In Dr.
C. V. Legros	PERSON	's `` Fabre , Poet of Science '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is presented a faithful account of that long life of poverty and struggle , and of passionate devotion to a beloved pursuit , that had so nearly ended without any adequate recogni - tion , from outside , of the noteworthy things accom - plished .

		In the nick of time the biographer has secured the cooperation of the aged naturalist in presenting to the public the vicissitudes of a labori - ous life of eager study , miserably-paid teaching , research pursued in the face of all but insuperable obstacles , and authorship engaged in with the scanti - est of encouragement from the book-buying public .

		The naturalist himself furnishes a short and char - acteristic preface , and Mr.
Bernard Miall	PERSON	translates the work into English .

		Admirable is the picture that the book gives of sturdy independence , disregard of conventionalities , scorn of worldly honors , genius for solitude , devotion to an ideal , and power of ` unre - mitting toil at an ill-paid task .

		The name of Jean -
Henri Fabre	PERSON	will stand high in the list of those whose compelling genius has defied adversity and glori - ously triumphed .

		In the richness of his sources of information the biographer has been fortunate .

		The naturalist 's '' Souvenirs '' and correspondence and other papers have been freely drawn upon , and per - sonal intercourse with the master has secured many additional facts of interest and helped to correct a number of inaccurate reports that had gained cur - rency .

		The spirit and style of the work are worthy of its subject .

		Even in translation its felicities of manner give delight , as where reference is made to the veteran entomologist 's junior admirers and friends , '' young people with warm hearts and smiling imaginations , overflowing with that
spring	DATE	- time sap of life which makes us so expansive and so 152 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	eager to know . ''

		A few easily avoidable Gallicisms , however , are encountered in Mr.
Miall	PERSON	's English , as '' sensible '' for '' sensitive , '' and such a construc - tion as '' Rembrandt ,
Teniers	PERSON	, nor Van Ostade never painted anything more picturesque ... '' In the last chapter there is some lack of correspondence between the numbered notes and the numbers in the text .

		A portrait from an apparently recent photo - graph helps to a better acquaintance with the extra - ordinary and pathetically heroic personality so well pictured by the biographer 's pen so well because to the author 's well-considered paragraphs there are added so many revealing passages of the great naturalist 's own writing .

		Some fears and many prejudices will disappear after a careful reading of `` The Jews of To-Day '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , translated from the German of Dr.
Arthur Ruppin	PERSON	by Miss
Margery Bentwich	PERSON	, and introduced to the English reader by Mr.
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	, Litt.D .

		Carefully written from the fullest obtainable knowl - edge , every aspect of the modern Jew in all countries finds sympathetic presentation , with well digested considerations of his value to the world and his due place in it , now and in the future .

		It appears that the single million of Jews in the world at the close of the
Thirty Years	ORGANIZATION	' War has now increased to some twelve millions , of whom two millions are in this country half of them in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Ruppin	PERSON	divides the race into four classes , the first and largest of which is untouched by modern culture and keeps itself as a nation apart ; the second holds a higher position econo - mically , interests itself somewhat in non-Jewish literature , and modifies slightly the old ritual ; the third includes the Jewish bourgeoisie in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, has a smaller birth rate , and keeps within the faith only in marriage and in occasional observance of ancient rites ; the fourth comprises rich and university-educated Jews the world over , who are no longer of the faith and are on the point of merging themselves with the prevailing elements of population by marriage and baptism .

		The num - bers of each class are roughly estimated , respect - ively , at six , three , two , and one million .

		One reads that '' In
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	anti-Semitism arose because of the great influx of immigrants who are used to a low standard of living , are content to work for a low wage and so undercut the wages and lower the standard of living of the native workman . ''

		Dr.
Ruppin	PERSON	says quite frankly : `` In social and public life the Jews are often charged with being presump - tuous and wanting in tact .

		This is very often the case in fact , but the reason is not to be found in their racial qualities but in the unparalleled rapidity of their social and economic advance , which naturally gives rise to this parvenu spirit . ''

		For the rest , it is said that the Jew in all ages has shown remarkable powers of assimilation with his neighbors , contrary to the general belief , and that for more than a century and a half has educated himself away from Jewry almost as rapidly as his bettering circumstances per - mitted his withdrawal from the Ghettoes of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		If numbers of his religionists and race rise far above the average in commerce , philosophy , and the arts , there are still greater numbers below the average ; so that there is no marked difference , intellectual or other , between them and their non-Jewish neighbors .

		And that the Jew is a valuable factor in civilization , and in his fuller development a valuable addition to any population , Dr.
Ruppin	PERSON	proves , we think , suc - cessfully , were these matters requiring proof .

		The mvtticai Miss
Evelvn Underbill	PERSON	, whose recent beginning of work on '' Mysticism '' is probably the Christianitv .

		most comprehensive modern study written from a sympathetic viewpoint , has followed this with another large book , '' The Mystic Way : A Psychological Study in Christian Origins '' -LRB- Dut - ton -RRB- .

		Here Miss Underbill is on much more debate - able ground than in her previous book ; for while the only question to be raised about the former was whether mystical consciousness really led into a new realm or whether it was a merely subjective state with no reference to objective reality , the present book involves an interpretation of Christianity radi - cally different from that of the sociologically-minded investigators who would explain all its early phases in terms of group struggles and of class antagonisms , and also from the modern liberal school who put a moralistic interpretation on the work of Jesus .

		Miss
Underbill	PERSON	's thesis is that Christianity represents in its primitive purity a new type of mysticism differ - ing from the Oriental , the
Neoplatonic	LOCATION	, and the Mahomedan .

		She quotes Professor
Leuba	PERSON	to the effect that the mystic of this dispensation is `` one of the most amazing and profound variations of which the human race has yet been witness . ''

		To make her thesis good ,
Miss Underbill	PERSON	has to show that Jesus himself ,
Paul	PERSON	, and the unknown author of the
Fourth Gospel	ORGANIZATION	were veritable mystics , and that their records are records of mystical experience which can be checked up against later and fuller records from more detailed and verifiable sources .

		Her task is necessarily one of conjecture and interpretation , and its success will depend very largely upon the dis - position which the Higher Critics are likely to make of some of her sources .

		Of course Miss Underbill takes the Higher Criticism into account , and fully accepts its findings as to the composition and ages of the sacred books ; but the skeptically-minded reader will feel , nevertheless , that she is too disposed to regard as historical the legends which fit the mystic character she confers upon Jesus .

		From her biblical survey , she turns to the early church and to the evidences of mysticism contained in the Catholic liturgy .

		In these it may be granted that the secrets of the '' Mystic Way '' are embalmed ; but it is the inevitable irony of mysticism itself that , to the reader who refused to see in this progress -LRB- granting a pro- gress from Jesus himself to the later mystics -RRB- anything objectively real , Miss Underbill could make no reply except the invitation to tread the
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 153 mystic way one 's self the very thing that the skeptic could not do .

		And it must not be over - looked that Professor
Leuba	PERSON	, whom Miss Underbill quotes in substantiation of the peculiar character of the Christian mystic , has himself recently analyzed those tendencies and laid it down that as soon as they show themselves in such forms as Miss Under - bill records they are no longer transcendental mys - teries but subject to the scientific analysis of the psychologist .

		And his own analysis of them leads him to find in them naught but projections of the believer 's needs .

		Wonders of the seashore .

		A nature-study book from so experi - enced a naturalist and writer as Dr.
Charles Wendell Townsend	PERSON	is sure to be well worth reading .

		`` Sand Dunes and Salt Marshes '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- represents the fruit of twenty years ' vacation study of the varied phenomena of the seashore as viewed on the beach and in the marshes of the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	coast at
Ipswich	LOCATION	.

		Both the habits of the shifting sands and the characteristics of the animal and plant life of the vicinity are closely observed by Dr.
Townsend	PERSON	, and his observations are recorded in a style attractive to general readers and by no means repellent to the specialist .

		Scientific names are relegated to the index , where they appear in parentheses after the more familiar unscientific designations .

		Illustrations , chiefly from the author 's photographs , are supplied to the number of ninety - four .

		The twelve chapters of the loook treat of the action of the sand under the impulse of wind and wave , tracks in the sand , plant life on the dunes , land birds of the seaside , swallow roosts and swallow migrations , water birds seen from the dunes , the harbor seal , salt marshes and their past and future , birds of the salt marshes , the horseshoe crab and other denizens of sand and mud , and bird genealogy .

		Striking and interesting are the instances given of rapid changes in seashore topography under the action of wind and wave .

		But if one goes a little further southward from
Ipswich	LOCATION	and observes the sport which the wind has with the sands of
Cape Cod	LOCATION	, the impression is even more memorable .

		A good story with an obvious moral is that of the Coffin farm , as told by Dr.
Townsend	PERSON	.

		Farmer Coffin , on his deathbed , bequeathed his estate to his sons , but bade them never cut off the wood toward the ocean .

		Disobedience was followed by the quick submerging of the fertile acres in wind-blown sand .

		As an example of the author 's careful note of all things occurring at the seaside , mention may be made of his solution of the mystery of grass balls , such as puzzled
Thoreau	PERSON	when he observed them on the borders of
Flint	LOCATION	's Pond in
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		He also takes pains to ascribe the sand-dune spider 's tracks to the male only , for the female abides at home .

		And the reptilian origin of birds he finds indicated in the quadrupedal movements of young herons before they have learned to fly , and in '' the extension of the so - called thumb or bastard wing in the pigeon and other birds as they approach their perch . ''

		The book abounds in similar instances of suggestive note and comment .

		Mr.
Amasa M. Eaton	PERSON	has brought Facts about together a wealth of information the tariff .

		e regarding the taritt in a small and readable volume which he calls `` Protection vs. Free Trade '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		It forms an earnest attempt to enlighten the American people regarding the gross impositions that have been practiced upon them under the name of `` protection . ''

		The author points out that free trade between the States of the
American Union	ORGANIZATION	and free trade in
Great Britain	LOCATION	make the doctrines of
Adam Smith	PERSON	and every other political economist of reputation a fact , and force upon their opponents the burden of proof to establish protection as anything more than a disproved theory espe - cially in the light of what it has done to the people of this country .

		He points out that `` free trade , '' wherever spoken of , does not mean the abolition of custom houses , but the raising of revenue from im - ports in accordance with the practice in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and elsewhere , in such a way as not to confer special privileges upon natives of the country whose imports are thus taxed ; the term is therefore synonymous with the phrase , `` tariff for revenue only . ''

		He points out the enormous cost of protective tariffs in comparison with other means of raising governmental revenue , conferring as they do upon their benefici - aries a power to tax the people equal to from seven to twenty times the amount received by government .

		He quotes the highest constitutional authority to prove that any bill before
Congress	ORGANIZATION	which contains protective features is introduced and passed in open conflict with the Constitution and in open violation of the congressman 's oath to support the organic law .

		Without resorting to statistics that might tend to confuse , he makes the point clear that any pretence of the need for `` protection '' passed years and years ago ; placing it as far back as
1812	DATE	, though there is abundant authority to show that many industries still `` protected '' were self-sustaining before the Revolutionary War .

		Generally speaking , he treats `` the American system '' with the profound contempt that it deserves from thinking men ; he denounces it as immoral , antiquated , outgrown , at odds with every idea of freedom , and the well-spring of inexpressible and inevitable corruption , and leaves its advocates on the defensive from the introduction to the close of his work .

		1 From the l n a volume of five hundred and ^ eminent fort y P a g es are gathered four hun - pubUdst .

		dred and twenty-five letters or selec - tions from letters written by or to the late
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	, and edited by his literary executor , Mr.
Arnold Haultain	PERSON	.

		Covering the years from
1846	DATE	to
1910	DATE	, they show us the distinguished scholar , author , journalist , and independent thinker , from his twenty-third year to within a week of his death .

		His earlier correspondence he himself deliberately 154 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	destroyed , as also most of that between the years
1846	DATE	and
1868	DATE	; but , as in the case of the Sibylline Books , what is now preserved will be all the more highly prized because of the loss of the rest .

		And perhaps we have fully as much as will be read and digested in these hurried twentieth-century days .


Goldwin Smith	ORGANIZATION	belonged to the nineteenth century , especially to its middle and latter part , as Mr.
Haultain	PERSON	remarks , though on some questions that closely concern us of to-day he expressed himself in no uncertain accents .

		Writing from
Toronto	LOCATION	to Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	in the
summer of 1902	DATE	, he bursts forth : '' Martem et
Cir	ORGANIZATION	censes how they are trying to befool the people with military excite - ment and shows !

		How great , one must sorrowfully add , has been their success !

		We have had `` a very painful revelation ... Things do not look well in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		They are getting more and more deeply entangled in
the Philippines	LOCATION	.

		This may , however , divert them from expansion southwards , to which the
Isthmian Canal	ORGANIZATION	is otherwise likely to be a lure . ''

		It is chiefly with English affairs that the letters deal , and Englishmen of note make up the majority of the correspondents .

		The careful editorship of the volume deserves more than a pass - ing word of commendation .

		In the table of contents the letters are arranged chronologically , each with name of writer , name of recipient , date of writing , and number of page on which it begins .

		Useful footnotes are supplied , and a full index of subjects and personal names completes the book .

		Four por - traits , showing
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	at different ages , are interspersed .

		These letters from his pen heighten one 's opinion already high of their writer 's vigor of thought and clearness of vision .

		Messrs.
Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	publish the volume , and it bears the title , ``
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	's Correspondence . ''

		Mr.
Alexander Irvine	PERSON	's power of vivid narration is known to all read - ers of his autobiographic volume , `` From the Bottom Up . ''

		A supplement to that appealing narrative is now offered in '' My Lady of the Chimney Corner '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , described in a prefatory note as `` the torn manuscript of the most beautiful life I ever knew , '' the life of the author 's mother .

		Very tenderly and touchingly he tells the love-story of his parents
Jamie Irvine	PERSON	and
Anna Gilmore	PERSON	.

		`` The Gilmores lived on a farm near
Crumlin	LOCATION	in
County Antrim	LOCATION	, '' and
Jamie	PERSON	was a jour - neyman shoemaker ; and , as he afterward expressed it , '' I know 'd frum th ' minute I clapped eyes on ` er that she was the finest wuman on God 's futstool ! ''

		The two were rich in nothing but love and children , of whom four died in childhood .

		Alexander was the ninth , born with a caul and so destined to have good luck .

		When times were especially hard and they seem rarely to have been anything else
Anna	PERSON	would help her husband at his work . ''

		There were things in cobbling she could do as well as
Jamie	PERSON	.

		Her defense of doing it in the early hours of the Sabbath was : ' Sure God has more important True love in
County Antrim	LOCATION	.

		work to do than sit up late to watch us mend the boots of the poor ; forby it 's better to haave y 're boots mended an ' go to church than to sit in th ' ashes on
Sunday	DATE	an ' swallow the smoke of bad turf . ' ''

		`` Aye , ''
Jamie	PERSON	would answer , `` it 's jist wondtherful what we can do if we haave th ' right kind ov a conscience ! ''

		The simple faith of the mother , her love for her dear ones , the author 's devotion to her , and all the homely details of their family and village life , are frankly narrated without even any changing of proper names , as the writer assures his readers .

		The boy 's call to become a preacher and missionary , his return to deliver a lec - ture on `` England in the Soudan `` in the only hall of his native village , his departure for
America	LOCATION	with the blessing of the mother he was never to see again much of this is at least partly known to those who have already interested themselves in Mr.
Irvine	LOCATION	.

		His closing account of his going back to Antrim after fifteen years , and what there befell him , forms a fitting conclusion to the little history .

		Stimulating Those of the cynics who are not too essays on life cynical will find a book to gloat and knowledge .

		over m Mr
William Arkwright	PERSON	's `` Knowledge and Life '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		Unlike most volumes of essays and sketches , it is not made up mainly of reprinted matter ; only two of the eighteen titles have previously appeared .

		The first and the last , `` The Tree of Knowledge '' and `` The Tree of Life , '' are really notable as well as immensely clever .

		One of the keenest , wittiest , wisest remarks of our decade is this : '' Again , as ' in prosperity of
summer	DATE	' the female green-flies , without male assistance , pro- duce an ephemeral offspring , so from a redundant curriculum do parthenogenetic writings make their appearance in greater numbers than those that are legitimately begotten .

		Wherefore , doubtless , each callow aspirant nowadays possesses droves of osten - tatious phrases , and is waiting for thoughts with which to fertilize them only as a rule he tires of waiting , and rushes into print . ''

		Seldom does a sci - entific analogy so perfectly point literary criticism .

		`` The Thief , '' a lampoon on old-time Calvinism , stabs a thing that perhaps is gasping its last breath , but which can not have too many murderers .

		The three stories told by an ant , though illustrating a rather worn method of satire , are nevertheless dis - tinctive and piquant .

		The biological pathos of the last story , told just before the nuptial flight and pre - destined death , gives the series artistic finish , sharpened , it must be said , with some emerystone from Shavian misogamy .

		In fact , Woman and the Church , two fairly old and fairly stable institutions , come in for repeated thrusts , `` The Bambino '' being one of the best ecclesiastical heresies . ''

		An Appre - ciation '' indicates Buddhistic sympathies .

		`` From an Old Diary '' convinces a reader already nearly persuaded that Mr.
Arkwright	PERSON	is a writer of much polish and skill , who has succeeded in waiting until some of his fine phrases have been fertilized by thought .

		Born in

Sept. 16	DATE	NEALE 'S FOR SEPTEMBER Besides the regular departments , The Fraternity of the Fields , which is intended to be the eyes and ears of him who may not be with
Nature	ORGANIZATION	in her many moods , conducted by an eminent writer ; The Stage , a department of brilliant , trenchant , fearless criticism of plays , actors , and dramatists , conducted by a distinguished critic ; Letters to the Editors , in which correspondents discuss among themselves topics of interest ; In
Motley	ORGANIZATION	, a department of wit and humor , not mere jokes , but pointedness , directed chiefly at persons in the limelight ; Editorial Comments , in which all sorts of subjects will be treated , now seriously , now lightly , yet always vigorously , fearlessly , and independently , besides these regular departments and the serials now running , the
September	DATE	number , among many interesting features , contains noteworthy contributions to general literature as follows : The Walls Of ConcameaU By
George K. Baker	PERSON	The first instalment of this novel , which will run serially for twelve months , is published in the
September	DATE	number .

		Broidered on the historical fabric of the struggle of the devoted Bretons who in
1489	DATE	held
Brittany	PERSON	against the French for the young
Duchess Anne	ORGANIZATION	, this story keeps the reader alert , with eyes wide and ears open , and the close , wild warfare of the
15th century	DATE	, with all its clash of arms and clank of mail , rings from the pages , and sweeps the reader on as with the resistless rush of the ocean .

		The editors of this magazine confidently affirm that
America	LOCATION	possesses no greater writer of fiction than
George K. Baker	PERSON	.

		Broken Lights By
Mowry Saben	PERSON	As an essayist Mr.
Saben	PERSON	is unexcelled by any American writer .

		He is to a degree
Arthur Symons	PERSON	,
Walter Page	PERSON	,
George Moore	PERSON	, and , perhaps ,
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	, Americanized , or , shall we say , cosmopolitanized .

		He first attracted attention by his essays that were published in the
Boston	LOCATION	Transcript .

		These were followed by such important books as `` The Spirit of Life '' and `` The Twilight of the Gods . ''

		The first of the essays assembled under the general title of `` Broken Lights '' is published in NEALE 'S MONTHLY for
September	DATE	and the others will follow serially .

		The titles of the various papers are : '' Some Modern Ways of Thinking , '' `` A Criticism of Some Modern Ways of Thinking , '' `` Puritanism , '' `` The Right to Freedom , '' `` Self-Realization , '' and `` Life Considered as a Fine Art . ''

		Brilla By
Anna M. Doling	PERSON	This unique and irresistible serial , the story of a lie , begins in NEALE 'S MONTHLY for
September	DATE	.

		A region yet unexplored in literature , the
Ozark Mountains	LOCATION	, forms a picturesque background for the figures that move through this striking American novel .

		Seldom is it the good fortune of a reader to find an absorbingly interesting story written at once so simply and so well yet so compellingly . ''

		Honest Graft '' By
Walter Neale	PERSON	The term `` honest graft '' seems to have been invented by
Tammany	ORGANIZATION	's millionaire statesman , former Senator
George Washington Plunkitt	PERSON	, who took the view that high public office may legitimately bring its incumbent more of this world 's riches than his mere salary .

		Mr.
Neale	PERSON	shows how productive were his seed of tares .

		The office of President of the
United States	LOCATION	enabled
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	to add enormously to his income as an author .


Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	began to contribute a series of articles to World 's Work with the
January	DATE	number of that magazine , and the series is still running .

		This magazine was edited by
Walter Hines	PERSON	Page until he qualified as Ambassador to
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and is published by the firm of which Ambassador Page is a member , and from which he still draws a salary , according to press reports .

		Thus the President of the
United States	LOCATION	is in a position of having appointed to the highest diplomatic post of the American people a man from whose firm he supposedly has been drawing large sums .

		Then , there are
William Jennings Bryan	PERSON	,
Champ Clark	PERSON	, Mr.
Neale	PERSON	shows how Plunkitt 's term `` honest graft '' has taken the place of
Cleveland	LOCATION	's dictum , '' a public office is a public trust , '' in the language of many of our public men .

		IntO the Sunset By
Edward S. Van Zile	PERSON	The first instalment of this novel was published in the
August	DATE	number of NEALE 'S MONTHLY .

		The story which is full of the stir of life , the clash of swords , the roll of the sea , and '' whisperings of love '' tells of the romantic career of the first Irishman to reach the New World .

		He came with
Columbus	LOCATION	, and so did another young man , and so did two girls .

		Mr.
Van Zile	PERSON	is the author of several successful novels , the most widely read of which , perhaps , is `` With Sword and Crucifix , '' which won for him a doctor 's degree in literature from
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Short fiction and various timely and interesting articles , besides the features enumerated above , will make NEALE 'S MONTHLY for
September	DATE	noteworthy among American magazines .

		At
$ 3.00	MONEY	a year ,
25 cents	MONEY	a number , NEALE 'S MONTHLY supplies a wealth of literature .

		Every number contains more than 100,000 words of text , superbly illustrated , and no number will contain less than 128 pages .

		In its mechanical appoint - ments no magazine in existence is its superior .

Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	'' are left .

		Of this first edition `` The
Saturday	DATE	Review , ''
London	LOCATION	, said : `` The binding and printing are perfect , recalling the best productions of
Colburn	PERSON	and Rivingtons at the beginning of the
last century	DATE	. ''

		Indeed , in all the annals of bookmaking the first edition of `` The Collected Works of
Ambrose Bierce	ORGANIZATION	'' has never been surpassed mechanically by any other publication .

		The paper , specially made for this first edition , is of the highest quality ; the type is
Caslon	PERSON	, new , pica , double-leaded ; the presswork is of the best .

		In every respect this edition is worthy the great writer whose life-work in literature it presents to the world .

		So great a bargain in books of pure literature has never been offered before .

		These 400 sets are exactly like the `` Autograph Edition , '' except they are not signed by the author , and they are bound in decorated cloth instead of in full morocco .

		They are a part of the first printing .

		No set of the `` Autograph Edition , '' bound from these sheets , has been sold at less than
$ 120	MONEY	, its price , and no set will ever be sold at less .

		There are , approximately , 100,000 words to the volume , or 1,200,000 words to the 12 volumes , the dimensions of which are about 6 inches wide , 9 inches long , and 2 inches thick , and average more than 400 pages each .

		The man does not live , from the humblest in rank to the most exalted , from the most illiterate to the most erudite , who would not read time and again every line that
Ambrose Bierce	PERSON	has written .

		Persons who wish to give as Christmas presents the magazine to one person and `` The Collected Works '' to another may enter their subscriptions accordingly , and both '' Neale 's Monthly '' and '' The Collected Works '' will be held by the publishers on request for Christmas delivery on all subscriptions entered and paid for now .

		It is the story of the struggle between the spiritual and the material in the life of an average American man an emotional drama of one who was very far from being a hero .

		But in the love of the woman he had misunderstood and rejected he finally found a tower of strength .

		The classified list of the coming season 's books , as made up from the announcements of Amer - ican publishing houses , and printed elsewhere in this issue , in accordance with our long-stand - ing custom , affords us the opportunity of mak - ing a random commentary upon the immediate literary outlook , selecting for mention a few of the titles of the most salient interest , although leaving many important categories untouched .

		As has been our custom heretofore , we devote this cursory view to works in the departments of history , biography , general literature , poetry , the drama , and fiction .

		The list is , if anything , of more than average interest , and many of its items are calculated to make the literary mouth water in anticipation of the prospective feast .

		In the historical section , a work of timely interest is `` The
United States	LOCATION	and
Mexico	LOCATION	, '' covering the period 1821-1848 in our rela - tions with the sister republic .

		The author is Mr.
George L. Rives	PERSON	, and the work fills two large volumes . ''

		The Americans in the
Philip	LOCATION	- pines , '' by Mr.
James A. Le Roy	PERSON	, in two vol - umes , will , we presume from its sponsors , be a contribution to the pernicious imperialistic pro- paganda . ''

		The Major Operations of the Na - vies in the War of American Independence , '' is by that greatest of authorities upon naval strategics , Admiral
A. T. Mahan	PERSON	.

		Professor
McMaster	PERSON	's `` History of the People of the United States '' will now , after more than a score of years , be completed by an eighth vol - ume , covering the decade just preceding the Civil War , thus coming into sharp competition with the early volumes of Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	. ''

		Chi - cago and the Old Northwest , '' by Mr.
Milo M. Quaife	PERSON	, is the work of one of the best-equipped students of our local annals .

		The concluding volume of Mr.
James Schouler	PERSON	's `` History of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
E. C. Wingfield	PERSON	-
Strat	PERSON	- ford 's `` History of English Patriotism , ''
Lord Milner	PERSON	's '' The Nation and the Empire , '' and
James Douglas	PERSON	's ``
New England	LOCATION	and
New France	LOCATION	, '' are other announcements of import - ance .

		In the category which covers biography , memoirs , and correspondence , there are two collections of letters that promise to be of sur - passing interest .

		It is something more than a 192 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	promise , because we have already been permit - ted to read some of the letters of
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	and
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	in the magazines .

		The
Moody	ORGANIZATION	volume will include the letters that have appeared in the last two issues of the '' Atlantic Monthly , '' and others , we hope .

		Those already printed are of such quality as to make imperative the demand for as complete a collection as can possibly be brought together .

		They take their place at once with the choicest epistolary treasures of our literature with the letters of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	and
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	to name the most charming ex - amples of this form of composition .

		The letters , speeches , and correspondence of
Carl Schurz	PERSON	, edited by Mr.
Frederic Bancroft	PERSON	, are to be published in six volumes .

		The reminiscences of the greatest of American sculptors ,
Augustus Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	, will appear in finely illustrated form .

		A life of
Lyman Trumbull	PERSON	, by the accomplished publicist , Mr.
Horace White	PERSON	, will fill a gap that has too long remained vacant in the record of our great statesmen .

		`` Fifty Years of My Life , '' by Mr.
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, while not exactly filling a gap , will doubtless be dear to his following for its hard-hitting and general breeziness . ''

		Fremont and '49 '' is a work which , from the pen of Mr.
Frederic Dellen	PERSON	- baugh , is sure to prove of both interest and value .

		`` The Everyday Life of Abraham Lin - coln , '' by
Francis Fisher Browne	PERSON	, the late editor of this journal , has for many years been one of the best of the Lincoln biographies , and the last months of the author 's life were spent upon a thorough revision of the work for publication this
fall	DATE	.

		A monument of painstaking industry and conscientious scholarship may be expected when Dr.
H. C. Chatfield-Taylor	PERSON	's life of Goldoni appears from the press .

		This work , upon which the author has been engaged ever since he published his life of Molidre , will pro- vide the first adequate account of Goldoni in the English language , and probably in any other .

		Other prominent works of biography are a life of Bulwer-Lytton , by the present
Earl	PERSON	of
Lytton	LOCATION	; a life of
Anthony Trollope	PERSON	, by Mr.
T. H. S. Escott	PERSON	; the memoirs of
Henry Labou	PERSON	- chere ;
Clara Louise Kellogg	PERSON	's '' Memoirs of a Prima Donna '' ; ``
Wagner	PERSON	as Man and Artist , '' by Mr.
Ernest Newman	PERSON	; and a volume on
Strindberg	LOCATION	, by Miss Lind-af-Hageby , the notorious Swedish anti-vivisectionist .

		The list of works of general literature , as distinguished from history and biography , does not seem to include many important titles .

		Perhaps the most attractive is the first com - plete English translation of `` Simplicius Sim - plicissimus , '' that extraordinary narrative of vagabond life during the period of the Thirty Years ' War .

		Mr.
Percy H. Boynton	PERSON	's `` Lon - don in English Literature '' is the result of many months spent in seeking out and identi - fying the haunts and shrines of famous English authors in
London	LOCATION	.

		A new volume by the venerable
John Burroughs	PERSON	is '' The Summit of the Years . ''

		We can not say what
Vernon Lee	PERSON	's '' A Tower of Mirrors '' will be like , but may be assured that it will be beautifully written and full of philosophical discernment .

		Mr.
H. W. Mabie	PERSON	's `` American Ideals : Character and Life '' will , we presume , give us his lectures delivered in
Japan	LOCATION	as a missionary of American culture . ''

		Half - Lengths , '' by
G. W. E. Rus	PERSON	- sell , is a title that seems to promise much genial entertainment .

		Books about the drama and the actual texts of plays are increasing in number every year , to correspond with the extraordinary revival of interest in this literary species .

		We note Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	's '' Shakespeare as a Play - wright , '' `` The Fools of Shakespeare , '' by Mr.
Frederic Warde	PERSON	; `` The Elizabethan Play - house , '' second series , by Mr.
W. J. Lawrence	PERSON	; `` Ten More Plays of Shakespeare , '' by Mr.
Stopford Brooke	PERSON	; ''
Beaumont	LOCATION	, the Dramatist , '' by Mr.
C. M. Gay	PERSON	ley ; as well as the Goldoni and
Strindberg	LOCATION	volumes previously mentioned .

		Mr.
Archibald Henderson	PERSON	will have a volume called `` European Dramatists , '' Mr.
Richard Burton	PERSON	one on `` The New American Drama , '' Lady
Gregory	PERSON	an account of `` Our Irish The - atre , '' Miss
Mary Caroline Crawford	PERSON	a volume entitled '' The Romance of the American The - atre , '' and Mr.
Charlton Andrews	PERSON	one entitled `` The Drama To-day . ''

		Among new dramatic works the following may be noted : '' The Tragedy of Pompey , '' by Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	; ``
Joseph	PERSON	and His Brethren , '' a pageant-play by Mr.
Louis N. Parker	PERSON	; and ''
Horace Walpole	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Gustave Simonson	PERSON	; translations in - clude
M. Hervieu	PERSON	's '' The Labyrinth , '' M. Pela - don 's '' Saint
Francis	PERSON	of
Assisi	LOCATION	, '' and new vol - umes of
Strindberg	LOCATION	and
Hauptmann	PERSON	.

		The mere titles of forthcoming books of verse do not convey much information , unless per - chance the authors are `` placed '' in our minds .

		A few that seem worth transcribing are these : '' Salt Water Ballads , '' by Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	; `` The
Wolf of Gubbio	LOCATION	, '' by Mrs.
Josephine Preston Peabody Marks	PERSON	; '' The Lonely Dancer , and Other Poems , '' by Mr.
Richard LeGallienne	PERSON	; `` The Collected Poems of Margaret Woods ''
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 193 `` Minions of the Moon , '' by Mr.
Madison Cawein	PERSON	; `` Merchants from Cathay , '' by Mr.
William Rose Benet	PERSON	; and `` Last Poems , '' by the late Mrs.
Dorr	PERSON	.

		Doubtless , the season will give us much new poetry as yet unheralded ; it is our usual experience to learn of the best work in this kind when it makes its actual appearance .

		The multitudinous array of forthcoming nov - els gives the most daring commentator pause , but , at the risk of seeming invidious , we will name the following fifteen as destined to stand somewhere near the forefront of the confirmed fiction reader 's attention : An unnamed novel , by Mr.
William De Morgan	PERSON	; `` The Dark Flower , '' by Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	; `` Bendish , a Study in Prodigality , '' by Mr.
Maurice Hew	PERSON	- lett ; `` Youth 's Encounter , '' by Mr.
Compton Mackenzie	PERSON	; '' The Honorable Senator Sage - Brush , '' by Mr.
Francis Lynde	PERSON	; `` The Great Adventure , '' by Mr.
Robert Herrick	PERSON	; `` West - ways , '' by Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	; `` The Business of Life , '' by Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	; `` The Happy Ship , '' by Mr.
Stephen French Whit	PERSON	- man ; '' The Will to Live , '' by
Miss M. P. Willcocks	PERSON	; '' After All , '' by Miss
Mary Chol	PERSON	- mondeley ; '' The Custom of the Country , '' by Mrs.
Edith Wharton	PERSON	; `` Van Cleve , '' by Mrs.
Mary S. Watts	PERSON	> and ''
Hagar	PERSON	, '' by Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	.

		One could get much of the cream of the season 's output by reading these novels , and perhaps fifteen is as large a number as anyone who cares for tranquillity of soul ought to read in a single season .

		SHELLEY ONCE MORE .

		There ought to be a critical Index Expurgator - ius , a list of subjects which , either because of their difficulty or because they have already been talked to rags , should forevermore be taboo to dis - cussion .

		The identity of the dedicatee and the dark lady of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets , Poe 's alleged debts and drunkenness , the marital infelicities of
Byron	PERSON	,
Shelley	PERSON	, and
Carlyle	PERSON	, are among the matters which should be thus set aside .

		To say the least , they have been frightfully overworked , and deserve a period of rest .

		But gossip is the foul familiar of Fame .

		Those who attain to the accolade of the latter must submit to the malignant eye , the leering laugh , the intruding finger of the former .

		There can be no canonization without the Devil 's Advocate .

		If people would only grant the possibility that in a question between a man of genius and an ordinary person , the man of genius may be right and the ordinary person wrong , there might be some use in infinite bio - graphical discussion .

		But judgment is usually given the other way .

		Mankind refuses to have its sun without spots , and it is more interested in the spots than in the light .

		In its own interest and for the sake of its debt to genius it ought to control this instinct of unwholesome curiosity .

		It ought to deal with erring great men as the sons of
Noah	PERSON	did wben they found their father lying drunk and exposed , walk backward and cover them with a mantle .

		Shelley is perhaps the most intensely interesting personality in literary history .

		He is the accom - plishment of the type , the realization of the idea of what the world has always meant by the word `` poet . ''

		Byron called him `` The Snake , '' and he had the fascination which that animal is fabled to possess without any of its sinister or repulsive char - acteristics .

		If grave men still feel his fascination , is it any wonder that the women with whom he was thrown could not resist it ?

		To speak plainly , women always and everywhere flung themselves at his head .

		He did not invite this bombardment , for he avoided society , and was a hermit and solitary .

		More charity is surely due him than for men who are not subject to such experiences .

		Yet his relations with women have damned him in the books of the good or the pretended good .

		During his lifetime he was ac - counted a fiend ; and when after many years the efforts of his friends and admirers lifted a little the pall of obloquy which covered his dead body , two strong hands drew it back the hands of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and
Mark Twain	PERSON	.

		Arnold 's opinion was the man of the world 's view , tolerant , slightly amused , but cuttingly severe ;
Mark Twain	PERSON	's might be called the backwoods opinion , and was less an opinion than a shower of mud .

		In those circumstances , it could hardly be expected that
Shelley	PERSON	's disciples should remain silent ; and accordingly Mr.
Henry S. Salt	PERSON	, in '' Shelley : Poet and Pioneer , '' comes to the rescue of his character .

		One regrets to meddle in the matter , or to retell in brief the so often told story of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's first marriage .

		But in mere fairness the thing seems unavoidable .

		Mr.
Salt	PERSON	makes it pretty evident that
Shelley	PERSON	was not in love with
Harriet Westbrook	PERSON	and did not want to marry her .

		She ran away from her home , and threw herself upon his protection .

		There were three things then that he could do .

		He might reject her , compromised and humiliated ; he might make her his mistress ; he might make her his wife .

		With splendid generosity , the boy -LRB- for he was nothing more -RRB- chose the last course , flying in the face of his father and all his worldly interests .

		From that issue sprang unnumbered woes .

		The boy-and-girl union was happy enough in the beginning , for
Harriet	PERSON	was attractive and
Shelley	PERSON	attentive .

		But the differences between them in training , temperament , and tastes were sure to de - velop sooner or later .

		Mr. Salt states , and evidence and probability point that way , that before there was any question of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's infidelity there had grown up a barrier between them .

		He claims that this was
Harriet	PERSON	's fault ; that her character hardened , and 194 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	that she rejected attempts at conciliation .

		Shelley had never believed in marriage , and his opinions on divorce were probably the same as those held by
Milton	LOCATION	,
George Meredith	PERSON	, and other great men , and which are pretty widely in vogue to-day .

		It may be said that this does not matter ; that neither the opinions of great men nor the votes of the multitude can determine a question of ethics .

		Practically , though , and in a social way , they do determine it .

		However ,
Shelley	PERSON	thought himself free to seek his happiness , and he left his unsympathetic wife and formed a free union with
Mary Godwin	PERSON	.

		Harriet retained her children , and was provided for mate - rially .

		It was to all intents a divorce , and no more reprehensible than thousands of such separations which are occurring every day .

		Two years later , however ,
Harriet	PERSON	, obeying a suicidal bent which had shown itself in early life , drowned herself in the Serpentine .

		If there were any irregularities in her life after the separation , she only followed
Shelley	PERSON	's precept and example .

		He never tried to exculpate himself by bringing charges against her , and his defenders would have done better to have remained silent also .

		What are we to say in the matter ?

		Compromise is always stupid , but it is generally reasonable .

		It seems to us that there is a good helping of blame for both parties ; but , considering their ages and tempta - tions , no cause for damnatory reprobation of either .

		Shelley 's future page was fair enough .

		In spite of his objections to marriage , he married
Mary	PERSON	as soon as he could , and there is not a shred of real evidence to show that he was unfaithful to her .

		The enthu - siasms and admirations expressed for other women in his poetry do not appear to have been translated into life .

		In regard to women , indeed , a poet is in hard case .

		Unless he puts his appreciation of their beauty and charm into verse he is apt not to become a poet at all ; and if he does , as
Shelley	PERSON	complained , people '' approximate him to the circle of a servant girl and her lover . ''

		A great artist may paint a gallery of portraits of fair women , his sitters ; may throw his whole soul into the depiction of their sen - suous or spiritual charms , yet he will not be accused of indiscriminate lovemaking .

		Really the world ought to accustom itself to a little hardness of heart in regard to the woes of women admired by poets .

		The women themselves are generally satisfied .

		Their vanity is flattered , and they get immortality , which is more than any other kind of men can give them .

		Contrary to received opinion ,
Shelley	PERSON	was less of a ladies ' man than a man 's man .

		His men friends ,
Hogg	PERSON	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	,
Peacock	LOCATION	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Medwin	LOCATION	, Tre - lawney , he grappled to his soul with hoops of steel .

		They never speak of him except as a miracle of gentleness , generosity , disinterestedness , wisdom , courage , and common-sense .

		From the least to the greatest they recognized in him a being superior to themselves .

		For an '' ineffectual angel , '' as Arnold called him ,
Shelley	PERSON	has been the most potent warrior of ideas in modern times .

		He is the pioneer of pioneers .

		There is hardly a phase of political reform or social agita - tion that has come up since his day which he did not anticipate ; and his ringing cry has been most effectual in urging the battle on .

		Religious tolera - tion , the union of workers , peaceful resistance to oppression , the improvement of woman 's position , the non-sacredness of property , the attack on privi - lege , and generally everything that makes for the rise of the poor and downtrodden , were forced into fiery propaganda by him .

		Of course he did not in most cases originate the ideas .

		They came to him by inheritance from
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	,
Rousseau	PERSON	, and the other prophets of the French Revolution , and from
Godwin	PERSON	at home ; but he brought them all to a focus , to burn in his eloquent verse and prose .

		Also , in the final analysis , there is the same fatal flaw of conduct as in
Tolstoi	LOCATION	's case .

		They are both aristo - crats pointing the way for the poor , but not exactly going that way themselves .

		That , in spite of all their generosities and unselfishness , they did not altogether divest themselves of the benefits of for - tune , was of course a counsel of common-sense .

		Both were totally unfitted to earn their own livings .

		Tolstoi is said to have made the worst boots in
Russia	LOCATION	, and if
Shelley	PERSON	had had to keep books he would have starved to death .

		They did not live in countries where , like
Buddha	LOCATION	, they could put away their princedoms and take up the begging bowl and depend upon disciples for support .

		But the fact that they remained aristocrats keeps them from being the real protagonists of the poor .

		Shelley was endowed with the metaphysical bent , and the myth-making instinct which goes with it .

		He was fairly well read in European philosophy .

		He knew
Hume	PERSON	, and had absorbed the parts of Plato that pleased him .

		He of course knew nothing of the dark pessimisms of the
East	LOCATION	, and his ignorance and temperament allowed him to accept the doctrines of the perfectibility of man and a future Golden Age .

		About the idea of personal immortality , the sole outlet for hope for man , his mind seems to have been to let .

		He rejected Christianity , and probably this dogma with it , and his mind dallied with a vague idea of pantheistic life .

		On the whole , his philosophy was a trifle shallow , as all optimism which is bounded by the expectations of this world must be .

		Mr. Salt challenges
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's verdict on
Shelley	PERSON	's poetry , and certainly he has reason as far as some of the critic 's dicta are concerned .


Essen	LOCATION	- tially , however , Arnold was right .

		The note of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's style is eloquence eloquence and a thin , aerial , haunting music , which is not superior to the rich complex tones of other English poets , but differ - ent .

		Whatever the finest or most magnificent rhet - oric , the most persuasive linking together of logic and English of the purest in exquisite modulation , whatever these things can do in poetry ,
Shelley	PERSON	has at command .

		He does not have at command that condensation of words which stamps coins and counters of expression for mankind .

		He does not have at command those verbal embodiments of
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 195 vision whose gleam and glamor lighten every corner of the mind .

		Vast tracts of his poetry are merely eloquent improvisations , and unless one is interested in the ideas they contain they are really unreadable .

		The lines on the '' Euganean Hills '' are among his best , but we read them as if we were wallowing through a mist . ''

		The Sensitive Plant '' is excellent , but place it by the side of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's '' Christabel '' and it fades and dims and dies into eclipse .

		Even at the last , when influenced by a study of
Keats	PERSON	, he did approximate to the rich , full-bodied English manner , he is still rhetorical .

		Compare the `` Ode to the West Wind , '' his masterpiece , with
Wordsworth	PERSON	's Lines to
Peele Castle	ORGANIZATION	.

		Shelley builds up his piece with an infinitely delicate logical architecture , em - bellishes it with beautiful rhetorical decoration , thrills it through with vibrating tones of music .

		Words - worth 's piece is plain in manner and monotonous in music ; but line after line of it goes home to the hearths and bosoms of mankind , and from its cen - tral heart leaps out the phrase , '' The light that never was on sea or land , '' which expresses in an instant all that
Shelley	PERSON	was trying to say all his life .

		To adapt a Johnsonian simile ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	delivers the oracle , while
Shelley	PERSON	only shows us the
Sibyl	ORGANIZATION	's graceful gesticulations and illuminated face .

		The gifts that
Shelley	PERSON	did possess , his fascinat - ing personality , his political prevision , his profusion of ideas , his persuasive eloquence , his considerable creative power , above all , his rare and original music , are sufficient to make him one of the gods of literature .

		But weight and magic of words to any appreciable extent he did not have , and they are the central jewels in the poet 's carcanet .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A QUESTION FOR MANUSCRIPT-COLLECTORS , and one that they will probably never answer in entire agreement with one another , is this : Where is the original manuscript of
Lincoln	LOCATION	's
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address ?

		This matter recently formed the subject of a para - graph in these columns , and now it comes up again in the
Boston	LOCATION	'' Transcript , '' in an article by Mr.
George H. Sargent	PERSON	on '' Adventures of Celebrated Manuscripts . ''

		He says : `` Unfortunately it is not permitted to mention the name of the owner in
Boston	LOCATION	of the original manuscript of Lincoln 's im - mortal
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address .

		It is reposing in one of the safe deposit vaults in the Ames Building .

		This manuscript was written by Lincoln on the train which carried the presidential party to
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		It is on small sheets of paper , in the clear , neat hand of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, who gave it to
Edward Everett	PERSON	, the orator of the day .

		Together with
Everett	PERSON	's long oration , which nearly everybody has forgotten , and which no schoolboy ever recited , the manuscripts were sold at the Sanitary Fair for the benefit of the soldiers .

		From the purchaser they passed by inheritance into the hands of the present possessor . ''

		But General
James Grant Wilson	PERSON	, who knew
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	well and was much with him about the time of the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	address , and who has made a careful study of the subject , has recently -LRB- see the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times '' of
June 29	DATE	-RRB- given his account of the five copies of the speech which he says are known to have been written out by
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	himself ; and this is what he has to say , if he is correctly reported , concerning the manuscript referred to above : '' The copy used by the fair -LSB- the
Maryland	LOCATION	Soldiers ' and Sailors ' Fair -RSB- ranks as the fourth , and the fifth was written in the same year -LSB-
1864	DATE	-RSB- for
Edward Everett	PERSON	, who wanted to have it bound with the manuscript of his own oration at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	and the President 's letter to him of
Nov. 20 , 1863	DATE	, to be sold at the
New York	LOCATION	Metropolitan Fair for the benefit of the
United States Sanitary Commission	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In addition to the two copies furnished for the fairs named in the foregoing , a copy appears to have been given to each of the President 's secretaries ,
Nicolay	PERSON	and Hay , and one to
George Bancroft	PERSON	.

		The Nicolay copy ,
General Wilson	ORGANIZATION	tells us , was afterward lost or stolen , and has never been heard of since , which is the more to be regretted as it seems to have been the very first draft of the famous speech .

		But the whole affair is so involved in uncertainty and dispute that it would be rash to make any positive assertions as to any of its details .

		THE UNPROTECTED BOOK-TITLE might seem to have a grievance in that it can hope for no such legal safeguard against violation and abuse as can the more fortunate trade-mark and trade-name . ''

		Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' may lawfully be affixed as a title to any piece of writing by any scribbler , but woe betide the man who offers for sale as a ''
Kodak	ORGANIZATION	'' a camera not made by the
Eastman Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The makers of a well-known baking powder estimate the value of the word Royal in their business at
eight million dollars	MONEY	, and the name '' Coca-Cola '' is appraised at five million .

		Surely , then , there is commercial value in such a name as `` Trilby , '' or '' Queed , '' and why should not the inventors of these catching titles be protected in their right to use them ?

		A writer in the
August	DATE	issue of `` The Bulletin of the Authors ' League of
America	LOCATION	'' considers at some length this question of `` the protection of titles , '' and cites a number of illustrative cases at law ; and although the utmost that can be gained from copy - right is security in the right '' to print a set of intel - lectual ideas or modes of thinking communicated in a set of words or sentences or modes of expression , '' there still remains in certain cases the possibility of protection under `` the law of Unfair Competition by reason of a probable deception of the public , with the incidental unjust appropriation of the fruits of his own labor by others . ''

		Also , as in the case of the ``
Nick Carter	PERSON	'' series of blood-curdlers , a non-descriptive and commercially valuable name may be registered , just as the `` Porosknit '' brand of underwear has its name registered .

		And , finally , where neither regis - 196 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	tration nor copyright avails to secure the author in the enjoyment of the fruits of his invention and fancy , he may appeal to the broad general powers of a court of equity to prevent the deception and tricking of the public by the offering of goods for sale under false pretenses , and the consequent unjust diminution of his own legitimate gains .

		So perhaps , after all , as things go in this imperfect world , the author is fairly well protected in his right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .

		A BOOK-BUYER 'S COMPLAINT , even though it is true that all the world turns with aversion from the man with a grievance , may sometimes , if genially worded , serve to give a welcome hint to those engaged in the manufacture and sale of reading matter .

		Mr.
John L. Hervey	PERSON	contributes to the
September	DATE	``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' a humorous-querulous dis - quisition entitled '' The Tribulations of an Amateur Book-Buyer , '' which may be read as a sort of sup - plement to Mr.
George P. Brett	PERSON	's '' Book-Publishing and its Present Tendencies '' in the
April	DATE	number of the same magazine .

		Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	's tribulations , he says , `` have arisen chiefly from two causes : the question of price , and the question of storage . ''

		Serious books cost more than they ought to , and books of whatever kind take up too much room to meet the wishes of a book-buyer of moderate means and living in a house of moderate size .


India	LOCATION	paper and flexible bindings are doing some - thing to solve the problem of storage , and the cheap and excellent reprint is helping to ease the strain on the purse .

		Nevertheless the new copyrighted serious work is offered at a price often prohibitive to the ordinary purchaser , who , if he is wise , bides his time till the book passes into the '' remainder '' class or is reissued in less expensive form , and then he buys it at perhaps one-half its original price .

		Still an outsider is tempted to query whether it would not have been good business to issue the book at a lower price in the beginning .

		A book sales - man quoted by Mr.
Hervey	PERSON	says in regard to a work of this kind : `` I sold quite a number of sets of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's ' My Life ' at
eight dollars	MONEY	, for there was wide interest in it ; but I could have sold three times as many , I am certain , at five dollars . ''

		A book-buyer of limited means but unlimited desires may well resent or at least regret a practice by which the publisher skims the cream of his wealthy patronage before appealing with more reasonable prices to the larger and less opulent public .

		It is like being asked at a banquet to wait and eat at the second table .

		But possibly one ought to be thankful if there is a second table spread at all , and one is not sent home fasting .

		AN EMBARRASSING GIFT , like the baby elephant that a facetious friend made
Mark Twain	PERSON	believe he was to be encumbered with at
Stormfield	LOCATION	, is often many times worse than no gift at all .

		The announce - ment that the little town of
Ashfield	LOCATION	in
Western Massachusetts	LOCATION	a town once famous for its
summer	DATE	colony of learning and culture , and for its annual ''
Ashfield	LOCATION	dinner '' is to be presented with a thirty-thousand-dollar public library by a filially affectionate native of the place , Mr.
M. M. Belding	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	, prompts the query whether a little farming community of less than a thousand inhab - itants , barely making its rock-ribbed acres yield it a livelihood , will thoroughly enjoy the prospect of maintaining the splendid institution whose marble walls , bronze doors , pedestal lamps , and other lux - urious appurtenances , will present an appearance so strikingly at variance with their simple rural environ - ment .

		Already the yearly tax-bill is a nightmare to the
Ashfield	LOCATION	farmer .

		What , then , will be his frame of mind when the expense of this library 's mainte - nance is added to the town 's burden ?

		But it may be that this anxious inquiry is premature .

		Perhaps Mr.
Belding	PERSON	is planning to add a handsome endow - ment fund to his generous benefaction , and to be in some degree to
Ashfield	LOCATION	what the late
H. H. Rogers	PERSON	was to his native
Fairhaven	LOCATION	.

		Therefore we will not borrow trouble , but rather take pleasure in picturing to ourselves the fine structure that already has taken shape in the designs of the
Samuel M. Green	PERSON	Com - pany , of
Springfield	LOCATION	, and that is to be erected by
Fred T. Ley & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of the same city .

		A capacity for fourteen thousand volumes is contemplated , and all the rooms are to be on the ground floor .

		Indeed there is to be but one story to the building , which will be fifty-three by forty-one feet in dimensions , fire-proof in construction , and with walls of marble from the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	quarries at
Gouverneur	LOCATION	,
N. Y. Furnace	ORGANIZATION	heat and illumination by a special gas-plant , with other items of modern equipment , are in the plans .

		The
Belding Public Library	ORGANIZATION	will typify , and more than typify , the progressive spirit of
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts in respect to free libraries for all the people .

		THE LIBRARY AS CLUB-HOUSE often serves , espe - cially if it has an assembly room or conversation room attached , to draw young people , and older ones too , who otherwise might turn their steps toward resorts of a less unobjectionable character .

		An acquaintance of ours is fond of dilating on the superior attractions of the light and cheerful though simply-furnished library reading-room to the luxuriously-appointed lounging-room of his club , and also on the greater profit he derives from fre - quenting the one rather than the other .

		Mr.
Richard Lloyd Jones	PERSON	, editor of the `` Wisconsin State Journal , '' describes in the ''
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin , '' his discovery of a wonderful little public library in the Canadian mining town of
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	, far away in the great
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, and relates what the librarian , who had virtually created that library , had succeeded in making of it .

		There were in
Nelson	LOCATION	no dance-halls , no gambling joints , no hang-outs of any kind except the library , with its assembly-room , billiard tables in the basement , card tables and checker boards , and other provisions for harmless and well-ordered recreation .

		Of the '' rather frail but pretty little lady of about thirty ''
1913	DATE	-RSB- 197 who had thus made Nelson so agreeably different from the typical western mining town , Mr.
Lloyd Jones	PERSON	has considerable to say in admiring praise . ''

		More than a hundred miles away from the main line of any railroad , lost in the canyons of
Kootenay	LOCATION	, she had made a camp a city , she had made a little mining municipality the pride of a crown , and the crown 's guests had been taken off the main line of their travel and through more than a hundred miles of matchless scenery to behold , not what nature had done , but what a little English girl , an amateur librarian , had done ... To my notion that little lady was a LIBRARIAN . ''

		Not only did she admirably fill her place , but she had actually created the place before she proceeded to fill it .

		AN IDEAL GRADUATE SCHOOL for those who love learning for its own sake , and to whom vocational training and bread-and-butter studies are abhorrent in the superlative degree , is about to open its doors at
Princeton	LOCATION	to a select company of one hundred picked students and the requisite number of care - fully-selected instructors a veritable aristocracy of brains .

		Richly endowed and generous in its provis - ion of free scholarships , it ought to be able to steer clear of the peril of becoming an aristocracy less estimable in character a peril dreaded by Presi - dent
Wilson	PERSON	when the plan of the school , with its somewhat sequestered location , was under discussion three years ago .

		Here the poor but gifted student , unable perhaps to gratify a cherished longing for a course at
Leipzig	LOCATION	or
Athens	LOCATION	, at
Paris	LOCATION	or
Rome	LOCATION	, ought to find himself moved with somewhat the same feel - ing that prompted Erasmus to exclaim , when he had made his way to
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in despair of accomplishing the longer journey to
Italy	LOCATION	: `` I have found in Oxford so much polish and learning that now I hardly care about going to
Italy	LOCATION	at all , save for the sake of hav - ing been there .

		When I listen to my friend
Colet	PERSON	, it seems like listening to Plato himself .

		Who does not wonder at the wide range of
Grocyn	ORGANIZATION	's knowl - edge ?

		What can be more searching , deep , and refined than the judgment of Linacre ?

		When did
Nature	ORGANIZATION	mould a temper more gentle , endearing , and happy than the temper of Thomas More ? ''

		That the faculty of this new school , the most noteworthy of its kind that our country has yet seen , will include men of the stamp of
Colet	ORGANIZATION	,
Grocyn	LOCATION	,
Linacre	PERSON	, and
Thomas More	PERSON	, it would be rash to predict ; but it is said that the whole academic world has been searched for teachers of the desired mental equipment and ability ... AN EDITORIAL SALUTATORY of unusual interest appears in the current issue of `` The Century Magazine , '' marking the entrance of Mr.
Robert Sterling Yard	PERSON	upon his duties as head of the periodical founded forty-three years ago under the name of '' Scribner 's Monthly . ''

		Dr.
J. G. Holland	PERSON	,
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	, and Mr.
Robert Underwood Johnson	PERSON	have successively filled the chair that now receives Mr.
Yard	PERSON	as its fourth occupant .

		Appro - priately and gracefully the new editor gives a backward glance and pays a word of tribute to his predecessors before turning his gaze toward the future now beckoning him to the achievement of still greater things than any attained to by those earlier directors of the magazine 's fortunes .

		After announcing a determination to maintain a `` fair , free , unbiased spirit of investigation , '' and '' to enlist the services of able authorities in every cause , and to present each justly from its own point of view , '' the new editor hopefully continues : `` As for the rest , we shall conserve the best that .

		THE CENTURY has stood for in the past .

		We shall offer a larger proportion of fiction than formerly , and shall bring it as near to truth , and make it as interpretative of life , as conditions allow .

		We shall maintain illus - tration at the highest point modern method will permit .

		We shall cultivate history and poetry and the essay .

		We shall explore conditions at home and abroad .

		We shall make this magazine , fear - lessly and in the white light of to-day , as nearly the magazine of the century as courage and devotion and eyes that see and minds that shrink not can do . ''

		In a word , the aim is to be the highest pos - sible ; and what more could one ask ?

		A WEAKNESS OF THE PRIZE NOVEL , as of the prize poem , the prize essay , or almost any other piece of literary work performed under the stimulus of a hoped-for reward in cold cash , is indicated in some of the communications from would-be prize - winners to
Messrs. Reilly & Britton	ORGANIZATION	, the
Chicago	LOCATION	publishers who lately offered ten thousand dollars for the best novel submitted within a given time .

		`` I will do my very best in writing one , '' hopefully / promises one contestant ; '' I am only a young widow and would love to win a prize . ''

		`` I never written an article for A Contest in my life , '' says another , '' But I will try any thing once , Being A brick mason , I have some pretty good dope , scattered along Twenty-five years experience , which , if I can correll into proper shape , might be readable . ''

		Writers , both professional and amateur , are human , and it is only natural that they should , like the above-named young widow , `` love to win a prize '' even more than they love the labor that is to enable them to win it .

		The image of the honest brick-mason , laboriously building his story , brick upon brick , in the fond hope of securing by the prowess of his trowel the ten thousand-dollar reward , is amusing , even pathetic , and richly significant in its illustration of the way real literature is not produced .

		THE LITERARY DIVERSIONS OF A RETIRED DIPLO - MAT , with such a record of arduous public service as stands to the credit of
Lord Cromer	ORGANIZATION	, might not be expected to give evidence of so wide and intimate acquaintance with the classics as is made manifest both by his book of '' Paraphrases and Translations from the Greek '' and by his contribution to the cur - rent `` Edinburgh Review '' on the kindred subject of `` Translation and Paraphrase . ''

		As an illustration 198 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	of the familiarity with polite literature evinced by him who has had so much to do with the making of modern
Egypt	LOCATION	, it may be interesting to observe that in the last-named production he quotes from or refers to a score or more of the old authors and a number of the moderns , including Homer ,

		A PROPOSED LATIN-AMERICAN LIBRARY is among the things talked about and planned in con - nection with the projected `` tallest ever '' building of the
Pan-American States Association	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	.

		To open the building for Pan-American purposes simultaneously with the opening of the Pan-Amer - ican Exposition at
San Francisco	LOCATION	is now the hope and desire of the architects of the grandiose scheme .

		Nine hundred and one feet -LRB- why not a thousand and one , with a statue of Scheherazade to cap the topmost pinnacle ? -RRB-

		the structure , if it should be built , is to rise toward heaven , or a good hundred and fifty feet higher than Mr.
Wool	PERSON	worth 's present record-breaker .

		One floor of the mammoth edifice is to be used for club purposes and to have a library `` containing information regarding anything and everything per - taining to the commerce and people of all the
Latin	LOCATION	- American republics , and the floor above that will be set aside for similar purposes , but to contain statistics of American affairs and reports of
Chambers of Commerce	ORGANIZATION	such as might be of use to business men . ''

		So runs the published description of the library part of this ambitious enterprise .

		If an upper floor or floors should be chosen for the library , it would have the distinction of raising literature to a higher level than has hitherto been attained .

		THE BOOK-COLLECTOR 'S FRIEND was what
Bernard Quaritch	PERSON	, who died at
Brighton	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	,
August 27	DATE	, proved himself to be to the many whom he so intelligently and capably aided in the acquisition of rare works of literature , precious prints , and price - less manuscripts .

		Son of the still better-known book - dealer of the same name , the younger Quaritch followed worthily in his father 's steps and was inde - fatigable in his quest of whatever seemed most desir - able in his department of the book-trade .

		It was in the course of a business visit to this country that he contracted the disease of which he died .

		He was present at the Hoe sale in
New York	LOCATION	last
January	DATE	, and secured a number of valuable works .

		The fame of his father for letting no expense deter him from obtaining whatever literary treasure he chose to be - come the possessor of would probably have been equalled by that of the son , had the latter 's life been spared .

		Many important works , moreover , bore the imprint of the house , which acted as agent for the publications of the British Museum and the
Society of Antiquities	ORGANIZATION	.

		A NEW COURSE IN LIBRARY SCIENCE is announced by the
Wisconsin Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, whose cur - rent `` Bulletin '' briefly explains the nature of the course and refers for further information to the `` detailed statement '' which is sent upon application .

		The course is given '' in connection with work at
the University of Wisconsin	ORGANIZATION	, with which the library school is affiliated . ''

		We read further : `` There is an evident demand for workers capable of devel - oping the sociological phases of the library .

		The establishment and growth of legislative , municipal , philanthropic , and other social science libraries is being seriously hampered by dearth of well-equipped workers .

		The
Wisconsin	LOCATION	library commission , there - fore , gains courage to announce a library course of an untried nature from the fact that the work which it seeks to do sadly needs doing , while nobody else seems willing to do it . ''

		Knowledge of a special subject , rather than mastery of library technique as a whole , seems to be the keynote to the new course , which should appeal to many who instinctively abhor the mere drudgery of library management .

		This promises to be a notable development in the speciali - zation that has already well begun in the broad domain of library science .

		... PARCEL-POST RATES FOR BOOKS ought soon to be granted if earnestness of demand from those whose petition should be heard is to count for anything .

		More than one hundred librarians from all parts of the country are said to have written to Represent - ative
David J. Lewis	PERSON	of
Maryland	LOCATION	in approval of his bill enacting the desired reform , and similar letters are being sent directly to the post-office department .

		Among librarians urgent and active in the matter are those of the

		UNANIMITY IN LITERARY CRITICISM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I wish I could share the optimism of my good friend - Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	, as to the unanimity of independent criticism , or the independence of unanimous criticism , While I would certainly agree that out of one hundred and fifty critics , one hundred and forty ought to accord high praise to his work , and I should be sorry for the temperament or starved condition of the other ten , nevertheless , in the interest of the truth , 1 !

		feel called upon to question his statement that '' these one hundred and tifty minds were working sincerely and intelligently . ''

		All publishers send out , as a means of advertising , a printed slip giving a roseate-hued account of each book
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 199 which they publish .

		It is written by the literary ad - viser or the publicity-man .

		These ready-made '' book - notices '' accompany the books when they are handed to the literary editors of the papers and magazines .

		Over - whelmed with the torrent of new publications which must be reviewed , the literary editor , in hundreds of cases , seizes upon the help thus afforded and prints the notice either in extenso or with certain modifications .

		Every publisher knows that there is a remarkable same - ness in the wording of criticisms .

		This is vividly called to his attention when , wishing to take off the snapper at the end of the whip to use in his advertisements , there are comparatively few that he can use , because he him - self has furnished the very stimulus desirable to apply to the languid book-buyer , who may be imagined as hesitating whether to buy a new automobile or a vol - ume of poems , let us say .

		This accusation is not quite so severe as might be supposed , because the bard-worked critic is not wholly unscrupulous : he certainly glances at the separate books making the never-ending tide ; he is sincerely desirous of knowing what is coming along ; and by practice and alertness often a glance will tell him if the book be good or bad .

		A butter-taster does not have to eat a whole tub of butter to decide whether the commodity is rancid or not , or whether it is oleomargarine .

		But there is no question at all that the larger part of newspaper criticism is not worthy of the name , as far as intelligent , original , canonical weighing of literature is concerned .

		I think all publishers and most authors , who look over the '' press-notices '' of their books , will agree with me that this is so .

		The true frame of mind for an author is to be immune to the stings of adverse criticism as well as to the poison of flattery : to regard his own work as wholly imper - sonal , and if errors of fact or slovenliness of style be pointed out , to accept the animadversion gratefully and correct them in the next edition , and , if a chorus of praise ascend , to remain humble and not feel undue exhilaration .

		MR.
ALFRED NOYES	PERSON	'S POETRY .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In reading THE DIAL of
August 16	DATE	, 1 was especially interested in Mr.
William Morton Payne	PERSON	's admirable review of Mr.
Alfred Noyes	PERSON	's '' Tales of the Mermaid Tavern . ''

		That a conservative , thoughtful critic of the high standing of Mr.
Payne	PERSON	should laud Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	so enthusiastically is but another proof that
Noyes	PERSON	is a major poet .

		1 feel compelled , however , to take issue with Mr.
Payne	PERSON	when he says : '' We do not find in him -LSB-
Noyes	PERSON	-RSB- the perfect finish of Tennysonian art , and
Tennyson	PERSON	is perhaps the only one of the great Victorians whom his performance does not challenge . ''

		I am afraid Mr.
Payne	PERSON	has here fallen into the common error of conclud - ing that since Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	is a very prolific poet he is therefore a careless or bungling craftsman .

		If Mr.
Payne	PERSON	were asked to be more specific in his statement , I suppose he would say that
Noyes	PERSON	uses too many irregular lines , for instance , iambic lines in which trochees or anapoests occur , and that he is too prone to let imperfect rhymes creep into his work .

		Of course anybody familiar with Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	's poetry will grant that he is pretty free in his use of irregularities ; but I have yet to find him using an irregular line which does not either relieve mechanical monotony or produce some particular effect which he seeks .

		Furthermore , I challenge any critic to find in his work a dozen harsh or limping lines .

		As regards Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	's carelessness with rhymes , it must be admitted that imperfect rhymes are by no means uncommon in his pages .

		But what about the rhymes of the impeccable Tennyson himself ?

		Were it not for such '' accidentals '' as '' love-prove , '' '' fear - bear , '' '' boast-lost , '' '' now-low , '' '' curse-horse , '' `` Christ-mist , '' `` words-chords , '' and a score of others ,
Tennyson	PERSON	's `` In Memoriam '' would be an intolerably wearisome and mechanical poem .

		Imperfect rhymes are as essential to good poetry as occasional sharps and flats are to good music .

		Mr.
Noyes	PERSON	may not be quite so finished an artist as
Tennyson	LOCATION	, but he certainly approaches even
Tennyson	PERSON	in art .

		A bard capable of the sustained grandeur of `` Drake , '' the intricate melody of `` The Barrel-Organ , '' the glorious and unfailing onomatopoeia of ''
Flos Mercatorum	PERSON	, '' and the enchanting loveliness of `` Oxford Re-visited , '' is , to say the least , a technician of the first order -

		`` PROGRAMME '' AND `` PROGRUM . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I see that in your latest issue you continue your war on the movement to improve English spelling .

		Will you kindly allow me space in your valuable journal to offer a few suggestions ?

		Are you sure it is '' carelessness '' that leads the reformers to make their recommendations ?

		Is it not rather a desire to be careful , orderly , and logical , to profit by the maxim that `` lazy folks take the most pains '' by removing some of the painful consequences of the laziness of our ancestors ?

		The personal char - acter of the reformers would seem to favor the latter assumption .

		The great strength of the reform move - ment lies in the fact that it has drawn to its banners so many of our scholars , than whom no class of citizens are more distinguished for disinterested and painstaking effort .

		It has also appealed to a large number of our best political and commercial leaders .

		It has even found advocates among the poets , the class to whom one might suppose the shock of novelty would be least tolerable .


Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	was on the
Simpli	PERSON	- fied
Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	, and
Walter Savage Landor	PERSON	was a precursor of it .

		Is there any artistic advantage in con - fusing the beautiful with the merely familiar ?

		Is there any aesthetic advantage in the conventional spelling of such words as '' through , '' '' rough , '' '' furlough , '' `` phthisic , '' `` phlegm , '' `` ptarmigan , '' and a thousand others ?

		There is real difficulty in the spelling '' program '' and the pronunciation `` progrum . ''

		But is not the diffi - culty due to the spelling-books of many generations , which have taught us that English spelling and English pronunciation need not have any striking relation to each other ?

		Is not the spelling '' program '' at worst a case where the difficulty has not been wholly removed , a mere and partial exception to the rule that the reformers are trying and , to judge by the papers , successfully trying to introduce a truer agreement between the written and the spoken language ?

		A GREATLY-GIFTED NATURALIST .

		* Brilliantly-gifted son of an illustrious father ,
Alexander Agassiz	PERSON	is less known to the world at large because instead of being a teacher and a popularizer of science , as was
Louis Agassiz	PERSON	, he chose to devote himself to the rigors of research .

		Long ago it was declared by the naturalist ,
Jeffries Wyman	PERSON	, who died in
1874	DATE	, that the younger
Agassiz	PERSON	had already done more for the advancement of pure science than had his famous father .

		If that was true nearly forty years before the death of him to whom the assertion referred , how much more emphatically true it must have become when he ceased his labors in
1910	DATE	, after a long life of unflagging devotion to his chosen studies !

		An adequate conception of the fulness and richness of that life of varied industry in the large domain of natural science , and of remark - able achievement also outside its limits , is what comparatively few , even of those who had some acquaintance with
Alexander Agassiz	PERSON	, have ever had the opportunity or taken the trouble to gain .

		But in the volume now prepared by his son , Mr.
George R. Agassiz	PERSON	, and entitled '' Letters and Recollections of
Alexander Agassiz	PERSON	, with a Sketch of his Life and Work , '' the man is pre - sented to the public in some completeness of view , with a more than merely filial sympathy with the subject of the work , and in a manner likely to engage the interest of a wide circle of readers .

		The nature and difficulties of the task so satisfactorily accomplished by the biographer are thus hinted at in his introductory paragraph : '' Any one who attempts to present a faithful impres - sion of
Alexander Agassiz	PERSON	's life is confronted with un - usual difficulties , for his versatile and restless energy covered a very extraordinarily wide field , and his per - sonality was so large that we are hampered in our view of him by our own limitations .

		The morphologist con - siders his earlier work the most important ; the geolo - gist , that his reputation rests chiefly on his extensive investigations of coral reefs ; the zoologist remembers his vast collections of marine life gathered in a dozen extended voyages widely scattered over the surface of the globe ; and to still others he appears as the creator of a vast museum and one of the greatest benefactors of the oldest university in
America	LOCATION	; while those who delve among ancient civilizations and primitive races might well be surprised at the extent of his poaching in their preserves , a mere detour in his many wanderings in the pursuit of science or search of health .

		In the world of * LETTERS AND RECOLLECTIONS OF ALEXANDER AGASSIZ .

		With a Sketch of his Life and Work .

		Edited by

Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		affairs he was known as an extremely capable and suc - cessful mining man , who was said to employ his leisure moments in some sort of scientific study . ''

		Originally purposing to let his father tell his own story in letters and other autobiographical material , the son soon found this impossible because so much of the requisite correspondence had been destroyed .

		Moreover , as he says , it is '' a much more difficult matter to make a characteristic collection of letters now than it was in past generations .

		D'autres temps , d'autres moeurs ; to-day we no longer keep trunks full of old letters stored in our attics , nor do we write the leisurely and carefully - penned epistles of our forefathers , while the roomy lofts that harbored them have vanished . ''

		Therefore , though modestly willing to resign in favor of '' a more experienced biographer , '' Mr.
Agassiz	PERSON	at last found himself compelled to fill in , with his own hand , the many and wide gaps left in the naturalist 's own account of his in - dustrious and richly fruitful life .

		How capably this Boswellian function has been performed will become apparent as we proceed with the present review , which however will leave the greater part of the book 's merits to be discovered by the readers of its pages .

		Neuchatel , where
Louis Agassiz	PERSON	settled as professor of natural history soon after his mar - riage to the talented
Cecile Braun	PERSON	, daughter of a village schoolmaster devoted in his leisure hours to natural science , was the birthplace of
Alexander	PERSON	, the eldest child and only son of the family .

		He was born
December 17 , 1835	DATE	, and seems from the first to have shown more of his mother 's characteristics of temperament than of his father 's .

		In this connection his son says of the two men : '' The very general belief that men of unusual abilities inherit many of their qualities from their mothers offers a ready explanation for the marked difference in the character of
Louis Agassiz	PERSON	and his son .

		Alexander inherited from him a love of science and an extraor - dinary ability and thirst for work ; but his sensitive and apprehensive temperament he acquired directly from his mother . ''

		Naturally it has been sometimes the habit to com - pare the two men .

		But beyond the fact that both had a passionate love of science , pursued by very similar methods of work , and that the son followed in the foot - steps of the father in developing the Museum that the latter had founded , they had less in common than might be supposed .

		The father 's optimism was always a cause of anxiety and trouble ; the son possessed a singularly clear sight for the rocks ahead , and a very marked ability to steer his course clear of them .

		The habits of thought of each were necessarily different .

		Louis was the last of the great naturalists who believed in the special creation of species , and the theological tenets that it implied .

		Alexander , though always extremely
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 201 cautious in any speculations that did not rest on a solid foundation of ascertained fact , passed his early scientific life under the stimulus that the teachings of
Darwin	PERSON	gave to a new school of science . ''

		Marked indeed was the contrast between the buoyant and robust elder
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, open and expansive in his nature , loving appreciation , fond of teaching , and possessed of a veritable genius for kindling his pupils and his hearers with something of his own enthusiasm , and the reticent , undemonstrative , vigilantly-controlled manner of the son .

		All the more memorable , therefore , were the latter 's rare indulgences in free expression of his feelings .

		Characteristic of the future man was the Swiss schoolboy 's revolt against the Prussian governor of the canton of
Neuchatel	ORGANIZATION	, which he and a band of like-minded playmates wished to see enrolled , as in fact it was enrolled a few years later , with the other cantons in the Swiss confederacy .

		The story of his refusal to salute the hated tyrant and of his scornful rejection of the school prizes conferred upon him by his teachers , but offered through the governor 's hands , is signifi - cant as well as amusing .

		His biographer says of him : '' Do men mature faster in the shadow of the Alps , that certain qualities , which made such a marked and distinguished personality of the man , were already so evident in the boy ?

		For this quiet youth already possessed an unusual power of concentration , and a gift of accomplishing what he intended to do .

		The thor - oughness and ease with which he worked , his great reserve , his sudden explosions of indignation , his quiet and entire devotion to those he loved , his occasional out - bursts of mirth , as delightful as they were unexpected , his unfailing charm , all these belonged to the Swiss boy no less than to the scientific man of cosmopolitan friendship and fame . ''

		It was in his fourteenth year , soon after his mother 's death , that the boy
Alexander	PERSON	followed his father to
America	LOCATION	and entered that strange household in
Cambridge	LOCATION	which , until the fortu - nate coming of a second mother to him and his sisters , consisted of Professor
Agassiz	PERSON	, `` a dear old artist , Mr.
Burkhardt	PERSON	, a young
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	student , Mr.
Edward King	PERSON	, an old Swiss min - ister called ` Papa Christinat , ' who was supposed to look after the housekeeping , a bear , some eagles , a crocodile , a few snakes , and sundry other live stock . ''

		In the
autumn of 1851	DATE	the young immigrant entered
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, `` at the age of fifteen and a half , '' writes his biographer , but he must have been nearer sixteen , which was certainly young enough even in that early time .

		Among his classmates were not a few destined to become well known , such as
E. H. Abbot	PERSON	,
K. T. Paine	PERSON	,
F. B. Sanborn	PERSON	,
Theodore Lyman	PERSON	,
J. K. Hosmer	PERSON	, Judges
Mitchell	PERSON	and
Seawell	PERSON	, Bishop
Phillips Brooks	PERSON	, and
Francis C. Barlow	PERSON	, `` the first scholar of the class , who entered the Civil War a private , and left it a major-general . ''

		Of these men , Professor Hos - mer , in his '' Last Leaf , '' has given us a pleasing glimpse of his gifted classmate .

		Whole-hearted application to both work and play seems to have marked his college course ; but as he devoted himself more eagerly to certain researches out - side the curriculum than to some of the less congenial studies within it , and as he was espe - cially zealous in perfecting his skill as an oars - man , he was graduated only twenty-fourth in a class of eighty-two .

		But in a subsequent course at the
Lawrence Scientific School	ORGANIZATION	he acquitted himself brilliantly .

		The work of his manhood in various depart - ments of natural history , in building up the great museum founded by his father , in guiding the fortunes of the Calumet and
Hecla	ORGANIZATION	mining enterprise , in conducting expeditions for scien - tific research , and in other activities contribut - ing to the advancement of science or the enrich - ment of human knowledge , is either already known to those interested , or may be followed in detail in his own writings and in the biog - raphy now offered to the public .

		The story of Calumet and
Hecla	ORGANIZATION	, as wonderful as a chapter of ''
Monte Cristo	PERSON	, '' but also not without grim details of what almost proved to be failure and ruin , forms one of the most interesting portions of the book .

		It is followed by accounts of '' the revision of the echini , '' the visit to LakeTiticaca , the
Newport	LOCATION	laboratory , the three cruises of the ``
Blake	PERSON	, '' work in
Mexico	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	, wander - ings elsewhere , the first `` Albatross '' expedition , studies of coral reefs , researches in the
Bahamas	LOCATION	and the Bermudas , on the Great Barrier Reef , among the Fijis and elsewhere in the southern
Pacific	LOCATION	,
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	's later years , and , finally , his eastern
Pacific	LOCATION	expedition .

		The tough two years in the
Michigan	LOCATION	wilder - tested the man 's resourcefulness and ness stamina as probably no later experience did , and it also broke his health and left him with a lurking disease to fight against for the rest of his life .

		He had already seen something of coal - mining as president of certain mines in
Pennsyl	LOCATION	- vania which his friend ,
John M. Forbes	PERSON	, had succeeded in having placed under his manage - ment , but the conditions in northern
Michigan	LOCATION	were new to him and probably unprecedented .

		If I succeed , I can then get my own papers and drawings printed and help my father at the Museum . ''

		How well he succeeded , and what excellent and unselfish use he made of the wealth he won , will all be found , with many other important matters , in the son 's careful and sympathetic biography of his many-sided father .

		Both the specialist in science and the general reader interested in the development of a singularly strong and variously gifted character will heartily enjoy the work .

		In portraits , views , maps , colored drawings , index , and other features , the book is all that could be desired .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		FINDING THE TRUTH OF THINGS .

		* `` The World Soul '' is a queer book an amusing , amazing , suggestive , tantalizing , much - promising and little-satisfying , sophomoric , pro phetic book .

		To begin at the beginning , the title is pre - judicial .

		And the prejudice is almost justified .

		For though there are plenty of definite , concrete things in the book , the title and all pertaining directly thereto remain a bit of non-luminous and non-caloric rhetoric .

		Even the glossary , introduced for the benefit of those who are not familiar with the terminology of Mr.
Fielding	PERSON	-
Hall	PERSON	's system , avails nothing . ''

		Soul '' is defined as `` emotion , '' and `` world '' is made identical with `` trinity . ''

		The
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	is composed of Nature , Soul , and Wisdom .

		So `` World Soul '' is mathematically the emotion of Nature , Emo - tion , and Wisdom .

		Simple cancellation makes Nature and Wisdom equal zero , a lamentable conclusion .

		Mere vagueness will no longer be cashed in for profundity .

		Another feature that may disparage the real value of the book is the author 's cool assurance that he has exhausted knowledge and completed wisdom .

		Even though `` The World Soul '' had done this considerable thing , it would behoove the writer not to be so fully conscious of it . ''

		It has been my good fortune to live a life of extraordinary variety .

		There are few things I have not felt or seen , few occupations I have not tried or been connected with , few things I have not done , few coun - * THE WORLD SOUL .

		tries I have not visited , few classes of people I have not known , few notable books I have not read . ''

		In the preface we read : '' What I am con - cerned to do is to find the exact truth of things , and to connect them into a coherent whole . ''

		This is a pretty large order , but we are gratified to note that the author has been able to fill it : '' So far I had come .

		By working diligently all my life , by asking , by seeking , by knocking , I had discov - ered a great many things , and I knew that all I had discovered was true . '' ''

		Then suddenly a thought touched my heart , it shook , and all things flashed into being .

		Every vague wandering thought that had gone from sight came back in new organic form .

		I saw all that I had wanted to see for so many years . ''

		It is not surprising to learn that since the time mentioned above he has `` been lonesome '' in his thinking .

		The suspensive art with which he promises , pointing ahead to some delectable revelation , is worthy of `` Tom Jones '' itself .

		And so no wonder one closes the book disap - pointed ; for , expecting a cloud-burst , one re - sents the scarcity of really good showers .

		It may be well to quote a rather extended passage from the first chapter in order to give the author 's point of view .

		The following will serve admirably : '' Jesus the World Thinker was in the world to think for it , and to tell it whence it came and whither it was bound ; how so to live as to accelerate that purpose which is in the world and for the world ; but with one exception the writer of the fourth Gospel no one even partially understood .

		The life of Jesus and his thought were misinterpreted .

		From out of his teach - ings a few simple truths were taken ; all the rest were misinterpreted , and thought was once more fossilised and dead .

		All research was persecuted and destroyed . ''

		The very little that was partially understood of what Jesus was and said was hidden in a mass of super - stition , and called Christianity .

		This was the faith that I was taught when young .

		Briefly , it is this : '' A God all-powerful , all-wise , all-loving , made the world , no one knows for why .

		It is a failure , full of misery , sin , and suffering .

		So he sent His Son to save it by his blood , because God had to be propitiated for the sin of His own creation .

		Jesus was born of miracle , lived in miracle , died in miracle , a denial of God 's own rule of law .

		He taught that the world is evil , and we must escape from it .

		We must be innocent and pure , abjure the world , and when we die those who succeed will go to heaven to live for ever uselessly because they are unfit for any work , and there is no work to do .

		The majority will burn in hell .

		Their symbol is that of death , a crucifix or cross . ''

		I did not believe a word of it . ''

		Even as a boy I saw instinctively and very dimly a great many things . ''

		No God would sacrifice His Son to Himself .

		He might send His Son to war knowing he would be killed .

		That is a different matter .

		But in that case how could He be all-mighty ? ''

		I saw that the world was beautiful , and that if it
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 203 was not entirely happy it was because of defects which existed to be overcome , for the whole value of life lay in overcoming them and going on .

		... I did n't want to go to either heaven or hell .

		I wanted life , and so did all others I knew . ''

		This passage will orientate the book , attracting or repelling the reader .

		It will be seen that the author 's arraignment of Christianity is slightly unfair ; nevertheless , many thoughtful
Chris	PERSON	- tians will feel that the exaggeration is but venial .

		The first half of the work is devoted to a his - tory of his own thought development , some of it fresh and some of it stale ; and a resume of his former books , which it is to be presumed are very much more diffuse than the present culminating volume .

		They are , '' The Soul of a People , '' `` The Hearts of Men , '' `` A People at School , '' `` The Inward Light , '' `` One Immor - tality , '' and '' The Sons of Time . ''

		The chief value of this book although such value appears to be incidental is the human - izing light thrown upon the life of Jesus .

		Utterly freed from the trammels of creedal Christianity , Mr.
Fielding-Hall	PERSON	professes and manifests the utmost reverence , amounting to worship , for Jesus .

		To those who find comfort in the humanity of Jesus , in his appeal as a brother in an actual and not a mystical sense , and are unable to appreciate his vicarious serv - ices as a god , there will be much pleasure and illumination in the later chapters , especially that entitled `` Crucifixion . ''

		The view herein presented , while not novel , exhibits many orig - inal features in its details .

		It is in brief that Jesus was `` neurotic '' -LRB- an atrociously infelic - itous word -RRB- .

		He did not die on the cross in three hours , but fainted .

		His appearances later were thus entirely natural , and his early death soon after was just as naturally caused by the tremendous shock he had experienced .

		This is not all thoroughly consistent and satisfactory , notably the supposition that
Philip	PERSON	, the writer of the
Fourth Gospel	ORGANIZATION	and the only disciple who had any intellectual sympathy for Jesus , knew all the time that Jesus had not died .

		Still there is immense suggestiveness in the chapter , enough to make the writer 's promise of a life of Jesus very welcome .

		There are certain surprising omissions , con - sidering the point of view and the frank , simple , unfrilled way of thinking on these questions that the author follows .

		He handles the birth and death of Jesus directly and without reserve ; on the other hand he nowhere makes mention of the stupendous fact that Jesus , whom he con - ceives to be the type and contain the essence of humanity , our brother , tempted and joyinp - and sorrowing in all points as we are tempted and joy and suffer , lacked the most vital human experiences .

		He was a celibate .

		I suppose it is a biological truism that marriage and parent - hood test the capacity of human joy and sorrow as nothing else in life can .

		Celibate thinkers have here and there been great , but have always been incomplete .

		However high and deep and broad their ken , there has been a height and depth and breadth unreached .

		`` They twain shall be one flesh '' is a literal biological law .

		A differentiated sex is disinherited from some of life 's original knowledge ; to realize complete wisdom sex must be added to sex .

		A perfectly happy unmarried
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	or Lincoln would have been distinctly less ; a perfectly unhappy , unmarried
Browning	PERSON	would not have been much .

		It remains to say that for the most part the author seems keen , honest , unfettered , and un - fettering .

		His style is simple , clear , and strik - ing wherever his hobby of the World Soul is in the background .

		He may not have solved all mysteries , but that is not greatly to be regretted .

		There would be no heritage of mystery for the future if '' The World Soul '' had paid all claims .

		THE INTERPRETATION OF
RUSSIA	LOCATION	.

		* The increasing prominence of the Slav in the affairs of
Europe	LOCATION	has drawn the attention of the world more and more to the great Russian Empire , almost three times the size of the
United States	LOCATION	, which is destined beyond doubt to play a most important part in the history of the next century .

		For many reasons
Russia	LOCATION	has been little known to the
Western	LOCATION	world .

		The ordinary tourist goes southward or halts well within the boundaries of
Germany	LOCATION	, and cares little for the remote and `` barbarous '' Scythians .

		The severe winters repel , and travel is not always easy and pleasant , as it has become elsewhere .

		But recent events have shown us that we must know more about the great Sphinx of
Eastern Europe	LOCATION	, and be able to judge her opinions and her diplomacy on the basis of wider and more exact knowledge .

		204 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	exceptional opportunities and privileges , and has made good use of them .

		In `` My Russian Year '' he has produced an impartial account of the Russian character , and has drawn vivid pictures of life among several different classes in the Empire .

		He records few statistics but many conversations .

		He had apparently no special interests ; he saw both town and country life , both reactionaries and revolutionists , peas - ants and nobility , Jews and orthodox .

		In
Russia	LOCATION	all extremes appear to meet .

		One sees there all the centuries illustrated . ''

		If one wants to know what sort of man an
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	villain was , it is more to the point to talk to a Russian peasant than to rummage in libraries .

		The pilgrims , dressed like Tannhauser in the third act , with staves in their hands and wallets at their sides , who wander through
Russia	LOCATION	on their way to pray at the Holy Sepulchre , belong to the age of the Crusades .

		The ascetic who spends his life in prayer and fasting and wears chains about his body , seems to have found his way into modern
Russia	LOCATION	from the Egyptian Thebaid of the fourth century .

		A country lad tells me that all Russians who are not orthodox are wicked persons , that Poles must be Catholics and Englishmen members of the English Church , and I realize that I am speaking to a contemporary of Queen
Elizabeth	PERSON	.

		I spent a week in
Livland	LOCATION	with people of the eighteenth century . ''

		In his effort to make the reader see
Russia	LOCATION	vividly , as he himself saw it , we think Mr.
Reynolds	PERSON	has succeeded .

		From a volume every chapter of which is full of interesting comment and of color , it is not easy to single out topics for discussion .

		We must not fail , however , to notice the chapter on `` The Reactionaries . ''

		These are the men who have not perceived the tendency of the times , who have fondly believed that the alien races now subject to the Czar can be made to do exactly as did the Russians of old .

		Their aim is `` to force every subject of the Russian Tsar to speak the language he speaks , to believe the creed he believes , to pray the prayers he prays . ''

		There are not many , to be sure , who hold such extreme views as these ; yet there are , as Mr.
Reynolds	PERSON	points out , many Conservatives `` who approve the present system of government , and , although they may desire reforms , are opposed to the introduction of wider liberties . ''

		Thus it re - sults that
Stolypin	PERSON	's policy of order first , then reform , is upheld by large numbers of the peo - ple , and ``
Stolypin	PERSON	's Necktie '' -LRB- the hangman 's rope -RRB- continues to play a large part in the administration of the government .

		The chap - ter on `` The Revolutionists '' ought to be read and pondered by the militant suffragettes .

		Doing evil that good may come never has suc - ceeded and never will succeed .

		The terrorists in
Russia	LOCATION	have themselves to thank for the presence of the hated secret police ; moreover , they have delayed reform for many decades , if not for centuries .

		Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's volume is the most comprehen - sive and ambitious of the four .

		In twenty-six chapters , filling 465 pages , he essays a descrip - tion of Russian ethnology , geography , litera - ture , history , and customs truly `` a large order . ''

		Had he attempted less , he would doubtless have made a better book .

		He seems to have become a professional in this sort , hav - ing to his credit works bearing a similar title on
Mexico	LOCATION	,
Guatemala	LOCATION	,
Brazil	LOCATION	,
Argentina	LOCATION	, and
Chile	LOCATION	.

		This is therefore his first venture on European soil .

		His style shows a woeful lack of training .

		Such gems as these occur : '' He looks like he was pneumatically inflated '' -LRB- p. 28 -RRB- ; `` he was as meek a looking fellow as one could find '' -LRB- p. Ill -RRB- ; `` the people could not be en - thused as formerly '' -LRB- p. 80 -RRB- ; `` it was blamed upon a Jew '' -LRB- p. 258 -RRB- ; '' The shopkeepers do not seem overly anxious for customers '' -LRB- p. 30 -RRB- .

		The description is quite devoid of enthusiasm and as a rule is most matter-of-fact .

		Yet it must be conceded that Mr.
Winter	PERSON	has a fairly good sense of proportion , and has well martialed his masses of facts .

		He has travelled widely in
European Russia	LOCATION	, and knows well the country as it appears to-day .

		In commenting on the abrogation by
Congress of the Treaty of 1832	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Winter	PERSON	has this to say : '' The Russian has a logical answer to the protest of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Our country will not admit polygamists , and yet
Russia	LOCATION	has thousands of polyga - mous subjects , and millions of Mohammedans , who at heart believe in the principle of plural marriages .

		There are likewise tens of thousands of Chinese who are subjects of the Czar . '

		Now , ' says the Russian , ` if you will not admit our polygamists or Chinese , how can you insist on our admitting your Jews ? '

		It is an unanswerable argument ...
The United States	LOCATION	can gain nothing , nor will the Jew , either in this country or
Russia	LOCATION	, be benefitted . ''

		The action of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, which looks like a diplomatic blunder , was doubtless based on in - sufficient knowledge of Russian conditions and habits of thought .

		As Dr.
Andrew D. White	PERSON	lately remarked to the present reviewer in a conversation , it can not fail to have a disastrous effect on the peace movement .

		Mr.
Rappoport	PERSON	has given us a substantial and worthy volume .

		In twenty-two chapters , of which fourteen are devoted to the country and the remainder to the town , he presents a series of pictures and observations which well set forth the private life of the Russians .

		He is not wholly systematic ; the four or five pages of notes are important and certainly ought to
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 205 have been amplified and incorporated into the text .

		Nor is he very consistent in spelling proper names : thus we find moujik -LRB- generally -RRB- and Moushik -LRB- p. v. -RRB- ; Alexejewith -LRB- p. 211 -RRB- ,
Wassilevitsh	PERSON	-LRB- p. 55 -RRB- ,
Stepanowitsh	PERSON	-LRB- p. 148 -RRB- , Puschkin -LRB- p.l2 -RRB- ; russaeki -LRB- for russalki , p. 48 -RRB- , and roussalki -LRB- pp. 62ff . -RRB-

		;
Tolstoi	PERSON	-LRB- pp. 86 , 203 -RRB- , and Tolstoy -LRB- p. 141 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Rappoport	PERSON	writes , however , compactly and directly .

		Among his most interesting chapters are those on stu - dent life and on the secret police .

		The strug - gles of many a Russian youth to gain an education are full of pathos . ''

		Thousands of Russian students are absolutely with - out means of any description , and keep body and soul together by giving a few lessons , and it takes a great deal of perseverance to carry on the struggle undeterred under such wretched conditions .

		It is easy to conceive that these conditions lead those least capable of resist - ance to a radicalism which recognizes no limits to good or evil , to a state of revolt against the existing order of things which is not always the result of meditation and reflection , but of an empty stomach and a bitter spirit . ''

		It is no wonder that many students soon land in prison or in
Siberia	LOCATION	betrayed perhaps by their bosom friends who were really of the secret police .

		There is little hope for
Russia	LOCATION	as long as the autocracy continues its present fatal policy , which paralyzes all independent thought on political or social questions .

		From these distressing thoughts one turns with something like relief to wanderings by the pleasant shores of the Black Sea , remote from the centre of despotic rule .

		Mr.
Stephen Graham	PERSON	, already known as an entertaining writer on Russian topics through his `` Vagabond in the Caucasus '' and `` Undiscovered
Russia	LOCATION	, '' now adds to the list an illuminating series of studies and reflections which he entitles '' Changing
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		Its framework is the nar - rative of a pedestrian journey from Rostof-on - the-Don to
Batum	LOCATION	, along the route of the new Black Sea Railway .

		Mingled with descriptions of scenery and of various types of humanity are found chapters on colonization and politics , journalism , hopes for a new national art , and the Russian imperial policy .

		On all these sub - jects Mr.
Graham	PERSON	writes intelligently and with neither illusions nor despair .

		For the Russian bourgeois he has supreme contempt . ''

		The curse of
Russia	LOCATION	, and , as the years go on , the increasing curse , is the bourgeoisie , the lower middle class , aware of itself articulately as the lower intelli - gentia .

		It is forming everywhere in the towns as a result of the commercial development of the nation .

		They are worse than the English middle class , worse than the Forsytes , because they wish to be considered national .

		They are of the race who ' limerick ' and treasure-hunt , but are not occupied so innocently .

		In politics they call themselves Liberals , though they have no notion of true Liberalism , they are seldom Socialists or Radicals , but are abusive of those in authority .

		They are unwilling , however , to sacrifice anything or take any risks for political ends .

		Through them the revolution failed ; they would have liked the revolution to have succeeded , but as they had not the faith of the true revolutionaries , they waited to see who would win .

		Selfish as it is possible to be , crass , heavy , ugly , unfaith - ful in marriage , unclean , impure , incapable apparently of understanding the good and the true in their neigh - bours and in life such is the Russian bourgeois . ''

		To offset this picture , there is the portrait of
Vassily Vassil	PERSON	` itch , a type of the higher intelli - gentia immaculate , courteous , religious , eager for the best thoughts .

		The number of this type can hardly be large , and we wonder whether they will do much toward stemming the tide of gross materialism which seems bound to sweep over the country and which has already begun to spoil the peasantry .

		This is perhaps the main burden of Mr.
Graham	PERSON	's thought that
Russia	LOCATION	is losing her faith in the church and religion , and for the mass of the people nothing is in sight to replace it except faith in the rouble .

		That
Russia	LOCATION	is about to pass through the same experience of the domination of
Phil	PERSON	- istinism which
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	have had for many years , seems inevitable .

		That the Philistines can not be killed off , as in
Kouprin	LOCATION	's striking skit in '' Satirikon '' -LRB- translated by Mr.
Graham	PERSON	, pp. 103ff . -RRB-

		, is unfortunately certain .

		Yet that culture will triumph in the end we may hope with some degree of confidence ; for the dollar and the rouble will not always sat - isfy , and sooner or later the children of light will come into their own .

		206 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	is that the immigration with which our own country is directly concerned is but a phase of a world phe - nomenon , to be understood and to be dealt with satisfactorily only in the light of this phenomenon as a whole .

		French and German students of social movements have very generally been able to take the larger view ; and some , as Re ` ne ' Gonnard , have written illuminatingly under its influence .

		But Americans , at least the Americans who have be - come the authors of immigration treatises , have almost universally failed to catch it , so that it becomes a genuine pleasure to record the fact that in one of the several American books recently published upon the subject the much-to-be-desired quality is at last to be discovered .

		The author of this book is Professor Fairchild , of
Yale University	ORGANIZATION	, whose excellent study of `` Greek Immigration in the
United States	LOCATION	'' was reviewed some time ago in these columns .

		Disclaiming the purpose to attempt exhaustive - ness of detail , Professor Fairchild seeks in his new book to portray the immigration question as it pre - sents itself in this country as '' a part of an inclusive conservation program for all humanity . ''

		The fun - damental matters , he affirms , '' are the laws or principles which underlie the great type of population movement which we call immigration ... It is a knowledge of these principles which fits one to under - stand the movement in its ever-changing aspects , and to grapple with it as a problem of practical politics or sociology .

		To define and clarify the concepts involved , to set forth clearly the laws and principles , and to point out the oppor - tunities and responsibilities , is the chief aim of this book . '

		1 Upon hardly any sociological subject has writing been generally more loose , slovenly , and lacking in perspective .

		The accuracy , conciseness , and balance of Professor Fairchild 's work are accordingly most refreshing .

		There is a good deal of history and a certain amount of statistical information , but the larger portion of the volume is taken up with a study of sources , causes , attending conditions , and results , viewed not exclusively as bearing upon the American problem but as aspects of a worldwide international conflict of social and economic forces .

		From the vantage point thus occupied the author is able to demonstrate effectively the fallacy of the popular notion that belief in immigration restriction is inconsistent with sympathy for the immigrant .

		He proves , indeed , that the restrictionist may be the alien 's truest friend .

		The changes of condition during recent decades , in
America	LOCATION	and abroad , are shown to be at least so extensive as to require that `` the entire immigration situation be considered in the light of present conditions , rather than of past history .

		The old stock arguments , pro and con , which seem to have stood the test of time , need to be thoroughly reviewed .

		The modern immigrant must be viewed in the setting of to-day .

		Especially must it be borne in mind that the fact if such it be that immigration in the past has worked no injury to the nation , and has resulted in good to the immigrants , by no means indicates that a continuance of past policy and practice in the matter will entail no serious evil conse - quences , nor bring about disaster in the future . ''

		No special plea is made for restriction or the reverse ; but it is insisted that the mind of the country upon this vital question should be made up from a full knowledge of the conditions to-day actually involved , not from the assumptions , nor even the facts , of seventy-five or twenty-five years ago .

		The sweep of Dr.
Warne	PERSON	's `` The Immigrant Invasion '' is less extensive .

		The subject is viewed in its American aspects almost exclusively .

		The major portion of the volume is taken up with a survey of the distribution , present character , and effects of immigration , and the more or less familiar facts are presented with commendable clearness and concreteness .

		The review of immigrant distribution , especially with respect to the South , is useful .

		An attempt is made to forecast in some detail the im - migration movement of the nearer future .

		The conclusion is reached that in
Germany	LOCATION	, the
Scandi	LOCATION	- navian countries , and
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	the principal sources of the older immigration the economic and political influences at present at work will operate to produce a continued decline in emigra - tion to the
United States	LOCATION	. ''

		The economic opportunities of those who might emigrate from these countries are now nearly as great as they are in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		These opportunities , once so widely apart , have more nearly approached a level .

		This has come about through an improvement of conditions in these European countries and by a relative decline in the pros - pects of the immigrant in the
United States	LOCATION	he no longer has before him here the chance for economic independence through land ownership . ''

		On the other hand , it is pointed out that the immigrant tide from the countries of southern and eastern
Europe	LOCATION	is likely to rise to still higher levels .

		The reason is stated convincingly as follows : `` The
United States	LOCATION	has only just begun the development of her material resources by means of industrial organiza - tion .

		Into the foundation of this organization our captains of industry seem to have successfully built , for a long time to come at least , a very low wage a wage too low to sup - port decently and comfortably the native worker .

		Our gov - ernmental organization or political state has so far been pow - erless to prevent this .

		Our manufacturers have even begun to use our governmental machinery in their campaign to capture the markets of the world .

		This competition in world mar - kets must meet a low wage and in consequence the demand of the American manufacturer for cheap labor will not only continue in the future but it will also most likely become even more insistent .

		Governmental action to prevent this anti-social demand from becoming effective , such for instance as the restriction of immigration by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, is very unlikely .

		In consequence we shall not be surprised if immigration for the coming years is of even greater volume than that of the past decade and more .

		The larger part of it virtually all of it must come from the eastern and southern and western Asiatic countries , where the standard of living of the masses is very little , if any .

		above the mere cost of the coarsest sub - sistence .

		Unless effective restrictive measures are enacted by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, this immigration will continue indefinitely until more of an equilibrium is established between the economic rewards to toilers in those countries and in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		This result can come about only through a slow and gradual process of economic adjustment , in the meantime continuing here among our own citizen-workers a low wage and in consequence a low standard of living . ''

		Dr.
Warne	PERSON	clearly favors a policy of restriction somewhat more rigid than that at present in opera -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 207 tion , but he believes also that the forces of sympathy for the ambitious alien and of self-interest on the part of the American employer are likely to prove too powerful to permit the enactment of legislation establishing such restriction .

		It is his opinion , too , that the opening of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal will inaugu - rate such an influx of Europeans on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast that the immigration question in that section of the country will assume a wholly novel phase ; and the question is raised whether the opposition to the coming in of laborers of an inferior standard of living , even though of non - Asiatic origin , may prove sufficiently strong in that section to induce the adop - tion of a federal policy regarding the Hungarian , the Slav , and the Italian similar to that at present operative respecting the Chinese and the Japanese .

		The book contains some helpful charts and tables .

		The bibliography which is appended , however , is so scant and haphazard as to be of small worth .

		Mr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	is cited , justly , as a high au - thority ; but there is no reason for referring to him as Professor
Rhodes	PERSON	.

		In `` The New Immigration , '' Dr.
Roberts	PERSON	presents a detailed survey of the human qualities , industrial efficiency , and social life of the masses of immigrants from southeastern
Europe	LOCATION	who during the past three or four decades have sought employment and homes in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		In the volume there is little of theory but much of carefully ascertained and clearly stated fact ; in truth , it abounds , perhaps above all other books ever published within the field , in specific incidents and illustrations which serve to humanize the subject .

		The view of the author is optimistic .

		It is recognized that large-scale immi - gration , under even the most favorable of circum - stances , has its darker side ; but it is insisted that
America	LOCATION	needs the immigrant hardly less than the immigrant needs
America	LOCATION	; that the immigration at present under way from
Italy	LOCATION	,
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	, and adjacent countries comprises in no true sense the `` scum of the earth '' ; and that , despite the imperfect realization of the problem of assimilation which has been arrived at , a variety of assimilative forces are already yielding results which are little short of marvellous . ''

		I believe in the immigrant .

		He has in him the making of an American , provided a sympathetic hand guides him and smooths the path - which leads to assimilation .

		The hand of the native-born can best do this ; and my main thesis is , that in every community where the men of southeastern
Europe	LOCATION	have settled the redemptive forces necessary to raise the foreigners from inefficiency and ignorance , from anti-social habits and gross superstition , are available , provided they are marshalled , supported , and set to work by patriotic men .

		Wherever the native-born lie supinely , looking to state or federal government for relief from the ills precipitated by foreigners , their expectation will not be fulfilled , and the ills they bemoan will grow more intense ... The past indus - trial development of
America	LOCATION	points unerringly to
Europe	LOCATION	as the source whence our future unskilled labor supply is to be drawn .

		The gates will not be closed ; the wheels of industry will not retard ;
America	LOCATION	is in the race for the markets of the world ; its call for workers will not cease .

		Confronted by these conditions , is it not the duty of the government to deal generously and justly by those who answer the call , and should not every industrial community adopt some definite plan for constructive work to raise the standard of the new immigration and speed on the process of assimilation ? ''

		The effectiveness of the assimilative process , in Dr.
Roberts	PERSON	's opinion , must depend more largely upon private effort than upon legislation .

		It is especially recommended that in every city , town , and village where immigrants have settled , public buildings be utilized for special educational work among the alien inhabitants .

		Centres opened in every public school in foreign colonies , where immi - grants might be taught , it is affirmed , would do more for foreigners in one year than ten years of legisla - tive inhibition as to what the foreigners should or should not do .

		By reason of the over-work of reg - ular teachers , and in many cases their ill-adaptation to the teaching of aliens , the public school as such is regarded as not the best agency through which the needed work can be accomplished .

		The opinion is expressed that the proper education of immigrants requires , in each city and town where they are resident in considerable numbers , a special superin - tendent , a special corps of teachers , and a special system .

		There can be no doubt of the general desirability of such an arrangement , or of its superior effectiveness .

		In few localities as yet , however , is the seriousness of the need appreciated to such a degree that the taxpayer is willing to meet it in the manner which Dr.
Roberts	PERSON	would desire .

		The description of
Austria-Hungary	LOCATION	which is given by Rev.
Francis E. Clark	PERSON	in '' Old Homes of New Americans '' is intended to acquaint the reader with the social and political conditions by which is determined the character of our Magyar , and of a considerable portion of our Slavic ,
Hebrew	ORGANIZATION	, and German immigration .

		The idea which underlies the book is that the proper place to begin the study of American race and industrial problems is in
Europe	LOCATION	, and especially that part of
Europe	LOCATION	which , while supplying an ever-increasing proportion of our alien influx , is still for the average American more or less a terra incognita .

		The point of view is unquestionably well taken , and it may be hoped that as time passes the immigrant problem will be attacked more and more at its sources .

		To the extent that the American people can be brought to an understanding of the inheritance of ideas and manners and the actual living conditions of our newcomers , the conditions of sympathy , forbearance , and good-will which are so essential to the amalga - mation of diverse population elements will be sup - plied .

		To this desirable end Dr.
Clark	PERSON	's book , which has the merit of being based upon somewhat intensive personal observation , makes real contribu - tion .

		The scholar will find in the volume nothing that is new ; indeed , he will find in it a good many statements which are open to question , and , in gen - eral , an inclination toward the picturesque which is not wholly consistent with soberness of judgment .

		208 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	But the book is not intended for the scholar ; and to the hurried reader who may wish to obtain at a couple of sittings a somewhat intimate and suffi - ciently discriminating impression of the antecedents of the Magyar or Slovak who crowds him on the street or lives around the next corner , the volume may be commended without reserve .

		Its lightness of touch and deftness of allusion render it pleasant reading .

		RECENT POETRY .

		* For the second time this year , the verse of our foremost living poet , Mr.
George Edward Wood	PERSON	- berry , occupies its rightful place at the head of our survey of recent books of poetry .

		Like the volume we reviewed a few months ago , the present collec - tion , published by the
Woodberry Society	ORGANIZATION	, contains but three poems , and is supplied with a preface which takes us jnto the writer 's intimate confidence .

		They are all , he tells us , `` poems of expectancy , in the mood of faith in the unimagined future .

		They have a touch of prophetic conviction , and that atmosphere of largeness of world-hope which is a trait of our time . ''

		The first of the three is called `` The Kingdom of All-Souls . ''

		It is written in a somewhat irregular verse , approaching the iambic heptameter as its norm , but making a large use of anapaests , and frequently using internal rhymes .

		These are the opening lines : '' I heard in my youth of a Kingdom , lying far at the whole world 's end , And pilgrim-wise I clothed myself in my boyhood there to wend ; Through the beautiful , the dutiful , the holy highway ran , So was I told , and it stretched through the midst of all the glory of man ; And all men spoke of the Kingdom , when they looked on my face of joy , And the souls of the dead spun the golden thread in the heart of the silent boy . ''

		POEMS OF LOVE AND EARTH .

		By
John Drinkwater	PERSON	.


London	LOCATION	:
David Nutt	PERSON	.

		The suggestions for this poem came from an expe - rience in a Sicilian sulphur mine and a visit to the Greek state prison at
Nauplia	LOCATION	, where `` the convicts fabricate an iron stamp , which is used to imprint the Christian symbol
IHS	ORGANIZATION	on the Easter bread . ''

		These are the lines which embody the second expe - rience : '' For I saw in the den of a prison-pen , on a peak of Argo 's coast , Men whom whips compel , mould as in hell the matrix of the Host : Murderers , thieves , and every brood of dark and heinous sin Forged in that shed the seal of God 's Bread , that stamps Christ 's name therein . ''

		The second poem , `` What the Stars Sang in the Desert , '' `` records the memory of a night which I and my guides , having lost our way , spent in the desert between
Biskra	LOCATION	and Tongourt . ''

		This is the strain of the song : '' We gaze on the far flood flowing Unimaginably free , Multitudinous , mystical , glowing , But all we do not see : And a rapture is all our knowing , That on fiery nerves comes stealing , An intimate revealing That all is yet to be . ''

		When sheathed and glacial o'er us Arcturus courses cold , And dry and dark before us
Aldebaran	ORGANIZATION	is rolled , Far-clustering orbs in chorus Shall light the pealing sky And throne to throne reply , ' The heavens grow not old . '

		v Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	's third poem is , as the title indicates , a Nietzschean suggestion , being called `` Beyond Good and Evil . ''

		The author admits the spell of
Nietzsche	LOCATION	, but disavows the doctrine .

		`` I know no modern thinker with such a fire-flow in him , the vital burst , la vie .

		I think of him as what I have found most rare in life , either among men or books , a companion on my way .

		I dare say I should have found him , in real life , quite impossible ; but , safely walled apart by time and space and death , we are friends in the spirit . ''

		The poem pictures a ride `` in the dark of the spirit . '' ''

		We were past the good and the evil , In the spirit 's uttermost dark ; He is neither god nor devil For whom my heart-beats hark ; And I leaned my cheek to my horse 's neck , And I sang to his ear in the dark : ' There is neither good nor evil , There is neither god nor devil , And our way lies on through the dark . ' ''

		Poems about books are apt to be anaemic , and one can hardly soar to heights of lyric rapture over a first edition , but the book-lover has feelings that prose is not exalted enough to express , and is at times constrained to pour them forth in verse .

		Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	's `` Lyrics from a Library '' sing to us of
Keats	PERSON	and
Herrick	PERSON	, of Theocritus and Omar , of `
Lanier	PERSON	and Freneau , of
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	,
Walton	PERSON	, and
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 209 many others , all with delicate appreciation and charmingly subtle fancy .

		He knows the joy of first editions , but there is a sting in his discourse concerning them . ''

		And now a word of warning , ye Who seek our constant company ; Unless yonr purses , plethoric , hold The round and clearly-minted gold , Abjure us , shun us , lest the night Creep on ye , and pale candle-light Find ye by us uncomforted , And slipping supperless to bed . ''

		`` A Bookworm 's Plaint '' is an admirable specimen of familiar verse . ''

		To-day , when I had dined my fill Upon a
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	, you know Will , I crawled forth o'er the colophon To bask awhile within the sun ; And having coiled my sated length , I felt anon my whilom , strength Slip from me gradually , till deep I dropped away in dreamful sleep , Wherein I walked an endless maze , And dined on Cartons all my days . ''

		Then I woke suddenly .

		Alas !

		What in my sleep had come to pass ?

		That priceless first edition row , Squat , quarto , and tall folio , Had , in my slumber , vanished quite ; Instead , on my astonished sight The ^ newest novels burst , a gay And most unpalatable array !

		I , that have battened on the best , Why should I thus be dispossessed , And with starvation , or the worst Of diets , cruelly be curst ? ''

		In more serious vein is this fine sonnet-tribute to Philip Freneau : '' Now that the vesper-planet 's violet glow la smothered in a welter of gray cloud , And all the winds that sweep the sky are loud , I mind me how , one white night long ago , Our earliest poet , valiant-souled Freneau , By the stern stress of years assailed and bowed , Fell by the way , and found a fatal shroud In the benumbing silence of the snow ! ''

		When the young nation shook with war 's grim throes , The smiting of his song was as a sword , The light of it was as a beacon flame ; And though the drift of
Time	ORGANIZATION	's unpitying snows Upon the mound that hides his dust be poured , It may not dim the glory of his name . ''

		We must also quote the envoy of the collection : '' The varied Book of Life , How hurriedly we con !

		Through the pages sown with grief and strife We reach the colophon . ''

		We would peruse it still Despite its stress , but nay , It must be closed , saith the Great Will , And laid aside for aye . ''

		Lyrics of love , nature , and the religious mood make up the contents of Miss Grace Duffield Good - win 's `` Horizon Songs . ''

		Without originality or marked distinction , they are nevertheless pleasing by virtue of their delicate imagery and tender wist - ful sentiment .

		`` Confidence '' is a fair example : '' I know not where the Blessed wait , Within what glory-girdled lands , Nor on what hill of God , elate , Redemption 's city stands . ''

		Mine eyes are blind because of tears , My feet move slow on Sorrow 's ways , And loneliness of earthly years Bedims the heavenly days . ''

		Yet even when nearest to despair , -LRB- God give me grace to suffer then -RRB- , I know , I know , sometime , somewhere , We find our own again . ''

		Miss
Amy Lowell	PERSON	, in '' A Dome of Many-Col - oured Glass , '' hardly lives up to her own definition of poetry . ''

		What is poetry ?

		Is it a mosaic Of coloured stones which curiously are wrought Into a pattern ?

		Bather glass that 's taught By patient labor any hue to take And glowing with a sumptuous splendor , make Beauty a thing of awe ; where sunbeams caught , Transmuted fall in sheafs of rainbows fraught With storied meaning for religion 's sake . ''

		Instead of the flights and imaginings suggested by these verses ,
Miss Lowell	ORGANIZATION	gives us precise and pretty fancies inspired by nature and by art verses upon the seasons and the stars , upon
Japan	LOCATION	- ese prints and Italian paintings , upon authors and their books .

		She imparts to us naive confidences , as when she says : '' I love the vivid life of winter months In constant intercourse with human minds , When every new experience is gain And on all sides we feel the great world 's heart ; The pulse and throb of life which makes us new , '' or when she sings .

		of her fruit garden : '' Dear garden of my childhood , here my years Have run away like little grains of sand ; The moments of my life , its hopes and fears Have all found utterance here , where now I stand ; My eyes ache with the weight of unshed tears , You are my home , do you not understand . ''

		It is neatly put , but not very important .

		Miss
Lowell	PERSON	's most pretentious poem is dedicated to `` The
Boston Athenaeum	LOCATION	, '' where '' We feel that we are not alone , We too are one with our own richest past ; And here that veiled , but ever smouldering fire Of race , which rarely seen yet never dies , Springs up afresh and warms us with its heat . ''

		`` Myself and I , '' by
Miss Fannie Stearns Davis	PERSON	, is a volume of `` magazine verse . ''

		This opinion does not need for its confirmation the prefatory note of acknowledgment to a list of popular periodicals for permission to reprint .

		Its contents are too evi - dently the futile flutterings that editors use to fill in the chinks . ''

		I do not know why they should heed my singing . ''

		Nor do we . ''

		Are they not deaf and blind with urgent Life ?

		And what am I , save one small lark , down-flinging My sun-song on a battle 's blood-red strife ? ''

		210 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	Most of these poems are na'ive confidences , such as `` The Dead Folk , '' of which we quote the ending . ''

		My body is a curious thing .

		My soul 's not half so strange , Who may go forth on gleaming wing , And take no touch of change . ''

		But that my body should lie still , And never dance or run , And never climb a crooked hill , And never see the sun , '' This is a strange , strange thing to me ; And stranger yet it grows Each time I stop awhile to see The Dead Folk 's decent rows . ''

		`` A Walled Garden and Other Poems , '' by Miss
Margaret Root Garvin	PERSON	, is another collection of magazine verse .

		`` Moon Flowers , '' a pretty conceit , may be taken to illustrate the quality of this vol - ume : `` Flowers of the
Moon	LOCATION	, are dreams : Sudden they
spring	DATE	from the dark soil of night ; In shadows foliate , their buds are bright ; With bloom , more fair than fruit , their leafage teems , Flowers of the Moon . ''

		Like night-moths , Psyche-winged , Our soul do sip these flower-founts of Joy ; Until the flames of Dawn the wings destroy , And tendrils break , that round our hearts were ringed , Flowers of the Moon ! ''

		The note of mysticism is predominant in Miss
Evelyn Underbill	PERSON	's `` Immanence , '' as might be expected by anyone acquainted with the author 's philosophical and imaginative work in prose .

		The last poem of the volume seems to us the most quot - able for the purpose of adequate representation .

		It is entitled `` Transcendence . '' ''

		Within thy sheltering darkness spin the spheres ; Within the shaded hollow of thy wings .

		The life of things , The changeless pivot of the passing years These in thy bosom be .

		Restless we seek thy being ; to and fro Upon our little twisting earth we go : We cry , ' Lo , there ! '

		When some new avatar thy glory does declare , When some new prophet of thy friendship sings , And in his tracks we run Like an enchanted child , that hastes to catch the sun . '

		And shall the soul thereby Unto the All draw nigh ?

		Shall it avail to plumb the mystic deeps Of flowery beauty , scale the icy steeps Of perilous thought , thy hidden Face to find , Or tread the starry paths to the utmost verge of the sky ?

		Nay , groping dull and blind Within the sheltering dimness of thy wings Shade that their splendour flings Athwart Eternity We , out of age-long wandering , but come Back to our Father 's heart , where now we are at home . ''

		Such poetry , appealing as it is , seems to do little more than chase the will-o ' - the-wisps of fancy , and drug the spirit in its irrational moods , drifting blindly , with no firm anchorage of thought .

		It does not give us clean-cut ideas , and its logic is purely emotional .

		Miss
Eva Gore-Booth	PERSON	's `` The Agate Lamp '' opens with a series of brief interpretations of works of painting and sculpture , such as these lines upon `` The Dawn '' of Michelangelo : '' Not as
Aurora	LOCATION	of the smiling eyes And rosy fingers doth this dawn awake ; Neither , like Aphrodite , doth she rise From the bright waves , all silver for her sake .

		Rather is she the Image in the Soul , The beautiful young dawn of all things fair , Who wakes in a dark world of gloom and dole , Wrapped in the marble coldness of despair .

		Thou sorrowful Dawn invincible , alone , Pale sleeper , from thy long rest turn aside ; Four hundred years of slumber hast thou known ; Long broken is that
Florentine	ORGANIZATION	's fierce pride That held thee tranced through years of storm and stress ; O , buried in the marble calm and cold , Wake thou , the world is full of heaviness , And men have need of beauty , as of old . '' ''

		Divina Commedia '' is the title of a wonderful long poem in which the vision of the modern world is contrasted with that revealed to the Tuscan poet . ''

		And
Beatrice	PERSON	vanished is the shining sphere And saints ' high throne above the world apart , Yet with us dwells the dream divine and dear That folds in beauty every living heart . ''

		No heaven is ours of lights and whirling flame For dying warriors a starlit goal But a lost country called - by a new name , Deep buried in dim valleys of the soul . ''

		A gentle land where the white singing waves Move softly under silver twilight skies , And life with her fierce wars and dreadful graves Seems but a little wind that falling sighs . ''

		The poet 's laurel and the martyr 's palm Wither , the old enchantments fade and cease ; Yet still the vision of the ancient calm Folds , round this weary world , wide wings of peace .

		These are but a few stanzas of a poem whose grave and measured beauty long haunts the mind .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's new volume is entitled '' The Muse in Exile , '' which seems to mean that its contents have been largely occasioned by the journeyings of recent years to
America	LOCATION	and elsewhere .

		To empha - size this character of the volume , it is prefaced by the lecture on `` The Poet 's Place in the Scheme of Life , '' which the author delivered upon several occa - sions during his last American visit .

		Here is an impression de voyage , which is also a graceful tribute to his American friends . ''

		How can we think Coldly of such a land , itself so warm In its accost and greeting ?

		There we win Friends whom to lose were to find life itself Less winsome .

		There , too , did we taste awhile Sorrow , not pleasure alone .

		And there we roamed Wide as from Spain-remembering shores , that watch The hues and moods of a chameleon sea Beyond
Miami	LOCATION	's palms and olive-groves To where Niagara takes the infernal plunge , And out of the grey rage of the abysm , Out of the torment , everlastingly , Upbreathes what seems , when sunlight touches it , The smoke of Hell , lost in the smile of God . ''

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 211 The volume includes several tributes to the poet 's charming Irish wife , of which '' Part of My Story '' is perhaps the tenderest . ''

		We met when you were in the
May	DATE	of life , And I had left its
June	DATE	behind me far .

		Some barren victories , much defeat and strife , Had marked my soul with many a hidden scar . ''

		I was a man deep hurt with blows that men Ne'er guessed at ; strangely weak more strangely strong ; Daring at times ; and uttering now and then , Out of a turbid heart , a limpid song . ''

		Fitful in effort , fixed and clear in aim ; Poor , but not envious of the wealth I lack ; Ever half-scaling the hard hill of fame , And ever by some evil fate flung back , '' Such did you find me , in that city grey Where we were plighted , O my comrade true : My wife , now dearer far than on the day When this our love was new . ''

		Something of the old fire burns in Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's verse when he hails the overthrow of the Turk , or expresses his indignation at the willingness of an English government to cast loyal , proud , `` great - hearted Ulster '' as a sop to the lions , or praises the plea of an American poet for the preservation of his country 's honor by keeping her pledged faith with
England	LOCATION	in the
Panama	LOCATION	matter .

		On all these themes , his song rings true , although his voice be - comes a sort of falsetto when it says `` Thou art
America	LOCATION	, dauntless Theodore . ''

		The sonnet which has this ending leaves a bad taste in the mouth .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	's volume , as a whole , contributes considerably to our pleasure , although it contains nothing comparable to the noble pieces upon which his reputation is so firmly based .

		We feel it to be the work of a man who realizes the high seriousness of the poet 's calling , and is in no danger of being lured away from his exalted mission by the verbal tricksters of the hour who impudently masquerade in the muse 's garments .

		The muse in exile is again illustrated by Mr.
Arthur Shearly Cripps	PERSON	, an Oxford man devoting his life to missionary work in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		There are recompenses for the exile in the strange new forms of beauty that unfold themselves to his vision , and in the broadening of his sympathies that came from loving interest in alien peoples .

		All this is expressed in the ballade of '' Pan 's Country , '' which is another name for
Mashonaland	LOCATION	. ''

		Did
Athens	LOCATION	' Queen , the violet-crown 'd ,
Athene	PERSON	's lore to alceris preach ?

		Did a dark galley southward-bound Ship Sophists for some Dorian beach ?

		Did one the springs of Zaden reach , And one
Cyllene	PERSON	's rock-shale spurn ?

		Be sure , Pan said his say to each They came to teach , they stayed to learn ! ''

		We that have fled green English ground For sun-tanned hills and moors that bleach More than red rubies ' worth have found In these thatched porches where we teach .

		The stoic herdsmen we beseech From food 's and raiment 's lust to turn Doth not their faith our faith impeach ?

		We came to teach , we stay to learn . ''

		We teach of Arms that wrap us round Safe from wolf 's howl and night-bird 's screech , Of Blood , whose balm from Fivefold Wound Outvies all salves of earthly leech For dying hearts ' despair and breach .

		How bright our faith 's dull embers burn In plowman 's psalm and goatherd 's speech !

		We came to teach , we stay to learn . ''

		Oxford , thy deep-voiced chimes renowned , For which our ears hark back and yearn , As sheep-bells here to shepherds sound Where shepherds teach , where shepherds learn . ''

		A dream world of elusive shapes and tremulous imaginings is half revealed to our vision by the subdued lyrics which Mr.
Robert Frost	PERSON	entitles `` A Boy 's Will . ''

		It is a world in which passion has been stilled and the soul grown quiet a world not explored with curious interest , but apprehended by the passive recipient .

		The sun does not shine , but the pale grey of twilight enfolds nature with a more gracious charm .

		The song called `` Flower - Gathering '' offers an exquisite example of the wist - ful and appealing quality of the author 's strain . ''

		I left you in the
morning	TIME	, And in the morning glow , You walked away beside me To make me sad to go .

		Do you know me in the gloaming , Gaunt and dusty grey with roaming ?

		Are you dumb because you know me not , Or dumb because you know ? ''

		All for me ?

		And not a question For the faded flowers gay That could take me from beside you For the ages of a day ?

		They are yours , and be the measure Of their worth for you to treasure , The measure of the little while That I Ve been long away . ''

		The desire of the solitary soul for companionship has rarely found such beautiful expression as it receives in this quotation : '' We make ourselves a place apart Behind light words that tease and flout , But oh , the agitated heart Till someone find us really out . ''

		`` Reluctance '' is the poem that closes the collection a lyric of lassitude with just a faint flicker of the spent fire of life . ''

		But through the fields and the woods And over the walls I have wended ; I have climbed the hills of view And looked at the world , and descended ; I have come by the highway home , And lo , it is ended . ''

		The leaves are all dead on the ground , Save those that the oak is keeping To ravel them one by one And let them go scraping and creeping Out over the crusted snow , When others are sleeping .

		212 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	'' And the dead leaves lie huddled and still , No longer blown hither and thither ; The last lone aster is gone , The flowers of the witch-hazel wither The heart is still aching to seek , But the feet question ' Whither ? ' ''

		Ah , when to the heart of a man Was it ever less than a treason To go with the drift of things To yield with a grace to reason , And bow and accept the end Of a love or a season ? ''

		If Mr.
Frost	PERSON	's verses show the cast of melancholy , there is at least nothing morbid about it .

		In their simple phrasing and patent sincerity , his songs give us the sort of pleasure that we have in those of the `` Shropshire Lad '' of Mr.
Housman	PERSON	.

		The following elegy on
Tolstoi	ORGANIZATION	well illustrates the serene dignity which is perhaps the chief char - acteristic of Mr.
John Drinkwater	PERSON	's '' Poems of Love and Earth '' : '' Not ont of his due time he moves among The immemorial silences of death , The golden ears were full , the song was sung , And the prophetic breath '' Had prophesied unto a world not wise Through a full tale of changing fiery days , And vision was no longer to his eyes Of earth 's tumultuous ways .

		`` His heart had striven long , his feet had pressed Adown the paths where many sorrows meet , Till the great heart was troubled in its quest , And tired the travelling feet . ''

		His lips have spoken , and his lips are sealed , But we shall pluck the fruits of his desire In days to be when broken love is healed , And hearts are forged in fire . ''

		Mr.
Drinkwater	PERSON	's verse has the strength that comes from severe restraint and the beauty that is revealed to the vision that pierces to the heart of life .

		Here is the last of his exquisite series of `` Roundels of the Year '' : '' The year is lapsing into time Along a deep and songless gloom , Unchapleted of leaf or bloom . ''

		And mute between the dusk and prime The diligent earth re-sets her loom , The year is lapsing into time Along a deep and songless gloom . ''

		While o'er the snows the seasons chime Their golden hopes to re-illume The brief eclipse about the tomb , The year is lapsing into time Along a deep and songless gloom , Unchapleted of leaf or bloom . ''

		This is a very slender volume , but its pages reveal an unmistakable individuality , and upon every one of them is the mark of distinction .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Oermanv from '' Criticism , '' writes Mr.
Price Collier	PERSON	, an American `` is temptingly easy when it consists , point of view .

		as ft so o f t en does , in merely noting what is different , or what is not there .

		Helpful criticism I take to be the discovery of what is there , and its revelation , with an examination of its history , its truth , and its value . ''

		In his collection of essays on ''
England	LOCATION	and the English , '' published a few years ago , Mr.
Collier	PERSON	showed that he is a very fair master of the art of helpful criticism ; and fresh evidence of the fact is supplied by his recently - published companion volume , ``
Germany	LOCATION	and the Germans '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The Germans are discussed , as were the English , from an avowedly American point of view , and the principal value of the one piece of work as of the other must arise from its tendency to promote that mutual knowledge of environments , traditions , and ideas upon which the concord of the great nations of the world must eventually be based .

		The volume opens with two chapters , aggregating a hundred pages -LRB- a sixth of the book -RRB- , undertaking to sketch the salient facts of German history from the
Cimbri	LOCATION	and Teutones to
Bismarck	PERSON	and
William II	PERSON	.

		Unfortunately , Mr.
Collier	PERSON	is no historian .

		Not only does he fail to present his material in this portion of his book in concise and orderly manner , but he is by no means always accurate in his statements of fact .

		Tacitus did not write with '' Rooseveltian enthu - siasm '' -LRB- p. 8 -RRB- concerning the rearing of children among the Germans .

		The assertion that '' more than any other one factor , the crusades broke up feudalism '' -LRB- p. 22 -RRB- is at best but a half-truth .

		Charlemagne did not sweep `` all
Europe	LOCATION	under his sway '' -LRB- p. 26 -RRB- ; not the whole of
Spain	LOCATION	, but a very small portion of it , was '' under his kingship '' -LRB- p. 26 -RRB- .

		The
University of Bologna	ORGANIZATION	was from the beginning a centre for the study of law , rather than medicine and philosophy -LRB- p. 33 -RRB- .

		Such erroneous or ques - tionable statements as these , together with other occasional lapses or sudden transitions of thought , impair seriously the value of the two chapters under consideration ; and the reader is further exasperated by faulty punctuation and careless proof-reading .

		In truth the book would have been a better one if these chapters had been omitted altogether .

		When , how - ever , the author comes to the purely descriptive por - tion of his work he arrives upon surer ground .

		He has no vantage point of special intimacy from which to write of the personality of the
Kaiser	PERSON	, yet he manages to furnish a characterization of `` the Indis - creet '' which is informing and well in accord with the generally known facts .


Berlin	LOCATION	, as a capital and metropolis , is interestingly described ; and there are readable chapters , characterized by a wholesome freshness of view , on the educational system and its connection with the progress of the country , the army , industry and its problems , the status of women , and the relations of the Empire with the outside world .

		The tone of the book is sympathetic , even
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 213 admiring ; yet , on the whole , the conclusion is rather unfavorable , and the spirit and culture of the Ger - mans are pronounced artificial and unstable .

		Ibsen 's
Fydell Edmund Garrett	PERSON	, an English ` and `` vrical political journalist who died recently , poems .

		was one of the first of his country - men to discover
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and he discovered him in the right way .

		While others were chattering about the social dramas , immersed in studies of their remark - able technique , or occupied with the discussion of their diagnosis of the ills of modern civilization ,
Garrett	PERSON	realized that the true manifestation of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's genius was to be found in '' Brand , '' and '' Peer Gynt , '' and the '' Digte . ''

		The year
1894	DATE	, in which Professor
Herf	PERSON	ord published his wonderful translation of '' Brand , '' was the year which found
Garrett	PERSON	also engaged upon an English version of that great work .

		After completing this , he turned his attention to the '' Digte , '' and translated nearly one-half of the entire number .

		All these transla - tions are now reissued under the supervision of his widow , in a volume entitled '' Lyrics and Poems from Ibsen '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		The `` Brand '' is given in
Garrett	PERSON	's final revision , and we have appended the scene of
Aase	ORGANIZATION	's death from `` Peer Gynt . ''

		The entire volume constitutes a noble tribute to
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's genius , and will be a precious possession even to those who can read him in the original Norwegian .

		We have hitherto regarded Professor
Herford	PERSON	's '' Brand '' as unapproachably successful , but we must admit that
Garrett	PERSON	's version is almost equally deserving of praise .

		Here is a test passage for comparison .

		Herf ord gives us : '' Not for us the Cross He mounted !

		Just the stirrup-slash 's stain Just the gash the cobbler scored In the shoulder of the Lord , Is our portion of this Pain . ''

		In
Garrett	PERSON	, this becomes : '' Not for us the cross was taken ; No !

		The cobbler 's stirrup-blow Which but left one purple track On the doomed Redeemer 's back , Is our fraction of His passion !

		All the rest we can forego ! ''

		Fine as the latter version is , the former is still finer and happier .

		This , however , is not always to be said , and we think that
Garrett	PERSON	is the more successful with the crucial lines that end the fourth act . ''

		Soul , be steadfast to the last !

		Till the fight of fights is o'er !

		When thine All away is cast , Loss is gain for evermore . ''

		This is truer to the original , and more inspiring to the shaken soul , than
Herford	PERSON	's '' Soul , be patient in thy pain !

		Triumph in its bitter cost .

		All to lose was all to gain ; Nought abideth but the Lost . ''

		Mr.
P. H. Wicksteed	PERSON	, - who writes an introduction to the '' Digte , '' and supplies the translations with helpful explanatory notes , gives us some words of searching criticism , of which the following may be taken for an example : '' But yet , for all his sense of the worth of life , that ' fight with trolls ' of which he was so deeply conscious indicates some exceptional feeling in
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's soul of a hostile power which cramped and conditioned his self-expression ; and his most fervent admirers must often feel that he was a haunted man , that he was in some sense possessed , that he had paid a terrible price for his insight and his achievement , and that though he was always seeking to break through to the light , he was often beset by a doubt whether darkness might not after all be the natural abode of man . ''

		The poem which
Garrett	PERSON	calls '' The Daylight Coward '' affords an illustration of this comment .

		Garrett is by no means the only translator of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's lyrics .

		Gosse ,
Boyesen	LOCATION	,
Payne	PERSON	, and others have done fragmentary work in this field , and Mr.
Percy Shedd	PERSON	has done almost as much as
Garrett	PERSON	.

		We are especially thankful to
Garrett	PERSON	for his versions of ''
Paa	ORGANIZATION	Vid - derne '' and ''
Terje Vigen	PERSON	, '' and for the group of national songs occasioned by the hour of
Denmark	LOCATION	's
Gethsemane	LOCATION	, when
Norway	LOCATION	stood aloof while the sister nation was being despoiled by the conqueror .

		Perhaps more than for anything else we should be grateful for
Garrett	PERSON	's translation of the intolerably poignant scene of
Aase	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		This preserves the lyrical swing , the '' quick broken dialogue '' and the `` racy naturalness `` of the original .

		`` To Soria-Moria Castle '' the translation is called , and it was first published in
1904	DATE	in the '' Independent Review . ''

		Fifty inness ^ r * D a i n g el > fi e kl has followed his paintings in study of the life and art of George reproduction .

		i nness w jth a most valuable supple - ment .

		In a collection called `` Fifty Paintings by George Inness '' -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	:
F. F. Sherman	PERSON	-RRB- , he presents more pictures by the artist than anyone before has been able to see together , except in the exhibition held after
Inness	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		The general impression -LRB- as of that exhibition -RRB- is very fine .

		Reproductions can never give us what the pictures do ; but what can be done by reproduction is here done for the student of Inness .

		Here he has the most important works of the painter , with note of size , date , and present place of the picture , and some introductory comment .

		Here will be found not only the better known examples from the larger collec - tions , such as the Butler Collection at the
Chicago	LOCATION	Art Institute or the
Evans Collection	ORGANIZATION	at the
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	in
Washington	LOCATION	, but also a number of less - known or generally unknown pictures from private collections .

		With such a set of photographs the student can follow for himself the development of the ideas of the painter , and of the technique can get a notion at least of the composition and general handling .

		There has not yet been made a thorough study of the work of
George Inness	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Dainger	PERSON	- field holds that no such study can be successful un - less a man will found himself upon Inness 's religious convictions and work up from that basis .

		He him - self in his Introduction points out that the earlier pictures are full of detail , while in the later '' the 214 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	fabric , the substructure , '' is kept out of sight though not less present .

		Here he is doubtless quite correct , but we wish very much that he had gone farther in the direction he has indicated .

		It would seem as if one so familiar with the artist 's ideas and his paint - ings might have sought to show us definitely how the later works are expressive of religious conviction , to indicate what the quality is that takes the place of the careful detail , to show how the spiritual sense dominates the substructure of fact .

		This , perhaps , is too much to expect in a short Introduction .

		We do not see , however , that Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	does what might be done in the way of definite study ; he appears to us to be far too fond of such critical remarks as '' Color is the music of
George Inness	PERSON	's painting . ''

		But it will perhaps be to the advantage of the student that he should not be entirely satisfied with the Introduction , he will be led to rely more upon the pictures themselves .

		And certainly in this respect the book is adequate ; there are few Amer - ican painters whose work has been better presented than is that of
George Inness	ORGANIZATION	in this volume .

		Thepertisand To readers and writers , as well as pleasure * of to publishers , Mr.
Robert Sterling	PERSON	book-publishing .

		Yard 's little book , `` The Publisher '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , with its inside information on the mys - teries of a great and honored calling , will prove of very real interest .

		Its four chapters treat of '' the worst business in the world , '' as some , not including Mr.
Yard	PERSON	, might call the publisher 's mode of making a living ; of what makes a book sell ; of that modern method of book-selling which the writer calls '' a dollar down and a dollar a minute '' ; and , finally , of the publisher , the author , and the devil , the literary agent being meant by the last designation .

		Mr.
Yard	PERSON	's experience in journalism and in book - publishing , as well as his present position as editor of a leading magazine , qualifies him to speak with first-hand knowledge of many things that take place in the world of printer 's ink , and he writes in a brisk and breezy style that carries the reader un - wearied to the end of his little book and leaves him rather regretful that it is not a bigger book .

		Its manner is not too technical for popular enjoyment , and many of the fundamental principles it touches on are principles that apply in more trades than one .

		Concerning the perennially important problem of advertising , the author says , inter alia , that the book - buying public '' is itself the eager seeker for the new and the worth while between book covers .

		And it will naturally seek its information where information can be found most easily and cheaply , namely , in the advertising pages of those periodicals habitually used by the largest number of publishers .

		There are not many of these periodicals , and it is obvious that the publisher who seeks this useful public need go little further with his advertising . ''

		Book-publishing is `` essentially a one-man business , '' he insists , `` though the wise publisher surrounds himself with strong , sympathetic advisers . ''

		On the whole , Mr.
Yard	PERSON	shows in a very attractive light the business that , as far as large and sure profits are concerned , might not unreasonably be considered the worst business in the world , but that is the only business in the world to the born publisher ; for publishers , like poets , are born , not made .

		The book closes with a certain prominent publisher 's assertion that '' pub - lishing is neither a business nor a profession .

		It is a career . ''

		Jefferson 's After a half century of
Hamilton	PERSON	- services to ianisni , it is interesting to see the the Republic .

		balance turn and
Jefferson	PERSON	come into his own again .

		A sign of the times is found in the lectures delivered at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	on the
George Blumenthal Foundation	ORGANIZATION	by the Hon.
John Sharp Williams	PERSON	, United States Senator from
Mississippi	LOCATION	, now published in a volume entitled `` Thomas Jefferson : His Permanent Influence on American Institutions '' -LRB-
Columbia University Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Rather hastily assembled and popularly written , these lectures are seven in number , and treat re - spectively of
Jefferson	PERSON	as revolutionist , democratizer of state institutions , diplomat , democratizer of federal institutions , and president , and of his influ - ence upon freedom of religion in
America	LOCATION	and upon our educational institutions .

		Jefferson has not been entirely fortunate in his biographers , many of his points of view being so at odds with those of
Europe	LOCATION	that their effect has been distorted or minimized ; but with
Senator Williams	PERSON	his radical belief in democracy finds a sympathy rather whole-hearted than discriminating .

		Yet , there being no one more unfortunate than the personage with whom his biog - rapher is not in sympathy -LRB- unless it be a fictional character under similar circumstances -RRB- , it is most agreeable to find accord so complete as in the present case , if only as a corrective to the too dis - criminating estimates heretofore current .

		Senator
Williams	PERSON	does not say , what the writer of this review believes he might truthfully have said , that American , as distinguished from European , ideas in our governments , state and federal , find their chief source in
Jefferson	LOCATION	, the opposingor Hamiltonian school grounding itself solely upon the aristocratic methods of older lands .

		He does make clear , however , that these ideas arose among English and Scotch philosophical historians , and were adapted by the genius of
Jefferson	PERSON	to our needs , and that
Jefferson	PERSON	's influence upon the French Revolution was much greater than the influence over him of either the revolutionaries or their predecessors , the encyclopaedists .

		Another interesting paper might have been written , in the nature of a synopsis of the others , on
Jefferson	PERSON	's political philosophy , upon which the modern school of individualism is based , and certainly more might have been said about the little comprehended fact that the Jeffersonian influ - ence in our government is the conservative influence , all the radical and Europeanizing measures which we have made ours having their origins in one or another of the political parties which that founded by
Jefferson	PERSON	has seen rise , grow moribund , and die ,

		To those wishing to form an estimate of
Jefferson	PERSON	's services to the Republic which will serve as an antidote to the poi - son once written about him by Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	-LRB- though Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's new party announces itself as based upon Jeffersonian ideals -RRB- , Senator
Williams	PERSON	's uni - formly interesting lectures can be freely commended .

		Under the ambitious title , '' Women Studies of ... , . '

		.

		, , , Feminism as World Builders : Studies in Mod - in action .

		ern Feminism '' -LRB-
Forbes	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Floyd Dell	PERSON	has considered the feminist movement in a manner and from a standpoint new to American discussion .

		His book is in direct line of descent from the once potent English pamphlet , written briefly , impressionistically , and with a good deal of that cleverness which made the pamphlet such a power in the days of its prime as an instrument of propaganda .

		Mr.
Dell	PERSON	's standpoint is new in that he eschews theory , after his introductory chapter , and discusses the actual contributions of living women to the new world synthesis in which self - conscious womanhood is beginning to play so im - portant a part .

		At first sight the author 's grouping of his subjects will appear rather incongruous .

		For the most part he pairs them off ,
Miss Addams	LOCATION	and Mrs.
Pankhurst	PERSON	in one chapter ,
Olive Schreiner	PERSON	and
Isadora Duncan	PERSON	in another , and so forth .

		But he succeeds in justifying these curious pairings .

		The pacific temper of
Miss Addams	LOCATION	is well con - trasted with the militant temper of Mrs.
Pankhurst	PERSON	although with Mr.
Dell	PERSON	's dictum that
Miss Addams	PERSON	's temper of conciliation is not a feminine but a mas - culine trait , and that , therefore , Mrs.
Pankhurst	PERSON	is more truly representative of feminine aspiration and method of attainment , not all of us will agree .

		The justification for pairing
Olive Schreiner	ORGANIZATION	and
Isadora Duncan	PERSON	lies in the fact that although they are super - ficially far apart , they are akin in this , that each has shown a new avenue to woman 's freedom , one through the channel of industrial activity , the other through the channel of artistic activity , emanci - pating , one the hand from idleness , and the other the body from Puritan bans upon its play activities .

		From women as a working section of the world , and apart from these other avenues of freedom which he describes them as opening up , Mr.
Dell	PERSON	expects a greater radicalism than from men , and a greater readiness to tear down our present social structures wherever they are found to obstruct the building of the new society of the future .

		Notebook , of Two considerations make `` The Note - the author of Books of
Samuel Butler	PERSON	, '' as edited `` Erewhon . ''

		ty -RSB- yj r >
Henry Festing Jones	PERSON	, of exceptional interest .

		First , the volume is a docu - ment of a little-known writer , one who failed of the ordinary literary success of getting his books published at some one else 's expense , and of getting them read by the multitude .

		This is something a priori in its favor .

		Some readers find the minor poets the truest poets , and obscure writers the most suggestive .

		A reading of
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's notes will open one 's eyes to the filmy veil between popularity and unpopularity , between obscure and luminous .


Butler	PERSON	's own explanation of his failure to secure a hearing , that he had played the enfant terrible , scattering bombs among the `` big wigs '' of both science and religion , is probably correct in part .

		Other reasons appear in the Notes : it is evident that he was somewhat vain , jealous , and -LRB- what is perhaps more dangerous to a literary reputation -RRB- overfond of a thin fancy and humorous `` small beer . ''

		Nevertheless he has recorded here many wise and witty things , most of them well worthy of the '' big wigs '' he so delighted to satirize .

		The other consideration is that these are extracts from note-books , the most intimate , piquant , first-hand revelations of a man 's mind .

		Butler 's reason for keeping such full notes is delightfully put : `` One 's thoughts fly so fast that one must shoot them ; it is no use trying to put salt on their tails . ''

		The bril - liant , wavering half-thoughts , the twilight sugges - tions , if we could only get them down just as they are , even though we never get them properly stuffed and mounted , what a delight and enrich - ment of our personality they would be !

		Note-Books such as
Hawthorne	LOCATION	's or
Butler	PERSON	's are especially rich to the literary amateur or professional .

		In them is usually to be found the most life and the best style .

		In these of
Butler	ORGANIZATION	's , moreover , we should say there is more truth than in his books , less posing and more condensation .

		This volume , com - ing at a time when more interest is being evinced in
Butler	PERSON	than at any time previous -LRB- presaging his cherished `` seventy years of immortality '' -RRB- , will do much to increase and justify perhaps regulate that interest .

		The book is published by Mr.
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	, and contains an interesting portrait .

		Perhaps the most prophetic voice f the n6W a g e > the a g e that has turned from intellectualism , pessim - ism , and utilitarianism toward the gospel of the will , of effort for personality 's sake and without dogmatic guarantee of ultimate victory for man , and the most vigorous exponent of its tendencies , is the Frenchman ,
M. Romain Rolland	PERSON	.

		From the standpoint of this gospel have all his later works been written .

		His biographical writings may be regarded as canonical books in a new and entirely human scripture .

		The way of life for it is that rather than a world view ,
M. Rolland	PERSON	being doc - trinally agnostic which he lays down in `` Jean Christophe , '' he illustrates in these biographies .

		`` The Life of Michael Angelo '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , as trans - lated by Mr.
Frederic Lees	PERSON	, is the life not primarily of an artist but of a personality .

		And majestic indeed is the personality , a Hercules whose labors have been multiplied endlessly , who stands before us in these pages .

		The actual graphic and plastic work of
Michael Angelo	PERSON	was so subordinated to 216 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	the demands of his unscrupulous employers of the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	that he ultimately lost faith in much of it .

		Nearer to his heart came to be his quest of beauty through love a quest made in the purest spirit of Platonism and finding its best fruit in the religious
Vittoria Colonna	PERSON	, the woman who '' could understand this old child , alone and lost in the world , and bring to his bruised soul a little peace , a little confidence , a little reason , and the melancholy acceptance of life and death . ''

		But
Vittoria	PERSON	died in
1547	DATE	, and it was not until
1564	DATE	that
Michael Angelo	PERSON	, after an ever more solitary and pain-racked life , at last , as he had long hoped to do , `` left time behind him . ''

		As might be expected from the mode of his treatment ,
M. Holland	ORGANIZATION	draws heavily on the sonnets throughout the course of his book , and he gives in an appendix a comprehensive selection of the most personal and beautiful of these in the original Italian .

		The book is illustrated with reproductions of the best-known works of its subject .

		A di , a P pomtin So vital and interesting a figure was boot about
William Ernest Henley	PERSON	, and so little
W. E. Henley	PERSON	, concerning him has found its way into print , that one takes up with pleasurable expec - tation the little book by Mr.
L. Cope Cornford	PERSON	, re - cently published by
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their series of '' Modern Biographies . ''

		But the work is almost a complete disappointment .

		It adds nothing to our knowledge of
Henley	LOCATION	as a man , and gives us no fresh or illuminating interpretation of his writ - ings .

		Of the author 's crude and labored style , the following sentence is a not unfair example : '' At any rate , when he arrived he was desperate ; and when
Lister	PERSON	asked him why he had come to him ,
Lister	PERSON	,
Henley	ORGANIZATION	replied in plain terms that it was because the rest of the medical profession had declared that he , Professor
Lister	PERSON	, was -LRB- in effect -RRB- totally incompe - tent . ''

		And here is one of the complete paragraphs : `` In
1889	DATE	, was born
Henley	ORGANIZATION	's only child ,
Margaret	PERSON	.

		Her portrait was painted in oils by
Charles Welling	PERSON	- ton

Germany	LOCATION	ten years ago .

		The Oxford Book of Latin Verse '' -LRB- Frowde -RRB- , edited by Mr.
H. W. Garrod	PERSON	, excludes epic and the drama and a large part of the Latin literature which is technically poetry but gives little or no aesthetic pleasure to its readers .

		Satire , also , is excluded , which leaves out Juvenal ,
Persius	PERSON	, and much of
Horace	PERSON	.

		Otherwise , the selection includes a great variety of matter .

		A few '' favorite '' English translations and imitations are ap - pended .

		`` The Great Lakes Series '' -LRB-
Ainsworth	PERSON	-RRB- , a set of supplementary reading-books for elementary schools by Dr.
Edward Payson Morton	PERSON	, recounts the story of American history as it was developed by the explora - tion and settlement of the great lakes .

		The series begins with '' The
Mohawk Valley	LOCATION	and
Lake Ontario	LOCATION	'' and ''
Lake Erie	LOCATION	and the Story of Commodore Perry . ''

		The idea is an excellent one , and the material is of fascinating interest . ''


Italy	LOCATION	To-day , '' by Messrs.
Bolton King	PERSON	and
Thomas Okey	PERSON	, which in the twelve years since its original pub - lication seems to have been accepted as probably the best accouut in English of current political and social questions in
Italy	LOCATION	, now reappears with the imprint of Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	in a '' new and revised edition . ''

		Al - though the title-page bears date of
1913	DATE	, we infer from a prefatory note that this is merely a reprint of the second English edition , with revisions down to
1909	DATE	only .

		Thus the vitally important events and develop - ments of the past four years are left untouched .

		Following its handsome reprint of Bulwer-Lytton 's letters to
Macready	PERSON	, published a year or so ago , the
Carteret Book Club	ORGANIZATION	of
Newark	LOCATION	,
N. J.	PERSON	, now puts forth two brochures , containing a brief essay entitled '' Criti - cism '' byWaltWhitman and an `` Appreciation of
Charles Dickens	PERSON	'' by
Charles Dudley Warner	PERSON	.

		It is believed that neither of these has ever before appeared in print .

		Fragmentary as they are , there is real pith and matter in both essays ; while the distinctive form in which they are issued , together with the fact that they are virtually first editions , will doubtless make them eagerly sought after by collectors .

		The edition is limited to one hundred copies in each case .

		The discussion occasioned by Mr.
Morley Roberts	PERSON	's recent '' revelations '' of
George Gissing	PERSON	's private life makes particularly timely the publication of a new edi - tion of
Gissing	PERSON	's '' Private Papers of
Henry Ryecroft	PERSON	, '' which Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	now issue in a handsomely - printed octavo , with a fine reproduction of Mr.
Will Rothenstein	PERSON	's lithographic portrait as frontispiece .

		Published originally ten years ago -LRB- soon after
Gissing	PERSON	's death -RRB- , this book has gone through many editions , and has found a wide circle of readers .

		It is a book unlike any other that we know of , a spiritual autobiography of the purest type , full of mellow thought finely ex - pressed and pervaded by a rare human charm .

		Those who would know what manner of man
George Gissing	PERSON	was should read , not Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	's injudicious and in - consequential volume , but '' The Private Papers of
Henry Ryecroft	PERSON	. ''

		A volume that should be of value to high school teachers of literature has been prepared by Miss
Sarah E. Simons	PERSON	and Mr.
Clem Irwin Orr	PERSON	, of the
Washington	LOCATION	schools , under the title of '' Dramatization '' -LRB-
Scott , Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The aim is '' to give practical sug - gestions for the dramatization of high school classics , '' not primarily as a means of entertainment , but as an aid to instruction .

		The pedagogy of dramatization is dis - cussed and the problem of staging carefully considered .

		Twenty or more scenes from novels , short stories , epics , and ballads are rewritten for stage presentation ; these are intended to be merely illustrative .

		The editors re - gard simplicity as the keynote to successful work in the high school .

		While some of their suggestions may be beyond the resources of the smaller school , the volume should be in many places practicable and in all sug - gestive .

London	LOCATION	in
1834	DATE	, and though brought up to follow the profession of civil engineer , he turned at an early age to literature and archeology .

		His first book , '' Memoirs of
William Hazlitt	PERSON	, '' appeared in
1867	DATE	.

		Among the more notable of his other writings are the following : '' The Venetian Republic , '' `` Four Generations of a Literary Family , '' '' Leisure Intervals '' -LRB- poems -RRB- , '' The Lambs , '' '' Lamb and
Hazlitt	PERSON	, '' `` Shakespeare : The Man and his Work , '' and `` Faiths and Folklore . ''

		He edited important edi - tions of
Warton	ORGANIZATION	's History of English Poetry ,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's Letters ,
Dodsley	ORGANIZATION	's Old Plays , and
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's Essays and Letters , as well as an eight-volume series of '' Bib - liographical Collections and Notes . ''

		After a long life-time of neglect , the great French naturalist
M. Henri Fabre	PERSON	seems at last to be coming into his own .

		The three volumes of selections from his Souvenirs entomologiques already published are to be fol - lowed by a complete translation into English , made by Mr.
Alexander Teixeira de Mattos	PERSON	, of the entire ten volumes of the Souvenirs .

		Instead of following the chronological order of the original , the translator has devised a series of volumes each of which will be de - voted to a specific order of insects .

		The first of these has already appeared , under the title of `` The Life of the Spider '' ; and the second , `` The Life of the Fly , '' will be published immediately .

		This is to be followed by '' The Wild Bee , '' with a chapter on the Red Ants ; and then in due course will appear volumes on the Beetle and the
Weevil	LOCATION	, the Wasp , the
Grasshopper	LOCATION	, the Butter - fly and the Moth , the Bug , and the Scorpion .

		The translation , which is an authorized one , will be published in this country by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		We note , in this connection , that besides the very interesting Life of Fabre by Dr.
G. V. Legros	PERSON	recently issued in English translation , another and more extended biography has been completed by the naturalist 's namesake and distant kinsman ,
M. Augustin Fabre	PERSON	.

		218 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL , BOOKS .

		It has been the custom of THE DIAL for many years past to place before its readers at this time a complete classified list of books announced for issue during the Fall and
Winter	DATE	season by the principal American publishers .

		These lists , care - fully compiled for our pages from authentic infor - mation obtained especially for this purpose , have come to be accepted as a feature of the utmost interest and value to librarians , booksellers , and private book-buyers .

		The list for the present year , herewith presented , contains over seventeen hundred titles , representing the output of about sixty pub - lishers .

		Considerations of space make necessary the carrying over to our next issue of two depart - ments `` School and College Text-Books '' and `` Books for the Young . ''

		274 THE MUSE IN A PET .

		In his brilliant but hopelessly wrong-headed essay on
Victor Hugo	PERSON	,
Frederic Myers	PERSON	com - ments upon a poem in `` L'Annee Terrible '' in which the author `` paints at great length and with startling rhetoric the possibility that God may at last be found to have deceived us all along that ` the moral cosmos may be re - duced to a chaos , ' and man , the sport of destiny , expire in a ruined universe . ''

		In that event , the poet informs us that he himself , `` terrible , indigne , calme , extraordinaire , '' will denounce God to his own thunders .

		Whereupon the essayist remarks : `` M. Hugo , forsooth , would be terrible !

		M. Hugo would be calm !

		M. Hugo would be extraordinary !

		It seems likely that at the crack of doom even M. Hugo might see something more terrible and extraordinary than himself . ''


Signer Marinetti	PERSON	, the Italian apostle of `` futurism , '' would meet such an exigency unperturbed .

		That he can be '' more than usual calm '' under trying circumstances we know from his own admission .

		When , two or three years ago , he confronted in the Mer - cadante Theatre of
Naples	LOCATION	a hostile audience of `` pastists , '' he showed his quality in a way which only his own words can fittingly describe .

		`` Suddenly , among the parabolas of potatoes and rotten fruits , I caught on the fly an orange thrown at me .

		I peeled it with the greatest calmness , and ate it slowly , by sections . ''

		This daring action turned the tide ; the audience which came to curse remained to applaud , and `` I hastened , of course , to thank the bellowing crowd by hurling fresh insults at them . ''

		We are not told how many heads were broken in the scrimmage that followed , and our chief interest in the episode lies in the fact that there are still to be found somewhere in our indifferent modern world audiences who can get really excited over discussions of art and literature .

		If we could only detach from the subject to which the pink envelopes of our newspapers are devoted even a small fraction of the popular interest which it commands , and divert this interest to some sub - ject of high human concern , such as poetry or painting , we should accomplish something really worth while , and put all our expensive educa - tional institutions to shame .

		The bedlamite ravings of the futurists , and 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	their nightmare creations of the pen and the brush , have at least this of value : they arouse passions and provoke thought .

		Worthier objects of passion and thought there doubtless are in the world of art , but a lively interest in things aesthetic , even if stimulated by the most ignoble examples , is better than no interest at all , for that way lies spiritual stagnation .

		Thus in poetry a
Marinetti	PERSON	or an
Ezra Pound	ORGANIZATION	may have his uses , and the Muse in a pet , or a tantrum , although bad-mannered and unconcerned with the amenities of criticism , may serve to remind us of the existence of
Parnassus	LOCATION	, a fact which men battening on the moors of philistinism are in danger of forgetting .

		As Mr.
Scott-James	PERSON	has just said in '' The North American Review , '' '' poetry has now become a mentionable subject in decent society , '' which is a condition of things that we must applaud , even if we owe it to poets and critics who browse upon only the lower slopes of the sacred hill or who wallow in the morasses at its base .

		The futurist muse has very decided ideas of what she does not like in poetry , although the sort of thing she offers as a substitute is , to say the least , disconcerting .

		She is bent , according to
Signor Marinetti	PERSON	, upon the destruction at any cost of these four intellectual poisons : `` 1 , The sickly and nostalgic poetry of distance and recol - lection ; 2 , Romantic sentimentalism rippling in the moonlight , with its fatal ideal of woman - beauty ; 3 , The obsession of lust , with the tri - angle of adultery , the pepper of incest , and the exciting seasoning of sin in the Christian sense ; 4 , The deep passion for the past , accompanied by the craze of the antiquarian and collector . ''

		Poetry without these themes or sources of inspir - ation would be considerably at a loss , we should say .

		After such a clean sweep of his normal sustenance from the board , the poet might well feel himself , as
Tennyson	PERSON	did after he had been
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's -LRB- vegetarian -RRB- guest for some weeks , '' A thing enskied -LRB- As Shakespeare has it -RRB- airy light To float above the ways of men . ''

		The only writers of the past -LRB- poets or others -RRB- that futurism accepts as having at least groped toward the right path are
Ernile Zola	ORGANIZATION	,
Walt Whitman	PERSON	, Rosny aine ,
Paul Adam	PERSON	, Octave Mir - beau ,
Gustave Kahn	PERSON	, and
Verhaeren	PERSON	.

		All the others are left to the outer darkness .

		But we must not forget the automobile and the aeroplane and the blast furnace , for these are types of the energy which is so dear to the futu - rist mind , and are the effective substitutes of - fered for all the sentimental rubbish of the past .

		With these symbols one can go far in the futurist world of creating , and it is no wonder that we find
Signor Marinetti	PERSON	lecturing the English upon `` ce deplorable
Ruskin	PERSON	, '' who despised them so heartily .

		Futurism is nothing if not thorough - going , and it lays its axe at the very roots of the written language .

		Punctuation , adjectives , and adverbs are all to be abolished , and all verbs are to be used in the infinitive .

		When the rules of diction laid down for writers are relentlessly ap - plied , we get such a farrago as the following , which is taken from a sample piece of descriptive writing devoted to the battle-field : `` Tours canons virilite voices erection telernetre extase toumbtournb 3 secondes toumb-toumb flots sourires rires ploff plouff glouglouglouglou cache-cache cristaux vierges chair bijoux perles iodes sels bromes jupons gaz liqueurs bulles 3 secondes . ''

		It reads like a cipher cable code , and if such is to be the literature of the fu - ture , we shall all have to begin our education over again .

		The futurist manifesto offers us one delightful rule of conduct so inclusive as to make most further directions superfluous .

		`` We must spit upon the altar of art every day . ''

		Simple and to the point !

		Signor
Mari	PERSON	- netti reminds us of the bad boy who , in `` The Session of the Poets , '' created a scandal by get - ting up and shouting : '' I disbelieve wholly in everything !

		There ! ''

		In a frequently quoted letter ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	speaks of the time , now near at hand , when we shall advance with a leap into the coming age .

		`` Hej !

		How ideas will tumble about us ! ''

		Ideas certainly tumble about us when we get into futurist company , and the degringolade of the old aesthetic order assails our ears with such a clattering as might be imagined if the gentleman in the futurist painting , '' Nu descen - dant 1 ` escalier , '' should suddenly fall to pieces .

		It would be a matter for jest merely , were it not the logical outcome of that sinister tendency of our time to reject all the established teach - ings and ideals of the past , all the rules of con - duct and canons of belief by which the social and the intellectual order have thus far been kept together , and the history of civilization held in continuity .

		If we dally overmuch with the destructive notions that are invading our political and social life on every hand , and refuse recognition to the old settled sanctities of con - duct and belief , we shall assuredly be called upon to pay some kind of a penalty , and no light one , for our indecision .

		History will
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 247 always be mankind 's best mentor , and the term `` pastist , '' coined for reproach by our amusing futurist friends , will be accepted as a title of honor by every serioiis fighter for human wel - fare .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE LIVING SIGNIFICANCE OF LATIN , a so-called dead language , has never been more convincingly demonstrated than hy Miss
Frances Ellis Sabin	PERSON	, assisted by Miss
Loura B. Woodruff	PERSON	, in their excel - lent handbook on `` The Relation of Latin to Prac - tical Life , '' described in its sub-title as a collection of `` concrete illustrations in the form of an exhibit . ''

		Miss
Sabin	PERSON	, who is at the head of the Latin depart - ment in the Oak Park and River Forest -LRB-
Illinois	LOCATION	-RRB-
Township High School	ORGANIZATION	, has undertaken to supply Latin teachers and Latin students with such unan - swerable arguments in favor of Latin studies as shall forever stop the mouths of objectors to those studies .

		And her exhibit , as she calls it , is indeed impressive , showing , with the aid of graphic and other illustration , how the life and literature and language of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	are woven into the very texture of modern every-day thought and speech and action .

		Incidentally and unavoidably the significance of Greek to the world of to-day is often touched upon .

		An `` outline '' sketches in nine brief proposi - tions the plan of the handbook , and sixty ' exhibits '' bring strikingly to one 's notice the many and varied proofs of these propositions .

		Large wall - cards for the display of these proofs and illustrations accom - pany the handbook , the whole being prepared under the auspices of the
Classical Association of the Middle West	ORGANIZATION	and South , and procurable from
Miss Sabin	LOCATION	.

		The author 's list of '' problems of to-day '' that were `` live questions in
Rome	LOCATION	'' is of especial interest .

		First comes a humorously appropriate cartoon by Mr.
J. T. McCutcheon	PERSON	, and then the list : `` The high cost of living , election of candidates by direct vote of the people , relation between business and politics , government control of public utilities , maintenance of the army and
navy	ORGANIZATION	, graft in the business world , methods of taxation , corruption in politics , the race problem , the labor problem , capital punishment , foreign relations , lawlessness , suffrage , class privilege , eugenics , divorce , education , religion , immigration . ''

		Probably the most generally con - vincing demonstrations in the book are those dealing with language and literature and illustrating the indebtedness of our daily speech , our familiar allu - sions , our habits of thought , our reading and our writing , to the language and literature and life of ancient
Rome	LOCATION	.

		Ample room is left for additional illustrations on the large wall-cards , thus calling for originality and resourcefulness on the teacher 's or lecturer 's part .

		Mention should here be made also of the many authorities quoted in favor of classical studies in modern education .

		REVISING THE VULGATE , in order to determine the exact wording of
St. Jerome	ORGANIZATION	's Latin version of the fourth century , in compliance with the behest of Pope
Pius X.	PERSON	, will be a tremendous task for the commission appointed six years ago by papal decree .

		Individual members of that body will pass away and be replaced by others long before the work is completed , but the commission will abide , and will at last bring to an end the most stupendous under - taking in text-revision that the world has seen .

		Abbot
Dom Gasquet	PERSON	, head of the Benedictine order in
England	LOCATION	, and chairman of the revision commis - sion , has come to this country to report the progress already made in the great work and to solicit finan - cial aid for its further prosecution .

		The biblical manuscripts to be hunted up and collated are beyond counting , but the ultimate fruits of all this dusty research will be , it is promised , of great value to Bible students of whatever shade of orthodoxy or heterodoxy .

		Benedictine scholars have been sent out by
Abbot Gasquet	PERSON	to ransack the libraries and archives of
Europe	LOCATION	, from the sunny shores of the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	to the bleak steppes of northern
Russia	LOCATION	.

		Doors have been flung open to these emis - saries , and mouldering piles of parchment submitted to their scrutiny , so that by this time some fourteen thousand biblical manuscripts , containing thirty thou - sand pages , have been brought to light .

		Since it was impossible to gather this mass of material in one place for necessary study and collation , the modern method of photography has been employed with the ancient texts , and eventually there will be completed at
Rome	LOCATION	a library of folio volumes displaying with minute accuracy all the variations that , as far as can be learned , the
St. Jerome	ORGANIZATION	version has ever under - gone .

		Already the book of Genesis has been thus revised and printed , and the Abbot hopes to live to see the completion of the
Pentateuch	LOCATION	and the Psalms .

		This is one of the scholarly labors that , like the
Oxford English Dictionary	ORGANIZATION	and the
Jewish Encyclo	PERSON	- paedia , inspire respect for the patient and commonly obscure and not too well-paid toiler in that field of arduous research whence issue so many of the useful and necessary literary tools that equip the reference rooms of our libraries , great and small .

		THE HIGHEST PRAISE OF A WORK OF LITERATURE is perhaps contained in the reader 's sigh of regret that he himself could not have been its author , a regret not infrequently accompanied by an idle and foolish fancy that he might have been its author if he had only thought of it in time .

		It is oftener the form than the substance of a piece of writing that evokes this feeling the clothing in faultless language what oft was thought but ne'er so well expressed .

		Blanco White 's famous sonnet , '' Night and Death , '' pronounced by many admirers to be the most nearly perfect sonnet in the English tongue , contains no thought that has not occurred , more or less vaguely , to hundreds of other ponderers on the mysteries of existence ; but so apt is the imagery 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	and so fitting the language that one immediately recognizes a masterpiece in the little poem .

		Then , it may be , comes the query , Why did the English - speaking world have to wait so many centuries for this obviously best and , so to say , inevitable mode of expressing that thought ?

		Another sonnet , chanced upon in a magazine ten years ago , struck at least one reader as voicing almost perfectly a thought familiar to thousands of reflective persons , but never before so aptly uttered .

		It was Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	's poem entitled '' Man 's Hidden Side , '' con - ceived in a mood not so very unlike that which prompted White 's '' Death and Night . ''

		Let it here be reprinted , to give point to this paragraph . ''

		The Moon , that earthward turns her radiant face As if she would without reserve confide Herself to us , conceals a secret side Whereof no mortal ever hopes to trace The dark-environed clue .

		It is a place Where strange abysmal phantasms may abide , Where Gloom 's abhorrent progenies may hide Emprisoned by the ebon walls of Space .

		Each one of us , however gay and bright To those that dream they know us we appear , However frankly we may keep in sight Our alternating phases through the year , Have , like the
Moon	PERSON	, a side that lies in night , Unknown to those to whom we are most dear . ''

		READERS ' HABITS are almost as many and varied as are the readers themselves .

		In support of this obvious proposition it will not here be necessary to adduce a multitude of instances , but it may be of interest to consider for a moment the very general tendency of the reading public to do unnecessary violence to books .

		The `` gentle reader '' leaves every book he reads in just as good condition , as far as the unaided eye can see , as when he began it .

		Not so the rude reader .

		At
Mount Vernon	LOCATION	,
N.Y.	LOCATION	, where there is a considerable immigrant population , it has been found that books borrowed from the pub - lic library by the horny-handed sons of toil are not unlikely to receive hard usage .

		Especially is this true of books taken by Italian working men .

		There - fore it is that one now sees pasted on the covers of all Italian books in the library the following friendly appeal to the borrower -LRB- we give the English trans - lation , retaining the familiar thou 's and thee 's -RRB- : `` This book is of wise advice and useful information for thee .

		Treat it well , as thou would ` st a good friend .

		Do not rumple it .

		Do not soil it .

		Do not tear it .

		Think that after having been useful to thee it must be of service to a great number of thy com - patriots .

		To damage it , to tear it , to soil it , would give a bad impression of thee and prevent other Italians getting benefit from this book .

		Respect this volume for the good name and for the advantage of Italians ! ''

		Moreover , as an object lesson where needed , a copy is exhibited of '' The Immigrant 's Guide '' so completely used up in one borrowing as to be of no further service , and by its side is shown a copy of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's '' Divina Commedia '' printed at
Venice	LOCATION	in
1529	DATE	, and still in as good condition as when it left the press , nearly four centuries ago .

		Mr.
John Foster Carr	PERSON	, in a recent address printed in `` The
Massachusetts	LOCATION	Library Club Bulletin , '' re - lates the Mt.
Vernon	PERSON	incident , and has other notable things to say about the relations between public library and foreigner .

		THE FRANKLINISM OF MAYOR
GAYNOR	PERSON	was not so marked as to ensure the future coupling of his name with that of the
Philadelphia	LOCATION	printer and philosopher , but it is true that both had something of the same shrewd common-sense and homely wisdom , that both could give apt and terse expres - sion to this practical sagacity , and that both were men of the people , plain in their ways and simple in their tastes .

		Almost simultaneously with Mr.
Gaynor	PERSON	's death there appears a volume entitled '' Mayor
Gaynor	PERSON	's Letters and Speeches , '' in which those interested in such comparisons can find pas - sages not so very unlike in style the published let - ters of
Franklin	LOCATION	; at least there is the likeness of pronounced individuality , of honest intent , and of great readiness in the expression of thought and opinion .

		Each man was distinctly a `` character , '' largely because each dared to be himself ; and probably
Franklin	PERSON	would have said of his own style of writing very much what the late mayor wrote in answer to an inquiry from a newspaper editor : '' I fear you will find no art in my let - ters ... What is the best way to write things , you ask ?

		Often the best way is not to write them .

		But if you do , the simple way is the best . ''

		In one respect , however , it would be difficult to find an equal to
Franklin	PERSON	as a letter-writer and auto - biographer , and that is the artless candor with which he tells us all the worst there is to be told about himself .

		Such astonishing frankness would be impossible with almost anyone else , and will be looked for in vain in Mr.
Gaynor	PERSON	's writings , which , be it added , contain , here and there , more of acerbity , of passion , of lack of self-control and philosophic calm , than can be found in
Franklin	LOCATION	.

		EARLY
CALIFORNIA	LOCATION	MAGAZINES , the product of an age when Californians might be supposed to have had enough to occupy them in the mere getting of a living , were of a number and a quality that reflect credit on the literary aspirations of those gold - digging pioneers of more than half a century ago .

		At the late eighteenth annual meeting of the
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, succinctly reported in `` News Notes of
California	LOCATION	Libraries , '' Mr.
Robert E. Cowan	PERSON	of
San Francisco	LOCATION	presented a paper on '' The Magazines of
California	LOCATION	. ''

		Besides the un - successful ventures that died a very early death , there were `` The Pioneer , '' ''
Hutchinson	PERSON	's
California	LOCATION	Magazine , '' `` The Hesperian , '' and `` The
California	LOCATION	Mountaineer . ''

		Soon afterward appeared '' The Overland Monthly , '' made illustrious by
Bret Harte	PERSON	's connection with it , and still in existence .

		Later Cali - fornia magazines , such as '' The Land of Sunshine , ' '' '' Out West , '' '' Sunset , '' and '' The Pacific Monthly , '
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 249 are surprisingly numerous for a region comparatively sparse in its population , and their quality is credit - able , sometimes even more than that .

		Many of
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia 's early periodicals and newspapers have passed into utter oblivion because , Mr.
Cowan	PERSON	says , '' the libraries of early days neglected their opportunities , and at the present time disaffection is not altogether unknown .

		Much of the material for the history of
California	LOCATION	has disappeared forever because of the failure of those in responsibility to heed the fine old counsel , carpe diem '' Perhaps , however , those in responsibility did heed the counsel , but in a too Horatian sense .

		A bibliographical study of
Cali	LOCATION	- fornia magazines will accompany Mr.
Cowan	PERSON	's paper when it is printed in the proceedings of the meeting .

		ALL OK NOTHING OF AN AUTHOR is the rule of a certain class of rigorously thorough readers , and there is something to be said in its favor .

		Still there is more than a grain of truth in the assertion made by Dr.
E. Benjamin Andrews	PERSON	in a recent magazine article on `` Education through Reading , '' that `` it is the mark or a great writer to have uttered a good deal of trash . ''

		Anyone can easily name , in the works of even his favorite author , certain books or parts of books that hardly add to the writer 's fame .

		Who is there that reads with enthusiastic delight
Shakespeare	PERSON	's `` Pericles , '' or
Scott	PERSON	's `` St.
Ronan	PERSON	's Well , '' or
Dickens	PERSON	's `` Hard Times , '' or
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's long-winded digressions in `` Les Misdrables , '' or
Browning	PERSON	's `` Luria , '' or
Longfellow	LOCATION	's `` New En - gland Tragedies '' ?

		Voluminous writers must inevi - tably leave behind them much work inferior to their best , as they also leave much that is superior to their worst , and it is pure pedantry to insist on going straight through any given author after once beginning him .

		The mere satisfaction of being able to say that one has read all of Goethe , or
Cowper	PERSON	, or
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	, or
Thackeray	PERSON	, or
James Fenimore Cooper	PERSON	, is not worth the labor required to win it , though many there are who read not for present enjoyment , but for the future fancied distinction of having read .

		President
Andrews	PERSON	repeats the story of the young lady who wished to convey the impression of an acquaintance with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, but when she was asked if she was familiar with ''
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, '' answered that she had often read `` Romeo , '' but `` Juliet '' had always been out when she asked for it at the library .

		This recalls the utterance of another young lady who , after running over the entries under '' Homer '' in the card catalogue , proudly declared that she had read all his works except the opera omnia .

		THE BOOKSELLER 'S POINT OF VIEW is one that the librarian ought now and then to try to take , with an effort of the sympathetic imagination , when he find himself inclined to clamor too loudly for a more liberal discount on his purchases .

		The book - dealer must live , even though some near-sighted buyers of his wares may not see the necessity .

		In proof of the really considerate treatment accorded to his library customers by the seller of books , listen to what Mr.
William B. Clarke	PERSON	, the
Boston	LOCATION	bibliopole , said to the
Massachusetts Library Club	ORGANIZATION	at its recent meeting in the halls of
Williams Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege .

		His informal , heart-to-heart talk tended to show the exceeding smallness , if not less than noth - ingness , of the profit made on the sale of new books to libraries , as at present conducted .

		From the
spring of 1912	DATE	to the
spring of 1913	DATE	he had kept a careful record of the cost and sale of all books furnished to libraries at the regular library discount of ten per cent on net books and thirty-three and one-third per cent on others , and the final summing up demonstrated `` a possible gross profit of .207 per cent against a 28 per cent expense ; but as fif - teen and one-half per cent of these books were re - turned , it left a gross profit on library sales for that year of .159 per cent against a 28 per cent expense .

		Unsalable books increased this loss still more when sold upon the bargain counter . ''

		This may not represent a fair average of profits realized , the world over , in supplying libraries with books ; but it is certain that these institutions , with many deal - ers bidding for their trade , do receive a not illiberal treatment ... ORNATE ORATORY , such as we associate with the names of
Burke	PERSON	and
Chatham	LOCATION	and
Patrick Henry	PERSON	and statesmen generally of the eighteenth century , and such as we were wont to select for purposes of declamation in our school days , is not common in these degenerate times of hurry and hustle and hard common-sense .

		All the more gladly , therefore , do we hail its brief revival in our national legislature , where Representative Gray of
Indiana	LOCATION	recently re - lieved the tedium of a long
summer	DATE	's dragging de - liberation over important issues with the following poetic effusion : `` It has always been my practice to vote against the previous question where there has been no opportunity for full discussion .

		But this discussion began in the early springtime and has continued during the long , weary months of a torrid
summer	DATE	.

		The birds have nested and flown with their young ; the flowers have bloomed and faded ; the harvests have ripened and been garnered in ; the beetles are already singing the dirges of a dying year ; the fall has come with the sere and yellow leaf of decay , with wailing winds and naked woods and meadows brown and sere ; the first breath of winter is upon our cheek to chill us .

		Looking squarely at my platform pledges to the people , I was ready to voce for the previous question . ''

		It need hardly be added that when the vote was taken , after this poetic burst in favor of the motion , it was triumphantly carried .

		PROMISCUOUS READING , in a sense not usually attached to the phrase , came up for discussion some months ago at a meeting of
the North Midland Library Association of England	ORGANIZATION	.

		A paper was read by the city librarian of
Peterborough	LOCATION	on the question of providing separate reading-rooms for women , and the substance of it was a strong argument for the mingling of the sexes in their use of the public 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	library 's store of printed matter .

		Many of the older English libraries and even some of the newer ones have separate rooms for readers of the sex once known in that country as `` gentle , '' but the
Peter	PERSON	- borough librarian advocated their abolition for the following five reasons : the recent educational and social advance of women has placed them in a posi - tion where they themselves cease to ask for separate reading-rooms ; to provide such rooms where there is little or no demand for them would be an unwar - ranted expenditure ; where there are such rooms they contain only papers and magazines peculiarly feminine in tone and character -LRB- and hence , pre - sumably , not over-inviting to large numbers of women readers , or remarkably valuable as litera - ture -RRB- ; duplication of other reading matter already available in the general reading-room is in most cases impossible because of the expense involved ; and , finally , common reading-rooms for both sexes '' tend to promote a better tone , a general raising of the standard of behaviour , and a keener apprecia - tion of the whole institution . ''

		The editor of the Baroda `` Library Miscellany , '' commenting on the
Peterborough	LOCATION	librarian 's paper , shows a far keener interest in the question than can be felt outside of
India	LOCATION	and the
East	LOCATION	, where the state of women is such that a special reading-room for their use is often necessary if they are to frequent the library at all .

		AKMINIUS VAMBEBY , who died
September 15	DATE	in his eighty-second year , was a romantically interesting character as well as a very learned scholar , a daring explorer , and a prolific writer .

		Professor of oriental languages at
Pesth University	ORGANIZATION	, he possessed a variety of learning , had been through a multitude of adven - turous experiences , and was the holder of almost innumerable degrees and honors and society mem - berships , such as are boasted by few occupants of academic chairs .


Hermann Bamberger	PERSON	was his German-Jewish name before he Magyarized it into Arminius Vambery .

		Among his best-known books are `` Travels in
Central Asia	LOCATION	, '' `` History of Bok - hara , '' `` Arminius Vambery : His Life and Adven - tures , '' `` The Coming Struggle for
India	LOCATION	, '' `` The Story of My Struggles , '' '' Western Culture in Eastern Lands , '' and works on the literature , languages , and ethnography of
Central Asia	LOCATION	.

		He was born in pov - erty and forced to make his own way ; by what means he succeeded in doing it is most interestingly told in his own autobiographical writings .

		* PECULIARITIES OF THE PAY COLLECTION of new fiction in public libraries come to our notice from time to time , but thus far it seems to have developed no objectionable traits such as might warrant its dis - continuance .

		At
Redlands	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, as is recorded in the Nineteenth Annual Report of the public library of that city , the original purpose was to let the pay collection include some of the ephemeral , temporarily popular fiction that it was thought undesirable to place permanently on the shelves .

		But the good people of
Redlands	LOCATION	did not view this policy with unanimous approval , some of the citizens regarding it as contrary to the intent of a free public library .

		Consequently it was decided to offer no books to the paying patron that were not also placed at the dis - posal of those unwilling or unable to pay a modest fee for a special privilege .

		The little incident is strikingly illustrative of certain not too amiable qual - ities in our common human nature .

		But there is one slightly redeeming feature to its unloveliness : on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast the copper cent is all but un - known , so that not even the most rapid reader of a pay-collection novel could escape the necessity of parting with at least
five cents	MONEY	for the privilege enjoyed a difference that would amount to some - thing considerable in the case of a novel-a-day reader .

		THE AUTHOR OF `` ON THE BRANCH , '' known in the world of books as `` Pierre de Coulevain , '' but whom the well-informed cataloguer places under `` F '' as `` Mile .

		Favre de Coulevain , '' leaves many readers to regret her too-early death .

		Report avers that she was born in
1845	DATE	at
Geneva	LOCATION	, a suitable birthplace for one of her cosmopolitan tastes and international fame .

		She was a close observer of manners and customs , as can be seen in such works of hers as `` L'lle Inconnue , '' in which persons and things British are subjected to her scrutiny , and `` Noblesse Ame * ricaine , '' a title that explains itself .

		`` Eve Victorieuse '' and `` Sur la Branche '' are also among her well-known books .

		Translations of her chief works have appeared in English , if not also in other languages .

		From at least one of them , `` The Unknown Isle , '' interesting revelations and hints as to her personal history may be obtained .

		`` On the Branch '' -LRB- rather perplexing in its title -RRB- has proved a popular novel in its English dress as also in its original French .

		... MINUTELY SUBDIVIDED LITERATURE is clearly to be found on the shelves of the public library that makes the following announcement in its latest Bul - letin : `` The reclassification of the library , which has been going on since
last October	DATE	, divides the books into ten main divisions , each division is then divided into ten sub-divisions , and each sub-division is again divided into ten divisions ; making in all some ten thousand different subject headings under which the books are classified .

		The library con - tains books on all these various subjects .

		Is there not one subject in which you are especially inter - ested ? ''

		Who would have thought that the products of literary inspiration could group themselves so symmetrically in a great army of books divided and sub-divided and sub-sub-divided by a constant divi - sor , ten ?

		And with the increase of specialization in authorship , as in every other industry , will this process of sub-division continue until we have , not ten thousand , but ten times ten thousand little classes of literature , and presently ten times the latter num - ber , and so on ad infinitum ?

		The brain reels at the thought , and visions arise of mad-houses filled with ex-cataloguers from all over the library world .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 251 THE MODERN ENGLISH NOVEL : SOME TENDENCIES .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		At the beginning of another publishing season , when the air is darkened with announcements of new books by the recognized concocters of fiction , it is customary for the press of this country to give a kindly word or two to the art of novel-writing .

		For this is the slack time of the year : most Londoners are out of town , en - joying their autumnal holiday ; and there is not much of importance in the way of social or other domestic news .

		Parliament is up ; the Balkan imbroglio , as a topic , has lost interest ;
Mexico	LOCATION	is a long way off .

		Thus it happens that the hard-worked journalist turns his attention for a moment to matters of lighter import .

		He has made his annual discovery .

		Last year he found out that the novel had a tendency to increase in length .

		For some time an impassioned controversy was carried on as to the proper measure of a modern work of fiction .

		Should it be eighty thousand words -LRB- which had hitherto been regarded as normal -RRB- , or something over a hundred and fifty thousand , as the
Caines	LOCATION	and Corellis , the
Hichens	PERSON	and Bennetts , appeared to prefer ?

		At length an ingeni - ous writer settled the matter by putting forward the unanswerable dictum that a novel should contain just as many words as were necessary for the adequate treat - ment of the story .

		Upon this the throng of popular novelists who had been contributing their various views to the discussion went back sadly to their work , wishing that they had thought of this excellent solution them - selves .

		But I do not know that many of them have acted upon it since .

		The discovery that has been made this year opens up , perhaps , a more interesting question .

		It is stated that the love interest is going out of fashion .

		That is to say , it is taking a secondary place .

		A well-known publisher comes forward to say that very few novels are submitted to him nowadays in which love , romantic or otherwise , forms the main motive .

		It is true that there is still , generally , a marriage somewhere in the book , but this no longer stands out as the one and only matter of real importance in the life of the characters concerned .

		Our novelists , it seems , are beginning to acquire a sense of proportion : they have at last recognized that it may be possible to interest readers in other subjects in poli - tics , or sociology , or Votes for Women .

		Their characters may be in love , but they do not waste all their time over it : they have other things to do in the world besides gazing at the moon and sighing for each other .

		All of which is , no doubt , a considerable step in the right direction .

		In the higher circles of fiction we may also con - gratulate ourselves upon the gradual extinction of the `` happy-ever-after '' school .

		This Victorian formula had a long and prosperous career , but it can not be denied that it began to exasperate the judicious reader .

		The fiction monger of that epoch used to conduct his couple to the altar , after innumerable vicissitudes , and leave them there at the close of the last chapter , with the strains of
Mendelssohn 's Wedding March	ORGANIZATION	still ring - ing in their ears , with the tacit assumption that the real business of their lives was now over .

		It was a formula .

		The novelist is compelled , by the nature of his craft , to adopt certain conventions , but it is as well that he should change them from time to time .

		Even in our youth we could never quite believe in this postulate of theirs .

		It was too obviously at variance with the stern facts of human life .

		Clearly there were many married couples of our acquaintance whose state of bliss was incomplete .

		And , though we could not , by the nature of things , know very much about the matter , our minds rebelled against the thought that marriage should descend upon the happy couple like a rosy mist , cutting them off from any further participation in the drama of life .

		We were convinced that the most interesting period of their career was just beginning .

		They had only a superficial knowledge of each other 's characters .

		They may have been devotedly attached to the ideals they had formed in their own minds , but we had a shrewd suspicion that these would not survive very long the closer analysis of domestic life .

		How would she get on with the servants , and how would he behave under the stress of leaking water-pipes and kitchen boilers and the noise of fractious or playful children ?

		Clearly the wedding bells should come at the beginning of the story rather than the close .

		Briefly put , the above is the substance of the position taken up by our
London	LOCATION	journal .

		It touches , as you may perceive , only the fringe of the subject , and it is perhaps not strictly fair in its estimate of our Vic - torian novelists .

		Some of these adventured , successfully enough , into the post-matrimonial period ,
George Eliot	PERSON	, for example , wrote '' Middlemarch '' more than forty years ago .

		And , for the rest , a novelist must stop somewhere , preferably before the anti-climax .

		If he is out to tell a love story , the wedding of hero and heroine forms a more suitable halting-place than any other .

		The Victorian formula is not dead .

		In all probability it will last as long as the art of fiction .

		But I agree that it is no longer so prevalent as it was .

		Novelists have shown a tendency for some time to split up into sections ; and those who still practice the romantic love story , pure and simple , have dropped to a lower plane in the estimation of critical readers .

		They still have their stars : some writers in this form , Mr.
Charles Garvice	PERSON	, for instance , enjoy as large a sale as many men with more admired reputations .

		But they appeal , if I may say so without offence , to a less sophisticated circle .

		From the commercial point of view , it may be argued that this is by far the best circle to address .

		It is large , and growing : year by year the half-educated mass of the population assists to swell its ranks .

		We possess in
England	LOCATION	at the present time a class of readers who have just been admitted to the simpler joys of literature .

		They are , as yet , easily tired ; they do not want anything that makes the slightest demand upon their dormant faculty of reason ; they require stories with a sufficiency of exciting interest and as much sen - timent as can be crowded between the covers of a single book .

		To these the romantic love story , in all its pris - tine simplicity , still makes the strongest appeal , and the enterprising craftsman who gave them anything else would soon find the best of reasons for regretting his temerity .

		Numerically , the servant girl and the wife of the small tradesman make up the bulk of our novel - readers to-day .

		And they want Romance and plenty of it : it is for them that our industrious leaders of the paper-covered book market contrive their entrancing stories of noblemen who seek their mates , not in the gilded halls of their peers , but from the flower girls in Piccadilly Circus or from the beggar maidens who wander homeless on the Thames Embankment .

		It does not concern them that the flower-sellers in the Circus are mostly ladies of a mature age , and that beggar maidens are rarely , if ever , to be found on the
Embank	PERSON	- ment .

		Their work has no relation to life as it is : they depict some imaginary fairyland in which the conven - 252 THE DIA1 -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	tions of generations of sentimental predecessors take the place of real facts .

		Like most trades , this of the fiction-writer discovers a tendency to split up into numerous subdivisions .

		We still possess a few men who range freely , who seek to make the Universe their province ; but the majority select their own little patch , cultivating it with only an occasional incursion into strange fields .

		Indeed , the practice of novel-writing is now so universally diffused that the only chance for a new man is to specialise , to make , if possible , a name for himself in some not too crowded enclosure .

		Thus we have Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, who has done for the '' Five Towns '' of Staf - fordshire , the Potteries district , nearly as much as Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	did for his
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	.

		We have had Mr.
Barrie	PERSON	and Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	, and a host of others in various parts of
North Britain	LOCATION	;
Ireland	LOCATION	has been handled by ''
G. A. Birmingham	PERSON	, ''
Somerville	LOCATION	and
Ross	PERSON	, Mr.
Shan F. Bullock	PERSON	, and a goodly band of ardent Celts ; Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	and Mr.
A. T. Quiller-Couch	PERSON	rarely stir from the little sections of
Devon	LOCATION	and
Cornwall	LOCATION	that they have respectively marked for their own .

		Wales and
Essex	LOCATION	,
Yorkshire	LOCATION	and the fells of
Cumberland	LOCATION	, each possesses one or more capable writers of fiction who confine themselves pretty closely to their own par - ticular districts .

		And it is not only in locality that we specialize .

		There is an increasing tendency for our authors to confine themselves to a single subject , or even to a single type of character .

		Sociology has spread its tentacles , like some gigantic octopus , over all the recent novels of Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, until there is some danger of the intrusive monster squeezing the life and interest out of his stories .

		Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	appears to have got himself entangled with a group of scientists and sportsmen , seeking adventure after the manner of the somewhat wooden figures created by the late
Jules Verne	PERSON	.

		For a long time Mr.
W. J. Locke	PERSON	was infected with the spirit of his
Happy Vagabond	ORGANIZATION	, just as the author of '' Raffles '' seemed unable to get away from the society of that gentlemanly burglar .

		And there are , of course , a whole crowd of more or less capable writers who confine themselves to detective stories , or to melo - dramatic serials for the halfpenny papers , or to some other branch of their art for which they , or their agents , imagine they possess a special aptitude .

		I say their agents , for it is undoubtedly to these gentlemen that we owe a good deal of this specialization in modern fiction .

		Let a man once score a success in a story , and it is certain that every effort will be made by his business manager to induce him to work the vein that he has been fortunate enough to strike until there is nothing left .

		It demands considerable force of char - acter on the part of the author to refuse .

		From the commercial point of view , it is no doubt a mistake to leave a mine that still promises a good yield ; from the artistic standpoint it has often proved a fatal error to begin attempting to repeat a past success .

		To imitate oneself may be morally more defensible than to imitate others ; artistically it is the greater blunder .

		The public likes to have some idea of the sort of stuff it is going to get for its money .

		This in itself forms a strong inducement towards specialization .

		Those of our authors who feel an irresistible inclination to wander from the beaten track , to escape from the groove that the agent or the publisher has marked out for them , can always find means of regaining their liberty .

		I have been acquainted with more than one novelist who em - ployed pseudonyms when they desired to publish some - thing in a different genre from their usual work .

		Others , with Mr.
Wells	PERSON	and Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	, divide their works into several categories , classifying some of their stories as fantasies or romances instead of novels .

		It is permissible to cultivate more than one field as long as the boundaries are kept well marked .

		Perhaps , too , it would be impossible for any one author to do much more than this .

		The serious novelist , as apart from the simple story-teller , is expected to deal with what he knows : his imagination should at the least have a basis in solid experience ; and , though some of us have lived strange lives , we are generally a little at sea when it becomes a question of dealing convincingly with the more violent crimes .

		Instinctively the author turns to the subjects that he knows best .

		And of romantic love there is probably no extant writer who does not imagine himself to have sufficient knowledge .

		Probably it is the most interest - ing , the most illuminating , experience that has ever fallen to his lot .

		This is why the love story , pure and simple , will never altogether die out .

		But it is a fact that we handle it with an increasing subtlety if we wish to get a hearing somewhere else than in the ser - vants ' hall .

		THE BRONTE LETTERS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Base interpretation , reflecting sadly on the life of a great woman , is , I believe , the result of the publication of the
Bronte	PERSON	letters in the
London	LOCATION	'' Times . ''

		The letters , as I understand , have been construed to disclose the love of a woman for a man who is indifferent to her , so indifferent that he scribbles vulgar memoranda on her persistent , amorous communications .

		This unpleas - ant insinuation , so unworthy of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	, is refuted definitely and finally in '' Villette '' itself .

		Char - lotte
Bronte	PERSON	never would have offered her love where it was unwelcome ; such an act was opposed to her whole theory of life .

		-LRB- And , once for all , in this parenthesis , I disclaim , with the utmost scorn , every speaking suspicion of what are called '' warmer feelings . ''

		Women do not entertain these `` warmer feelings '' where , from the commencement , through the whole progress of an ac - quaintance , they have never once been cheated of the conviction that to do so would be to commit a mortal absurdity ; nobody ever launches into love unless he has seen or dreamed the rising of Hope 's star over Love 's troubled waters . -RRB-

		Who could doubt the almost quixotic chastity of the woman who wrote these words ? ''

		I could not have expressed ... such thought such scruple without risk of exciting a tyrannous self-contempt ; of kindling an inward fire of shame so quenchless , and so devouring , that I think it would soon have licked up the very life in my veins . ''

		Charlotte
Bronte	PERSON	's life was largely mental ; she at - tached a significance , `` rooted and active , '' to friendship , its evidences and its tokens ; a mere letter from a friend was to her almost as vital as life itself , a source of inexpressible joy or unutterable woe . ''

		Villette '' fur - nishes countless proofs of this fact .

		SAI ^ TSBTJRY ox THE ENGLISH NOVEL , .

		* To ride solitary up the tourney field and ring one 's spear in challenge against the
Templar	ORGANIZATION	's shield , something like that it is to differ with Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	in literary matters .

		Not that he has any of the qualities of Scott 's bold , bad champion ; but his equipment in criticism is so complete , the mass of critical work behind him so formidable , that the mere blazoning on his tent , the fluttering of his pennon , are enough to keep challengers away .

		How one pair of eyes could have gathered in the harvest which he has stacked up and pressed down in his '' History of Criticism '' is beyond our feebler powers to understand .

		And he displays his acquisi - tions in a way to enhance their value .

		He is not only in literature , but of it .

		We would almost rather read Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	than the authors he writes about ; and in a good many cases we admit that is what we have done .

		There is only one flaw in his panoply .

		He seems to have had little metaphysical training , at least , like Arnold himself , he scorns philosophy and bids it begone from the field of criticism , where innate and educated taste is the only guide and director .

		Well , it is possible to lay a course by the stars and dead reckoning , but the compass is a handy invention .

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's new book , '' The English Novel , '' exhibits his immense reading and his gift of reanimating dry bones , as did his '' His - tory of Criticism . ''

		It would be interesting to know which course of reading he found most wearisome , the forgotten or half-forgotten critics of
Europe	LOCATION	, or the dead or little-read novelists of
England	LOCATION	.

		Our first point of quarrel with him is in regard to the position of the novel itself in literature .

		We quote the words with which he concludes his book : '' In the finest of its already existing examples it hardly yields in accomplishment even to poetry ; in that great secondary -LRB- if secondary -RRB- office of all Art to redress the apparent injustice , and console for the ap - parent unkindness of Nature to serve as a rest and refreshment between those exactions of life which , though neither unjust nor unkind , are burdensome , it has no equal among all the kinds of Art itself . ''

		The second part of this sentence is undoubtedly true as regards human beings to-day ; but it is only true , we believe , because there has been a * THE ENGLISH NOVEL .

		By
George Saintsbury	PERSON	.

		`` Chan - nels of English Literature . ''


New York	LOCATION	:
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		general weakening of intellectual fibre , a relax - ation in the power of attention , largely brought about by the excessive use of novels themselves , which have indisposed people for other forms of art , though these intrinsically may have more con - solation and refreshment in them .

		If we could bring back to life a Greek of the time of Pericles , or even an Englishman of the time of Pope , neither one of them might find much consola - tion or refreshment in the English novel .

		Pope concentrated a hundred novels in the Satires and Epistles , and a contemporary of his might prefer his portable phrases to the diluted exposi - tion of human nature in the modern novel .

		It must be remembered that the novel has only been in vogue , been the fashionable form of literature , for a hundred years .

		The reign of the novel began with '' Waverley . ''

		Great novels had been written before that , but the form had always been considered a secondary and inferior one .

		The first part of Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's sentence quoted above we should challenge altogether ; and we believe that he is too good a critic , too true a judge of literary values , to defend it .

		There are three things that make literature val - uable , thought , adequate or beautiful verbal expression , and the creative projection of human figures .

		Thought is the common possession of all forms of literature .

		You must have some - thing to say before you can write at all .

		There is no reason why a novel should not be as pro- found as a philosophical treatise or a great drama or poem .

		It may be a mere accident that no novel in existence does rank with the great Bibles of the world , or with the `` Prometheus , '' '' De Rerum Natura , '' `` Hamlet , '' or `` Faust . ''

		In the matter of expression , it is simply ab - surd to compare the very best prose of the very best novels with the verse of the great poets .

		These last not only have given us a sensuous form , music and sculptured perfection , which always delighted the world , until the flood of novels washed out of its mind the power of ap - preciating distinction , but by their superior con - centration they have made a thousand phrases which have entered into common parlance where the novelists have made one .

		In creativeness the novel may seem to be more on a level with other forms of literature ; but even here the palm is not for it .

		The great figures of fiction which dominate man 's imagi - nation , which have really swayed and moulded his life , are almost exclusively the protagonists of plays or poems .

		Rama ,
Rustam	LOCATION	,
Achilles	LOCATION	, Prometheus ,
Hamlet	LOCATION	,
Lear	PERSON	, and fifty others , 254 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	these are kings whose reigns have been not over single countries but over whole continents , whose dominion has lasted not for a few years but for many centuries .

		The novel in its whole period of existence has projected but one creation that can rank with them
Don Quixote	PERSON	.

		That it has produced one may be an argument that it can bring forth more ; but until it does so , it is un - wise to claim for it an equality of accomplish - ment with poetry .

		Secondary characters of great power and charm and beauty the novel has to its credit in vast numbers , but so has poetry and the drama .

		And these secondary characters of poetry retain a certain superiority .

		Has any hero of any French novel whatever exercised as much influence over the French mind as the hero of
Corneille	ORGANIZATION	's play , `` Le Cid '' ?

		We doubt it .

		Has any English heroine fascinated as many men or reproduced herself in the moods and manners of as many girls as
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Rosalind ?

		We are quite certain that none has .

		What is a novel ?

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	nowhere definitely defines the genus ; but the main pur - pose and most skilfully executed design of his book is to aggrandize one of its species , the novel of manners as the central type , any aber - ration from which is a falling away from per - fection .

		Why the novel of manners should be central any more than the comedy of manners is central in the drama , it would be hard to ex - plain .

		Tragedy , romantic comedy , fantastic comedy , all outrank satirical comedy of con - temporary life .

		Few critics would place '' The School for Scandal '' on a level with ``
King Lear	PERSON	, '' '' The Tempest , '' or '' The Clouds '' of Aristophanes .

		Is there any reason why it should be different in the novel ?

		Neither the name nor the genesis of the novel indicates any such reason .

		Novel means something new , and presumably startling .

		The first novel we have , '' The Golden Ass '' of Apuleius , is a wild and grotesque tale of adventure .

		The early novels of
Spain	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	were of a similar character , except when they told discreditable tales of domestic life which we can at least hope were not a true reflection of average humanity .

		The close study of quiet , unexciting contemporary life is really a late arrival in the novel field , and even yet it can not vie in popularity with other varieties .

		But Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	is determined to see in this latter type the hoped-for accomplishment of all that the novel can do .

		His book is con - structed to make
Jane Austen	PERSON	appear the apex of the English novel , up to whom everything previous led , and since whom everything has sloped down towards the abyss .

		He gives a really magnificent exposition of the art of the eighteenth century novelists ,
Richardson	PERSON	, Field - ing ,
Smollett	PERSON	, and
Sterne	PERSON	; but he calls them `` The Four Wheels , '' meaning , we suppose , the wheels of the chariot which is to bear
Jane Austen	PERSON	to triumph .

		He slurs over
Scott	LOCATION	, hurries past
Dickens	PERSON	, and , what is more surprising , half ignores
Thackeray	PERSON	, in order to exalt his favored queen .

		What is the mystery of
Jane Austen	PERSON	's superi - ority ?

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	seems to think that the life she depicts is more normal than that of any other novelist , and that she realizes it better .

		Now we do not believe that the life of the little coteries of county families which
Jane Austen	PERSON	gives us is a particle more normal than the life which
Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	describes in `` Coningsby , '' or the life which
Herman Melville	PERSON	projects in `` Typee . ''

		There are communities existing in the world to-day that go about like the old Hindoo sect `` sky clothed '' and eat their dead enemies with innocent gusto , but who certainly consider their lives absolutely normal .

		Every literary artist must observe and must imagine .

		The life he deals with must go through the alembic of his brain and suffer a quantitative and qualitative change there .

		Miss
Bates	PERSON	is no more `` real '' than
Meg Merrilies	PERSON	.

		In her way she is quite as astonishing and as eloquent as the gypsy .

		Who ever knew a Miss
Bates	PERSON	who revealed her character with every word she spoke and never faltered in stroke upon stroke of self - revelation ?


Jane Austen	PERSON	gives us the concen - trated essence of
Miss Bates	LOCATION	, and we might have lived with the original twenty years without knowing her as well as we do in an hour 's read - ing .

		But this is the secret of all successful character creation , and
Miss Bates	PERSON	is made by the same formula as
Justice Shallow	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
Toby Belch	PERSON	,
Parson Adams	PERSON	,
Dominie Sampson	PERSON	, and
Micawber	PERSON	.

		The only difference is that she is not as interesting in herself as these others .

		In two characters , Mr.
Collins	PERSON	and Lady
Catherine de Burgh	PERSON	,
Miss Austen	PERSON	did , by allowing herself a little more exaggeration than usual , achieve veritable triumphs .

		But what we want to insist on is that all her successful figures are made and modelled as every other good artist has wrought his .

		All of them ride hobby-horses .

		Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- nett is always the ironical philosopher whose business it is to extract amusement from his wife and daughters .

		Mr.
Woodhouse	PERSON	is always the valitudinarian who invites people to dinner and then advises them not to eat anything .

		Emma is always the intermeddling angel who
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 255 disastrously manages other people 's affairs .

		And so on .

		There is no new creative method .

		The fact that the hobby-horses ridden by these am - iable people are rather tame livery hacks , and that they do not prance and caracole like the steeds trotted out by My Uncle Toby ,
Jonathan	PERSON	Old - buck ,
Jingle	ORGANIZATION	, or
Sairey Gamp	PERSON	, does not change the fact of their truth to type .

		And the fact that
Miss Austen	PERSON	has only two preeminently fine creations , whereas Fielding ,
Scott	PERSON	, and
Dickens	PERSON	have twenty , fifty , one hundred ; and the further fact that the worlds projected by these novelists are immeasurably larger , nobler , more varied , than
Jane Austen	PERSON	's narrow little domain , all this would seem to negative the idea that she is the culmination and climax of the art of novel - writing .

		We have no share in the second sight which Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	as a Scotsman or a dweller in
Scotland	LOCATION	ought to be gifted with ; but we can imagine a great critic of the future , a Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	of the twenty-first century , writing of this book something as follows : '' In the time of this critic there raged all over the world a craze for novels , somewhat analogous to the tulip mania in
Holland	LOCATION	or the excitement of the
South Sea Bubble	LOCATION	.

		Vast prices were paid for these curious and unsubstantial specimens of literature ; and the poet , the dramatist , and the thinker were relegated into the background .

		Especially did the critics of that day dote on the tame studies of ordinary life such as a schoolgirl with no experience could easily turn out .

		Luckily we have recovered from this lunacy , and the bloated and formless novel - thing has been shown its proper place in litera - ture , while the clear-cut , definite forms of art , the lyric , the narrative poem , and the drama , have come into their own .

		And the novels of the past , the huge galleons of a vast Armada , lie scattered or sunk around the shores of that fair island of Art , which they started out so proudly to conquer . ''

		A Study of International Pol - itics from
Sadowa	LOCATION	to Kirk-Kilisse ' .

		By
William Morton Fullerton	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		the author has an intimate knowledge of at least considerable portions of his subject .

		But though the book is written in an easy style , it will hardly be read by the generality of men because it presupposes a knowledge of modern national and world politics that very few pos - sess .

		The treatment is by all odds at its best in the portions which deal with the domestic affairs , both political and social , of
France	LOCATION	.

		Here the author 's knowledge is evidently based on per - sonal observation at close range , and conse - quently what he tells us about the present con - stitution and government of
France	LOCATION	, and their relation to Clericalism and Reaction on the one hand and Syndicalism and machine politics on the other , is illuminating in the highest degree .

		Mr.
Fullerton	PERSON	has also a good deal to say about other nations and peoples .

		His remarks about the
United States	LOCATION	are worthy of especial note .

		The American , having long since been labelled a dollar-chaser , will be surprised and probably gratified to find that `` idealism is the most characteristic note of the American char - acter . ''

		However , we do not escape criticism .

		In repudiating their war debts the
Confederate States	LOCATION	took a step which is paralleled in our times only by the action of certain Central American States .

		The American is too much given to sport : his newspapers devote as much space to games as they do to home politics , and infinitely more than they do to foreign politics .

		Like others , the American is growing irreligi - ous ; he is also coming to believe that his fav - orite theory of equal rights has been tried and found wanting .

		He is realizing , though slowly , that his isolation in international affairs is com - ing to an end , partly as a result of the taking of
the Philippines	LOCATION	, partly and chiefly in conse - quence of the construction of the
Panama Canal	ORGANIZATION	.

		A further result of the latter enterprise will probably be that the American will be forced to conform his favorite principle of the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	to the
Law of Nations	ORGANIZATION	.

		The domestic affairs of the several nations appear in this treatise only to give a basis for the discussion of international relations .

		Ob - viously one can not in a few lines give an ade - quate resume of a study involving a multitude of details .

		Mr.
Fullerton	PERSON	tells us that
Germany	LOCATION	carried on a highly , almost superhumanly , suc - cessful foreign policy from the time of Bismarck to
1898	DATE	, `` the critical year . ''

		In that period she managed to draw
Austria	LOCATION	and presently
Italy	LOCATION	into association with her in the form of the
Triple Alliance	ORGANIZATION	.

		Consequently she could 256 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	face the French desire for revenge with equan - imity , indeed , by virtue of her influence at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	and of
England	LOCATION	's policy of `` splendid isolation , '' she was really the dom - inant factor in all international matters .

		In
1898	DATE	her leadership began to be feared and presently contested .


France	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	had already become friendly , the events of the South African War swept
England	LOCATION	into association with them , and presently the
Triple Alliance	ORGANIZATION	was confronted with a competent rival in the
Triple Entente	ORGANIZATION	.


Germany	LOCATION	, perceiving the dim - inution of her influence under these tendencies , has sought by every device known to diplomacy to disrupt the
Triple Entente	ORGANIZATION	, with the con - trary result of solidifying it and seeing her own power decline until it was practically broken by the course of the recent Balkan War . ''

		Kirk-Kilisse marks the end of an epoch , the Bismarckian , and the beginning of a new era . ''

		International affairs , which in general are not as satisfactorily treated as the domestic affairs of
France	LOCATION	, suffer still further because they are discussed with a considerable bias .

		Mr.
Fullerton	PERSON	is a Germanophobe , and he can find little good proceeding from
Berlin	LOCATION	. ''

		While
France	LOCATION	is still , in the conventional way , loyal to the appeal of great principles , respectful of accepted ideals of international law , and of recognized notions of justice , and correspondingly indifferent to the pure material aspects of any problem , ...
Germany	LOCATION	, the great modern parvenu power , bereft of all deep-rooted historical traditions , unrestrained by precedent save that of the original sin of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	has been able to put herself abreast of the time and adopt me - thods best fitted to a period dominated by economic interests ... But the British principle that ' business is business ' has never , even in
England	LOCATION	, been allowed to become the sole principle of diplomatic action . ''

		The rhetoric of these sentences is more correct than their content .

		There is no less history back of
Germany	LOCATION	than of
France	LOCATION	, and their present governments are practically of the same age .

		And as for the restraint of precedent , it is ludi - crous to suppose that the precedents represented by the policies of
France	LOCATION	under the Bourbons and Napoleons , or by
England	LOCATION	's policies in
China	LOCATION	,
South Africa	LOCATION	, or
Persia	LOCATION	none of which give evidence of being better than German policies are of a kind to act as a wholesome restraint .

		If
Germany	LOCATION	is without such prece - dents she is thrice blessed .

		This tendency to pronounce the policies of the several nations good or bad according as they harmonize or conflict with
England	LOCATION	's in - terests runs through the whole volume .

		For example , Mr.
Fullerton	PERSON	tells us that the
United States	LOCATION	ought to abandon the
Monroe Doctrine	ORGANIZATION	.

		But then , being `` innocent '' in international matters , we ought to avoid being drawn into an alliance with
Germany	LOCATION	; for if this happened the
United States	LOCATION	`` would have to bear the responsibility of an act which would upset the entire balance of power in
Europe	LOCATION	, and result in a war involving the interests of the entire population of our planet . '' ''

		Were the Americans of the
United States	LOCATION	, in the present state of the world , to succumb to the blandish - ments of
Germany	LOCATION	, and accept any exclusive arrange - ment with that Power , they would be selling their birth - right , sacrificing the essentials of what has made their history worth anything in the world 's annals , and losing their ' lives , their fortune and their sacred honor . ' ''

		Horrible , if true !

		If , however , we withstand the `` blandishments '' of
Germany	LOCATION	, which would draw us into an international gang of land - grabbers , and ally ourselves with
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, we shall secure the peace of the world ; `` for the only influence in the world capable of putting an end to these predatory methods are the combined forces of the new British Empire , and a self-denying
United States	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	. ''

		-LRB- The italics are the reviewer 's . -RRB-

		This dictum does not at all agree with
England	LOCATION	's recent seizure of a `` sphere of influence '' in
Persia	LOCATION	, a high-handed act which makes it apparent that not only
France	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, but the new British Empire as well , should be `` self - denying . ''

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 257 himself to art , was not trying to get as far away as possible from an unlovely and detested world , but was by that very devotion doing the best work possible for that world .

		Thus his writing of poetry was not merely a solace , a kind of evening recreation after the arduous work of the day , but was a necessary part of the day 's work , as useful and indispensable as any other labor ; and in so treating it ,
Morris	PERSON	was putting into practice the teaching of his great master
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		Another interesting point which Mr.
Drink	PERSON	- water insists upon , though with less success , is that
Morris	PERSON	, essentially a narrative poet , had a fine understanding of the essential nature of dramatic poetry , in which chiefly `` the develop - ment of character and the progress of idea through the medium of action '' are to be shown .

		`` Sir
Peter Harpdon	PERSON	's End '' at least demon - strates this well ; but Mr.
Drinkwater	PERSON	is forced to admit that `` Love is Enough '' is in structure something of a failure , in that Pharamond , '' instead of passing swiftly from stage to stage in pursuit of his end and snowing us that love is enough , pauses for long periods to tell us that love is enough . ''

		In other words ,
Morris	ORGANIZATION	, ex - pressing himself in a somewhat unusual medium , was carried away by the lyrical impulse , and made no strong effort to satisfy rigidly the de - mands of dramatic construction .

		On the subject of popular heroes Mr.
Drink	PERSON	- water has some wise remarks -LRB- pp. 106 f. -RRB- which deserve to be quoted : '' We decorate and honour our soldiers whose business , be it to destroy or to be destroyed , is , in any case , con - nected with destruction ; those of our lawyers who are chiefly concerned with restraint and punishment ; our politicians who spend their time protecting us from as - saults of neighbours and communities as commercially rapacious as ourselves , or , in their more enlightened moments , in adjusting wrongs that are the dregs in the cup of civilization .

		The functions of these men may be necessities of society , but they nevertheless apply to the small negative aspect of our state and not the great normal life .

		It is that which is , rightly , the concern of our creative artists ; but our creative artists are not decorated and honoured by the nation as such ... Nationally we acclaim the negative and neglect the pos - itive manifestations of man .


Morris	PERSON	's art was , implic - itly , a challenge to this temper and a means of escape from it . ''

		Our only criticism of this view is that it is not half strongly enough put .

		America is sadly afflicted with the same disease ; her legislators would rather build battleships than universities or museums , and while voting pensions recklessly to the old soldiers , would not give a dime of gov - ernment money to a starving poet or painter or teacher .

		It is this attitude of mind that we insist should be met by the gospel of
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Morris	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Drinkwater	PERSON	's book contains a few bad misprints .

		It was in
1857	DATE	, not
1875	DATE	-LRB- p. 46 -RRB- , that
Rossetti	PERSON	conceived the scheme of paint - ings for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		For `` Glance '' -LRB- p. 98 -RRB- read `` Glauce . ''

		For `` Hemir '' -LRB- p. 142 -RRB- read `` Heimir . ''

		For `` Feurir '' -LRB- p. 143 -RRB- read `` Fenrir . ''

		P. 142 , 1 .

		2 , read : `` and of brother , '' etc. .

		On p. 189 , 1 .

		11 , does not the writer mean `` affect '' ?

		Believing that there was still room for a study dealing with the personality of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Arthur Compton-Rickett	PERSON	has essayed to fill the gap .

		If one is thus led to expect from his volume a new fund of stories or an anecdotal biography , one is sure to be disappointed .

		Although the author `` has sought the firsthand impressions of as many , as possible , of
Morris	PERSON	's intimates and acquaintances , '' he has quoted very few Sir
Philip Burne	PERSON	-
Jones	PERSON	, Sir Will - iam
Richmond	LOCATION	, Mr.
Belford Bax	PERSON	, Mr.
Watts	PERSON	-
Dunton	PERSON	,
Walter Crane	PERSON	,
Wilfrid Scawen Blunt	PERSON	, and a few others , some anonymous .

		Nor can it be said that in this respect we get from his book much that is really new .

		For though it may be true , as he suggests , that `` whereas X may see certain traits clearly , Z will see other points more vividly , '' on the other hand it is to be said that
Morris	PERSON	's nature was by no means subtle or difficult to understand ; nor was he in any sense like
Paul	PERSON	, who sought to be all things to all men .

		Morris had many interests , and , as some would put it , many talents , all of which he used .

		His activity brought him into contact with many different types of men ; but to all he was much the same bluff , hearty , hot-tempered , warm - hearted , positive , eager to see his ideas and ideals make headway in the world , a hater of shams , and above all a lover of beauty .

		It is not sur - prising , therefore , that there is no extraordinary variety in the accounts of him contributed to this volume by his friends .

		Yet we would not be understood as implying that they are devoid of interest ; altogether , the section called '' The Manner of Man '' gives us a very pleasing ac - count of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	's personality .

		In discussing
Morris	PERSON	's poetry , Mr.
Rickett	PERSON	remarks that '' he was not a great poet ; for to the great poet rhythmic beauty is the one and inevitable expression of his creative imagina - tion . ''

		We shall not insist that
Morris	PERSON	was a great poet ; but the reason was not , we think , that he expressed himself also in other forms , as painting and design .

		It is idle to assert that 258 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	because a man can do three things he can not do one thing supremely well ; it is merely a vicious post hoc , propter hoc .

		If
Morris	PERSON	missed the divine spark of the supreme genius , the cause is not , in our opinion , assignable by human judgment .

		Some have alleged that he was too facile , that he wrote too easily ; others have complained of his excessive narrowness ; still others , of his sham mediae valism .

		That he was not seriously at fault in any one of these particulars can , we think , be successfully con - tended ; yet this is not to assert that his place is with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	or Homer .

		Even the
Bard of Avon	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- it is now permitted us to believe -RRB- was not impeccable , nor did he always write poetry of supreme loveliness ; yet few dispute his su - premacy .

		Morris himself excelled others in at least some points ; Mr.
Rickett	PERSON	rightly points out the general clarity , the ease , and the level excellence of his verse , in which he was superior to many of his great predecessors .

		The least satisfactory chapter in Mr.
Rickett	PERSON	's book is that in which he discusses
Morris	PERSON	as a craftsman .

		His account of
Morris	PERSON	's activities in design is somewhat bare and meagre .

		He re - produces , of course , the prospectus of
Morris	ORGANIZATION	,
Marshall , Faulkner & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, but says little as to the variety or the extent or the success of their business .

		We should like to know about some of the churches and other buildings , public or private , which have been enriched by their win - dows or other products ; more about the revolu - tion in popular taste which their work effected .

		Moreover , this chapter needs illustrations , which Miss
Gary	PERSON	in her volume fortunately provided .

		In fact , the work and influence of
Morris	PERSON	as a designer , the work in which he gloried , calling himself proudly `` a master artisan , '' has yet to be adequately described .

		Mr.
Rickett	PERSON	is more fortunate in setting forth
Morris	PERSON	's views on social reform .

		Whatever we may think of Socialism , there can be no doubt that
Morris	PERSON	presents his noblest aspect when viewed as a teacher of society .

		Writing ro - mances or toiling at
Merton Abbey	ORGANIZATION	was far more congenial to him ; but he saw that before the beauty he loved could be generally appreciated and sought after , the whole attitude of society must be changed , and competition must give way to cooperation .

		Competition may be the life of business ; but being based essentially on selfishness , it inevitably leads to wrong notions about work and its products .

		The world has gone so far in the wrong direction that it will take a long time to reconstruct things ; and probably some of the notions of the early Socialists will prove utterly unsuited to the coming State ; but their fundamental conten - tion seems sound , and we appear to be moving steadily toward its realization .

		To the popularization of the Socialistic creed
Morris	PERSON	undoubtedly contributed much .

		But it is not as a Socialist that he will be longest remembered , or even as a designer and adorner of our everyday world .

		When the social abuses against which he strove shall have been forgot - ten , when even the buildings which his art adorned shall have crumbled , men will still , we believe , delight in the tales in which our modern Chaucer set forth with imperishable dignity and grandeur the elemental passions of that romantic world , ever old yet ever new , which was to him so real , so possible that he sought constantly to bring it into actual being the world of
Jason	PERSON	, and Alcestis , and
Paris	LOCATION	, and Ogier the
Dane	PERSON	, and
Gudrun	PERSON	, and
Sigurd	PERSON	, and
Brynhild	LOCATION	.

		As a teller of tales , he stands by himself ; and in the long pageant of time the age which produced him can never be put to shame .

		MEN AND EVENTS IN OUR EARLY NAVAL , HISTORY .

		* In narrating in detail the services performed by our cruisers and privateers in the Revolu - tionary War , Mr.
Gardner W. Allen	PERSON	has per - formed a patriotic duty .

		Already favorably known because of his briefer treatises on our naval war with
France	LOCATION	and with the
Barbary Corsairs	ORGANIZATION	, the historian follows in this more ambitious work the methods made familiar in those volumes .

		He relies primarily upon official records , both in this country and in
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, piecing these out with personal letters and diaries and with extracts from the newspapers of the time , scanty though these last appear to us to-day .

		But the story as a whole is most impressive , the more so because the author has included , as far as was possible with existing materials , the operations of the ves - sels sailing as privateers under authority of the several states , outnumbering greatly the ships commissioned by the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 259 gland , from
Paul Revere	PERSON	's ride to the evacuation of
Boston	LOCATION	, every American school-child is made aware .

		But who knows of the doughty O'Briens and their deeds at
Machias	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, less than two months after the
Concord	LOCATION	fight , though there has been a naval vessel ever since to keep their name from forgetfulness ?

		Who has ever heard of the capture of the good ship '' Hellish , '' laden with military clothing and stores for
Burgoyne	PERSON	's army , and diverted by Captain Jones to the uses of
Washington	LOCATION	's half - clad forces ?

		Yet the operations of our ships and sailors kept pace with our land operations from the begin - ning of the war to the end , and it was a French fleet that made the victory at Yorktown pos - sible , even as the
Machias	LOCATION	incident bespeaks the temper of the colonists quite as much as
Lexington	LOCATION	, and the loss of the supplies on the `` Mellish '' aided in bringing about the surren - der at
Saratoga	LOCATION	.

		It is in the recital of these seemingly minor events that Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's book is chiefly valuable , though of course the stress is rather upon the more sensational and better known deeds of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, as chiefly exemplified in the brilliant career of
John Paul Jones	PERSON	.

		Poor as we were in those days , ill-organized as the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	was for dealing with naval affairs , it is probable that more than two thousand privateers sailed forth under our new flag ; and their services were of prime value to the patriot cause , not only in such affairs as that of the `` Mellish , '' but in causing the British people to exert pressure upon their government to bring the war to a close through the commercial losses they thus sustained and the terror created by the ap - pearance of hostile craft on the very shores of
Albion	ORGANIZATION	's supposedly inviolable isle .

		Of the lack of efficiency shown by our gov - ernments , state and national , Mr.
Allen	PERSON	speaks briefly and wisely .

		Had the lessons been learned which are written so largely in our failures during this early period , there would have been no second war of independence necessary to free our ships and sailors from heavy wrongs .

		For the rest , the book is clearly and unpretentiously written , well printed and indexed , and illus - trated interestingly with scenes and portraits from contemporary sources .

		Mrs.
Reginald de Koven	PERSON	, in leaving the field of fiction for that of accurate historical writing , has in no way allowed her manifest talents as an interpreter of character and as a descriptive writer to lapse , and the result is a welcome relief from the German method which deems everything of value in history , however intrin - sically uninteresting .

		To deal in the German way with such a hero of romance as
John Paul Jones	PERSON	would have been futile , and the reader may well rejoice in Mrs.
de Koven	PERSON	's sympathy for the lover Jones proved himself to be , as well as fighter .

		Her painstaking research , evidences of which abound throughout her two fine octavo volumes , has brought out the romance of Jones 's private , no less than of his public , life , so that the work possesses both the fascination of a novel and the serious value of authentic and fully documented history .

		The historian here has had not only to set forth accurately the facts of Jones 's career , but to remove a cloud of doubts and false surmises left from the slipshod work of at least one previ - ous biographer , The portrait drawn is convinc - ingly true ; if lacking a little in such qualities of heroism in daily life as we must instinctively feel to be improbable , it gains greatly in human qualities .

		What strikes the reader most , per - haps , is the tremendous efficiency exhibited by Jones while afloat , and the even profounder effort required to secure ships with which to ex - ercise his manifest talents .

		A stronger nation would never have allowed such a genius to remain ashore a moment longer than necessity required ; as it was , his talents were wasted for months and years , during which he strove in vain to obtain a command , now from Con - gress , now from the French Crown .

		It is through the urgencies he was thus forced to display that his character loses much of ro - mantic glamour .

		Finding himself deprived of one ship after another at the moment when he had demonstrated his superiority over every other American sea-fighter , he was compelled to resort to the methods of an almost remorseless creditor to procure another ship and crew , until it is not too much to say that everything he accomplished was in spite of conditions rather than because of them .

		Considering the wire - pulling and jealousy he was so persistently engaged in at home and abroad , his contem - poraries are hardly to be blamed for regarding his persistency as a nuisance , contrasted as it was with their own inertia and lack of vital enthusiasm .

		Notwithstanding the fact that
Jones	PERSON	is our one naval hero of the Revolution , the result of all this is that the concluding chapters of Mrs.
de Koven	PERSON	's work , dealing with his services to
Russia	LOCATION	after the close of our war , are the most 260 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	engrossing of the entire book , and the gaps left by earlier biographers and historians are at last completely filled .

		The reviewer may be par - doned an expression of regret that room was not found for some of the ballads and other literature dealing with
John Paul Jones	PERSON	, who is here proved to be himself a poet of sorts , such pieces as `` The Yankee Man-of-War , '' quite the best naval song of the Revolution ,
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's `` Would you hear of an old - time sea-fight ? ''

		taken down from the lips of an ancestor who was with
Jones	PERSON	on the `` Bon -
Homme Richard	PERSON	, '' as well as more modern verse dealing with the cruise which bore his body back for permanent sepulture in the land of his adoption .

		As
Jones	PERSON	was the chief naval hero of the Revolution , so was
Oliver Hazard Perry	PERSON	the foremost figure upon the waters in the second war with
Britain	LOCATION	; and Mr.
James Cooke Mills	PERSON	has done well to devote a well-printed and vera - cious volume to him in this centennial year of his great victory .

		The story is vividly told , and the author 's complete sympathy with so inter - esting a subject adds to its value , though it sometimes presses historical fact somewhat hard .

		There was little need , for example , to revive the forgotten tale of
Elliott	ORGANIZATION	's delinquency on the memorable day that gave the
United States	LOCATION	the command of
Lake Erie	LOCATION	, or to pass over in com - plete silence
Chauncey	PERSON	's exploit on
Lake Ontario	LOCATION	, which was needed to round out
Perry	PERSON	's victory .

		Nor should
Perry	PERSON	's only less distinguished younger brother ,
Matthew Calbraith	PERSON	, have re - mained quite unmentioned .

		But these are errors of omission , no more .

		It is a deeper matter for regret that someone did not go over Mr.
Mills	PERSON	's work and reduce it to ordinary rules of grammar and style .

		What , for instance , can be made of such a sentence as , `` The gunboats were generally armed with a single twenty-four pounder , two of which were stationed off Stonington , '' or `` The frequent up - risings of which the regency was noted , '' or '' The heartrending tragedy of the
River Raisin	LOCATION	and other localities followed in succession , '' or the complete confusion of '' creditable '' with '' credible '' ?

		Similar examples of carelessness abound , and lead to errors in statement of fact , as where on page 104 the '' Trippe '' is said to be commanded by
Lieutenant Holdup	ORGANIZATION	and on page 145 by Lieutenant
Holdup Stevens	PERSON	.

		Nor should such a book have been published without an index .

		WALLACE RICE .

		A GREAT GERMAN SOCIALIST AND STATESMAN .

		* Shortly before the middle of
August	DATE	there died at
Zurich	LOCATION	the most eminent of contempo - rary German socialists , the sole survivor of the remarkable group of leaders by whom were laid the foundations of the German Social Democ - racy a generation and more ago ,
August Ferdinand Bebel	PERSON	.

		It is a cause for gratulation among students of social and political move - ments that before his death
Herr Bebel	PERSON	the `` Red Pope , '' his adversaries denominated him committed to writing his recollections of the men and measures of the early days of the German socialist propaganda .

		There is cause for regret , however , that the Autobiography in which these recollections are recorded was com - pleted -LRB- the portion of it , at least , which has reached print -RRB- only to the
year 1878	DATE	; although if we are not to have the entire work as pro- jected , the portion which has been printed , dealing as it does with the remoter and more formative period in the Social Democracy 's growth , may be assumed to be of the largest interest and value .

		The career of
Bebel	PERSON	was one of continued and inspiring triumph over adversity .

		The condi - tions surrounding his boyhood were hard and narrow .

		His father , a non-commissioned officer in the Prussian army , died in
1844	DATE	, when the boy was but four years old ; his mother died nine years later .

		The rudiments of an education were acquired in a poor-law school at
Wetzlar	ORGANIZATION	, but at the age of thirteen the youth was thrown entirely upon his own resources and prospect of further schooling had to be abandoned .

		In
1853	DATE	he was apprenticed to a master-turner , and
five years later	DATE	he began tramping about the country as a journeyman .

		In
1860	DATE	he appeared at
Leipzig	LOCATION	, where steady employment was found and where , in
February , 1861	DATE	, he attended his first public meeting of workingrnen and joined his first workingmen 's society .

		In both politics and industry the times were unsettled , and the opportunity afforded a restless spirit such as
Bebel	PERSON	to agitate , to argue , and to organize was unlimited .

		In
May , 1863	DATE	,
Lassalle	PERSON	's `` Mani - festo , '' commonly regarded as the starting-point of the German Social Democracy , was published ; and shortly afterwards there was formed the
General German Labor Union	ORGANIZATION	, whose purpose was to make of labor , in accordance with
Lassalle	PERSON	's ideas , an organized power in politics .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL , 261
Bebel	PERSON	, who from 186 3to
1872	DATE	served continu - ously as vice-president of the
Leipzig Society	ORGANIZATION	for the Promotion of Knowledge among the Work - ing Classes , at first opposed the propaganda for manhood suffrage , on the ground that `` the workers were not yet ripe for it , '' and long held out against the general programme of the Las salleans .

		In truth he was not a socialist until , having occasion to read the writings of the Las - salleans in order to combat them , he fell under conviction and was won over .

		Gradually , how - ever , he became a socialist of the socialists , a universal suffragist , and an outspoken enemy of the entire social order based on capitalism .

		`` I was a
Saul	PERSON	, '' he says , '' and became a Paul ; and a Paul I have remained even unto the evening of my life , more than ever convinced of the justice of my beliefs ; and so I shall remain to the end , as long as my strength is left me . ''

		In
1867	DATE
Bebel	ORGANIZATION	was elected a Labor member of the North German Diet .

		In
1871	DATE	he was chosen to a seat in the newly constituted
Reichstag	LOCATION	, and , except during one prolonged interval of imprisonment , and during the years
1881-1 88 3	DATE	, he was at all times thereafter until his death a member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		From the first he participated actively in debate .

		He refused to vote the subsidies asked at tfee be - ginning of the war with
France	LOCATION	, and he opposed the annexation of
Alsace-Lorraine	LOCATION	.

		By his in - dependence of speech and action he , of course , incurred the displeasure of the authorities .

		In
December , 1870	DATE	, he was imprisoned on a charge of attempted high treason ; and in
1872	DATE	he was tried and condemned to two years of confinement in a fortress .

		Released in
1875	DATE	, he was im - prisoned again for six months in
1877	DATE	, on a charge of libelling
Bismarck	PERSON	.

		These periods of enforced inactivity , however , but afforded opportunity for reading and study , and the
Government	ORGANIZATION	appears to have arrived at the conclusion that to add the element of martyr - dom to the sources of power which the man al - ready possessed would be a mistaken policy .

		At any rate , there was no further interference with his personal freedom .

		The present volume brings us only to the eve of the attempts on the life of the Emperor in
1878	DATE	, and the anti-socialistic legislation by which those unfortunate episodes were followed .

		This was also the year in which there took place the final amalgamation of the several organiza - tions which have entered into the composition of the Social Democratic party , so that it affords a convenient division point in the history of the great movement with which
Bebel	PERSON	's name will ever be linked .

		The writer , in summing up the situation at this point , says : '' The play was ready to begin .

		It was intended to be a tragedy , in the course of which the Social Dem - ocratic party was to be sacrificed upon the altar of the monarchical and capitalistic interests .

		But , as before , it did not ` come off ' ; we turned the tragedy into a comedy , and the Hercules who came forth to strike us down with his bludgeon was himself laid low after an inglorious ten years ' war against the hated enemy , and cumbered the field of battle with his corpse .

		Whereas in the old days of the Empire the battle-cry of the ad - vancing armies was ` To me ,
Guelph	LOCATION	!

		Tome ,
Ghib	PERSON	- belline ! '

		it was now ' To me ,
Bismarck !	ORGANIZATION

		To me , Social Democrats ! ' '

		In style , the narrative is simple and straight - forward ; in substance , it is interesting and often illuminating .

		It reveals a forceful , intense , yet kindly personality ; and it tells a story that no interpreter of modern European affairs can afford to ignore .

		Especially instructive are the comments which are made upon
Bismarck	PERSON	's effort to exploit the interests of labor in the earlier years of his ministry , the intimate char - acterizations of Liebknecht ,
Schweitzer	PERSON	, and other socialist leaders , and the more or less incidental portrayal of the habits , ideas , and aspirations of the German workingman in the
third quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		But there is nothing in the book that is superfluous , little that is even unimportant .

		THE PHILOSOPHY OF CRIME AND PUNISHMENT .

		*
Gabriel Tarde	PERSON	, whose work on `` Penal Philosophy '' has recently been translated for the '' Modern Crim - inal Science Series , '' was an ornament of the legal profession , a judge of wide experience , a scholar , a psychologist , and an eminent sociologist ' ; his writings have stimulated thought in every country on the themes he discussed .

		First of all , as a criminologist , Tarde is a severe critic of the school of
Lombroso	LOCATION	, whose disciples have , in
Tarde	LOCATION	's opinion , over-estimated the import - ance of the inherited physical causes of anti-social conduct .

		The criminal is not a madman ; the insane may injure the person or property of citizens , but they are not responsible for their deeds and should be held in safe custody in a hospital .

Oct. 1	DATE	modern society , an example of atavism , is dissected and rejected .

		Nor is the offender a degenerate , although degenerates are likely to commit crime .

		The theory of epilepsy as a constant cause of crim - inality is set aside .

		It is probable that
Tarde	PERSON	has not given due weight to physical defect in this causal series which ends in crime .

		Many competent ob - servers in all lands have been sure that prisoners are inferior on the average to the group from which they come ; and our author himself does not wholly reject this factor .

		The explanation which , according to Tarde , ac - counts for the most decisive facts is psychological and sociological in character .

		When we have seg - regated all the imbeciles , epileptics , and lunatics in educational , medical , and custodial colonies , we shall still have to deal with a large body of offenders who are nearly enough normal to be treated as respon - sible for their actions .

		The most fundamental dis - tinction to be made is that between rural and urban offenders , having as sub-groups violent criminals and thieves .

		Naturally the distinguished advocate of the theory of imitation , as an explanation of conduct in gen - eral , seeks to apply this theory to the phenomena of crime ; and while he may overlook other elements , he certainly makes good use of this unquestioned fact .

		Since he wrote the book now published all the psychologists have been examining his view of imitation , and their debate still continues .

		It is interesting to note some of the methods of applying the theory .

		The vices and crimes of to-day which are found in the lowest orders of the people de - scended to them from above . ''

		Drunk as a lord '' is a proverb which is now applied to common in - ebriates , but which points back to the time when nobles vied with each other in feats of drinking .

		Irreligion is copied from the learned and exalted .

		Vagabonds are the contemporary representatives of noble pilgrims and ministers of the Middle Ages .

		Poisoning is now a crime of the illiterate ; but once it flourished in palaces .

		We have professional murderers because the example was set by rich men who hired bravos and assassins .

		The glorification of war and soldiers bears some of the blame .

		Aristotle classed brigandage with agriculture and stock-raising as a natural industry available to man for the procuring of his subsistence .

		Says Tarde : `` If we concede to the economists that all wealth which is not acquired as the fruit of labor is the result of plunder , whether brutal or disguised in some manner , we can form an accurate idea of the enormously important part played by crime in the social functions . ''

		It would be interesting to have exact references to the orthodox economists who claim that all possessors of wealth who have not come into their possession by their own labor must therefore be plunderers and parasites .

		The diffi - culty is the one which
Robert Burns	PERSON	cites , the power to see ourselves as others see us .

		`` We reproach the savages who poison their arrows , and we ex - haust our brains to devise strange engines of de - struction , grape-shot , torpedoes , which in the twink - ling of an eye can sink the most formidable vessel of war and mow down two hundred thousand men in an hour on a single battlefield . ''

		England car - ried on a campaign against the slave trade abroad , while it left its women and children to physical and moral ruin in mine and factory .

		`` There is nothing to equal the progress of our political and military inhumanity , unless it be the depth of its unconsciousness ; our newspaper polemics breathe nothing but deadly hatred ; instigation to murder , the glorification of assassination , no longer astonish anybody in them .

		The inroads made by immorality upon morality , by dishonesty upon honesty , are as continuous as they are imperceptible .

		The tendency , in drawing rooms , seems by preference to be , as we are aware , to go to the extreme limit of respecta - bility , and to strive to extend that limit ; so much so that after a certain length of time , in a very lively society , a person can only continue to be respectable by saying the most indecent things possible . ''

		In our country these accusations can not justly be applied to the majority of the wealthy , either to their business standards or to their social inter - course ; but there can be no question that idleness in the second generation of inherited wealth , with - out any regulating belief in responsibility for earn - ing income , is producing its natural fruit , and that the example is pernicious .

		The crowded city , with its excitement , its conflicts , its allurements to excess , furnishes only too many base models for imitation .

		The city sets an evil example to the rural population , and crime spreads to the country by imitation .

		Tarde defends the notion of personal responsi - bility against writers of the positive and naturalistic school ; but he is a determinist to the core .

		The con - troversy is an old one , and there is no prospect of its coming to an end in our time .

		It may have some importance ; certainly our author states and defends his system of metaphysics with learning and subtle ingenuity , although most men will watch the debate very much as they do the feats of legerdemain , and go away puzzled and mystified .

		The point at which we can agree is that a man of sound mind who com - mits crime should be treated in a different way from an insane or feeble-minded person who performs the same act .

		Moral detestation is not only natural and rational , but it is a necessary part of wholesome re - action against anti-social conduct .

		If burglars and murderers are simply sick men to be pitied and cured , if they are not to be made to feel the reprobation of all right-minded people , we lose one of the most effective weapons of social defense , and one of the most powerful incentives to resist temptation .

		If it is monstrous to punish an idiot , it is just as monstrous to look upon a base assassin as simply a victim of `` brainstorm . ''

		`` When we shall cease to hate and stigmatize the criminal , crime will multiply . ''

		But this does not mean that society is to pursue the object of its just reprobation with eternal punish - ment .

		Wicked and loathsome as he may be , the criminal remains a person , with the rights and the
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 263 possibilities of a human being .

		Sentimentalism has no place either in relief of the indigent or punish - ment of the offender .

		True charity will be careful to avoid artificial creation of lazy parasites and malingerers .

		The administration of justice will re - form the guilty man , if this is possible ; and , if he is incorrigible , we are wealthy enough to '' pay for the luxury of kindness . ''

		This kindness will take the form of supporting him to the end of his days , if necessary , at public expense ; but he will be deprived of liberty , compelled to live as a celibate , denied the coarse pleasures for which he cares most , and required to work for the daily bread which keeps him alive .

		More important than all this punitive machinery is the social demand that privileged people spread among the evil-minded minority an example of their own honesty .

		`` To improve the guilty , to civilize bandits , is difficult and costly , and could not be called a good investment of time and money ex - pended .

		But this is an obligatory extravagance '' ; it will not pay , but it is duty .

		What will pay is what Tarde does not fully discuss : a system of pre - ventive and constructive legislation which will make reformatory prisons needless as rapidly as possible ; education , training , supervision , and control of neg - lected children and youth until they are all habitu - ated to work which earns a living and to recreations which do not corrupt .

		In dealing with the `` indeterminate sentence , '' conditional liberation , and the parole system , Tarde is very unsatisfactory .

		His allusions to American experiments do not reveal any knowledge of the work of our supervision of conditional liberty .

		This very successful method must therefore not be judged by his fragmentary treatment .

		At the same time , Tarde does not oppose the tendency to individualize the treatment and to train convicts for liberty during a period of surveillance , and he recommends the principle .

		`` It is thus not while in the cell that the convict can really gradually begin to improve morally ; it is only after he has left his cell ... Malefactors are game of a particular species , very hard to capture , which no one knows what to do with after it has been captured , and which it is as dangerous to set free as it is embarrassing to keep . ''

		Step by step , with vast patience and skill , the per - verted man must be helped to walk in freedom , until law-abiding conduct is second nature and the danger of relapse has been reduced to a minimum .

		In this immensely difficult task of reforming the morally deformed the supreme factor is a faithful personnel .

		Almost any system works well with a competent administrator ; while the best system fails in the hands of spoilsmen , incompetent , coarse , brutal , untrained .

		It is at this point alone that edu - cated men can make themselves felt in the adminis - tration of correctional institutions : they can insist on the merit system of selecting officers by examin - ation , probation , professional training , with security of tenure as long as they give evidence of efficiency .

		Tarde insists that modern society can supply such men . ''

		Our society is better down below than it is on its surface ; it has , like jewel cases , as
Joubert	PERSON	would say , ' its velvet on the inside . '

		It ought to be possible to bring together in a prison the worst human brutes and the finest types of men , such men as Cartouche and
Vincent de Paul	PERSON	.

		Let search be made for the latter ; in the end they will be found . ''

		But they are rarely found by a governor whose prin - cipal and dominant purpose is to get rid of trained officers and to instal , with good salaries , his favorite henchmen , to whom he owes political debts and who mock at the need of education and training .

		Tarde favors the retention of capital punishment as a means of deterrence and of elimination ; but he confesses that the evidence of intimidating influence is unsatisfactory , that the judicial killing of a dozen bad men out of thousands has little value in dimin - ishing their numbers , that statistics are unreliable and impossible to interpret .

		He does not adequately develop the method of permanent segregation of dangerous criminals through an extension of the '' indeterminate sentence '' with proper judicial con - trol .

		In spite of lending his high authority to the retention of capital punishment , the balanced state - ment of the facts may fairly be claimed by aboli - tionists as favorable to their plea .

		But no instructed abolitionist wishes to do away with this `` rudiment '' of savage ages without at the same time multiplying and strengthening the measures of social control of all youth who are forming anti-social habits , and of retaining in custody not only all incorrigible criminals but also all degenerates , insane , epileptic , and feeble - minded persons whose progeny are certain to be a perpetual menace to the order of society and to secu - rity of life , property , and morals .

		By a vigorous and prolonged effort , with the necessary financial invest - ment , we could in a few generations have all the advantages of the natural law of extinction of the unfit without reverting to the cruel methods of nature . ''

		So o'er that art which you say adds to nature Is an art which nature makes . ''

		The conclusions of Dr.
Gustaf Aschaffenburg	PERSON	, as embodied in his volume on `` Crime and Its Repres - sion , '' have long since found numerous advocates in
America	LOCATION	, and have been embodied , not without pro- test , in the so-called `` indeterminate sentence '' laws of several states .

		Yet the eminent author rarely alludes , even faintly , to American examples ; per - haps , as another German writer has recently said , because it is unpopular over there to cite the doings of the young Republic .

		We are not particularly wounded by this slight , for history will do us justice ; and the last
International Prison Congress	ORGANIZATION	recorded in its proceedings a testimony to our influence on the world movement .

		The eminent author , as a psychiatrist , starts from the basis of experimental science and not from rules established by precedents in an unscientific past .

		For this reason he is clear and decided where Tarde hesitates and splits hairs .

		Yet he is not dogmatic in his certainty ; he bases his conclusions on a wide 264 THE DIAI , -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	study of psychology , forensic medicine , and statistics , as well as on the judgments of many others , like him - self , who have had intimate contact with prisoners in correctional institutions .

		Among the causal factors affecting the kind or quantity of crime are mentioned variations of sea - sons , race , religion , occupation , alcohol , prostitution , gambling , and superstition .

		Poverty and alcohol - ism are regarded as the chief direct incentives to harmful conduct .

		Both socialists and prohibitionists may draw powerful weapons from this armory .

		Among individual factors are considered parentage and training , education , age , sex , domestic status , physical and mental conditions of the offenders .

		It is noteworthy that this distinguished physician rejects the idea that the criminal has inherited a specific criminal nature .

		Crime is not a disease .

		Yet criminals are known to be inferior to ordinary citizens , both physically and mentally , and they often inherit part of their defects .

		`` Weakness of body , mind , and will helps to account for the fact that these particular persons yield to the pressure of temptation and fall ; once fallen it is difficult to keep them on their feet thereafter .

		Therefore the protec - tion of society calls for a vigorous and persistent policy of elimination .

		Those who , immediately after release , go back to theft , burglary , rape , and arson should be kept under an indeterminate sentence , and prevented from injuring others , as is done with the dangerous insane .

		The short sentence in jail corrupts the harmless offender and does not reform the habitual .

		Education , economic improvement , and restric - tion of the drink traffic will have ' considerable value as preventive agencies , especially with youth ; but society ought to face the fact that there are many so weak in body and mind that they can not be trusted with freedom in ordinary competitive life .

		Eugenic ideas come to light at several points and deserve attention .

		While Dr.
Aschaffenburg	PERSON	is safely behind the most advanced experimental legislation in the
United States	LOCATION	, his facts , arguments , and eminent authority will greatly reinforce the progressive pol - icy which already has the support of the
American Prison Association	ORGANIZATION	and of the
American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology	ORGANIZATION	, as well as of able representatives in the
American Bar Associa	ORGANIZATION	- tions .

		CHARLES
RICHMOND HENDERSON	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Rambles in - ^ n inspiring account of his mental book-land with development , as promoted by the a boobtover .

		rea ding of all that is best in ancient and modern literature , is given by Professor
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	in his book entitled `` A One-Sided Autobi - ography : Containing the Story of My Intellectual Life '' -LRB-
Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Preparing himself tor college with no teacher to guide his studies , and with only the night hours free for the purpose , Mr.
Kuhns	PERSON	was admitted to
Wesleyan University	ORGANIZATION	with but few conditions , and there pursued , with an enthusiasm now become too rare , the old classical course leading to the bachelor 's degree ; but he adds a confession of peculiar significance when he says : `` Yet I do not think I enjoyed the pure delight of reading in college so much as I did before going there . ''


Berlin	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and other centres of learning were afterward visited , and some of the greatest scholars of the later nineteenth century were listened to with profit .

		From first to last , however , Mr.
Kuhns	PERSON	seems to have been his own best guide in the realm of literature , breaking his own path down through the ages , and ordering his studies after a system of his own .

		His taste in books is truly catholic , and the range of his reading remarkably wide , while the intimate , personal touch he gives to his talk about his favorites imparts a charm to his chapters such as is not found in every collection of literary essays .

		Dante is the author he has studied most faithfully , taught to others with the greatest ardor , and read and re-read with the most unfailing enjoyment which is all in accord with what he says of `` that phase of my own nature which is per - haps the deepest of all , a sense of the divine and the spiritual in and over and beyond all things material in life . ''

		Of his passion for poetry he says he can - not tell when it began . ''

		Away back in the mist of childhood years I can see that it existed , and amid all the vicissitudes of life it has continued to broaden and deepen , until to-day it seems to include in itself all the charm I have found in music , or the plastic arts , in nature , the joys of home and friends , the beauty of woman , the charm of innocent childhood , and the deeper aspirations of the soul toward the spiritual world . ''

		Some graceful lines of his own prefixed to the volume show the author to be himself not lacking in the accomplishment of verse .

		Greater care in verifying quotations and book-titles -LRB- slippery and treacherous things even with the best of mem - ories -RRB- would have improved the book ; and ` more vigilant proof-reading would have prevented the occurrence of occasional misprints .

		A French '' Sprawly '' is the only word which estimate of adequately characterizes the volume ,
Meredith	PERSON	.

		translated from the French of
M. Constantin Photiades	ORGANIZATION	, entitled ''
George Meredith	PERSON	: His Life , Genius , and Teaching '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		M ,
Photiades	ORGANIZATION	is an enthusiastic admirer of
Meredith	LOCATION	, and a minute student of the master 's works ; but he has little critical insight , and still less capacity for synthesis .

		Fortunately , the book is made up largely of straight narrative , in which the author is facile , and of comment upon citations , in which he is often felicitous .

		The intervening patches of general criti - cism contain much mere verbiage , which passes now and then into undiscriminating adulation with an amusingly Gallic strain to it . ''

		A Faith on Trial '' is characterized as '' a magnificent poem of melan - choly '' ; Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, because of his touching little elegy on
Meredith	PERSON	, becomes `` a visionary bathed
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 265 in purest rays of light . ''

		The chapter on '' His Life '' is purely factual , though vivacious .

		That on '' His Genius `` resolves itself , after a little beating of wings , into a careful and interesting summary , in ninety pages , of ''
Harry Richmond	PERSON	'' ; the author 's predi - lection for this novel , with its comparatively light and superficial narrative , is quite characteristic .

		That on '' His Teaching '' is , as might be expected , the most sprawly of all ; it tells the English reader nothing that is not better told in already existing books and articles in English .

		The remaining two chapters are the best .

		`` A Visit to
Flint	LOCATION	Cottage , '' apart from its touches of the melodramatic , gives a picture of Meredith which we should not willingly do without .

		The novelist himself does most of the talking , on such subjects as
Tennyson	PERSON	-LRB- whose '' In Memoriam '' associates itself in the speaker 's mind with '' psychic crises of young clergymen silently tormented with doubt '' but failing not in the end to conform -RRB- , the English language as a vehicle for poetry ,
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's `` Omar , ''
Swinburne	PERSON	, the critics -LRB- `` each of them is at best but the slave placed near the conqueror to remind him of his mortal condi - tion '' -RRB- , the relationship between his own poetry and prose , the significance of
France	LOCATION	, etc. .

		These topics are common , of course , in the recently-published Letters of Meredith ; but the master 's remarks dur - ing this interview are none the less fresh and wel - come .

		The chapter on ``
George Meredith	PERSON	's Art '' contains some thought-provoking things about the novelist 's style .

		That the defects of this style are due to
Meredith	PERSON	's constant attempt `` to sift circum - stances , to weigh them with care , and with a result always beneficial to sound judgment and art '' is cer - tainly a truer view than that they arose , as a well - known American critic has asserted , from confirmed dilettantism .

		It is interesting , also , to find a thoughtful French reader maintaining that `` thanks to the wizard
Meredith	PERSON	, English idiom is emanci - pated '' ; and that
Meredith	PERSON	effected a much-needed '' union of English poetry and English prose . ''

		A final point must be noted in regard to this uneven book : it exaggerates
Meredith	PERSON	's affiliations with the French .

		The author quite misses the fundamentally Anglo-Saxon trend of his hero 's temperament ; with the result that
Meredith	PERSON	here appears , on the whole , '' an ultra-Gallican gentleman '' like ReneVs fiance * , at whom he pokes such fine fun , for that very quality , in ''
Beauchamp	PERSON	's Career . ''

		Records of two Mr ' Hu g h B '' .

		C ''
Pollard	PERSON	's volume , journalists iil the '' A Busy Time in
Mexico	LOCATION	: An land of unrest .

		Unconventional Record of Mexican Incident '' -LRB-
Duffield	PERSON	-RRB- , is appropriately named both in title and sub-title .

		A busy and exciting time the author undoubtedly had ; and his record is `` unconventional '' to the extent of being inaccurate in so many particulars as to create the suspicion that it may be exaggerated in others .

		It contains , however , some extremely interesting matter that has appeared in no previous volume on
Mexico	LOCATION	, and its score or more of illustrations are from photographs hitherto unpublished .

		It describes the personal experiences of the author , who first landed in the state of
Chiapas	LOCATION	near the Guatemalan fron - tier ; and after some time spent in that region pro- ceeded to the
City of Mexico	LOCATION	, arriving there in time to have his interest awakened in the Madero revolt .

		He then assumed the r6le of correspondent for some American newspapers , was present at several of the skirmishes in the neighborhood of the capital , and finally left the
City of Mexico	LOCATION	on one of the sections of the train which bore ex - President
Diaz	PERSON	to
Vera Cruz	PERSON	and into exile .

		In a postscript writ - ten apparently in
London	LOCATION	, he describes the assassi - nation of Madero and speculates upon the probable future attitude of the
United States	LOCATION	toward
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		Had the author prepared himself for his visit to
Mexico	LOCATION	, and for writing a book , by a study of Mex - ican history he would not have slipped into such an error as the following : `` Vera Cruz the rich city of the
Holy Cross	ORGANIZATION	as Drake termed it . ''

		It was
Cortez	PERSON	who established the city and named it `` La Villa Rica de la
Santa Vera Cruz	LOCATION	. ''

		Eminently appropriate is the characterization of
Mexico	LOCATION	in the title of Mr.
Henry Baerlein	PERSON	's volume , ''
Mexico	LOCATION	, the Land of Unrest : Being chiefly an Account of what Produced the Outbreak of
1910	DATE	, together with the Story of the Revolution down to This Day '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- .

		But the book fails utterly to fulfil the promise of its title-page , much to the disappoint - ment of the reader eager to know something of `` what produced the outbreak of
1910	DATE	, '' and `` the story of the revolution down to this day . ''

		In the first place , the author 's English is at fault , and his style is cryptic .

		This may be due to the influence of his mother tongue ; but whatever the cause , the reader may toil through some of his paragraphs , extending over six or seven pages and skipping from one subject to another , and arrive at the end with a confused feeling as to what it is all about .

		The author 's position is distinctly anti-Diaz , and he is hopelessly committed to the previously-pub - lished accounts of the slavery in Yucatan and the inhumanity of
Diaz	PERSON	.

		But the character of the book is little improved by the reproduction of crude car - icatures from Mexican papers , or by the author 's chapter entitled `` Diaz at the Door of Hell , '' which reads like an undergraduate skit in a college annual .

		It should be said that the book contains a fine map of
Mexico	LOCATION	folded within a pocket attached to the front cover , and a very good collection of illustra - tions -LRB- excepting the caricatures above mentioned -RRB- .

		The appendices contain a useful glossary of Spanish - American terms and some interesting notes on the native languages .


Germany	LOCATION	is preeminently the land of socialism .

		At the general elections of
1912	DATE	more than four and a quarter million votes were cast for socialist candidates , and one hundred and ten of these candidates were re - turned to seats in the
Reichstag	LOCATION	.

		This , however , tells but a part of the story .

		It is true that a large 266 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	proportion of those who vote for socialist candidates are not full-fledged socialists , and furthermore , that the socialist party as such has never yet been strong enough to enact a law or to assume an active share in the administrative system .

		But on the other hand it is to be observed that the socialism of the '' reds '' does not occupy the field alone .

		There is also the socialism of the crown , more restrained and less com - prehensive , but just as truly socialism ; and through - out a generation this monarchical , or state , socialism has been carrying the Empire step by step in the very direction in which the '' reds '' would have it go .

		The pace is not swift , but it is seemingly sure .

		German state socialism , as it is familiarly known , came into being in the days of
Bismarck	LOCATION	and comprised from the outset a programme of state ownership and other state enterprise intended to alleviate social distress , to promote public prosperity , and thereby to cut the ground from under the feet of the Marxians ,
Rodbertians	PERSON	, and other extremists .

		Its protagonists were
Wagner	PERSON	,
Schmoller	PERSON	,
Schaeffle	LOCATION	, and
Schonberg	PERSON	, and its first great convert was the Iron Chancellor himself .

		Already in a number of the German states the principle of the public ownership and control of railways , mines , and other utilities had found appli - cation ; and beginning with the enactment of the sickness and accident insurance laws of
1883	DATE	and
1884	DATE	, the Empire , under
Bismarck	PERSON	's guidance , em - barked upon a cautious but far-reaching programme of socialistic operations .

		In a modest and well - written volume entitled `` Monarchical Socialism in
Germany	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , Mr.
Elmer Roberts	PERSON	describes the progress and present status of this programme .

		He shows what has been done in respect to the state control of railways and other public utilities , the development of labor exchanges and the remedying of unemployment , the taxation of land , the regula - tion of trusts , the upbuilding of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	, and a number of other matters , and he predicts the con - tinued advance of
Germany	LOCATION	along the pathway thus marked out .

		The impression , indeed , is left with the reader that , in the main , the notable prosperity of the German people to-day is attributable to the following of this course an impression quite the contrary of that to be obtained from Mr.
Price Collier	PERSON	's recent book , ``
Germany	LOCATION	and the Germans . ''

		Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	has long been a representative of the
Associated Press	ORGANIZATION	in
Germany	LOCATION	, and he writes out of a considerable fulness of experience and observation .

		Under the title , `` French Prophets of Yesterday '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , Professor
Albert L. Gue	PERSON	`` rard of
Stanford Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity has written a most dispassionate and objective history of French religious and philosophic thought during the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	, from the standpoint of its contribution to the solution of the religious ques - tion in
France	LOCATION	to-day .

		And as the question now being faced in
France	LOCATION	is , in an acute form , the same that
America	LOCATION	will face to-morrow , and that
England	LOCATION	is already beginning to face , the valuable lessons of the book have much more than a merely national The trend of religion in
France	LOCATION	.

		significance .

		The four main strands of progress during the era before the new scientific spirit irra - diated thought were Catholicism , with its literary analogue in Romanticism and its travesties in the various cults of evil ; Protestantism , which never had a chance in
France	LOCATION	because it could only make a wide enough separation from the authority of Catholicism to fall into the other extreme of Free Thought and again be lost ;
Voltairianism	LOCATION	, which is spiritually barren ; and Humanitarianism , which is only a spasmodic faith mediated by social and polit - ical crises , and which is powerless as an every-day guide to the best living .

		The author traces these faiths and their failings , exhibits the work of such critics of their tendencies as Renan , and shows pretty conclusively that Modernism within the Catholic church , the present-day hope of so many thinkers , is an impossible solution of the difficulty because it is at the outset simply a contradiction in terms .

		`` Shall we close this review on a discord ? ''

		he asks , after showing that supernaturalism is out of the purview of rational speculation , and that naturalism alone is not a religion but merely descriptive in its function .

		And he can only answer that question by emphasizing the fact that both supernaturalism and naturalism point to the aspirations of man .

		And that man has aspirations and ever strives to live by them , is , in this day of criticism and doubt , the only solid fact to which the religious inquirer may cling with any degree of certainty and comfort .

		Thesiorv Careful study of a fascinating sub - ofanold ject is manifest in Mr.
Hilaire Bel	PERSON	- Romanroad .

		i oc g monO g rap h O n `` The Stane Street '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , in which he presents , first , some general considerations on Roman roads in
Britain	LOCATION	, then takes up `` the particular case of the Stane Street , '' the general line of the road and its four divisions or `` limbs , '' the camps or `` mansiones '' along its course , its historical character , and the modern divergences from the ancient highway ; next follows a discussion of certain details in suc - cessive sections of the road ; and , finally , there are appended notes , a folding map , and a full index .

		Sketch maps in abundance are printed with the text , and landscape drawings , some of them of much beauty , are furnished by Mr.
William Hyde	PERSON	.

		Stane Street ran from
Chichester	LOCATION	to
London	LOCATION	, or , more specifically , to
London	LOCATION	Bridge , and the prob - able method by which it was surveyed , with the conjecturable reasons of its occasional deflections from a straight line , afford matter for research and surmise of an interesting sort .

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	handles his theme with skill and learning , and it is a pleasure to follow his argument and to ac - company him in his journey over the historic road , much of which still appears to be in use , as a modern macadamized thoroughfare , with certain stretches not yet brought up to date .

		In his zeal to acknowledge English indebtedness to the con - quering Roman , he goes rather too far when he asserts that it is impossible `` to prove one institu -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 267 tion or one inherited handling of material things to have descended to us from the outer barbar - ism , '' that is , from non-Roman origins .

		Surely our daily speech is full of Anglo-Saxon words in - dicating the inheritance of both institutions -LRB- take merely the terms home , wedlock , king , earl , knight -RRB- and of the handling of material things -LRB- as borne witness to by such agricultural terms as plough , hoe , rake , thresh , winnow -RRB- from sources other than Roman and older than the Roman occupation of
Britain	LOCATION	or the extension of the Roman dominion beyond the Alps .

		However , we would not quarrel with the author 's enthusiasm for his chosen theme , since to it the book owes its charm as literature .

		The recent revolution in
China	LOCATION	, Mr.
Frederick McCormick	PERSON	's `` The Flowery Republic '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a book of considerable value to one who wishes a full statement of the details of the re - cent revolution by which the oldest empire became over night the youngest republic .

		Apart from the narration of facts , however , this study of the revolu - tion offers little of worth .

		Moreover , the chronology of the revolution is not so clear in Mr.
McCormick	PERSON	's treatment as one would like to have it , since the writer inverts the time order on occasion in his effort to attain a journalistic realism of style .

		Beginning with his own appearance on the scene after the beginning of the outbreak , he alternates throughout the book between the reporter 's account of what he sees and the historian 's statement of the main events .

		This method affords at times interest - ing sidelights upon incidents and personalities of the revolution , and at times clear statements of impor - tant episodes in their proper relation ; but the two styles of narration are not happily blended , and each blurs the impression made by the other .

		Indeed , a decidedly blurred impression is left upon the reader by the whole book .

		One never feels quite certain whether the author possessed accurate and adequate knowledge of the Chinese people , nor does one know certainly whether the author 's opinion of them and of their present leaders is on the whole favorable or unfavorable .

		Compliments bestowed freely in one chapter are in full collision with heavy condemnation in a neighboring section of the treatise , so that the reader is left with the feeling that the author is a safe prophet , no matter what turn events may take .

		The bulk of the book has to do with the murder of
Darnley	PERSON	, the precipitate
Bothwell	PERSON	marriage , the im - prisonment in
Lochleven Castle	LOCATION	, and the defeat at
Langside	LOCATION	, leaving about one-quarter of the volume to cover the remaining events of
Mary	ORGANIZATION	's forty-four years .

		The author declares himself to be an im - partial chronicler , not a partisan , and his straight - forward narrative seems to prove that he is unen - tangled by the fatal fascinations of his heroine , although he has been paying her attentions for nearly two decades .

		Original sources , he says , have been consulted in the preparation of his book , and many are '' now utilized as biographical data for the first time . ''

		No notes , however , or bibli - ographical references are introduced , the evident purpose being to present the
Queen of Scots	ORGANIZATION	in a few clear and telling strokes , with strict avoidance of irrelevant details .

		In this Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	has suc - ceeded .

		The book is well illustrated , chiefly with portraits .

< Gretton	PERSON	, who is engaged during the last in writing the history of
England	LOCATION	three decades .

		d ur i ng tne last three decades , has recently published the first of his two projected volumes under the comprehensive title , `` A Modern History of the English People '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The volume covers the period from
1880	DATE	to
1898	DATE	, and is packed with details drawn chiefly from the files of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times . ''

		Mr.
Gretton	PERSON	writes well , and has given us a number of chapters that are both interesting and valuable ; his emphasis on the importance of the labor movement and his account of the vicissitudes of trade unionism are to be especially noted and commended .

		But his chief purpose has been to give an account of everything that interested English society during the period covered , and this has led him to include a mass of really trivial details that have only a passing interest and had but a slight effect on the course of events .

		One of his chapters is headed ``
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Egypt	LOCATION	and Jumbo '' ; and more than a page is given to the importance of the popular song , `` Ta-ra-ra-boom - de-ay , '' as indicating the state of English taste in the early nineties .

		There are many other indications of erratic judgment on the author 's part which ob - scure the real excellences of his work .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		In a certain very popular novel , with a very popular hero , that hero 's name is not once disclosed , but he is always spoken of as '' the Virginian . ''

		In Miss
Marie L. Marsh	PERSON	's juvenile chronicle , `` Auburn and Freckles '' -LRB-
Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the chief character is likewise nameless ; he is always `` the freckled boy . ''

		His ad - ventures are varied , amusing , and unfailingly boylike .

		One can not tell beforehand what he will do , but it is sure to be something delightfully characteristic of a red-headed , freckle-faced boy with the instincts proper to his kind .

		His friends help to give variety to the narrative ; and there is very little danger that any reader , adult or juvenile , will go to sleep over its pages .

		The freckled boy is a thoroughly likable youngster , worthy of a place in the same class with
Tom Sawyer	PERSON	268 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	and
Tom Bailey	PERSON	and the rest of our boy-favorites in lit - erature .

		The writer 's rendering of boy-talk is success - ful , neither over-done nor falling short of verisimilitude ; but in one place there occurs a curiously awkward attempt to represent the abbreviated corruption of '' without , '' which of course should be '' ` thout , '' and not '' ` thought , '' as we find it printed .

		That Oscar Wilde 's poems should be included in so popular and standard a series as the '' Astor Poets '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is emphatic proof of the secure place that he now occupies in literature .

		The edition is evidently complete , including as it does the '' Uncollected Poems '' first published in the complete English edition de luxe , and the exquisite `` poems in prose . ''

		Mr.
Nathan Has	PERSON	- kell
Dole	PERSON	contributes a biographical introduction which , good as it is , would be still better if it were half as long .

		It seems to us a pity to perpetuate in such a place as this so many of the more or less apocryphal anecdotes of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's foibles and extravagances .

		It is his greatness , rather than his littleness , that should be emphasized .

		The low price at which the volume is issued , together with its attractive and careful typography , should make this a favorite edition .

		The discriminating few who have found delight in that exquisite bit of writing , '' The Roadmender , '' will be glad to learn something of its author in the little volume entitled ``
Michael Fairless	PERSON	: Her Life and Writ - ings '' -LRB- Button - -RRB- .

		Under the pseudonym of ``
Michael Fairless	PERSON	'' was concealed the gentle personality of Miss
Margaret Fairless Barber	PERSON	, a gifted Englishwoman who died at thirty-two after several years of acute physical suffering . ''

		The Roadmender '' was written during her last months , as were also her two other books '' The Gathering of Brother Hilarius '' and '' The Gray Brethren . ''

		In the volume now published , her sister , Mrs.
Haggard	PERSON	, supplies a slender biographical chapter ; while her literary executor , Mrs.
Dowson	PERSON	, contributes the critical portion .

		Two portraits of ''
Michael Fair	PERSON	- less '' add to the interest of this record of a rarely gifted personality .

		In the guise of a fable or folk-tale of ingenious con - struction , Mr.
C. H. Robinson	PERSON	relates the history of the part supposed to have been played by fire in the raising of primitive man from his lowest level to one appre - ciably higher . ''

		Longhead : The Story of the First Fire '' -LRB- Page -RRB- traces the fortunes of the observant and inventive hero , the dolichocephalous Longhead , and his somewhat similarly gifted spouse , Broken Tooth , after his accidental discovery , in which a fortunate stroke of lightning plays a prominent part , of the singular nature of fire and some of its useful properties .

		How the dis - covery leads eventually to the rudimentary beginnings of domestic and social life , of cooperation , the useful arts , government , and even religion , is agreeably pic - tured , with some forcing of the motive or underlying thought , perhaps , but with no detriment to the interest of the tale .

		The author 's use of '' brachiocephalic '' -LRB- `` arm-headed , '' if it means anything -RRB- instead of '' brachycephalic , '' as the antonym of '' dolichocephalic '' or `` dolichocephalous , '' is a little surprising ; and in this connection one might question whether there were any long-skulled men among those most nearly brutal an - cestors of ours of whom
Longhead	LOCATION	is supposed to have been one .

		But the story is a good and instructive piece of imaginative anthropology for the young , and its illustrations by Mr.
Charles Livingston	PERSON	Bull are in harmony with the text .

		NOTES . ''

		To-day and Yesterday in
New Rochelle	LOCATION	, '' by Dr.
J. Pettit Gaylord	PERSON	, is soon to be issued in an illustrated volume by

		The '' novel of the season '' for many readers will be Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's '' The Dark Flower , '' which Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	plan to issue this month .

		To those who have followed its serial publication , it has seemed much the strongest work yet put forth by this writer .

		A volume of collected verse by Mr.
Brian Hooker	PERSON	appears on the autumn list of the
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Hooker	PERSON	wrote the opera ''
Mona	PERSON	, '' which , set to music by Professor

		By the death of

		BRIEFER MENTION 312 NOTES 313 LIST OF NHW BOOKS ... 314 A FAMOUS VICTORY .

		The enactment of the new tariff law , which went into effect on an early day in the present month , may fairly be described as a famous victory a victory for the forces that are assail - ing the citadel of corruption and special privi - lege .

		Even little
Peterkin	PERSON	could be made to understand the reasons why it deserves this title .

		We can share to the full in the exultation felt by President
Wilson	PERSON	in the solemn moment when he affixed his signature to the act , saying , as he did so : `` I feel a peculiar pleasure in what I have just done by way of taking part in the completion of a great piece of business .

		It is a pleasure which is hard to express in words which are adequate to express the feeling ; because the feeling that I have is that we have done the rank and file of the people of this country a great service .

		I have a feeling of profound gratitude that , working with the splendid men who have carried this thing through with studious attention and doing justice all around , I should have had part in serving the people of this country as we have been striving to serve them ever since I can remember . ''

		It is , indeed , '' a great piece of business '' to have dealt such a body blow to the intrenched inter - ests that have so long set the common welfare at defiance , and , with the rancid patriotism and nauseous hypocrisy of their defence of an inde - fensible system , have for so long made the worse appear the better reason to the muddled public intelligence .

		Of a truth , the plea for protec - tionism is revolting to the trained mind , and the shifts to which its advocates have been reduced in recent years have provided a startling object - lesson of the tenacity of irrationalism .

		There never were but two arguments in its favor hav - ing about them a shred of logical respectability the infant industry argument , and the argu - ment that a country should be self-sustaining in the necessaries of existence and both of these have been so ludicrously inapplicable to our practice of protectionism during the last half - century that its hardened defenders have been almost ashamed to use them .

		Instead of them , we have had the pauper labor argument , and the bread line argument , and the dumping argument , and the cheap man argument , and the foreigner - pays-the-tax argument , all of them so ineffably silly that they have strained the enormous capa - city of the ordinary mind to be humbugged .

		Now , at least , the air is partly cleared , and 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	a large share of the ill-gotten gains which the beneficiaries of the old vicious system have been pocketing under the sanction of law has been turned back into the channels of competitive industry , and the injured fill our ears with dismal prophesyings .

		But we must not forget , in all our satisfaction about what has been accomplished , that the victory is by no means complete , and must be regarded as only a first step although a long one toward the desired goal .

		The new tariff law is still a highly pro- tective measure , and its schedules contain many duties that our daughters of the horse-leech in the days before the Civil War would have re - garded as higher than there was any use in demanding .

		A tariff law that continues to tax any foreign products -LRB- except luxuries -RRB- fifty per cent and upwards is by no means a matter for unqualified self-congratulation on the part of the consumer , who may still indignantly ask : '' Why should the law force me to buy from the domestic producer something which I want , and pay him this enormous tribute , when it is offered me elsewhere at a reasonable price ? ''

		The question is insistent , and will not down ; it is a question quite as pertinent under the new law as it was under the outrageous provisions of the old one .

		All we have thus far done has been to make a sort of compromise between the social - istic policy of protectionism and the policy of taxation which takes into account only the principles of equitable incidence and adequate revenue , and between these policies a lasting compromise is no more possible than between darkness and light , or between evil and good .

		There are certain tariff matters with which a journal like ours is especially concerned which loom much larger in the consciousness than their political or financial importance would warrant .

		As citizens of the republic , we are concerned with such things as the cotton and woollen and lumber schedules ; as conductors of a journal having for its special field the interests of culture , we are much more largely concerned with such matters as the tariff on books and works of art , and with the provisions that affect the comfort of returning travellers .

		We have called the tariff on books the meanest of taxes , and we deeply regret that it will continue to retard the progress of education and culture .

		The Presi - dent can not be held guiltless of the perpetuation of this enormity , for no one can doubt that the firmness which he displayed in his demand for free wool and free sugar could have obtained for us free books without the least difficulty .

		And there is a sense in which free books are , more important than either free wool or free sugar .

		That they are withheld is a fact that has about it a shameful and humiliating quality that does not attach to an unjustifiable tax upon a merely commercial product .

		If a President who stands for scholarship more distinctly than any we have had since the early Virginian dy - nasty can fail us so lamentably , the case seems indeed hopeless .

		It is true that , after an ener - getic protest , the indecent attempt to take books in foreign languages from the free list has been abandoned , that English Bibles and text - books are now admitted free , and that the tax on En - glish books in general has been reduced from twenty-five to fifteen per cent , but these are only palliations of a grievous offence .

		A tax of one per cent upon them would be almost as obnox - ious as the higher one now in force , because any tax at all means that an English book can not be sent to an American scholar by post without being held up at the custom-house , and this fact , far rather than the increased price , is the head and front of the offending .

		As for books imported by booksellers , the lowered tax means a possible lowering of the price by
two cents	MONEY	in the shilling , and we may be fairly sure that the individual purchaser will not get even that small benefit .

		The victory of the forces that have been de - manding untaxed works of art is indeed a no - table one .

		The opposition to this enlightened measure was of so unreasoning and pigheaded a description that it seemed hopeless to seek to overcome it .

		But the hopeless was accom - plished , thanks to the strong concerted attack made upon this proposed monstrosity of taxa - tion .

		At the risk of seeming to be engaged in the unnecessary task of slaying the slain , we will make the following quotations from the brief of Mr.
John Quinn	PERSON	, acting as counsel for the American artists in their demand not to be protected by an over-zealous government : '' The art of every age is the flowering of all the sci - entific and all the philosophic thought of its own day and time .

		It quickens vitality and intensifies the love of beauty and increases the joy of life .

		The plea that I make for free contemporary fine art is a plea that art may be brought within the reach of people of modest means and not remain the trading commodity of wealthy art-dealers or become merely the hobby or the exclusive possession of the rich . '' ''

		As was pointed out in my brief , we are the only or substantially the only civilized country that taxes art .

		We spend hundreds of thousands and even millions on museums , art galleries , art commissions , municipal , state and national , and yet
the Finance Committee of the Senate	ORGANIZATION	proposes to erect a Chinese wall fifty feet high against the importation of modern , vital , living , creative art . '' ''

		It is an absurdity to argue that art is merely a
1913	DATE	-RSB- 293 luxury .

		It is a degradation to treat it as though it were something like opium or a drug or an adulterated food or like a contagious disease , and it is uncivilized and reactionary to consider it merely as a means of raising a little revenue , as if it were leather or wool or machinery or tobacco or bananas or cotton goods or like any other articles of utility that need ' protection ' or afford a chance to raise a little revenue from . ''

		Even our benighted senatorial law-makers had to yield to such persuasions as these , and with respect to our national attitude toward art we may now at last be reckoned among the civil - ized countries .

		But we still belong with the barbarians in the matter of books , and in the matter of those tariff provisions which now make the return from abroad a terror to every American traveller .

		No American who has ever learned by personal experience the contrast between the treatment of the tourist in
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean and American custom-houses has not blushed for his country ; and if the numbers of such returning tourists were o ^ y large enough , we should not long have to endure an admin - istrative system which regards every one of them as an object of suspicion , and which re - quires , in addition to a personal declaration of innocence , an inquisitive investigation to deter - mine the truth of that declaration .

		THE AUTHOR OFEREWHON . ''

		Is there any certain recipe for contemporary reputation ?

		Catching on to coat-tails is as good a counsel as any .

		It is as valuable for the catchee as for the catcher ; for if enough people of parts can be induced to form a train , their light , singly perhaps indiscernable , may together flare out in our sky like a comet which `` fires the length of
Ophiuchus	LOCATION	huge . ''

		Such a combination of brillancies is not only pardon - able but laudable .

		Meier-Graef e said that the Pre - Raphaelite movement in
England	LOCATION	was a criminal conspiracy .

		But this is shooting way beyond the mark .

		Natural sympathy caused the members of the group to gravitate together , and they did a needed work .

		Only , for awhile , their preoccupation with themselves , the flood of books and articles which they poured forth about each other , threw everything else in
England	LOCATION	into obscurity .

		The movement was not really the central fact of the time , but it had the appearance of being so ; and other great names or great issues were eclipsed .

		The pioneers , the originators among men , have , however , usually a solitary lot .

		Luck , or just hitting the right moment , may sometimes get them an imme - diate following ; but more often theirs is a lonely fight with the world .

		Like
Winkelried	PERSON	, they must gather the spears of the Philistines into their breasts in order to make a way for the
Children of Light	ORGANIZATION	.

		And too often those who follow them into the breach are pseudo Children of Light , Children of Light for revenue only , who give an additional stab to the leader who has made their victory possible .

		But when such a leader is comfortably dead , then his struggle and his obscurity are at an end .

		He is treasure trove for the whole world .

		A few explorers discover him at first , and they bring back and exhibit the nuggets of rich ore in which his work abounded .

		Then there is a Klondike rush to his `` diggings , '' as there was not long ago to
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	.

		The recently published `` Note Books '' of
Samuel Butler	PERSON	show plainly enough that their writer died in the modest assurance that he was of this order of men , and would , intellectually , '' cut up rich . ''

		This interesting miscellany of fragments , notes , diaries , essays , bears a striking resemblance to the `` Parerga '' of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	.

		There is the same solitary attitude of disdain for his contemporaries , and very much the same views of life , death , genius , and greatness .

		Unfortunately ,
Schopenhauer	PERSON	came first , and the massy brilliancy of his prose is beyond anything the Englishman has achieved . ''

		Can you emit sparks ? ''

		is the first question we ask of a writer of this kind .

		Unquestionably
Butler	PERSON	can and does emit sparks ; but compared with the broad , vigorous flashes of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, they are small and dim .

		His ideas resemble the older man 's as the second infusion of tea-leaves in the pot resembles the first brew .

		Or his mind might be compared to a sieve into which all the thoughts of his great contemporaries in science and philosophy have been poured : the lesser thoughts get through and into his books , but the larger ones remain behind unused .

		We may adopt what attitude we please towards
Schopenhauer	PERSON	and Nietzsche : we may call the first the Apostle of Gloom and the sec - ond the Prophet of Unrighteousness ; but the fact remains that they startle , astound , and wake us up .

		They are capable of giving the world those electric shocks that resurrect it .

		Butler 's battery of magnetic truths is only a respectable one , and we think that in
England	LOCATION	alone there are several of his contem - poraries who surpass him in novelty and force of opinion .

		In science his study of heredity and habit may have more originality than we can see in it when considered along with the investigations of
Darwin	LOCATION	,
Galton	PERSON	, and
Von Hartmann	PERSON	; but it is certainly not epoch-making .

		Butler indulged himself in a number of opinions which can hardly be called anything but crochets .

		One of these was that the English school of music is the finest in the world , and that
Handel	PERSON	is not only the greatest of all musicians , but the greatest man who has ever worked in any of the arts .

		That is a question of taste ; and if a person chooses to have a taste of that kind there is nothing more to say ex - cept that he is not likely to be of a prevailing party .

		Another of his crochets was that the Odyssey was written by a woman .

		That is a question of fact ; and as there are no facts adducible to prove it , and all tradition and the acceptance of ages being against it , the theory must be waved aside .

		Again and again , in his '' Note Books '' and else - 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	where ,
Butler	PERSON	shows himself sensitive to the charge of being a man of one hook .

		`` Erewhon '' was the one success of his career , and it came early .

		That he could have repeated this success and won contem - porary literary fame is probable ; but he branched off into painting , music , and other kinds of achievement .

		Towards the end of his life he essayed the modern novel of manners in '' The Way of All Flesh . ''

		This , however , was published posthumously , and any vogue it may have had came too late to console him .

		There were undoubtedly in his character a lofty indifference to practical results and a high disdain of literary quackery .

		But there was also a lack of verve and flow and continuity , which explains the scantiness of his product and the paucity of his repute .

		Mr.
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	suggests that `` The Way of All Flesh '' is a masterpiece .

		It is not neces - sary to state , therefore , that it belongs to the school of fiction which holds up life by the tail , like a strug - gling puppy , and not to the school which places life on a pedestal for study and admiration .

		This school might be called that of the Dropped Veil , for it prides itself on tearing away all illusion from existence .

		As most of the great philosophies of the world main - tain that all existence is illusion , this kind of fiction can not have a very sound philosophical basis .

		Most of us hug our illusions , and get enough interest and amusement out of life to make us want to live .

		But the new fiction preaches to us that it would have been money in our pockets if we had never been born .

		It is not that it deals with more forbidden material than the older fiction , with worse vices and crimes , with more terrible outlooks upon time and eternity .

		That would be an impossible feat , for all the secrets of evil have long been embodied in immortal verse and prose .

		But the new fiction goes about its work of being bad in a hard didactic way , which , though it convinces us that the Devil is dull and Evil is only another word for ennui , makes its novels and plays as repulsive as tracts , and kills all joy in us .

		The joy of festival and the joy of battle , the delight of the senses and the heroism of the soul , these surely are the things that literature should convey to us and convince us of .

		With the best will in the world to be what they call brutally true , the new fictionists are continually having to make concessions to romanticism .

		The whole plot of `` The Way of All Flesh '' is an instance of this .

		It bears a distant resemblance to the plot of ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	. ''

		In both books the hero is set loose to flounder about in the world , get into bad company , and fall into evil ways .

		In ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	'' there is a certain College of Guardians which watches and directs
Wilhelm	PERSON	's course unknown to him , and only lets him out as it were on a leash .

		In
Butler	PERSON	's book this business is assumed by an older relative , who holds a large fortune secretly in trust for the hero , and who steers him through his misadventures .

		Of course this is playing the game of realism with loaded dice .

		It is making Achilles invulnerable , and then patting him on the back for being brave .

		Butler 's hard , tight style prevents his portraits from having much literary lure ; but in one char - acter , a reincarnation of Mrs. Quickly , he nearly arrives at a creation .

		The girl
Ellen	PERSON	is painted in hard , bright colors ; but as we have spoken of ''
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	'' we may compare her with
Philina	LOCATION	, in order to see how charm and mystery and illusion are needed to make anything that is living .

		Mr.
Pontifex	PERSON	, the hero 's father , is almost the raison d'etre of the book ; but he bores us as much as he did his son .

		As a clergyman he is not as prepos - terous as Mr.
Collins	PERSON	; as a father he is not more erring than Mr.
Bennet	PERSON	; but whereas custom can - not stale the infinite variety of
Jane Austen	PERSON	's men , we have not the patience to read Mr.
Pontifex	PERSON	's record through .

		So , in the end , to explain
Butler	PERSON	's confidence in his immortality , and the importance his disciples seem to attach to him , we are driven back to the book which the world did in some measure accept .

		The central idea of '' Erewhon , '' that of a country where human nature runs on different lines than it does with us , is of course as old as literature .

		It appears in
Aristophanes	LOCATION	,
Lucian	PERSON	, the '' Arabian Nights , '' Sir
Thomas More	PERSON	,
Lord Bacon	ORGANIZATION	, Swift .


John Buncle	PERSON	, and many others , down to recent times when the theme has become almost as prolific in its varied inventions as that other but somewhat similar one of an imaginary European kingdom .

		The mould has always been the same , but it has been filled up with different material .

		Sometimes it has been purely idealistic , sometimes fantastic , sometimes satirical . ''

		Erewhon '' combines all three of these elements .

		We are inclined to think that its ideal - ism , its doctrine of the simple life and a return to nature , rather conflicts with its satire .

		The end of the book has forgotten its beginning .

		It will probably be granted that Swift 's ''
Gul	PERSON	- liver 's Travels '' is the central and best book in this type of literature .

		`` Erewhon , '' we should say , can fairly claim second place .

		Written fifty years ago , its satire is not only fresh and effective , but it deals with problems and ideas which are only now begin - ning to stir in the world 's mind .

		There is a curious mixture in the book of ironical satire on modern civilization and a suggested new philosophy of life .

		The Erewhonian notions about health and crime have not been put into practice by any society the world has known , though they may be in a meas - ure anticipatory of the Nietzschean programme .

		But
Butler	PERSON	's satire on our double standard of
Chris	PERSON	- tian and commercial morality , in his description of the '' Musical Banks '' ; his exposure of our higher education in the account of the Colleges of
Unrea	LOCATION	- son , with their '' hypothetical '' language ; his rev - elations about the mythological figures which the Erewhonians worshipped but did not believe in ; and his approving comment on
Goddess Ydgruri	PERSON	, whom we take to mean Good Sense or Good Form , all these inventions are deadly thrusts at civilization as it exists to-day .

		But the most important thing in the book is the
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 295 theory as to the danger of machinery .

		While
Butler	PERSON	was in
New Zealand	LOCATION	he wrote and published there an essay entitled ''
Darwin	PERSON	among the Ma - chines , '' and this became the germ of '' Erewhon . ''

		Briefly , the theory is that machines tend to become a super-race which will in time enslave and crush out the men who make them .

		The Erewhonians are convinced of this , and destroy all their up-to-date machinery .

		We think that Swift would have dem - onstrated the horror of these Frankenstein monsters in a more concrete way than
Butler	PERSON	has done ; but the latter is to be credited with foreseeing a long time ago a very real danger which threatens hu - manity .

		Machines may never acquire mind and volition , as he suggests they will , but without that they can come near to ruining humanity .

		On the whole , we must take leave of
Samuel Butler	PERSON	with assurances of distinguished respect .

		He was perhaps too much of a scientist to be a great philosopher , and too much of a dilettante to be a great scientist , but as a satirist he has hit the blot again and again .

		The grim irony with which the hero of u Erewhon '' is made to tell his project for capturing anl selling into slavery his kindly Erewhonian hosts , in order that they may be con - verted to Christianity , is worthy of Swift himself .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		GENIUS IN THE TREADMILL is always a pathetic spectacle , however beneficial it may ultimately prove to soaring genius to be forcibly held down to earth for a certain disciplinary period .

		In the letters -LRB- reviewed on another page -RRB- of him who , as Mr.
Gilder	PERSON	expressed it in his fine tribute to the poet , gave us `` the thrill of a brave new song '' and `` lovely thoughts and mighty thoughts and thoughts that linger long , '' we have frequent glimpses of the song - ster fretting at the necessity that holds him a bond - slave in the ``
Chicago	LOCATION	themery '' this , of course , re - fers to his instructorship in English at the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	when he longs to go `` galumphing o'er twin-peaked Parnassus . ''

		A few passages from the letters will fill in this picture of
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	beating , with not quite impotent hands , the bars of his prison cell .

		He did gain his freedom after some years of drudgery , but meanwhile he eased the tension by many a half-serious , half-humorous , and always amusingly extravagant outburst like the following : `` If my lines were cast in other places , even other places in this gigantic ink-blot of a town I could make shift to enjoy my breath .

		I should make a very happy and efficient peanut-vender on
Clark	PERSON	or
Randolph Street	ORGANIZATION	, because the rush and noise of the blood in the city 's pulse would continually solicit and engage me .

		The life of a motor-man is not without exhilarating and even romantic features , and an imaginative boot-black is lord of unskirted realms . ''

		Again , referring to some vacation hack - writing , he says : '' Promptly at 9 o'clock each morn - ing I put on blinders , stuff my ears with wax , and strap myself to the desk , in order to do my day 's stint on a text-book on English Literature -LRB- God save the mark ! -RRB-

		which I have to get a certain portion of done this month . ''

		A later letter shows the writer once more at his post . ''

		It has been the very devil to get down to work again , after my long and keenly - relished holiday .


Chicago	LOCATION	seemed uglier and grim - mer than I had believed possible .

		There was nothing to do but shut my eyes , put my sensibilities in the lower drawer , and sail in .

		Gradually the beneficent numbness of drudgery is stealing over me , and that tin illuminated dogged patience which constitutes my substitute for moral courage is beginning to possess what in other seasons I am wont to refer to exuber - antly as my soul . ''

		Moody was never lacking in `` sand '' -LRB- a favorite term of his -RRB- , and moreover he was supported by an underlying sense of the essential fairness of the fates in their dealings with him , as witness the following : ``
Chicago	LOCATION	is several kinds of hell , but I wo n't weary you with asseverations that I am being shamefully victimized by fate ; you wont believe it , and besides it 's a lie .

		I am merely paying the market rates for my bread and beer , commodities for which many a better man has been villainously overcharged . ''

		... LINGUISTIC VANDALISM works its ravages in every age and clime , asserts the sagely observant author of `` New Letters of an Idle Man '' -LRB- noticed more particularly in another column -RRB- .

		A paragraph from a letter of his written in
1885	DATE	is even more timely now than it was then .

		He writes : '' I was amazed by the extracts from your German friend 's letter ; and besides , they were interesting as showing how prone is the human mind in all countries to the same kind of idiocies in regard to spelling and that kind of thing , although at present there is doubtless less
Blodsinn	PERSON	on the whole in
Germany	LOCATION	than among us Americans , who in regard to the English language seem to me obstinately bent upon improving it the wrong way .

		Let us add what we will to the lan - guage , but let us not change it : for no good can come of change : nay , rather much harm : for do we not thus lose connection with the Past ?

		and all our magnificent Earlier Literature is swept into the limbo of Gibberish , the limbo I mean like unto that in which Chaucer doth languish .

		By all means take up this topic in your next Monthly Lecture .

		The topic is of ethical import .

		It connects itself with the sanctity of Inherited Good , and the vast moral blessing of having conscious root in the Past .

		It is only gorillas that devour their own offspring , only savages that pass away without leaving trace of their existence .

		Deepening and preserving race - consciousness , so to speak , is of ethical import .

		The more civilized is a race , the more it will keep in its consciousness the whole sweep of its Past .

		To pre - serve the language is to preserve this sweep of the Past .

		What good does it do to write scepter instead of sceptre ?

		go on in this way and a book two hun - dred years old is a strange thing to us ; keep on writing sceptre and we keep on being conscious of 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	possessing the whole Past of our Literature as an integral and familiar possession . ''

		That was uttered two decades before the bursting of the storm now venting its fury impotently , let us hope on our written speech .

		One can imagine how much more vehemently the writer would express himself on the same subject to-day .

		Two VIEWS OF
PLATO	LOCATION	, strikingly opposite , chanced to present themselves in two notable books that were recently taken up for recreation and re - freshment , and they well illustrate in how great a measure the subjective element enters into all ap - praisal of books and authors .

		In Professor
Oscar Kuhns	PERSON	's '' Story of my Intellectual Life '' -LRB- the sub - title and the more accurately descriptive title of his '' One-Sided Autobiography '' -RRB- , memorable among the books of the year , he says , in comparing
Emer	PERSON	- son and Plato : `` Similar to this feeling of intense delight which I have found in
Emerson	LOCATION	is my expe - rience with
Plato	PERSON	, only in a far deeper sense ; for the faults of
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	loose connection , staccato style , lack of philosophical system are absent from the Greek , whose dialogues are as marvellous in re - gard to form , wit , gentle humor , and dramatic and poetic power , as they are true , deep , far-reaching , and fraught , on every page , with a sense of the abid - ing and eternal . ''

		In contrast with the emphasis here laid upon
Plato	PERSON	's `` form , '' his freedom from `` loose connection '' and from `` lack of philosophical system , '' there must now be cited a passage from the second book referred to above , the elaborate `` Life and Letters of
Benjamin Jowett	PERSON	, '' by Dr.
Evelyn Abbott	PERSON	and Dr.
Lewis Campbell	PERSON	, in which it is said of Plato in
Jowett	PERSON	's translation that `` he was brought before us in his strength and his weak - ness : the poetry , the imagination , the elevation of thought shone out through the English ; and on the other hand the sophistry of argument , the uncertainty and indefiniteness of the conclusions , the contradic - tion of various points of view , were not less appar - ent . ''

		This is not quite so strong as Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's outspoken verdict , already quoted by us : `` I care for
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's metaphysics as little as I care for the rhapsodical gammon of Professor
Bergson	PERSON	or Miss
Marie Corelli	PERSON	'' ; but it certainly conveys a different impression of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's peculiar merits from that gained in reading Professor
Kuhns	PERSON	.

		Luckily , however , we can all go directly to Plato himself .

		LIBRARY LKSSONS FOR THE PUBLIC , but without entrance examination or graduation certificate , are among the possibilities of the future ; yes , even among the actualities of the present .

		In the '' Wis - consin Library Bulletin '' Miss
Maud van Buren	PERSON	describes certain new and promising '' publicity methods '' that are being tried in various places .

		For instance , ' interest in the new public library of
St. Louis	LOCATION	continues to such an extent , and RO many visitors desire to be shown through the building , that it has been decided to give special attention to visitors on one evening in every month .

		On that evening an effort is made to show the whole building to visitors , including parts of it that are not usually open to the public , such as the stock room , the cata - logue and work rooms , the bindery , etc. '' Then follow some suggestions . ''

		Why not , in the case of a new building , attracting many visitors , make these special evenings occasions for taking your public into your confidence ?

		The layman knows little of the ' inner workings ' of a library , and because of his ignorance he is likely to undervalue its importance and the work of the librarian .

		Here is an oppor - tunity to explain the various processes through which a book must go before the patron gets it .

		The arrangement of the books on the shelves , special collections , the use of the catalogue , the Reader 's guide , the clipping and picture collections , and other features not on the surface , might have attention called to them at this time . ''

		This throwing open of the penetralia and laying bare of the sacred mys - teries would have horrified all librarians a century ago and some librarians even a quarter-century ago ; but , as has already been remarked by someone else , tempora mutantur et nos mutamur in illis , THE FIRST ROLLO BOOK was not , as many might suppose , written by
Jacob Abbott	PERSON	; it was the product of
Xenophon	PERSON	's pen , and was called `` Cyrojiaedia . ''

		So we are informed by Mr.
Gamaliel Bradford , Jr.	PERSON	, who writes of the innocent cause of our schoolboy tears and groans over th ?

		`` Anabasis '' in an article entitled `` A Gentleman of
Athens	LOCATION	, '' which appears in the
October	DATE	`` Yale Review . ''

		Rollo was a royal person - age in the Greek initial number of the Rollo series .

		His name was
Cyrus	PERSON	, and he became King of
Persia	LOCATION	.

		He had some of the traits of the best
New England	LOCATION	ancestry , and he was always punctual to the second with his beautifully appropriate platitudes .

		Inured to the rigors of a rather meagrely-spread board at home , whenever he was sent on a visit to his opulent grandpa , the
King of Media	ORGANIZATION	, he was treated to goodies without stint by that indulgent old gentleman .

		But in true Rolloesque fashion Cyrus would remark : `` Grandpa , what a bother your meals must be , if you have to reach for all these dishes and taste so many kinds of drinks . ''

		`` What ! ''

		exclaims the aston - ished grandsire , `` do n't you find this much better than your food at home ? ''

		`` Oh , no , '' replies
Rollo	PERSON	; `` the road to repletion is much shorter and easier with us than with you .

		Bread and meat take us right where we wish to go , whereas , though you are going to the same place , you travel a long way about before you get there . ''

		What could a royal grandpa reply to this ?

		In such wise , or very nearly , does Mr.
Bradford	PERSON	introduce us to some pleasant aspects of him who has conducted so many unwilling youths in that wearisome march up from the sea .

		THE H ^ GER-BRONTE CORRESPONDENCE , OT the four recently unearthed and published letters from
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	* to her
Brussels	LOCATION	teacher , should not too hastily be taken to prove '' a consuming adoration '' -LRB- the
London	LOCATION	' Book Monthly 's '' words -RRB- on Miss
Bronte	PERSON	's part for Professor He `` ger .

		The
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 297 reported willingness of Monsieur He ` ger himself from the very first to encourage belief in such an infatuation has always disinclined the reflective to place any confidence in the absurd story ; and Mr.
Clement K. Snorter	PERSON	's ``
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	and Her Circle , '' with its authoritative account of the whole affair and its citations from
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	's own letters to reinforce his assertions , ought to have forever silenced the gossips who found pleasure in picturing in a compromising or at least undignified attitude the author of '' The Professor , '' the austere young woman who with her youngest sister rushed up to
London	LOCATION	on one memorable occasion to rescue her pen name and that of the other brothers '' Bell '' from the imputation of ever so slight a deception in the pursuit of their literary calling .

		Marion HaiLn I 's short and carefully - written book on Char - lotte
Bronte	PERSON	' in her
Haworth	PERSON	home gives in a few words , based on authoritative documents , all that one needs to know about the
Brussels	LOCATION	affair , and if anyone is shown in an unSecooring light it is cer - tainly not the English literary celebrity whom the Belgian schoolmaster was not averse to having ap - pear as subjugated by his invincible charms .

		So , at any rate , as the careful an 1 conciliatory
Franklin	PERSON	would say , it appears to us at present . ''

		THE THREE BEST FOODS FOR FANCY , '' Said Mr.
Walter R. Nursey	PERSON	, Inspect or of
Ontario Public Libra	ORGANIZATION	- ries , at the late ai nual convention of the
Ontario Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, ' - are the spoken story , the drama , and the novel .

		The sanest , the most whole - some , the most accessible of these is the novel .

		It is as cruel to deprive a growing boy or budding girl of an abundance of wholesome , enjoyable fic - tion as it is to debar them from butter on their bread .

		But remember that a child should be taught to think of the labor it has cost to produce a book .

		Never to turn down its leaves , never to place it upon the table face downward , and never to read with dirty or inky fingers . ''

		Then followed the obvious but always timely truth that `` you can not develop heroes and heroines on ` mush . '

		Many chil - dren 's books are too puerile in style and too limited inla nonage . ''

		The fairy tale received high praise , perhaps too high praise , from Mr.
Nursey	PERSON	, who quoted Dr.
Felix Adler	PERSON	's assertion that `` the fac - ulty of putting oneself in the place of others may be cultivated by means of fairy tale ?

		, '' and thus the child 's sympathies are `` aroused in a variety of forms . ''

		True enough , but let the young reader take heed lest he be of those '' Who , dabbling in the fount of fictive tears , And nursed by mealy-mouth 'd philanthropies , Divorce the Feeling from her mate the Deed . ''

		JUVENILIZED SCIENCE , or the simple and attrac - tive treatment of more or less difficult subjects for the entertainment and , indirectly , the instruction of children , is something far more common in the book world to day than it was a hundred , or fifty , or even ten years ago . ''

		Wireless Telegraphy for Amateurs and Students '' will engage the willing attention of almost any wide-awake boy ; `` The Child 's Day '' succeeds even in presenting the subject of hygiene in a manner not repulsive to children ; and '' Lessons for Junior Citizens '' teaches the principles of civil government so that , though babes may not cry for the book , it need not draw tears from the young people who are required to read it .

		These three out of many such books are mentioned by Miss
Elizabeth McCracken	PERSON	in her late work on `` The American Child , '' in which she says , not without a little exag - geration : '' It is safe to say that there is practically no subject so mature that it is not now the theme of a book , or a score of books , written especially for children .

		Every one of the numerous publishing houses in the
United States	LOCATION	issues yearly as many good volumes of this particular type as are submitted .

		A century ago a new writer was most likely to win the interest of a publisher by sending him a manu - script subtitled , ' A Novel . '

		At the present time a beginner can more quickly awaken the interest of a publisher by submitting a manuscript the title of which contains the words , ` For Children . ' ''

		DEAFNESS TO THE CALL OF ITALIAN CFLTURE is charged against the extra-Italian world by Mr.
Douglas Ainslie	PERSON	in his '' Introduction to
Croce	PERSON	's Philosophy of the Practical , '' contributed to the
October	DATE	`` North American Review . ''

		It may be well to ponder seriously , or as seriously as it de - serves , his plaint that `` the Alps continue to be a barrier , and the thought of
France	LOCATION	and of
Germany	LOCATION	reaches us , as a rule , far more rapidly than that of the home of all the arts and of civilizatn n , as we may call that
Italy	LOCATION	which contains within it the classical
Greater Greece	LOCATION	.

		A striking instance of this relatively more rapid distribution of French thought is afforded by the celebrated Lundis of Sainte-Beuve , so familiar to many readers ; yet a critic greater in depth than Sainte-Beuve was writ - ing at the same period greater in philosophical vision of the relations of things , for the vision of Sainte-Beuve rarely rose above the psychological plf * n a .

		For one reader acquainted with the History of Italian Literature of de Sanctis , a hundred are familiar with the Lundis of Sainte-Beuve . ''

		Never - theless , Mr.
Ainslie	PERSON	finds that since the publication of his translation from the Italian philosopher named above `` there has been some movement in the direction of the study of Italian thought and culture , which I advocated in the Introduction to that work . ''

		With the continuation of his scholarly undertaking , still in progress , there may be a still further turning of errant footsteps toward the home of all the arts .

		... THE LITERATURE OF SPECIAL LIBRARIES , that is , the books and pamphlets arid there are likely to he more pamphlets than books on the library shelves , is not always or often what some readers would call literature at all .

		It is certainly not belles lettres .

		Nevertheless , in looking over the current number of 298 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	the periodical , `` Special Libraries , '' one meets with a few book-titles not devoid of interest even to lovers of literature not so rigidly special as that commonly handled by the special librarian .

		In the library of the
Prudential Insurance Company	ORGANIZATION	, for instance , a library containing more than 150,000 volumes and pamphlets , the statistician of the company selects certain rare works for mention , the most ancient of which is the Latin treatise of
1622	DATE	, '' De Mercatura : Decisiones et Tractatus Varii , et de Rebus ad Earn Pertinentibus . ''

		Another venerable tome is the ''
Lex Mercatoria Rediviva	PERSON	, '' by
Wyndham Beawes	PERSON	, pub - lished in
London	LOCATION	,
1752	DATE	.

		One year earlier in date is
Malachy Postlethwayt	PERSON	's '' Dictionary of Trade and
Commerce	ORGANIZATION	, '' and sufficiently ancient is
John Wesk	PERSON	- ett 's `` Complete Digest of the Theory of Insurance , ''
London	LOCATION	,
1781	DATE	.

		Among early American books on insurance , the shelves of the
Prudential Company	ORGANIZATION	hold `` An Account of Charitable Corporations for the Relief of Widows and Children , ''
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
1769	DATE	, and the exceedingly rare `` Plan of a Society for Making Provision for Widows by Annuities for the Remainder of Life , ''
Boston	LOCATION	,
1772	DATE	.

		Even to such a strictly commercial theme as insurance the long , descriptive , sometimes quaint titles of eighteenth century treatises on that subject impart an interest not to be found in the curt names chosen for the publications of to-day .

		FUTILE LITERARY INDUSTRY has been engaged in , the more 's the pity , by thousands of penmen since the invention of writing .

		A visit to the British Museum reading-room , with its concentric circles of desks all filled with busy persons engaged , in most instances , in writing or in the studies preliminary to writing , must prompt the query , How much of all this flow of ink is shed to any good purpose or with any lasting result ?

		In a recently - printed `` Short History of the Library Company of
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia , '' by Mr.
George Maurice Abbot	PERSON	, librarian , are to be found some personal reminiscences of the writer 's long connection with the famous old institu - tion founded by
Franklin	PERSON	and his fellow-members of the `` Junto . ''

		Among these recollections occurs the following : `` Queer people from time to time have made a practice of coming to the Library ... One was known as the old Swede ; he came every day for years , kept pen and ink in the
John Dickin	PERSON	- son reading desk , and appeared to be taking notes , all day busily writing , but , strange to say , rarely asking for a book .

		Finally he came no more , and in the
Dickinson	PERSON	desk was found only an old pen , some dried ink , and a roll of manuscript meaning nothing . ''

		Who knows but that , like Mr.
Casaubon	PERSON	in `` Middlemarch , '' he fully believed himself to be preparing an epoch-making contribution to human knowledge ?

		AN EMPEROR 'S BOOKS may distinguish themselves from other books by means of elaborate bindings and an imperial book-plate ; otherwise they are likely to be not so very different from the books in any well-appointed library .

		Those who attend the great book-trade exhibition at
Leipzig	LOCATION	next year will have the pleasure of viewing the library of the reigning German Emperor , a collection of about six thousand volumes , two-thirds of which have been acquired by their owner in the quarter-century since his acces - sion .

		It is not a large library for a monarch , or even for a wealthy private individual , and it is con - siderably smaller than it would be but for the
Kaiser	PERSON	's characteristic discard of about half the thirty-five hundred volumes handed down to him by his
Hohen	PERSON	- zollern predecessors .

		After eliminating what seemed to him to be mere rubbish he made from time to time additions to the extent of four thousand or more works , and the enlarged and modernized collection is now catalogued under twelve general subject - headings , encyclopaedias and dictionaries , juris - prudence , economics and social science , colonial literature , archaeology and mythology , universal history , history of the Hohenzollerns , biography and correspondence , military science , geography and ethnography , German literature , and art works .

		The book plate to be found in each volume was , of course , '' made in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' being designed by the artist
Herr Ernst Doeppler	PERSON	, and shows the imperial arms with the inscription , `` Ex libris

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		ALPHONSO
GERALD	PERSON	NEWCOMER .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		You will perhaps not find it amiss to give place for a few words regarding the late Professor A. G Newcomer in addition to the note in your issue of
October 1	DATE	.

		It was my good fortune to be a colleague of Mr.
New	PERSON	- comer 's for ten years , and during a good part of that period to share the same office with him .

		Never was there a man more truly a colleague , as there was never one more truly a teacher .

		And never has there come into my experience his equal for the meekness and modesty which adorn scholarship but which are none too commonly noticed in philologist , critic , or pedagogue .

		His first letter to me , written before we had met , when I was about to join his department as a comparatively inexperienced teacher , was an offer to turn over to me a certain course in a subject with which he knew I had been concerned , graciously offering as reason , not the obvious fact that it was one of the few things I was competent to teach , but the belief that he had not yet found the right way to handle that difficult theme .

		Years later , I remember , when we were one day discuss - ing the impatience of the younger men over the slow - ness with which promotions were coming , Mr.
Newcomer	PERSON	remarked that in earlier days they had been won more easily , adding : `` I have often thought how little I de - served mine . ''

		In twenty years of academic life I have never heard this sentiment uttered sincerely by any other colleague .

		The same modesty of temper preserved in him that open-mindedness of outlook which keeps criticism sweet and makes possible continued acquisition and growth at an age when many scholars have ceased to do aught but reiterate and defend what they discovered when young .

		This temper may be exemplified by a characteristic
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 299 passage from a private letter written by Mr.
Newcomer	PERSON	at a time when we were both doing some work on Shake - speare 's sonnets a subject where it is almost a matter of course to revile one 's predecessors in the field . ''

		I am now engaged in reading
Massey	ORGANIZATION	's work a stupendous volume ; a little diffuse , but so earnest and interesting I can not skim .

		And though I believe
Massey	PERSON	is quite discredited now , his theory is a most engaging one .

		At any rate I think I shall be repaid for perusing him , for his analysis is so exhaustive that I shall at least get a good baptism in this apparently soundless ocean .

		At present , you can imagine , my eyes are full of water and sand , and I am gasping for breath .

		I find temporary comfort in turning to
Wyndham	LOCATION	, and repeating , after him , that after all the poetry is the main thing , the story a minor matter .

		And yet , all those circumstantial de - tails must have a story behind them . ''

		The past year was Mr.
Newcomer	PERSON	's sabbatical , and he spent the greater part of his absence in the
Mediter	LOCATION	- ranean countries .

		His health failed so early that he was unable to carry out a good part of the externals of his programme , and when I saw him after his return it was natural to commiserate him on the spoiling of his long-looked-for journey .

		But he assured me , with his always unfailing cheerfulness , that there had been no disappointment ; true , he could not go about as he had hoped , or even enjoy the expected intercourse with friends , but
Italy	LOCATION	had accomplished its old ministry for his inner life , it had been a rich experience .

		`` I should have wished to do no differently , '' he said , '' if I could have foreseen everything .

		I am wholly content with the journey , and wholly content that it is done , and that I can live with the memory , at home . ''

		There , in his
California	LOCATION	home , under his rose-vines , it was my privilege to say good-bye to him only a few days , as it proved , before the end .

		He had been reading a volume of
Maeterlinck	PERSON	's tragedies when I came in , and showed it to me with his eager smile .

		Not just the book , I remarked , which some of us would choose as a source of good cheer in invalidism . ''

		Perhaps not , '' he said , '' but how beautiful ! ''

		This gust of what is beautiful coupled always , to be sure , with discernment and restraint made him both the teacher and the critic that he was .

		He fulfilled , in other words , the wise saying which he once contributed to a discussion of the teaching of English -LRB- `` The Nation , '' vol .

		85 , p. 301 -RRB- : '' As for the inner spirit of literature , which we have so long hungered and striven to teach , may it not be largely trusted to find its way ?

		The teacher who really feels it will never be able to conceal his feeling .

		The radiation that reaches him will be radiated in turn , the communicable communicated to so many as are ready to share in that grace . ''

		What aspirations and industry under many difficulties !

		With these feelings I have written the little tribute to his memory which follows .

		Comrade and friend , what way is yours , What heights in heaven do you climb , Now that the immanent flesh immures No more your steps in space and time ?

		INDIAN CENSORSHIP .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Some of Mr.
Wilfrid Blunt	PERSON	's books about
Egypt	LOCATION	were recently ordered from the
London	LOCATION	publisher , Mr.
Fisher Unwin	PERSON	, by a bookselling firm in
Lahore	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	.

		The parcel containing them was opened , Mr.
Blunt	PERSON	's books were abstracted , and , after several months , returned mutilated to the shipper , in an unsaleable con - dition , certain passages having been officially marked as '' objectionable . ''

		Concerning the circumstance , Mr.
Blunt	PERSON	writes as follows to ' -
India	LOCATION	'' : '' It is a good example of the queer shifts to which a despotic
Government	ORGANIZATION	is put which pretends not to be despotic yet governs by despotic methods .

		In
Russia	LOCATION	a book censorship is openly and directly exercised at the frontiers , and we , in
England	LOCATION	, call it an abuse of power when our books and periodicals are returned to us with passages officially deleted .

		In
India	LOCATION	the same thing is done , but the
Government	ORGANIZATION	, by a trick , evades its responsibility .

		My books , it appears now , are not prohibited ' in
India	LOCATION	; only prevented from entering the country in a saleable condition .

		I would remark that the volumes in question are no new publications , but have been many years issued and gone through several editions ; they contain almost nothing about

		A POET ix EPISTOLARY MOOD .

		* Instead of wasting words in a vain attempt to describe the rare flavor of '' Some Letters of
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	, '' which the poet 's in - timate friend and cordial admirer , Mr.
Daniel Gregory Mason	PERSON	, has so acceptably edited , the best plan will be to give the reader some liberal tastes of the volume here and there , and then trust to his running hotfoot in quest of the complete book in order to appease the hunger to which the foretastes will have but imparted a keener edge .

		The feast will leave him with only one regret , that it could not have been pro- longed ; but he will endeavor to console himself by recalling the good old maxim , that it is better to rise from table with an appetite than with a sense of surfeit .

		The letters extend over the last seventeen years of the poet 's too-short life , beginning in
1892	DATE	, when he was twenty-three years old , and ending in
1909	DATE	, when he had just entered upon his forty-first year .

		First we see him fretting , good-humoredly , in the bondage of tutorship and lectureship at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and
Chicago	LOCATION	, where he corrected themes , discoursed on the beauties of English poetry , and counted the days till he could throw aside blue pencil and lecture notes and woo the muse in some congenial retreat , in
Italy	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, or elsewhere .

		In course of time , and as his efforts in poetry and the drama gained recognition , he worked himself free of the hated thraldom ; but even while
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	wore the har - ness and the galls were still raw , he evidently found a sort of Carlylean relish in the very extravagance of those picturesquely emphatic epithets with which he knew so well how to depict his spiritual sufferings .

		For instance , he writes to Professor
Robert Morss Lovett	PERSON	, his college mate and close friend , in this wise from
Cambridge	LOCATION	, where he was teaching English composition : '' The midyears -LSB- examinations -RSB- have left me limp as a rag , and have convinced me that , instead of an amiable divorce such as you suggest , Philology and
Minerva	PERSON	are destined to part with mutual scorn and vituperation , if indeed their feud does not result in pistols and pillow - chokings .

		If you want to rescue either of them you must come on in
March	DATE	as you promise , for I will not answer for their lives a day later than the twentieth . ''

		But when
Cambridge	LOCATION	had been exchanged for
Chicago	LOCATION	, the venerable elms and time-stained * SOME LETTERS OF

Houghton M i HI in Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		buildings of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	for the raw newness of the great western university , there was eloquent re - gret , a sorrow 's crown of sorrow , in his vivid remembrance of happier things .

		To Mrs.
Marks	PERSON	, who was then Miss
Josephine Preston Peabody	PERSON	, he writes from the city by the lake : ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	mellow and autumnal begins already to take on really mythic colors to loom symbolic , under the stress of this relentless prairie light and vast featureless horizon ... I do not know what this place is going to do for me , but I am sure of its potency its alchemical power to change and transmute .

		It is ap - pallingly ugly for one thing so ugly that the double curtain of
night	TIME	and sleep does not screen the aching sense .

		For another thing it is absorbing crude juice of life intellectual and social protoplasm Far aloft hovers phantom Poetry , no longer my delicate familiar .

		But I dream of another coming of hers , a new com - panionship more valorous and simple-hearted . ''

		A little later we read of at least a brief visi - tation , in which the poem that later became '' Jetsam '' was conceived . ''

		Which reminds me , '' he says , a propos of nothing , in a letter to Mr.
Mason	PERSON	, `` that , having a few hours
last week	DATE	for ecstatic contemplation of my navel , I emitted a more or less piercing yawp there - concerning , in the form of a new treatment of the moon theme . ''

		Not only lecturing and theme-correcting , but also hack-work for pub - lishers took the time he would fain have devoted wholly to original composition .

		Also , at times , the charms of some fair one seem to have dis - quieted him .

		In the following passage the `` Uncle Horace '' referred to is the late Mr.
Scudder	PERSON	, for whom
Moody	ORGANIZATION	was doing some edi - torial work as a pot-boiler : '' I have been brutally busy since getting back , on Uncle
Horace	PERSON	's book , so that all my schemes of spirit - ual conquest are done up in moth-balls for the time being ... One o'clock midnight , and the morrow flames responsibility .

		Hire a typewriter marry one if necessary and we will annihilate space .

		I have a creature to tell you about but a Creature ! ''

		Six months later , to the same trusted friend , Mr.
Mason	PERSON	, he writes again in similar strain , this time giving in prose form the substance , or rather the airy unsubstantiality , with much of the imagery , that later became '' Dawn Parley , '' a poetic rhapsody rejected for some unknown reason when he came to make up the `` Poems '' of
1901	DATE	.

		Mrs.
Moody	PERSON	says he felt that `` The Golden Journey '' made it superfluous , as we learn from a note of Mr.
Mason	PERSON	's .

		Here is the semi-humorous , semi-sentimental prose version : '' I have had an enormous little adventure since I wrote last .

		Another Girl , of course .

		This time a Westerner par excellence a
Calif	LOCATION	ornian , dating men - tally from the age of
Rousseau	PERSON	and Chateaubriand , with geysers and cloud bursts of romanticism , not to say

		She likes
Gib	ORGANIZATION	- son 's drawings , adores
Munsey	PERSON	's , and sings ' Do n't be Cross , Dear ' with awful unction .

		After this you will not believe me when I say that she gave me the most unbearable shiver of rapture at recognition of essential girlhood that I for a long time remember .

		Well , have you ever slept under the same roof with sucli a person , in the country , and wakened at that moment before dawn when in the ' spectral uncompounded light ' the spirit is least capable of defense , when it feels only a membrane separating it from the shock of joy and woe as they stream from the passionate dayspring , and have you felt the sense of that common shelter like a caress , heard through walls and doors the rise and fall of her breast as an ineffable rhythm swaying the sun ?

		If you have you can realize the gone feeling that possessed me when she said -LRB- interpreting my own gloomy guess -RRB- that my kind was not her kind , that my language was not her language , and that her soul could only be stu - dious to avoid mine , as the bird flying southward in
spring	DATE	avoids the hunter .

		I bowed assent and came home .

		I now nurse memories and grow elegiac . ''

		Less than a month afterward he writes again to the same correspondent , enclosing what he calls `` a reaction on a recent notable Experience . ''

		To complete this little story of a poem in the making , let us reproduce the verses , especially as they are omitted from the familiar collection of his works .

		The title , as already stated , is `` Dawn Parley . '' ''

		I woke upon the edge of day , The east was wild with racing light , All meek and wild my spirit lay Star-shaken with delight . ''

		I said , ' This moment she doth wake Within the chamber next but one , She sees the morning-glory shake Its trumpets to the sun . '

		* A bird that had his headstrong say Outside my casement , frilled and went ; All wild and wan my spirit lay With sudden anguish rent . ''

		For yesternight I laid my brain And all my soul 's dim banded powers Open to her , who said , ' ' T is plain Thy ways are none of ours . '' '

		Though nobly good to thine and thee , To us thy ways are strange and drear ; I go with my sweet friends to be , And thou must tarry here . ' ''

		Above the hurry of the light All meek and wild my spirit hung , From the far hills I scared the night And in the zenith sung , '' < O !

		playmates of her heedless hours , Her eyes ye never more may see : My brain and all my soul 's dim powers Possess her utterly . ' ''

		So bold and dexterous an artist in words as
Moody	ORGANIZATION	one will not meet again in many months .

		There is notable pruning of extravagances as years sober the mind , but to the very end he was panting to achieve fresh triumphs in the manner of handling his medium .

		He says to one of his friendly critics : '' I think you are not tolerant enough of the instinct for conquest in language , the attempt to push out its boundaries , to win for it continually some new swiftness , some rare compression , to distil from it a more opaline drop . ''

		Mr.
Mason	PERSON	's Introduction , written in loyal affection and admiration for his friend , forms an important part of the volume , and has no little of the glow and shimmer of the pages that follow .

		In speaking of
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's endless pains with the manuscript of his poems , his corrections upon corrections , layers deep , Mr.
Mason	PERSON	likens his much-emended lines to '' the pediments of ruined temples , with columns of words rising at irregular intervals to unequal heights '' exciting a nat - ural query in the reader whether pediment is not here inadvertently made to do duty for pedestal or some similar word .

		On the whole , it is a satisfaction , a delight even , to have this volume of
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's informal prose , as an object lesson in the making of a poet and a commentary on some of his poems .

		Its high-hearted , vigorous , always finely imaginative style can not but make young readers rejoice in their youth , and older ones feel their thinner blood pulsing a little more quickly in their veins .

		Two portraits of
Moody	ORGANIZATION	in his early manhood , with a facsimile page of his manuscript , enrich the volume .

		THE PIVOTAL , PERIOD OF THE CIVIL , WAR .

		* The task of continuing the late
John C. Ropes	PERSON	's admirable work on the Civil War , two volumes of which had appeared at the time of the author 's death in
1899	DATE	, was assigned to Colonel
William Koscoe Livermore	PERSON	; and the first instalment of the continuation has re - cently been published in two volumes , covering the campaigns of

		302 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	books on the art and science of war .

		There is every evidence that his work is as careful and painstaking in method , as full and unbiased in treatment , as the most exacting critic might require .

		The official records of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and Confederate armies have been studied and di - gested with all diligence ; and , as far as the present reviewer can judge , every other trust - worthy source of importance has been consulted and properly evaluated .

		It may be said at once that
Colonel Livermore	PERSON	has shown himself worthy to continue the work of
Colonel Ropes	ORGANIZATION	, whose untimely death left his task but well begun .

		The author 's point of view , as stated in the Introduction , is frankly warlike .

		He says : '' In the struggle for existence , great nations are crowding upon each other .

		Universal peace will not be possible until conflicting interests shall have been ad - justed All nations but our own are preparing for defense .

		By neglecting to bear our share of the burden , we are insulting the rest of the civilized world upon whom we now rely for our safety in the hope that each nation will hold the other in check , and save us from all trouble and expense ... The history of the Civil War is useful in keeping alive the military inter - est of the present generation so that the next may have some civil history to record . ''

		On this reasoning one should regret the extra - ordinary `` peace developments '' of the last few months ; for if all the nations should continue their arbitration agreements and expand the operations of the Hague tribunal , it would seem that the `` necessary wars '' may not come , and in that case succeeding generations will have no civil history to record .

		It is an interesting result of military thinking in the
United States	LOCATION	that the Civil War should now be regarded as a thing for which thanks should be rendered , since it has been the means of keeping alive the warlike passions , or at any rate a pride in successful conflict .

		In volume one of this second part of the general work of Ropes and
Livermore	PERSON	there is a careful analysis of the positions of the con - tending forces in the Civil War .

		The import - ance to both sides of
Vicksburg	LOCATION	,
Chattanooga	LOCATION	, and
Richmond	LOCATION	is clearly shown .

		The difficul - ties of the tasks of the contending generals are made more evident than in previous works .

		As to the numbers of men engaged , there is no disposition to under-estimate the Federals and over-estimate the Confederates , a weakness of most writers on the war .

		Colonel Livermore places the
Union	ORGANIZATION	strength on
January 1 , 1863	DATE	, at 547,100 men , the Confederate at 272,100 .

		That is to say , the armies of Grant ,
Rosen	PERSON	- cranz , and
Hooker	PERSON	were more than twice as strong in human material as those of
Pember	PERSON	- ton ,
Bragg	LOCATION	, and Lee .

		This is almost conceding the contention of the South that it was out - numbered `` three to one . ''

		English military critics , like
Henderson	PERSON	and Wood and
Edmonds	PERSON	, in their admirable studies of the war , have made similar estimates .

		It is clear to all that the long-standing quarrel between
North and South	ORGANIZATION	as to numbers of men engaged is about to terminate with judgment in favor of the South - ern claims .

		Of the commanders and their personal quali - fications ,
Colonel Livermore	ORGANIZATION	says less than might be wished ; but it must be recalled that Ropes has already given us many character sketches of the leading generals , though he wrote with less sympathy for the Southerners than the present author would have shown .

		Lee receives some attention , and his place of primacy among all the generals of the war is acknowledged , he is characterized as '' the greatest captain of his age . ''

		General Grant is not so highly praised , though his work at
Vicksburg	LOCATION	is compared to that of Napoleon at Ulm .

		It should be said , however , that this comparison is quoted from
Halleck	PERSON	, and is not offered as the author 's opinion .


Pemberton	PERSON	had no conception of the problem which it was his business to solve at
Vicksburg	LOCATION	; nor does
Joseph E. Johnston	PERSON	win from
Colonel Livermore	PERSON	any of the high praise which
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	awarded him after the war was over .

		The battle of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	receives the most detailed study and analysis , about one-fifth of the work being given to the account of that sanguinary conflict .

		The claim is made and ably supported that
Meade	PERSON	in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and not Grant at
Vicksburg	LOCATION	, secured the life of the American nation , because Lee `` bore the fortunes of the Confederacy on his saddle bow , '' and he who struck at Lee and his army struck at the true objective .

		The number of men who took part in the battle are again given according to the disputed Confederate estimates , that is ,
Meade	PERSON	had 96,000 and Lee only 76,000 .

		These figures are not very different from those cited by Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	, the general historian of the war .

		The question of who was to blame for the Con - federate disaster on the third day of the battle is no nearer a settlement in
Colonel Livermore	ORGANIZATION	's pages than it has been before .

		The Englishmen , Wood and
Edmonds	PERSON	, in their brief but admirable work , say bluntly that Longstreet must bear the blame ; and they go so far as to criticize Lee because he failed to order a court martial .

		This is the view of most Southern writers , though
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 303 Lee never gave an opinion on the subject , either in his report of the battle or , as far as the present reviewer has been able to ascertain , in his later conversations or private correspondence .

		In fact , the great Confederate general assumed re - sponsibility for all the errors of that fatal day ; and in view of the unparalleled boldness of some of his orders this seems not unjust , as
Colonel Livermore	ORGANIZATION	makes plain .

		In this , the keen and discerning Southern general ,
E. P. Alexander	PERSON	, chief of artillery of the Confederate army , sus - tains the author ; and most Northern writers are of the same opinion .


Gettysburg	LOCATION	was the gigantic blunder of a great soldier .

		The reason is plain .

		Lee had beaten
McClellan	PERSON	, Pope ,
Burnside	PERSON	, and
Hooker	PERSON	in quick succession ; he thought himself invincible and his army thought itself invincible , and both army and commander stood ready for any hazardous task .

		The Southern people also spurred their greatest war machine onward , seeking battle on Northern soil and expecting victory .

		The outcome is known to everyone : the Confederacy there be - gan its downward career .

		Meade 's failure to attack Lee on the
4th of July	DATE	is explained by
Colonel Livermore	PERSON	much to the credit of the sturdy Northern leader .

		He knew the risk , and dreaded the effect on
Northern	ORGANIZATION	opinion of a possible defeat .

		He and his officers were so accustomed to defeat that they thought it best to maintain the prestige won by the three-days ' fighting , and endeavor thus to reinspire the Northern people , who had grown sick of disaster .

		This is the reasoning which
Colonel Livermore	ORGANIZATION	thinks occupied the mind of
Meade	ORGANIZATION	.

		Other writers have made out the same case for the hero of
Gettysburg	LOCATION	, and possibly this is the correct view .

		But it admits the interpretation that the head of a victorious army , a third stronger than the defeated foe , was afraid of Lee ; that victory had not been expected , and that the risk of a second encounter was too great to take .

		It shows the prestige of the Southern commander , and tends to prove that the war was not so near its end as is claimed by the very men who justify
Meade	PERSON	.

		In war much depends upon a single throw of the dice , and it was altogether likely that the army of
Northern Virginia	LOCATION	would yet regain its high position and win the coveted Southern indepen - dence .

		There are many interesting questions raised in these pages which one would like to discuss at length , did space permit .

		It only remains to say that all who desire a fair and straightforward account of the military movements of
1863	DATE	need but turn to these volumes .

		And all who know the earlier work of
Colonel Ropes	ORGANIZATION	will rejoice that the same spirit and the same keen intelli - gence which distinguished the author of the first part of the work also pervade the pages of

		JANE
AUSTEN	PERSON	'S HOME
Jane Austen	PERSON	is in the foreground again .

		As a matter of fact , `` poor little
Jane	PERSON	, '' as some unfriendly critics have gratuitously called her , has never been very far in the background at any time during the past thirty or forty years .

		Since the publication in
1870	DATE	of the Memoir by her nephew ,
J. E. Austen-Leigh	PERSON	, no less than eight biographies of the novelist have appeared , to say nothing of introductions , sketches , criti - cisms , and appreciations , which it might be diffi - cult to count .

		It may be of interest to add that at least ten important editions of the novels have been published since
1880	DATE	.

		Now we have a fresh narrative of
Jane Austen	PERSON	's life , a `` Family Record '' as its authors describe it , by the son and the grandson of the author of the Memoir .

		It is a volume of four hundred pages , with a charming portrait and with an appendix which contains variant readings and corrections of the text of the novels , also a partial bibli - ography .

		The publication of this work is justified by its authors on the ground that the earlier nar - rative failed to take account of
Jane Austen	PERSON	's life on its emotional and romantic side ; more - over , as they claim , its author `` hardly knew how much she had gone into society , or how much , with a certain characteristic aloofness , she had enjoyed it '' ; and , thirdly , the uneventful nature of the author 's life they think has been exaggerated .

		These are interesting points cer - tainly , and thoroughly important ; for tradition has imaged
Jane Austen	PERSON	as unromantic and unemotional , shut in by the narrow environment of a small and isolated Hampshire village , lead - ing a secluded life , with few social opportunities , shy , ignorant of the world and indifferent to its great events .

		The early home of
Jane Austen	PERSON	at
Steventon	LOCATION	does naturally suggest retirement if not isolation .

		It is in a shallow valley among low-lying hills ; the rectory , elm-shaded , is at the end of a row of cottages ; the church , small and solitary but *

		304 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	interesting because of its age -LRB- it dates from the tenth or eleventh century -RRB- , stands beyond the village ; aged hawthorns blossom in the church - yard , and a lone yew , as ancient as the church , droops above the graves .

		This was
Jane Aus	PERSON	- ten 's home for five and twenty years ; here she planned and wrote `` Northanger Abbey '' and the sketches , later revised and amplified in u Sense and Sensibility '' and `` Pride and Prejudice . ''

		We think instinctively of that other rectory at
Haworth	LOCATION	where the
Brontes	LOCATION	, a generation later , lived their precocious childhood ; but the atmos - phere of the
Yorkshire	LOCATION	moors was different from that of the Hampshire downs , and there was nothing abnormal in the life at
Steventon	LOCATION	rec - tory .

		Rev.
George Austen	PERSON	was a man of placid disposition , serenely tempered ; Mrs.
Austen	PERSON	was positive , shrewd , determined .

		From her mother ,
Jane	PERSON	inherited her acute insight into character , her energy and her sense of humor ; her refinement of intellect , her appreciation of literary achievement , and her serenity came from her father .

		There were eight children in the home , of whom
Jane	PERSON	was the seventh ; her oldest brother was ten years her senior , and
Cassandra	PERSON	, her only sister , was two years older than herself .

		Thus closely drawn together by their ages , the two sisters were inseparable until death parted them , each regarding the other as her second self .

		It was a pleasant country home , with a touch of the farm in its activities .

		The Rector kept his horses , and Mrs.
Austen	PERSON	supervised a dairy and a poultry yard .

		The boys were en - thusiastic lovers of sport ; two of them afterward entered the navy and each attained the rank of admiral .

		While the girls were still young the older brothers had completed their course at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and were at home assisting in the edu - cation of the sisters .

		Jane was given a taste of boarding-school life between the ages of seven and nine , but she appears rather to have accom - panied Cassandra because she could not endure the separation from her sister than for any more serious purpose .

		It was always a reading house - hold , and reference is frequent in the memoir to the books and authors of the day .

		The children were fond of amateur theatricals , and acted plays with elaborate preparation , using the barn as a theatre in
summer	DATE	, the dining-room in winter .

		Socially , the Austens were the most import - ant family in the village ; they enjoyed the best society in the countryside , and exercised a liberal hospitality in the entertainment of friends and relatives .

		Their circle of acquaintances was large , and life was far from dull .

		As
Cassandra	PERSON	and
Jane	PERSON	grew older they found apparently no lack of amusement such as naturally appeals to young people , in the way of parties , balls , and the regular monthly assembly held at
Ba	ORGANIZATION	sing - stoke .

		Under date of
January 9 , 1796	DATE	,
Jane	PERSON	writes to her sister , in a characteristically lively strain : `` You scold me so much in the nice long letter which I have this moment received from you , that I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved .

		Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down to - gether .

		I can expose myself , however , only once more , because he leaves the country soon after next
Friday	DATE	, on which day we are to have a dance at
Ashe	ORGANIZATION	after all .

		He is a very gentlemanlike , good-looking , pleasant young man , I assure you .

		But as to our having ever met , except at the three last balls , I can not say much ; for he is so excessively laughed at about me at
Ashe	LOCATION	, that he is ashamed of coming to
Steventon	LOCATION	, and ran away when we called on Mrs.
Lefroy	PERSON	a few days ago . ''

		The youth referred to ,
Tom Lefroy	PERSON	, was the nephew of a dear friend of the Austens , the wife of the rector in the neighboring parish of
Ashe	LOCATION	.

		This '' very gentlemanlike , good-looking , pleasant young man '' was afterward Chief Jus - tice of
Ireland	LOCATION	; he was not the hero of
Jane Austen	PERSON	's one actual romance .

		It will be readily seen that
Jane Austen	PERSON	's girlhood was by no means solitary , nor was it quite untouched by the stimulus of outside events .

		Two years previous to the date of the letter quoted here , the quiet life of the rectory was disturbed by an incident which must have brought the grim tragedy of the French Revo - lution very forcibly to the imagination of this impressionable girl , then eighteen .

		A cousin of the Austens had married a French nobleman who , in
1794	DATE	, was guillotined at
Paris	LOCATION	.

		His wife , the countess , had been intimately asso - ciated with the family at
Steventon	LOCATION	, had visited them shortly before her husband 's arrest , and may possibly have been at
Steventon	LOCATION	when the execution took place .

		Moreover , we must not think of the experi - ences even of these earlier years as limited by the narrow boundaries of a country village .

		Jane had had her first glimpse of
London	LOCATION	at twelve years of age .

		There were numerous con - nections of the family with whom visits were constantly being exchanged .

		One of the elder brothers settled in
London	LOCATION	, another inherited an extensive estate in Kent .

		Cassandra and
Jane	PERSON	were often in these homes , sometimes to - gether , sometimes singly , and a varied society was thus opened to them .

		The popular and lively resort of Bath was distant but two days ' easy travel by post chaise .

		A brother of Mrs.
Austen	PERSON	, a gentleman of ample means and ad -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 305 dieted to gout , was frequently at Bath , and it was a common occurrence for
Jane	PERSON	and
Cas	ORGANIZATION	- sandra to be entertained by their uncle and aunt .

		That Miss
Austen	PERSON	made effective use of what she observed in the society of this lively resort is evident to her readers .

		In
1801	DATE	, on account of the Rector 's failing health , the home at
Steventon	LOCATION	was broken up and the entire family removed to Bath , residing there until after Mr.
Austen	PERSON	's death in
1805	DATE	.

		It was prob - ably about the period of this change in their affairs that the one serious romantic episode occurred in the life of the novelist .

		The facts are obscure ; the circumstances , even the name of
Jane	PERSON	's lover , are unknown .

		The meeting apparently took place one
summer	DATE	when
Jane	PERSON	and
Cassandra	PERSON	were at the seashore ; the gentle - man died of some sudden illness within a few months of the beginning of their acquaintance .

		By a strange coincidence ,
Cassandra	PERSON	's only love - affair was terminated in the same pathetic way .


Jane Austen	PERSON	's literary activities began early ; she had written stories and dramatic sketches before she was sixteen , but these contained nothing notable except their style , which was pure and simple ; the sense of humor which they betrayed was already keen .

		In later life Miss
Austen	PERSON	expressed the wish that she had read more and written less ; there is , however , no good reason why we should coincide in this opinion , which was , after all , only a bit of advice to a little girl of twelve over-fond of scrib - bling .

		At all events
Jane	PERSON	slipped easily into the first stages of serious composition before she was twenty .

		The family were great novel - readers , `` and not ashamed of being so . ''

		The name of
Jane Austen	PERSON	appears in the list of subscribers to `` Camilla , '' published in
1796	DATE	.

		It is even possible that she may have met Madame d'Arblay , who , from
1793	DATE	to
1797	DATE	, lived in the adjoining county of
Surrey	LOCATION	, a neigh - bor and intimate friend of cousins of the Austens with whom
Jane	PERSON	visited .

		In '' Sense and Sen - sibility '' one may find traces perhaps of the author 's interest in ''
Evelina	LOCATION	. ''

		The fact that
Jane	PERSON	's first version of her novel , the ''
Elinor	PERSON	and
Marianne	PERSON	, '' followed the epistolary form is significant of the writer 's respect for these earlier English novels , especially for the works of
Richardson	PERSON	.


Jane Austen	PERSON	was singularly objective in all her literary work .

		She never intrudes .

		There is a reminiscence of her own early efforts at self-education in the account of
Elizabeth Ben	PERSON	- net 's girlhood , and a reminder of her own feelings at the breaking-up of the home at
Steventon	LOCATION	in the grief of Marianne at leaving
Norland	LOCATION	.

		There is also a suggestion of the school days at Reading in the description of Mrs.
Goddard	PERSON	's school in `` Emma . ''

		The only probable portrait is that of one of the sailor brothers in the character of
William Price	LOCATION	, in '' Mansfield Park '' ; but these are almost the only allusions of a purely personal nature in all her works .

		Writing to her sister in
1798	DATE	, she speaks severely of a certain novel which offended her literary sense in this respect . ''

		Never did any book carry more internal evidence of its author .

		Every sentiment is completely
Egerton 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is very little story , and what there is is told in a strange , unconnected way .

		There are many char - acters introduced , apparently merely to be delineated . ''

		This criticism is particularly interesting as it antedates the revision of her first two novels , and was written while she was busy on the first draft of `` Northanger Abbey . ''

		The
last eight years	DATE	of
Jane Austen	PERSON	's life were spent at
Chawton	LOCATION	, where Mrs.
Austen	PERSON	and her daughters lived in a pleasant country house on the estate of one of her sons .

		Not far from
Steventon	LOCATION	, the scene of her first productive period , the novelist here resumed her literary work with serious purpose .

		It was at
Chawton	LOCATION	that her first two novels were finally prepared for the press , and here that ''
Mansfield Park	PERSON	, '' ''
Emma	PERSON	, '' and '' Persuasion '' were written .

		In the general sitting-room at
Chawton	LOCATION	, Miss Aus - ten did most of her literary work , subject to interruptions from servants , children , and visit - ors , writing on small sheets of paper which could be easily slipped under her blotting-pad whenever the creaking swing-door gave notice that anyone was coming .

		Modest and shy in regard to her work , and altogether indifferent to fame , she evaded publicity ; few outside the circle of her relatives learned her secret while she lived .

		At this day it is unnecessary to discuss
Jane Austen	PERSON	's place in literature , or to weigh her work to estimate its values , human or artistic .

		She herself once spoke of '' the little bit , two inches wide , of ivory on which I work with so fine a brush , as produces little effect after much labor '' ; no one has described her process better .

		She used material which was familiar and which she understood ; she loved the field in which she found it .

		To her niece , whose literary am - bition had found expression at an early age , she said : '' You are now collecting your people delightfully , getting them exactly into such a spot as is the delight of my life .

		Three or four families in a country village is the very thing to work on , and I hope you will write 306 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	a great deal more , and make full use of them while they are so favorably arranged . ''

		Such depreciation of Miss
Austen	PERSON	's accom - plishment as exists is based upon what she did not do rather than upon what she did , an unsound basis for criticism of one who achieved so much .

		One might justly criticise her favorite poets ,
Cowper	PERSON	and
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	, because they did not write otherwise than they did .

		The '' Life and Letters '' now published has its chief merit in bringing the youth of
Jane Austen	PERSON	and the period of her first literary de - velopment more vividly to light .

		In giving proper emphasis to the emotional and social side of her nature the authors of the book have really helped us to understand her better ; there is no question that they have corrected some erroneous impressions regarding this most inter - esting personality .

		BYZANTINE AND ROMANESQUE ARCHITECTURE .

		* The receding waves of enthusiasm for single architectural styles or for a restricted hierarchy of styles are laying bare a broad margin for appreciation and legitimate individual prefer - ence .

		The day is still not wholly past when critics , by rigid exclusion of all architecture not perfect in structural expression , limit their ad - miration to the Greek and the Gothic , or even to the masterpieces of these styles , the
Parthenon	LOCATION	and the cathedral of
Amiens	LOCATION	.

		An increasing tolerance , the result of keener vision , is now , however , permitting the enrollment of one ex - onerated style after another under the old shib - boleth `` Reason in Architecture . ''

		The motto has not been changed , but the reasons accepted are more numerous and varied .

		Roman archi - tecture ,
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, baroque , and modern architecture , all have been recently defended , and , if not wholly free from the stigma of incom - plete structural logic , have been justified as possessing high qualities .

		In his latest work , `` Byzantine and Roman - esque Architecture , '' Mr.
Thomas Graham Jackson	PERSON	, the veteran English architect and writer , appears as one of the champions of these two relatively neglected styles , which , though they have escaped positive condemnation , have usually been contrasted unfavorably with the Gothic .

		Instances could be multiplied in which BYZANTINE AND ROMANESQUE ARCHITECTURE .

		he contravenes the traditional view .

		Speaking of the French Romanesque of
Auvergne	LOCATION	, he says : '' After spending some weeks among the robust round-arched churches that we have been de - scribing , one finds the Gothic of the cathedral of
Clermont	LOCATION	thin and unsatisfactory ... one misses the broad simplicity , the generous solidity of column , arch , and wall , the grandeur of un - broken surf ace that gives the earlier Romanesque a dignity , and at the same time a geniality that one fails to find in the more scientific construc - tion of the later style . ''

		Again , in the conclud - ing chapter : `` Inferior as they are in science , the solidity of the Romanesque buildings with their sturdy columns and massive proportions will often satisfy the artist eye better than the more slender and ingenious constructions of a later day , when the architect economized sub - stance almost as closely as the engineer . ''

		That this is not an isolated preference , but an instance of changing critical sentiment , is illus - trated by similar relaxation of purist rigors against Roman architecture , from which the Romanesque took its departure . ''

		It is quite true that ornament rises in value in pro- portion as it illustrates and emphasizes the construction ; and the converse is also true that ornament is indefen - sible when it falsifies or conceals it .

		But to the latter charge , at all events , the Roman architect need not plead guilty : his wall decoration by columns and entablatures deceives nobody ; no one would take them for the main supports of the building .

		... It does not do to apply the canon of utility too rigidly to every decorative feature in architecture .

		The objection which is raised against Roman architecture on Ruskinite principles might with equal force be taken to much that we admire in Gothic ... The Gothic spire itself is an extrava - gance if we look merely to its original function as a covering to the tower .

		While on the one hand we should try to make decoration as significant as we can , it is clear that if the test of utility is pedantically enforced , there will be an end of architecture altogether . ''

		It is by a freedom from bigotry and preconcep - tion , of which this ability to see freshly is an evidence , that Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	makes his chief con - tribution to the discussion of his subject .

		In other ways the book is often disappointing .

		The author frequently seems unaware of cur - rent controversies which one might reasonably expect to find discussed .

		The only reference to purposed irregularities , or refinements , in the laying out of the buildings considered is a brief mention of those in the facade of the cathedral of
Pisa	LOCATION	, based upon
Ruskin	PERSON	's early observa - tions .

		With Mr.
William H. Goodyear	PERSON	's ex - tended researches on this monument and the pthers of its group he seems unacquainted .

		Mr.
Goodyear	PERSON	's demonstration , published some years ago , that the campanile at
Pisa	LOCATION	was from
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 307 the beginning intended to lean was sufficiently plausible to convince many scholars , including those attached to the Italian government , yet Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	speaks simply of the `` accident '' of its leaning .

		It is interesting to note , how - ever , that he , like Mr.
Goodyear	PERSON	, considers the inclination an artistic merit , and thus furnishes a disinterested corroboration of the motive assigned for building the tower in this manner .

		Of Professor
C. H. Moore	PERSON	's ideas on mediaeval church architecture and the origins of Gothic he seems equally unregardful .

		To treat the pointed arch as the fundamental differentia of Gothic seems nowadays rather naive .

		These instances open the way to a general discussion of Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's method and its bearing on the value of his work .

		His confessed limitation to buildings , or at least to classes of buildings , which he has visited and studied himself is praiseworthy for caution , but makes the work a partial collection of monographs rather than a well rounded history .

		This would not be so serious if seeming unfamiliarity with some of the omitted classes of monuments did not tend to impair the authority of certain of his generalizations .

		Discussion of the recipro - cal influences of Byzantium and
Italy	LOCATION	without thorough knowledge of the churches of
Greece	LOCATION	and of
South Italy	LOCATION	can scarcely carry conviction .

		The great amount of matter descriptive of sin - gle monuments included tends to obscure the general historic outline .

		Much of it , though doubtless based on personal observation , merely repeats information which is common property , and even when fresh facts are presented it is questionable if the place and the manner of presentation are of the best .

		A series of topo - graphical works for the local styles most dis - cussed , such as the Byzantine of
Constantinople	LOCATION	and
Salonica	LOCATION	, or the Romanesque of
Great Britain	LOCATION	, similar to the same author 's admirable ``
Dalmatia	LOCATION	, '' would seem a more suitable form .

		Freed from the mass of description , the his - torical introductions and summaries emerge as the most interesting parts of the book .

		By newer or better readings of history , they often healthily correct superficial views advanced by previous historians of the relation of art to environment .

		Among such suggestive analyses , those of the condition of
Italy	LOCATION	in post - Roman times , and of the circumstances surrounding the building of the great French churches seem especially just .

		The illustrations show few unfamiliar monu - ments , but they are frequently taken from un - hackneyed points of view and show details which are little known .

		The author 's sketches , some of them made more than fifty years ago , have often an added value through showing buildings as they formerly stood .

		The rich - ness of sketchbooks from which such an uncon - templated selection could be made is a testimony to the breadth of personal observation on which Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	so much depends .

		The expressed prejudice against photography , however , is scarcely borne out by the relative clearness and superior authenticity of the photographs repro - duced .

		As covering the same general field , the book invites comparison with Mr.
Arthur Kingsley Porter	PERSON	's recent work , '' Mediaeval Architecture , '' though this latter is intentionally confined to styles in the main line of development towards Gothic .

		Mr.
Porter	PERSON	's thread of narrative and generalization is much easier to follow than Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's ; his descriptions of single monu - ments are wisely relegated to appended lists .

		With its rich provision of bibliographies and abstracts from archaeological literature , it re - sembles the German '' Handbiicher , ''
summar	DATE	- izing the state of knowledge concerning its subject .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's book , in contrast , is essentially personal , and derives its mellowness from years of life and experience .

		Though difficult to classify as to form , it is welcome as preserving a knowledge of the buildings dis - cussed which is scarcely to be equalled for intimacy among our own generation or the gen - eration of our fathers .

Oct. 16	DATE	each is devoted primarily to the life of a single There is some advantage in this , since man .

		each author is discussed by one who is expert in the branch of botany he especially cultivated ; but taken all together , the treatment necessarily lacks continuity and unity .

		Perhaps the strong - est impression gained after reading this series of biographies is that science progresses in very different ways and through the labors of very different men .

		In one case we observe what seems like a dignified and orderly pageant of progress ; in another , erratic and irregular out - bursts , in which real contributions to knowledge are mixed with quite other matters .

		Here we see the eminent official , honored and well paid ; there the patient amateur , who does what he can , for the love of it , in the intervals of a busy life .

		All have scientific zeal ; but their other possessions , mental and material , may be infin - itely diverse .

		All who would be students should read such a book as this , if only to perceive that the aristocratic level in science cuts nearly at right angles to the more familiar social strata .

		It is this which stultifies even academic distinc - tions in the long run .

		Dr.
William F. Ganong	PERSON	, professor of botany in
Smith College	ORGANIZATION	, has long been known as an ardent and independent worker , especially de - voted to the pedagogy of his subject .

		He now extends the scope of his endeavor , and produces a book , '' The Living Plant , '' designed not for experts , or even for college classes , but for the great multitude of those who desire a readable and intelligible account of the principles of botany .

		So , he says , `` I have been at more pains to be clear than to be brief , assuming on the part of my reader no great knowledge of the subject , but a large willingness to take trouble to learn . ''

		He has also frankly faced the philosophical questions underlying all bio - logical studies , and arrives at a position which he calls '' supervitalism . ''

		To those who see only mechanism in all life-phenomena , this atti - tude will be abhorrent , and Dr.
Ganong	PERSON	will be accused of exhibiting superficial vagueness in place of the precision expected of a scientific man .

		Others will remember that the great root of superstition has been the desire to find simple explanations , short-cuts to the understanding of nature 's mysteries .

		Hearing in thunder the angry growls of Zeus , one had no occasion to know anything about electricity .

		Is it not pos - sible , to say the least , that in our modern zeal for complete '' explanation '' we may merely flatten out and smooth down our mental con - cepts , leaving nature herself as rugged as before ?

		So if Dr.
Ganong	PERSON	seems a little ambiguous in his philosophy , it is not necessary to suppose that he himself knows exactly what he means ; the point is , that there is something he and we can feel and yet not understand .

		Those who insist most loudly that they stick to '' facts , '' and are content with '' known causes , '' end by making those `` facts '' and `` causes '' do all the work ; a proceeding quite analogous to that of the men of old , who explained what they could by no possibility then understand , by overworking '' facts '' already familiar to them .

		To return to Dr.
Ganong	PERSON	's book : it is an excellent intro - duction to botany , readable and clear .

		It is illustrated by a number of useful figures and diagrams .

		From the standpoint of a beginner , it has perhaps one fault : the discussions are too general , without sufficient citation of partic - ular cases .

		On account of this , notwithstanding a high degree of lucidity , it may sometimes be difficult to hold the attention .

		The student can not be so precipitately synthetic .

		Messrs.
Knight	PERSON	and Step 's `` Popular Bot - any , '' originally published in
England	LOCATION	and now reissued in this country , is a large two-volume work , with -LRB- to quote literally from the title-page -RRB- `` 721 beautiful illustrations and 18 colored plates . ''

		It is a cleverly written popular compi - lation , prepared by men who know much about the subject .

		The authors have taken a great deal of trouble to search out interesting passages in various writings and quote them at length , thus enlivening their narrative .

		The very nu - merous illustrations are of unequal merit .

		The plate facing the title-page of the first volume represents a tropical African plant , drawn by Sir
H. H. Johnston	PERSON	, and is truly magnificent .

		The text-figures include very many excellent reproductions fiom photographs , and a large number of very poor drawings , that of the Leaf Butterfly -LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 4 -RRB- being positively scandal - ous .

		A very remarkable picture occupies p. 67 of the first volume ; it represents a giant cactus of
Mexico	LOCATION	, clearly from a photograph , but some enterprising artist has added a drawing of a Mexican , on such a scale as to make the cactus seem enormously larger than it really was .

		The legend beneath states that the spines are long enough to be used as toothpicks , which is true enough ; but they appear about as long as the arm of the man figured !

		Such fake pictures ought not to be published .

		After making these criti - cisms , it is only fair to add that they have to do only with relatively minor features of an excel - lent book .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL , 309 BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		An appraisal of In view of the `` Itra-generous treat - the Nietzichean ment already accorded to the creator philosophy .

		O f the
Uebermensch	LOCATION	, Mr.
Georges Chattel-ton Hill	PERSON	's `` The Philosophy of Nietzsche : An Exposition and an Appreciation '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- reveals at once sublimated faith on the part of the writer and profitable experience on the part of the publisher .

		This revelation is much the more strik - ing since the manuscript of the book was finished eight years ago , and since but two of its thirteen chapters contain anything that would have been essentially new for the readers of
1905	DATE	, and even these have been anticipated , if not superseded , in the meanwhile .

		All serious students of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	know that , heroism , sincerity , and refinement were his three most prominent traits , and that he looked upon the
State	ORGANIZATION	, the moral law , science , and Christianity as exasperating hindrances in the development of his ideal class .

		An elaboration of these ideas , coupled with a brief account of his life , fills Book One of the present work .

		Book Two goes over the now hard - trodden ground of will , knowledge , master and slave , superman ; and compares
Nietzsche	PERSON	with
Max Stirner	PERSON	, after having appraised the former .

		It is these two sections that one reads with the interest of near-novelty .

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	finds
Nietzsche	PERSON	and Stirner alike in their idealization of force , their belief in the will of power , their doctrine of the integral life , their faith in the preeminence of the voluntary over the purely ititellectual sentiments , and their exalta - tion of the individual .

		Both were individualists ,
Nietzsche	PERSON	for the sake of the race , his inferior pro- totype for the sake of the individual ; while
Stirner	PERSON	admired a
Cesare Borgia	ORGANIZATION	as such ,
Nietzsche	PERSON	admired him as the type of a race to come .

		But with all of Mr.
Hill	PERSON	's able comparison , it is a pity to see him re - ferring to such works on Stirner as those of
Mackay	LOCATION	and Rt < - hurt - and leaving
S. T. Byington	PERSON	's classic translation -LRB-
1907	DATE	-RRB- , with its excellent introduction by
J. L. Walker	PERSON	, out of consideration .

		In this one respect at least , Mr.
Hill	PERSON	should have revised his treatise to date .

		But with his general evaluation of Nietzsche no one will quarrel .

		It is a delight to read , at last , something sensible on
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's un - qualified denunciation of Christianity ; it is helpful to ponder over Mr.
Hill	PERSON	's discussion of genius which
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	had and of erudition which he did not have ; it is refreshing to meet with a sound exposi - tion of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's personality , the most powerful stimulant against the corroding isms of the present day .

		Nietzsche cried out aloud both to those who were asleep and at ease and to those who were un - wisely energetic ; and the echo of his cries may still be heard and heeded .

		It is invigorating to have such human reminders around , though too many of them would soon rob each one of his effectiveness .

		Albeit
Nietzsche	PERSON	did not add to our stock of positive knowl - edge , he did increase our interest in the full life and the deep ideal .

		Mr.
Hill	PERSON	has gone into this part of his study with uncommonly fruitful results .

		De - spite his fondness for such words as '' hemiplegic , '' `` unicity , '' `` theorician , '' `` diathesis , '' `` nmoneism , '' words that perturb the linguistically trepid , the entire discussion is clear , thorough , and reasonably untechnical .

		And only once , in `` Neitzsche '' on page 139 , has the proof-reader seemed to nod .

		More paoes from The 8econd J m e < > f the '' Diary of the diarv of Frances , Lady Shelley '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- Lady
Shelley	PERSON	, appears after the lapse of one year since the publication of the first , and takes up the story where the earlier one dropped it in the year
1817	DATE	.

		As
Percy Bysshe Shelley	PERSON	was then living and writing his best poetry , and was only six years younger than the diarist , there is a natural expecta - tion that we shall be favored with some signs of her pride in his accomplishment .

		On the contrary , there is but one allusion to him , `` my husband 's young kinsman ,
Percy Shelley	PERSON	, who seems ditsposed to become a poet .

		When I spoke to Mr.
Scott	PERSON	-LSB- Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	-RSB- about him he told me he seemed to possess great talent ; but I have no means of judg - ing of this myself , as I have not seen any of his productions . ''

		Yet this was the very year -LRB-
1819	DATE	-RRB- in which
Shelley	PERSON	was writing the most radiant of Utopian visions , '' Prometheus Unbound '' ; the great - est of tragedies since
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, `` The Cenci * ' ; and the most perfect of English lyrics , the '' Ode to the West Wind . ''

		There is also a copy of a long letter from
Scott	LOCATION	to
Shelley	LOCATION	, acknowledging the receipt of some poems submitted to the former for judgment , which contains such smug advice as this : '' They are a little too wordy , and there is too much the air to make the most of everything ... Upon the whole , I think your specimen augurs very favorably of your talents ... But , above all , be in no hurry to publish * A name in poetry is soon lost , but it is very difficult to regain it . ''

		However , there is no lack of interest for the reader who seeks for glimpses of men who were helping to make history in the eventful years between
1817	DATE	and
1873	DATE	.

		Lady
Shelley	PERSON	was the chosen companion and acknowl - edged friend of the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	of
Wellington	LOCATION	.

		Notwith - standing a temporary breach in their confidential relations , which was afterwards mended , he was always the object of her hero-worship .

		They ex - changed frequent visits ; on one occasion he draws for her a plan of the battle of Orthes , on the knee of his breeches ; for her , he consents to have his picture painted by
Hayter	PERSON	, a reproduction of which now appears for the first time as the frontispiece of this volume .

		We learn of his devotion to his mother , notwithstanding that she used to snub him as a boy because he was shy , and had not the dash and charm which distinguished his elder brother .

		With Queen
Victoria	PERSON	,
Lady Shelley	PERSON	was on such intimate terms that the Queen stood by her death - bed , and it was to her that she uttered almost her last words , ' I should be completely satisfied to die , Your Majesty , if I might be allowed to kiss your hand . ''

		The seven illustrations are all new and interesting .

		310 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	The authorship of the rambling , of a restless amusing , always intimately personal man of leisure , inters published about two years ago under the title , `` European Years , '' is now divulged in Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	's preface to a second selection of letters from the same pen ; and the name , already an open secret , is
Hermann Jack	PERSON	- son
Warner	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		New Letters of an Idle Man '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will be found no less worth reading than the preceding collection , although a little dif - ferent in tone .

		As the editor of both volumes says , the later one '' illustrates the subtle way in which a letter-writer responds to his invisible correspondent by an unconscious mood in himself , pre-established by ' auld acquaintance ' ; this packet is of a lighter sort , is more indulgent to whim and weariness , and an etymological interest takes the place of political economy . ''

		By reason of their greater indulgence to the writer 's whim and weariness , these letters , which are all addressed to an apparently intimate friend , designated in print as '' H , '' and , one conjectures from internal evidence , a Bowdotn professor , are even more frankly and carelessly revealing , in what they dis - close of the '' idle man 's '' amiable personality , than were those first published .

		The second packet seems to have been brought to light as a result of the '' rummaging in old desks '' occasioned , Mr.
Wood	PERSON	- berry says , by the publication of the first ; and there is cause for satisfaction that the rummaging was so fruitful .

		From the autumn of 188 1 to the
summer of 1899	DATE	the letters continue with few long breaks , the years
1884	DATE	and
1896	DATE	being the only ones left blank ; and the writer 's wanderings in those two decades were from
Europe	LOCATION	to
America	LOCATION	and back again , to
Japan	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	and
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	, to the
Bahamas	LOCATION	and to
England	LOCATION	, with winters in
Italy	LOCATION	, summers in
Germany	LOCATION	, sojourns it
Switzer	PERSON	- land , and other restless hitherings and thitherings , as Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	might put it .

		The writer is the same companionable soul , the same lover of ease and good living , and as `` far gone in indolence and pipes '' as in the earlier volume .

		But he is always a wide reader , and he comments shrewdly and fear - lessly on what he reads .

		The `` New Letters '' will not disappoint the lover of epistolary literature .

		The abode of Richer and riper , more mellow , more gentle mirth and genially tolerant , more filled with tranquil thoughts tne ca i m w i e dom of life , and marked by even more abundant felicities of style than his former volumes , Mr.
Arthur Christopher Benson	PERSON	's `` Joyous Gard '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- carries with it an atmos - phere of tranquil mirth , of kindly humor , of sage reflection , of wise observation , and of large charity and good will , that makes it a book thoroughly wholesome in its stimulus , restful and yet persuasive in its non-insistent plea for the best things of the spirit , and always sane and quietly optimistic in its outlook on the great drama of human existence .

		The title is , of course , suggested by Sir
Launcelot	PERSON	's castle into which , as is related in the `` Morte d'
Arthur	PERSON	, '' he retired for rest and recreation and pleasant dis - course when the exigencies of war and business permitted ; and the book argues the desirability and possibility of a similar stronghold of the mind for each one of us to seek in moments of leisure , in order thus to keep alive in the soul whatever of beauty and spirituality and intellectuality it can make its own .

		Not as a duty , however , is this to be regarded , but as a pleasure and an increasing delight .

		The substance of the volume is divided into twenty-seven short chapters or essays , all in the vein agreeably familiar to Mr.
Benson	PERSON	's readers , but enriched with fresh thought , new incidents , apt illustrations .

		He makes the chief end of man not exactly that laid down in the Shorter Catechism . ''

		For the end of life , '' he says , '' is that we should do humble and common things in a fine and cour - teous manner , and mix with simple affairs , not condescendingly or disdainfully , but with all the eagerness and modesty of the true knight . ''

		Poetry he defines as * the discerning of beauty , '' whether the beautiful things be seen or heard or hidden deep in the mind and soul ; a fine definition , but not likely to drive out those other narrower ones which are also needed .

		Deploring a certain disre - spect for knowledge in
England	LOCATION	, the writer makes this rather startling statement : `` There is , indeed , a land in which knowledge is respected , and that is
America	LOCATION	.

		If we do not take care , the high culture will desert our shores , like
Astraea	ORGANIZATION	's flying hem , and take her way Westward , with the course of Empire . ''

		And in the same mood he censures the English worship of wealth .

		In good round terms the author assails - ` the detestable Puritan fibre '' that induces a distrust of any discipline that is not dark and gloomy .

		But opinions and principles and theories are not the sole substance of the book ; few representatives of the studious life have Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- son 's store of personal reminiscence and fund of concrete illustration .

		Some fresh ^ ne ^ tne most curious characters chronicles of of that interregnum between Louis theReaency .

		XIV .

		and
Louis XV	ORGANIZATION	.

		known as the Regency was the eccentric Duchesse du
Maine	LOCATION	, granddaughter of the
Grand Conde *	ORGANIZATION	, daughter of the fantastic family tyrant
Henri Jules de Bourbon	PERSON	, and wife of the illegitimate son of the Grand Mon - arch , who at one time had prospects of becoming Regent or even of reaching the throne itself .

		The miniature rival of the
Versailles Court	ORGANIZATION	which Mme. du
Maine	LOCATION	established at
Sceaux	LOCATION	, while it had no political significance , does not lack a certain literary interest , involving as it does the names of
Voltaire , Fontenelle	ORGANIZATION	, and other writers not yet forgotten .

		The vigorous and piquant memoirs and correspond - ence of a life-long member of the little Court ,
Madame de Staal Delaunay	ORGANIZATION	, have been culled and edited by Mr.
B. S. H. Lombardini	PERSON	, and the result now appears in a volume entitled '' Rival French Courts '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The life of Mme. de
Staal	PERSON	was a strange and melancholy one .

		As a child she won the heart of a lady who pampered and cuddled
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 311 her for years , but who died in the girl 's early twenties , leaving her entirely without means or protection .

		A whimsical notable , the Duchess de la Ferte '' , filled with admiration for the young wo - man 's qualities of mind , set about securing her a place as lady of waiting with the Duchesse du
Maine	LOCATION	, but , becoming angry with her while nego - tiations were in progress , wreaked the most exqui - site revenge by obtaining for her a servant 's place instead .

		The poor girl dared not refuse it , and for years one of the finest intelligences of the genera - tion occupied itself with menial service about the person of the '' Queen of Sceaux . ''

		In the course of time , however , she rose to the rank and place for which she was originally intended , married a Swiss captain , and died greatly respected and ad - mired .

		The Memoirs show certain notable qualities of mind and heart in their author , a literary charm that ranks them with their better-known contempo - raries , the letters of Mme. ` de Se ` vigne ' and the chronicle of
St. Simon	ORGANIZATION	, a gift of objective imparti - ality , a patient self-control which is more than ad - mirable , and a capacity for admiring and loving which under other circumstances would have made a beautiful character .

		The frequent harshness of judgment and the gradual development of a pessi - mistic philosophy are entirely explicable from the circumstances of a life of drudgery and ill-treat - ment , although it must be admitted that if the witty serving-woman had not found the life of courts absolutely necessary to her existence , she might have escaped and been happier amid quieter surroundings .

		The title of the book does not make it clear that the treatment is confined almost entirely to the private and literary Court at
Sceaux	LOCATION	, and deals very incidentally with the real Court at Ver - sailles .

		It has long been understood that a vast amount of valuable information and gentleman , for the stu -LRB- ient of history lies hidden in the archives of prominent English families .

		The
Historical Manuscripts Commission	ORGANIZATION	has succeeded in bringing much of this material to light ; but many collections still remain unexplored .

		Some has also been published through unofficial agencies , chiefly as a result of the newer literary fashion which calls for extensive citations of documentary materials in history and biography . ''

		Why may not the
Life of Windham	ORGANIZATION	be written from his letters ? ''

		wrote one of his friends in
1831	DATE	.

		The suggestion has recently been acted upon , and now we have such a biography in `` The Windham Papers '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This work is in two volumes , and is made up almost exclusively of letters written by and to Will - iam Windhara , who was one of the more eminent English statesmen of the Napoleonic age , though , `` by the irony of events , he is now best remembered as the successful advocate of bull-baiting . ''

		Among the correspondents represented in this collection are
George III.	PERSON	,
Pitt	PERSON	, Fox ,
Burke	PERSON	,
Canning	ORGANIZATION	,
Castlereagh	LOCATION	,
Cobbett	PERSON	, and many more .

		From the confidential An English statesman letters of such men we should expect to gather much new information , and we are not disappointed .

		In
1783	DATE	Windham entered public life as chief secretary for
Ireland	LOCATION	; the next year he entered parliament ; ten years later he entered
Pitt	PERSON	's cabinet as chief of the war office ; in
1806	DATE	he joined the ministry of `` all the talents '' as secretary for war and the colonies .

		He was therefore for a long time in close touch with political affairs and in the secrets of the government during a momentous period , and his correspondence is a valuable supplement to the public documents of the time .

		But '' high-souled Windham '' -LRB- as Macaulay called him -RRB- was more than an official and politician :
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	, who has written the Introduction to `` The Windham Papers , '' says that he '' was the finest English gentleman of his or perhaps of all time . ''

		Such a man would have many interesting friends , and his correspondence has an added value in the light that it sheds on the lives and personalities of such men and women as Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	,
Fanny Burney	PERSON	, Mrs.
Siddons	PERSON	,
Lord Nelson	PERSON	, and others .

		Lord
Rosebery 's Introduction	ORGANIZATION	is chiefly devoted to a study of
Windham	ORGANIZATION	's character as a politician : he finds him a follower of
Johnson	PERSON	and
Burke	PERSON	, the one was his guide in religion , the other in pol - itics .

		As to the identity of the editor of the Papers , the volumes furnish no clue .

		A number of excel - lent illustrations , chiefly portraits , add much to the interest of the work .

		No one knows what the son of .

		Napoleon III .

		might have accom - plished had he lived ; but the chances are that he would have had no more influence upon French affairs than that excellent gentleman his cousin , who succeeded to the Napoleonic Pretender - ship at the
Prince Imperial	ORGANIZATION	's death .

		Empires have always ended by bringing ruin to
France	LOCATION	, and the gallant but hasty youth who sacrificed his life gratui - tously in one of
England	LOCATION	's dubious African quarrels would probably not have been able to induce his country to forget the past .

		However this may be , the Prince Imperial was a charming character , and his life and death are touchingly told by his old tutor ,
Augustin Filon	PERSON	, in a volume whose first purpose is evidently political , but which is not ostentatiously different from other sympathetic biographies with no ulterior motive .

		M. Filon 's acquaintance with the Prince began when , in
1867	DATE	, he was set to supervise an ingenious but wholly unsuccessful arrangement for giving the boy a public school education without exposing him to humiliation and danger by sending him to a public school , which very difficult pro- cedure was attempted by employing various lycee professors to visit him , assign the lessons which their classes were studying at tha same time , and give him a relative ranking along with the rest .

		Things went much better after the downfall of the Empire , in
1870	DATE	, had reduced the boy to the rank of a private citizen and allowed him to attend school in
England	LOCATION	on nearly the same basis as other boys .

		It is clear 312 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	that although he was slow in developing , the Prince Imperial possessed both intellectual alertness and strength of character , and that the depreciatory esti - mate which the Republican press of
France	LOCATION	set upon him was dictated entirely by political considerations .

		He remained under the charge of his tutor until he graduated from the
Woolwich Military Academy	ORGANIZATION	and entered the British regular army in
1875	DATE	, so that his biographer was in constant personal contact with the Prince during the most significant third of his short life .

		Neither the interest of the book as a biography nor its value as political propaganda is heightened by the unpleasant pages in which various brave British officers , and not alone the question - able Captain
Carey	PERSON	, who commanded the squad in the attack in which the young man was killed , are bitterly criticized for allowing him to meet his death .

		There are two sides to the question at worst , and it would have been better to obey the appeal of the bereaved mother : `` Enough of recrimination ; may the remembrance of his death join in a common re - gret all who loved him , and may no one suffer either in reputation or in material interests I who can desire nothing more in this world make this a last request . ''

		The volume is issued in handsome form by Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The perennial The soul of goodness in things evil problem of does not escape the discernment of the bov .

		President
William De Witt Hyde	PERSON	in his book for educators and parents , `` The Quest of the Best '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- ; observingly he distils it out , and though he affirms that `` boys are by nature bad , '' he proceeds to show that their very badness is but goodness in the making .

		The six lectures in the book were delivered last
May	DATE	before the First Gen -
eral Assembly of Association Workers	ORGANIZATION	with Boys , at
Culver	LOCATION	,
Indiana	LOCATION	.

		Their method of preparation was novel and effective .

		With the six members of '' English 10 '' at
Bowdoin	LOCATION	, for the year 1912-13 , the topics to be handled were gone over and subjected to a sort of joint and several treatment in both writing and oral discussion , the result `` in several instances being their -LSB- the students ' -RSB- work precisely as they wrote it . ''

		Although Dr.
Hyde	PERSON	has printed as the first sentence of his introduction the provocative announcement that `` This is a book for the top shelf , out of the boy 's reach , '' it is safe to say that not even the bad boy of his conception will feel irresistibly impelled to pluck and eat the forbidden fruit from that top shelf ; a first taste would be enough for him .

		In other words , the treatment of the theme is serious and scholarly , though not unpractical .

		Its six heads are : `` Natural Badness the Germ of Goodness , '' `` Artificial Goodness the Repression of Badness , '' `` The Quest of the Best , '' `` Missing the Best : Sins of Excess and Defect , '' * The Personal Motive and the Social Medium , '' and `` The Birthright of the Child . ''

		President
Hyde	PERSON	here again proves that he knows how to hit the nail on the head : his style is vigorous , his thought practical , his applications apt and telling .

		An out-of-the - An entertaining and informative wav corner book about a little-known region is of
Canada	LOCATION	.

		Mr > j onn
Mason Clarke	PERSON	's `` The Heart of Gasp < : Sketches in the Gulf of St. Law - rence '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Clarke	PERSON	's interest in the remote and inaccessible peninsula which the French call Gaspesie is primarily that of the geologist , but it is also that of a geologist who sees and is able to make us see the grace and dignity and significance of the gigantic cliffs that guard this rugged land , and the character of the kindly and hospitable fisher-folk whose villages cling to their feet .

		He tells us something , also , of the history of the coast , the landing of
Jacques Cartier	PERSON	, the early missions , attempts at colonization , and the development of the cod-fisheries still the principal , one might almost say the only , industry of the
Gaspe	LOCATION	'' shore .

		He describes the famous Perce '' Rock ,
Bonaventure Island	LOCATION	with its colonies of gannets , murres , kitti - wakes , and puffins , the marvellous peninsula of Forillon , and the sea-wracked
Magdalen Islands	ORGANIZATION	.

		Altogether Mr.
Clarke	PERSON	has told , with the charm that comes of genuine enthusiasm , the story of an out - of-the-way corner of
Canada	LOCATION	and of its unhurried and untroubled inhabitants .

		The tired worker seeking a quiet spot as remote as possible from the city , and content with plain food and simple sur - roundings , might easily go farther and fare worse .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The handsome `` Imperial Edition '' of Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	's collected works , which Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	have had in course of publication for some time past , is now completed for the time being by the addition of '' The Judgment House '' and a volume of poetry .

		From '' A Lover 's Diary , '' in the latter collection ,
Sir Gilbert	LOCATION	has abstracted some twenty-five sonnets which have always been objectionable in his eyes ; and has added , evidently rather reluctantly , '' a book of youth and memory and impressionism in verse '' entitled '' Embers , '' which was privately printed many years ago .

		The eighteen volumes comprising this edition make a dignified and impressive appearance , and the writer who lives to see his work given such a setting may well be considered fortunate . ''

		Psychology '' seems to have become the preferred term for any sort of talk about human functions or attributes .

		In '' The Psychology of Laughter '' -LRB- Ap - pleton -RRB- , Dr.
Boris Sidis	PERSON	offers an assortment of things he considers funny , strung along on a thin thread of commentary .

		The commentary makes clear the author 's ethical prejudices , but fails to indicate anything specific or fresh concerning the nature of laughter .

		The excuse , apparently , is that the book is intended to be '' popular , '' but it is far from clear that there is any necessary rela - tion between popularity and inadequacy .

		Of the cur - rent theories of laughter , Dr.
Sidis	PERSON	mentions
Bergson	PERSON	's and
Freud 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		He disagrees with both , but offers no substitute of his own ; and he ignores entirely or is ignorant of Sully 's important '' Essay on Laughter '' and the work done in laboratories at
California	LOCATION	and
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	on the nature of the comic and its bearing on laughter .

		One gets the impression that this book , like
Moses	PERSON	's razors in '' The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' was made to sell .

Messrs. Houghton Mit ` Hin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who have in active preparation such a work , written by Mr.
T. Philip Terry	PERSON	, author of a standard '' Guide to

		The announcement of an immediately forthcoming volume of poems by Mr.

Symons	PERSON	's return to literature , after an absence of several years , due to physical break-down .


Jane Austen	PERSON	is at last to be given place in the '' En - glish Men of Letters '' series .

		The volume dealing with her has been prepared by Mr.

		It will contain a specially prepared memoir of the poet by his son , the valuable author 's notes which have hitherto appeared only in the '' Eversley '' issue , and a photogravure portrait from the painting by
Watts	LOCATION	.

		Among forthcoming books on the stage we look for - ward with interest to the volume by Professor
Boyer	PERSON	of
Princeton	LOCATION	, on '' The Villain as Hero in Elizabethan Drama . ''

		Professor
Boyer	PERSON	, we are told , threshes out the problem of the influence of Machiavellianism on the Elizabethan dramatists , beginning with

		A revised edition of
Miss May Sinclair	ORGANIZATION	's `` The Three Brontes , '' originally published last year , is announced by

		A notable feature of this edition will be a new Introduction in which Miss Sinclair deals vigorously with the questions aroused by the recent publication in a
London	LOCATION	newspaper of the cor - respondence between
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	and
M. Heger	PERSON	.

		Mr.

		Arrangements have been made in advance of publication for translation into French and German .

		Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's publishers have in active prep - aration a new volume of this writer 's short stories , to be entitled `` A Changed Man , and Other Stories . ''

		At least two of the stories '' The Romantic Adventures of a Milkmaid '' and '' What the Shepherd Saw '' have been published in pirated editions in the

		Lovers of verse will be glad to learn that Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	are planning to issue a new volume by the poet who chooses to be known as `` A. E. '' It will bear the title '' Collected Poems , '' and will consist of a selection from '' Homeward , '' '' Songs by the Way , '' `` The Earth Breath , '' and `` The Divine Vision , '' to - gether with some new verses .

		368 SMVA INDIGNATIO .

		Indignation is one of the noblest of passions , because it connotes a burning desire to right some enormous human wrong , a flaming resent - ment against some outrageous miscarriage of justice , a deep craving for the realization of righteousness among men .

		Wherever the weak are oppressed , or the fundamental liberties of mankind are endangered , this passion springs up in generous hearts , and impels them to fitting words and deeds in defence of the threatened palladium .

		It is to such hearts that the poet appeals when he says : ''
Whoso	PERSON	takes the world 's life on him , and his own lays down , He , dying so , lives , '' and it is when he invokes such ardors that the poet fulfils one of his highest functions .

		But those to whom it is given to know this passion pay heavily for the endowment .

		For it possesses them as with the tearing force of the avalanche , or the devastating fury of the forest fire .

		The tranquil satisfactions and comfortable joys of normally-ordered existence are not for them , and their only hope of peace J that expressed by Swift when he wrote for his own tombstone the terrible epitaph : Ubi sceva indignatio ulterius cor lacerare nequit .

		If we were to expunge from the world 's literature the note of indignation , the resulting impoverishment would be incalculably great .

		To the apostles of the discredited gospel of r art pour Vart the loss might seem insignificant , but it would be immeasurable to those for whom literature is no fabrication of the studio but a product of the laboratory of life , associated with every deep human concern , and allying itself with the great causes of religion and politics and the conflict between the ideals of individual liberty and social justice .

		What would Juvenal mean to us were he deprived of the temper with which he denounced the corruptions of the declining Empire ?

		What would remain of Swift were the burning passages of indignation stricken out of his record ?

		What was it but the note of indignation that gave
Rousseau	PERSON	the power to impel a revolution of the social order , or
Burke	PERSON	the power to smite the besotted con - science of a government intent upon the oppres - sion of the American colonies and thus recreant 342 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	to the hard-won principles of human liberty , with the passionate cry : '' The question is not whether their spirit deserves blame or praise , but what , in the name of God , shall we do with it ? ''

		It was the indignation of
Mazzini	PERSON	that unloosed the regenerative forces that redeemed
Italy	LOCATION	from the bondage of foreign tyranny and made it a nation ; it was the indignation of Hugo that opened men 's eyes to the monstrous inner significance of the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	and made it a loathsome memory of the past .

		As Lord
Morley	PERSON	once pointed out , such writings are more than books , being acts , and it is the indignation which inspired them that gave them the vis viva of their irresistible impact upon what seemed to be the firmly established order of things .

		Shelley 's Greek patriot hurled his dying words of defiance at the Turkish oppressor , '' Then held his breath , and after a brief spasm The indignant spirit cast its mortal garment Among the slain dead earth upon the earth ! ''

		And it was the driving power of
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	's in - dignation , concentrated in such foci as '' Queen Mab , '' '' The Masque of Anarchy , '' and '' Hellas '' that made it possible for
Brandes	PERSON	to say of him that his life , begun in
August , 1792	DATE	, `` was to be of greater and more enduring significance in the emancipation of the human mind than all that happened in
France	LOCATION	'' during that fateful month .

		It is , indeed , to the poets that we must go for the most impassioned and moving ex - amples of that indignation in whose presence wrong cowers and spiritual darkness is overcome .

		The last great voices of indignation in English poetry were those of
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Swinburne Tennyson	PERSON	with his : '' Bring the old dark ages back without the faith , with - out the hope ,
Break the State	ORGANIZATION	, the Church , the Throne , and roll their ruins down the slope . ''

		Authors atheist , essayist , novelist , realist , rhyme - ster , play your part , Paint the mortal shame of nature with the living hues of Art , '' Rip your brothers ' vices open , strip your own foul passions bare ; Down with Reticence , down with Reverence forward naked let them stare . ''

		Feed the budding rose of boyhood with the drainage of your sewer ; Send the drain into the fountain , lest the stream should issue pure .

		Set the maiden fancies wallowing in the troughs of Zolaism , Forward , forward , aye and backward , downward too into the abysm . ''

		Swinburne with his : `` Bow down for fear , then ,
England	LOCATION	; bow Lest worse befall thee yet ; and swear That naught save pity , conscience , care For truth and mercy , moves thee now To call foul falsehood fair . ''

		So shalt thou live in shame , and hear The lips of all men laugh thee dead ; The wide world 's mockery round thy head Shriek like a storm-wind 's : and a bier Shall be thine honour 's bed . ''

		The indignation of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	and
Ruskin	PERSON	made a deep impression upon the thought of the
Vic	PERSON	- torian age , and still evokes responsive echoes in the hearts of men who are wise enough to turn to those seers for guidance in the conduct of life .

		There is a sharp contrast between the in - dignant manner of the prophet of
Chelsea	LOCATION	and the prophet of Brantwood .

		Carlyle 's indigna - tion was explosive , exceeding in dynamic quality that of most spirits thus aflame .

		A typical ex - ample is the outcry : `` My malison on all block - headisms and torpid stupidities and infidelities , of which this world is full ! ''

		Ruskin 's indigna - tion , on the other hand , was more petulant and passive , and tempered with a sad resignation , as of one who knew that his was a voice crying vainly in the wilderness , of one whose nature impelled him to testify , but who had little hope that his appeal would be heeded .

		We hear it in the opening of `` Fors Clavigera '' : '' For my own part , I will put up with this state of things , passively , not an hour longer .

		I am not an unselfish person , nor an Evangelical one ; I have no particular pleasure in doing good ; neither do I dislike doing it so much as to expect to be rewarded for it in another world .

		But I simply can not paint , nor read , nor look at minerals , nor do anything else that I like , and the very light of the
morning	TIME	sky , when there is any which is seldom now-a-days , near
London	LOCATION	has become hateful to me , because of the misery that I know of , and see signs of , where I know it not , which no imagination can interpret too bitterly . ''

		In a word ,
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's indignation was angry , and
Ruskin	PERSON	's was sorrowful .

		Each , in its way , is capable of stirring us to the depths of our being .

		In our own national history , two causes , beyond all others , have fired with indignation the breasts of our noblest spirits .

		In the case of slavery , the passion of Garrison and
Sumner	PERSON	and
Phillips	PERSON	, of
Emerson	LOCATION	and
Whittier	LOCATION	and
Lowell	PERSON	, brought about a triumphant routing of the powers of evil , at what terrific cost we all know .

		In the later case of the brutal subju - gation of a liberty-loving people , doubly shame - ful because it involves us in recreancy to the most fundamental of our national ideals , indig -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 343 nation has not yet completed its task , but it is working in the national conscience , and the outlook is promising .

		Meanwhile , it is cause for congratulation that the noblest of our recent poets perhaps of all our poets was wrought to white heat by this monstrous wrong , and gave us one of the finest examples of indigna - tion in English poetry when he wrote his '' Ode in Time of Hesitation / ' '' I dare not yet believe !

		My ears are shut !

		I will not hear the thin satiric praise And muffled laughter of our enemies , Bidding us never sheathe our valiant sword Till we have changed our birthright for a gourd Of wild pulse stolen from a barbarian 's hut ; Showing how wise it is to cast away The symbols of our spiritual sway , That so our hands with better ease
May	DATE	wield the driver 's whip and grasp the jailer 's keys . ''

		Tempt not our weakness , our cupidity !

		For save we let the island men go free , Those baffled and dislaureled ghosts Will curse us from the lamentable coasts Where walk the frustrate dead .

		The cup of trembling shall be drained quite , Eaten the sour bread of astonishment , With ashes of the hearth shall be made white Our hair , and wailing shall be in the tent . ''

		A certain amount of prejudice is necessary for the effective manifestation of indignation .

		We mean , of course , prejudice in the good ety - mological sense of fixed judgment determined , not by passion , but by a clear intellectual envis - agement of the evil in view , and of its probable consequences if permitted to prevail .

		The time for passion is after the judgment has been reached , not during the process of its formation .

		After that , indignation can not burn too fiercely , or express itself in terms too severe .

		Prejudice in the bad sense is born of passion at the start , or at least of some unreasoning dislike , if not of some desire for personal advantage , and its causes will not bear close scrutiny .

		A great deal of spurious indignation , the outcome of this sort of prejudice , finds voice all about us , in religion , in politics , and in sociology , and often the utterance is so vehement that it deceives all but the few whose ears are trained to catch the note of intellectual insincerity .

		If ever the indig - nation of bias is justifiable , it is as a weapon in the warfare against the fanatic , whose own bias is so unreasoning that it would pull down the very pillars of the temple if by so doing it might accomplish its petty purpose .

		The fanatic is constitutionally incapable of `` playing fair , '' and the workings of his unbalanced mind practically force the defenders of civilization to resort to exaggerated statements of their cause .

		Extremes of affirmation must sometimes be met by extremes of denial , and the spirit of calm deliberation which would gladly say : '' Come , let us reason together , '' finds itself forced to abandon temperance because it is sure to be taken by the enemy as implying a confession of weakness . ''

		Uncle
Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' would not have ceased to be a mere book , and become one of the great facts of history , if its author had been willing to parley , and to weigh dispassion - ately the plausible defences of slavery that came from the rostra and pulpits of the
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		It was the virtue of that flaming fiction that it saw only one side of its subject , but pre - sented that side so intensely that the conscience of the nation was effectively aroused .

		It sometimes happens that indignation of the most righteous and salutary sort needs to be expended upon objects that do not seem at the time to deserve such reprobation .

		The philo - sophic mind looks far ahead , and realizes that eternal vigilance is indeed the price of liberty , which as a practical precept means nothing to the masses of mankind .

		It discerns the under - mining and corroding influences in thought and life when their destructive work is just begin - ning , and is up in arms before the multitude has taken alarm .

		To these watchers from the masthead the world owes more than it knows , and their indignation , which often seems dis - proportioned to its exciting cause , averts many a shipwreck of ideals .

		That wise man ,
Lord Acton	LOCATION	, never wrote wiser words than when he said , speaking of the example of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Hamilton	PERSON	in our national life : '' It teaches that men ought to be in arms even against a remote and constructive danger to their free - dom ; that even if the cloud is no bigger than a man 's hand , it is their right and duty to stake the national existence , to sacrifice lives and fortunes , to cover the country with a lake of blood , to shatter crowns and sceptres and fling Parliaments into the sea . ''

		THE NEW BRONTE LETTERS .

		On
July 29 , 1913	DATE	, more than a year after the appearance of my book , `` The Three Brontes , '' the editor of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times '' published , with every circumstance of advertisement , four letters of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	to
M. Constantin Heger	PERSON	all that remains of the correspondence .

		The originals are now in the
British Museum	ORGANIZATION	, the gift of
M. Heger	PERSON	's son , Dr.
Paul Heger	PERSON	, to the nation .

		One of them is torn in two and mended again .

		344 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	It might have been more decent if
M. Heger	PERSON	had finished his work of destruction -LRB- if it was his work -RRB- ; but since he did preserve the letters and they passed from his keeping to his son 's , no other course was open to Dr.
Heger	PERSON	than , in his own words , '' to offer them to the British Museum as the official custodian on behalf of the British people . ''

		The responsibility for their publication rests with the editor of `` The Times . ''

		The letters were written after
Charlotte	LOCATION	's final return from
Brussels	LOCATION	in
February , 1844	DATE	.

		They are dated respectively
July 24 , 1844	DATE	,
October 24 , 1844	DATE	,
January 8 , 1845	DATE	, and
November 18	DATE	-LRB- ? -RRB-

		,
1845	DATE	.

		Ex - tracts from three of them are given by Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	in her `` Life of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	. ''

		It is not known whether she had the letters in her hands , or whether she merely used such discreet selections as were given to her .

		Possibly Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	may herself have made discreet omissions .

		As they now stand , unaltered and unabridged , they throw considerable light on that obscure and contested point of `` tragic passion . ''

		So much light that , personally , I think they ought never to have been given to the world .

		But , since Mr.
Spielmann	PERSON	has seen fit to give them , I am bound to unsay much that I have said , and to admit that some passionate element , inno - cent and unconscious , was , for all its innocence and unconsciousness , present unmistakably in
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	's feeling for her '' Master . ''

		All that I wrote on this subject was written more than two years before the appearance of this additional evidence .

		I was then entirely justified in maintaining that , as far as `` tragic passion '' goes , we have no evidence to prove it , and that what we have points all the other way .

		* And if I said that tragic passion was , on the evidence , improbable , I nowhere said that it was impossible .

		Sir
William Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	, in his letter to `` The Times '' of
July 30	DATE	, says : `` It has been very seriously and ably argued that
Miss Bronte	PERSON	's regard for
M. Heger	PERSON	was nothing more than an ordinary friendship .

		To suppose it went further is ` pitiful and silly . '

		... It will now be seen that those were right who took another view . ''

		You seem to hear a certain note of triumph , as if he said , `` Aha !

		who was right and who was wrong , after all ? ''

		And it was necessary to remind my critic that I never said that
Miss Bronte	PERSON	's regard for
M. Heger	PERSON	was nothing more than an ordinary friendship , that , on the contrary , I was at some pains to show that it was a most extraordinary one .

		Well , I own that the now positively notorious passage about
Charlotte	LOCATION	's `` peace of mind '' may , after all , have referred to `` Miss
Bronte	PERSON	's regard for
M. Heger	PERSON	'' ; and that when
Charlotte	LOCATION	says that day and night she finds neither rest nor peace ; that if she sleeps she is disturbed by tormenting dreams in which she sees her Master , `` always severe , always grave , always incensed '' against her ; when she says that the poor have not need of much to sustain them they ask only for the crumbs that fall from the * '' The Three
Bronte	PERSON	's , '' pp.
82-95	DATE	.

		rich man 's table , but that if they are refused the crumbs they die of hunger ; and that to forbid her to write , to refuse to answer her , would be to tear from her her only joy on earth , to deprive her of her last privilege ; and that when day by day she awaits a letter , and when day by day disappoint - ment comes to fling her back into overwhelming sorrow , then fever claims her , she loses appetite and sleep , she pines away , we have here the language of subconscious love-sickness underlying a perfervid intellectual passion .

		And if any room for conjecture yet remains , there can be no doubt as to
Charlotte	LOCATION	's state of mind when she assures
M. Heger	PERSON	that his `` deux discours prononce 's a la distribution des prix de 1 ` Athe ` ne'e royale '' are worth the Pensees de
Pascal	PERSON	and the complete works of
Bernardin de Saint Pierre	ORGANIZATION	.

		But we have no business to read what she says .

		Her case raises a large question of literary ethics , of the public 's `` right to know , '' of the biographer 's right to publish what was never meant for publica - tion .

		In the innumerable discussions that followed the appearance of these letters it was abundantly evident that to the ordinary decent man and to the ordinary decent woman Mr.
Spielmann	PERSON	's act did not appear the fit and beautiful thing it appears to him and to Sir
William Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	.

		Had any ordinary decent man found himself with these letters of
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	's in his hands , nothing , I think , would have induced him to give them to the world .

		He would n't have cared a rap about defrauding the public of its `` right to know . ''

		He would have considered that the public has no right to know about
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	dead what
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	living would have died rather than make known .

		Of course , you have the notorious case of the
Browning	PERSON	letters which may be pleaded as pre - cedent , but publication of even this unique corre - spondence was regarded by many scrupulous people as more or less an outrage against perfect decency .

		Still , it may be said that if the
Browning	PERSON	letters had not been given to the world the world would have been considerably the poorer by their loss .

		They stand as the expression of a unique and perfect passion .

		You will not find in them one word which either
Robert Browning	PERSON	or his wife could have wished not to have written .

		Whether they would have wished them to be published is another matter ; but in no sense was Mr.
Browning	PERSON	dishonoring his father and his mother when he gave their love - letters to the world .

		This can not be said of the love-letters -LRB- if they are love-letters -RRB- of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	.

		True , there is nothing in them dishonoring to the writer ; but there is much which she would have wished not to have written .

		They are not the expression of a perfect love , acknowledged and crowned .

		They are the pitiful , almost abject cry of a passion secret , unac - knowledged , incomplete , such passion , as , with all its innocence , abhors publicity .

		To have published them simply as they stand is to have done their writer a gross wrong .

		To publish them with the
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 345 accompanying editorial comments is to add insult to injury of the dead .

		Nor can I find in them any excuse for their publication .

		There is nothing unique about them .

		They are not , as Sir
William Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	thinks , `` priceless . ''

		They are the expression of a very ordinary love-sickness , writh - ing under its veil of intellectual passion .

		They add nothing of any value to our knowledge of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	, even supposing that we had the right to know .

		Many harsh things have been said of Mrs. Gas - kell 's indiscretion , and it may be admitted that where other people were concerned she was , even for a biographer , more than usually indiscreet ; but in all that related to
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	she was a perfect example of that loyalty which the living owe to the dead .

		As we do not know whether she had access to these letters , we have no evidence for sup - posing that she guessed
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	's '' secret . ''

		But we can be pretty certain that , had she guessed it , she would have died rather than give it to the Press .

		This inability to do the indecent thing may make a poor biographer and a poorer editor that depends on what you consider to be the important truth about an author .

		Mr.
Spielmann	PERSON	, referring to Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's extracts from the letters , says rather gratuitously that `` they have inevitably , no doubt , at that time , for the biographer 's peculiar purpose been garbled in a manner rare in a frankly and candidly conceived narrative , '' so that '' the real burden and significance of the corre - spondence are thus ingeniously and successfully concealed . ''

		Now , if , as Mr.
Spielmann	PERSON	admits to be possible , Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	'' had no part in it , '' if she '' never had possession of the letters themselves , '' she was hardly responsible for the garbling .

		What then was her peculiar purpose ?

		What was it that she so ingeniously and successfully concealed ?

		If , on the other hand , she did have possession of the letters , her purpose of concealment was plain .

		She suppressed , that is to say she discreetly omitted , all that she considered she was not at liberty to reveal .

		She concealed deliberately the secret which her sense of honor told her she had no right to know .

		But the modern editor is not worried by any of these scruples .

		And so , after all these years , we have
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	's poor little secret dragged into the daylight for all Fleet Street to gloat over .

		We have headlines in the papers : `` Pathetic Heart - Cry , '' `` Hysterical , '' `` Six Months ' Silence . ''

		We have a `` Vindication of Charlotte Bronte ' '' by Sir
William Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	.

		We have reporters interviewing biographers in the hope of extorting an opinion on the great discovery that , after all ,
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	had a heart ; we have Sir
William Robertson Nicoll	PERSON	and Mr.
Clement Shorter	PERSON	both declaring stoutly almost too stoutly , as if they were champions of a lost cause that they honor her all the more for writing these letters ; we have the editor who gave her away protesting with a supreme stoutness that the secret he has exposed was entirely innocent , as if
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	's innocence was ever seriously called in question ; we have a tre - mendous display of chivalrous emotion all round ; and we have decent average people feeling nothing but the sickness of disgust .

		Mr.
Spielmann	PERSON	in his leader says -LRB- and it sounds very noble -RRB- : '' It is impossible for any but the stupidest to feel a prurient curiosity about these emotions which she has so innocently laid bare ... to discuss them one needs a purity of thought and language equal to her own . ''

		This would be all very well if Mr.
Spielmann	PERSON	had not drawn our particular attention to the fact that
M. Heger	PERSON	had scribbled the address of his bootmaker on the margin of
Charlotte	LOCATION	's last and most passionate appeal ; it is more than suggested that
M. Heger	PERSON	was entirely indifferent to these outpourings ; we are , in fact , invited to look on while an unhappy woman gives herself , with every letter , more utterly away , and to note well the coldness and propriety of Monsieur .

		We have Mr.
Spielmann	PERSON	's most uncalled-for editorial rendering , '' hysteric or neu - rotic , '' for '' exaltfe , '' that word with which
M. Heger	PERSON	in his `` affection presque paternelle '' is supposed to have reproved her .

		And so the real secret is out .

		It is not a vindi - cation of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	at all ; it is a vindication of
M. Heger	PERSON	.

		Under all the urbanity , all the pro- testing , all the manly chivalry , the reiterated state - ments of what was never doubted , the real motive is apparent .

		Dr.
Heger	PERSON	, tossing back to the British public these torn fragments of
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	's heart , endorsed with the address of
M. Heger	PERSON	's bootmaker , is not concerned with
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	.

		He is purely and simply defending his father .

		That bootmaker 's address is to stand as a perpetual proof that
M. Heger	PERSON	was innocent of any , even the faintest , response to
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	's '' passion . ''

		Now , nobody ever seriously suspected either
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	' or her master of any attachment that was not wholly innocent .

		And but for the pub - lication of these letters the question might have lain over till the day of judgment .

		As it is , in try - ing to prove that his father was indifferent to the verge of brutality , it seems to me that Dr.
Heger	PERSON	has tried to prove too much .

		He has still to explain why the letters were preserved ; why , in particular , that last letter lay in
M. Heger	PERSON	's waistcoat pocket so handy for the bootmaker 's address .

		Dr.
Heger	PERSON	states in writing to Mr.
Spielmann	PERSON	about the letters that `` there have never been any others than those I send you . ''

		And yet
Charlotte	LOCATION	, writing in Octo - ber ,
1844	DATE	, asks M
Heger	PERSON	if he heard from jfcer at the beginning of
May	DATE	and `` again in the month of
August	DATE	. ''

		On the
18th of November	DATE	, presumably
1845	DATE	, she says : `` It is now the
18th of November	DATE	; my last letter was dated -LRB- I think -RRB- the
18th of May	DATE	. ''

		In the first of the four letters , dated
July 24 , 1844	DATE	, she says : `` Ah , Monsieur !

		I once wrote you a letter that was less than reasonable , because sorrow was in my heart .

		I will do so no more . ''

		It may be that this letter was never sent , but there are still 346 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	three letters unaccounted for .

		And as the six months ' regulation apparently did not come into force in the beginning of what Dr.
Heger	PERSON	calls `` the one-sided correspondence , '' we may presume that there were many more letters sent than he supposes .

		And we have still to wonder why
Madame Heger	PERSON	disapproved of the `` one-sided correspondence '' so strongly that her husband had to propose to Char - lotte that clandestine arrangement which
Charlotte	LOCATION	very properly refused to adopt .

		* More than all , we are left wondering why , if the master sus - pected his pupil of a regrettable passion for himself -LRB- and it is more than suggested that he did suspect her -RRB- , why on earth did he make that scene , described in one of
Charlotte	LOCATION	's earlier letters , when she was anxious to return to
England	LOCATION	, and he implored her to remain ?

		That is not the conduct of an honorable man suspecting a woman 's regrettable passion for himself , neither is it the conduct of a man altogether indifferent to that woman ; though it may very well be that of a man innocently unaware of the nature of his own feeling and of hers .

		And the theory of complete indifference is irre - concilable with the evidence of the letters them - selves .

		Can anybody whose judgment is not en - tirely warped by a theory really think that
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	, proud , reticent , self-distrustful to the last degree , the
Charlotte	LOCATION	whom we know in all her other letters , would have let herself go to such an extent , would have appealed so humbly , so almost abjectly , to a man whom she knew to be com - pletely indifferent to her ?

		If there is nothing dis - honoring in
Charlotte	LOCATION	's feeling for
M. Heger	PERSON	, if , with Mr.
Speilmann	PERSON	, we are to '' admire her all the more for it , '' why should there be anything dishon - oring in
M. Heger	PERSON	's possible feeling for
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	?

		Why should n't we admire him all the more for it ?

		There is nothing admirable in the figure that he cuts on the hypothesis of complete indifference .

		It is conceivable that he should have seen fit to end a rather trying correspondence on grounds far other than indifference ; that his feeling evaporated gradually , and that he became bored with
Charlotte	LOCATION	's letters , is also conceivable .

		What his precise feeling was nobody will ever know ; but that he began with indifference is contrary to the little , the very little , that we do know .

		What is more : on the total evidence I am con - vinced more than ever that until the moment for her final departure from
Brussels	LOCATION	, until the `` scene '' that
M. Heger	PERSON	made ,
Charlotte	LOCATION	had no `` feeling '' for him to speak of .

		I see no reason to modify any - thiifg that I have written in reference to the periods preceding her return to
England	LOCATION	in
1844	DATE	.

		It was , I suspect , that scene that woke her up , that started the whole train of the longing that finds expression in the four letters , longing accentuated to torture by the loneliness and tragedy of her surroundings , * According to the statement
Charlotte	LOCATION	made to Miss
Fastitia Wheelwright	PERSON	, he asked her to address her letters to The
Athene Royale	PERSON	instead of to his home , on the grounds that the correspondence was disagreeable to his wife .

		longing that was finally appeased when her genius woke also and came into its own .

		However that may be , it does not , I take it , greatly matter .

		What greatly matters is the genius that appeased her ; and the publication of these let - ters does not affect in the least my main contention that that genius owed nothing to her '' master , '' that -LRB- in spite of her brief obsession -RRB- it was independent of all that he could do to her or make her feel .

		The proof is the use , the deliberate and unimpas - sioned use , it made of him .

		You can not have it both ways .

		If you insist that the figure of
M. Paul Emanuel	PERSON	is a portrait from the life , you may measure the extent of her inde - pendence by her amazing mastery of the material at her hands .


M. Heger	PERSON	may have been able to say , '' I was adored once . ''

		But
M. Paul Emanuel	PERSON	is the portrait , not of a god , but of a mortal , exposed , if you like , in all the charm , but also in all the weakness , the vanity , the pathos , of his mortality .

		Some of the '' old boys '' among our college graduates can even now recall the sufferings endured in poorly heated and dimly lighted recitation rooms , the bleakness of barn-like dormitories , and the insufficiency ` of appetizing food furnished at the college `` commons . ''

		But no man now living can describe as an eyewitness the crudities of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	's first building , where the ground floor was devoted to academic uses , religious and literary exercises , and the purposes of refectory , kitchen , and buttery , while above were students ' quarters , mere cells of the rudest sort .

		Though clapboarded and shingled , the building was far from weather-proof , and more air than light was admitted by the windows , which were only partly glazed , oiled paper serving else - where to let in a few of the sun 's rays and keep out the `` coarsest of the cold , '' as
Artemus Ward	PERSON	said when he hung an old hoopskirt over his chamber window at a country hostelry in mid-winter .

		Not even the most rudimentary of table-equipment was supplied at the college eating - room .

		His own knife and fork were carried with him by each student when he went to dinner , and after he had finished he wiped them on the table-cloth .

		The first president of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, the Rev.
Nathaniel Eaton	PERSON	, could have given points to
Wackford Squeers	PERSON	on the best way to abuse and cheat ingenuous youth .

		Even his usher ,
Nathaniel Briscoe	PERSON	, he nearly did to death by his brutal treatment .

		But he met with his deserts , being excommunicated by the church and ending his days in a debtors ' prison in
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Arthur Stanwood	PERSON	Pier brings these half-forgotten details to our attention in his readable book , `` The Story of Harvard . ''

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 347 THOSE WHO HAVE NO USE FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES , though the library stand with hospitably open doors in their very street , are - more in number than libra - rians like to believe , and more in number than they will be , it is to be hoped , a few years hence .

		The '' Library Occurrent , '' issued quarterly by the Indi - ana
Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, says , editorially : '' Once in a while a librarian is found who actually believes , or says she believes , that her library reaches all of her community that it can serve ; that everybody knows about the library , and makes use of it , or if he does not make use of it , has no use for it .

		Of course , no library 's registration list will bear out any such statement , but the librarian of this type can explain away any questions on that score with a wave of the hand that 's the most important part of her reply and a statement that ` the children all have cards and they take books home to their parents . ' ''

		Some significant figures from five
Indiana	LOCATION	cities with good libraries are printed , in proof of a too-common ignoring of one of the most valuable privileges open to the citizen .

		At
Plainfield	LOCATION	a little more than half the inhabitants are strangers to the library , so far as can be ascer - tained ; at
Hartford City	LOCATION	nearly three-quarters know not its benefits ; at
Muncie	LOCATION	the record is about the same ; at
Fort Wayne	LOCATION	more than two-thirds of the residents are recreant ; and at
Indianapolis	LOCATION	not far from nine-tenths are equally blind and deaf to their own best good .

		In general , the larger the city , the smaller seems to be the proportion of card-holders and library-users ... COORDINATING ENGLISH WITH OTHER STUDIES , and thus making it appear less remote from the in - terests and tastes that govern a student 's selection of the particular course to be followed by him in laying the foundations of his education , the English Department at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	is this year making an ex - periment that is thought to promise good results .

		Hitherto the twenty small sections in first-year English have each been composed of about thirty students , grouped together with no regard to their special lines of study .

		By the new plan , adopted in accord with President
Lowell	PERSON	's desire for a greater coordination of studies , there will be but nine sec - tions , each section embracing a group of students of similar tastes and pursuits .

		Thus there will be four divisions of those taking courses in civil government , three of those following the call of philosophy , one of those electing history , and one composed of classical students .

		Assigned readings and required themes will have some reference to these several lines of study .

		At the same time , however , a partial continuance of work under the old plan will furnish means for comparing the two methods and for deter - mining whether the innovation is productive of the hoped-for good results .

		Professor
Greenough	PERSON	, of the English department , says of the new plan : '' It is hoped that by the new arrangement English com - position may be thought of as standing less apart from man 's other studies than often seemed to be the case under the older plan .

		The mixed sections will not be given up or their number greatly dimin - ished unless the new plan clearly proves its super - iority .

		It has not been attempted before , so far as we know , and it will be very encouraging from every standpoint if it succeeds . ''

		A SUCCESSFUL TEACHER OF ENGLISH LITERA - TURE , supposing English literature to be a teachable subject , is not to be found in every institution of learning .


Dartmouth College	ORGANIZATION	was distinguished and fortunate in enjoying the services and the inspiring presence of one who seems to have been able to treat this subject pedagogically and yet not instil a lasting hatred of it in his pupils .

		Professor
Charles Francis Richardson	PERSON	, who died on
October 8	DATE	at
Lisbon	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	, in the prime of his useful life , is best known to gen - eral readers as the author of `` The Choice of Books , '' which has given pleasure and profit to hundreds of young persons eager to know the best that has been thought and written by the great ones of the past .

		His `` Primer of American Literature , '' his two - volume work on American literature , his novel , `` The End of the Beginning , '' his book of poems , `` The Cross , '' his `` Study of English Rhyme , '' and the various products of his editorial industry , have had fewer readers .

		He was born at
Hallowell	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	,
May 29 , 1851	DATE	, was graduated in
1871	DATE	from the college to which he gave the best years of his life , was editorially connected with `` The Independent , '' `` The Sunday-School Times , '' and `` Good Litera - ture '' in the years preceding his call to
Dartmouth	LOCATION	, and for twenty-nine years was a successful and be - loved teacher of his favorite subject at that college .

		Not even President Emeritus
Tucker	PERSON	was more popular with
Dartmouth	ORGANIZATION	men than was the professor whom they had long ago humorously nicknamed `` Clothespins . ''

		A sentence from one of his last let - ters may partly indicate why he was so universally liked .

		`` Somehow , '' he wrote to
Colonel Melvin O. Adams	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	, `` the boys that you like , you like better and better as the fugacious years fly by . ''

		A SAD LACK OF GOOD BOOKS FOR GIRLS IS one of the manifold ills with which the modern world has to contend .

		This is not saying that the ancient world was any better off in this respect ; its condi - tion was undoubtedly much worse , since there seem to have been no books at all for the amusement and recreation of either girls or boys .

		Miss
Clara W. Herbert	PERSON	, head of the children 's department of the
Washington	LOCATION	-LRB- D. C. -RRB- Public Library , contributes to the
Springfield	LOCATION	`` Republican '' some of the results of her experience in ministering to the literary needs of girls , and takes occasion to lament that '' at present there are hardly thirty girls ' stories which add any - thing to her -LSB- the girl -RSB- mentally . ''

		She has found that `` it is almost impossible to make the average girl read a story not laid in the present time and in surroundings and circumstances similar to her own .

		Historical tales , and those dealing with life in other lands , are not generally popular , as are the stories 348 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	of school and neighborhood life , or those in which the heroine assumes charge of the family during the illness , or after the death , of one of the parents .

		Authors have learned that this is a popular basis for girls ' stories .

		Thus the difficulty is to give to the girl books in sufficient numbers , satisfying this real need of hers and she will not read them unless they do meet this need in some way and still give her anything that will be stimulating intellectually . ''

		Thankful indeed must the writer of juvenile books be that the boy 's craving makes him interested in a wider range of subjects : history , biography , travels , science , invention , and discovery may all be worked up acceptably in stories or other books for boys .

		Here and there , too , one finds a girl who has a healthy appetite for boys ' books and turns away disdainfully from the
Elsie Dinsmore	PERSON	series .

		On the whole , there seems to be a field open for arousing fresh interests in girl readers and for supplying the books that shall touch upon those interests in an attractive way .

		TRAINING FOR CITIZENSHIP , with all the aid that reading and lectures arid class-room instruction can render , is too obviously advisable to call for any argument in its favor on our part .

		Almost anyone ought to have the making of a good citizen in him if he is caught young enough and properly instructed .

		Our universities and colleges are of late paying increased attention to the instruction of their stu - dents in the duties of intelligent citizenship .

		At
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	the regular work of the College of Arts this year includes a '' course in citizenship , '' in which non-resident lecturers will give weekly lectures , as will also members of the
Department of Political Science	ORGANIZATION	, and Dr.
Devine	PERSON	's manual on `` The Family and Social Work '' will be used as textbook .

		In the syllabus of the year 's course are to be noted such lectures as that by Mr.
Clinton Rogers	PERSON	Wood - ruff on `` The Citizen and His Community , '' and that by Mr.
Lee F. Hanmer	PERSON	on `` The Citizen and the Recreation Needs of the
Community	ORGANIZATION	, '' as also Mr.
Clarence Arthur Perry	PERSON	's address on `` The Citizen and the Schools , '' Dr.
Hermann M. Biggs	PERSON	's discourse entitled '' The Citizen and Public Health , '' Dr.
Devine	PERSON	's treatment of `` The Citizen and Prob - lems of Crime , '' and Mr.
Franklin Matthews	PERSON	's lec - ture on `` The Citizen and the Press . ''

		Much good ought to result from such a course as this , and not the least of the benefits accruing may prove to be the more general establishment of similar courses at other like institutions of higher learning .

		WHAT TO READ ABOUT
JAPAN	LOCATION	, in order to gain some adequate conception of the remarkable people who are causing so much discussion and debate in our own country and elsewhere , is a question at present asking itself in many an inquiring mind and getting itself voiced in many a bookshop and public library .

		The
Japan	LOCATION	Society , in reply to the great number of persons who appeal to it for suggestions in this department of reading , has prepared a short list of helpful and authoritative works .

		They are , as announced by the Society : ' - Intercourse between the
United States	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	, '' by Nitobe ; '' The Japanese Nation , '' by the same author ; ' - Ancestor Worship and Japanese Law , '' by
N. Hozumi	PERSON	; ''
Polit	PERSON	- ical Development of
Japan	LOCATION	, '' by
Uyehara	LOCATION	; ``
Japan	LOCATION	: An Interpretation , '' by
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	.

		Impoi-tant as are the works of native writers , and interesting as is the native author 's way of viewing his sub - ject and expressing his thoughts , readers will find it profitable not to neglect the writings of western authors on
Japan	LOCATION	, who better appreciate the western student 's difficulties and pointof view in approaching the subject .

		A foreign language is commonly best learned from one who , having i he same native tongue as the learner , has himself thoroughly mastered the language and not unconsciously assimilated it in childhood .

		So it is that
Latcadio Hearn	PERSON	's and
Pierre Loti	PERSON	's pictures of
Japan	LOCATION	are more intelligible to us than some other and perhaps more minutely faithful productions from a native hand .

		SIMPLIFICATION AND MYSTIFICATION meet and join hands , with the cordiality characteristic of the junction of extremes , in the pages of `` The Pioneer of Simplified Speling , '' the official monthly publica - tion of the English `` Simplified Speling Sosieti . ''

		The leading article in the latest number at hand begins thus : `` Shoelderz tu the wheel !

		Aultnoe The Pioneer iz not isyud for tuu munths in the sumer , our campain goez on unbroecen .

		Indeed , tu jnj from the formidabl piel of pres-cutingz befor us -LRB- thai ar sumariezd in anuther colum -RRB- , the public interest in our rnuuvment haz never been so ceen .

		Ever mor rair ar the contribyushonz tu the Pres that shoe complect ignorans ov our wurc and our aim / .

		; ever graiter iz the number ov thoez hu taic our sied . ''

		A little further on the editor takes occa - sion to `` thane our well-wisherz for thair help in the paast .

		It wood be tuu much tu ecspect that aul wood be satisfied with ever !

		deetail ov our sceem , with every feetyur ov our propaganda . ''

		To an un - simplified speller a page of typographical contortions of this sort is not the easiest of reading : it mystifies more than it simplifies , although of course one might in time get used to such verbal puzzles as `` ceen , '' `` sceem , '' `` jnj , '' `` taic , '' `` wurc , '' `` tuu , '' and so on .

		In comparison with `` The Pioneer , '' our American `` Simplified Spelling Bulletin '' is a hidebound con - servative in its treatment of the written language .

		If it were not for the English reminder and warning of what we may be coming to by sanctioning even the slightest initial license in spelling , one might turn from `` The Pioneer '' and hail with glad relief the '' Bulletin . ''

		MR.
HALL CAINE	PERSON	'S PROTEST against the exclu - sion of his novel , `` The Woman Thou Gavest Me , '' from certain American public libraries , is an utter - ance natural to one who feels that he has put into the censured book all the resources of his brain and all the forces of his soul , as Mr.
Caine	PERSON	expresses it , and who avows himself conscious of no unworthy
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 349 motive in writing the story .

		He says : '' I specially desire to reach the large and sincere audience that depend for their literature on the great Free Libra - ries of your country -LSB- i. e.
America	LOCATION	-RSB- .

		I belonged to that audience myself in
England	LOCATION	in my youth and early manhood '' which is a somewhat puz - zling statement if taken literally .

		`` I only ask , '' he pleads , `` that in judging a book let the basis of consideration be the aim of the author . ''

		And fur - ther : `` Behind any book is the man who wrote it , and if he is a man of pure aims , and at the same time a true artist , he can teach a powerful lesson by an intimate study of any side of life , no matter how disgusting and revolting it may seem . ''

		The fallacy of that doctrine needs no demonstration here .

		The
Manxman	PERSON	's appeal to the American librarian 's sense of fairness is made through his American publishers , and will doubtless be printed in full in many journals .

		It is to be hoped that it will be read by all to whom it is addressed , and that it will receive due consideration .

		LIBRARY ECONOMY IN BOOKBUYING is a kind of economy every public library tries to practice , and the liberal discounts allowed to libraries by the book dealers help to make the book fund go as far as pos - sible .

		At
Bristol	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, as we learn from the current report of its public library , the average cost of books bought during the year was kept down to a figure remarkably low , if the books were all of fairly excellent quality .

		The average cost per vol - ume is given as seventy-seven and
one-half cents	MONEY	, as compared with one dollar and
two cents	MONEY	at the
Hart	PERSON	- ford
Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, one dollar and
fourteen cents	MONEY	at the
New Britain Institute	ORGANIZATION	, one dollar and
three cents	MONEY	at the
New Haven Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and eighty -
four cents	MONEY	at the
Waterbury Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Pur - chasing orders were widely distributed , no fewer than forty-nine bookselling houses and individuals being called upon for one or more volumes each .

		In its percentage of total annual outlay devoted to book-buying the
Bristol	LOCATION	library far outstripped its neighbors named above .

		The figure attained was thirty-eight per cent , against thirteen to twenty-eight recorded by the other libraries .

		C OMMUNICA TION .

		MILTON 'S EPITAPH ON SHAKESPEARE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I think it will be of great interest to your readers if you will kindly permit me to say a few words in your valuable paper apropos of the paragraph on pages 133-4 of your
September 1	DATE	issue , which 1 have just seen . ''

		Starre-ypointing '' has been the despair of English grammarians for more than 250 years .

		I am the chair - man of the
London University College School	ORGANIZATION	, and our Headmaster tells me that as a boy he was catechised upon
Milton	PERSON	's extraordinary blunder ; because `` y , '' like the German '' ge , '' is never prefixed to a present parti - ciple , but only to a past participle .

		Lathoni and practi - cally all other grammarians were astounded that
Milton	PERSON	, the most accurate of scholars , should have committed such an absurd grammatical error .

		So the matter re - mained until about six mouths ago , when I called atten - tion to - the fact that my copy of the second folio of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays ,
1632	DATE	, contained an inserted page in which
Milton	PERSON	's Epitaph is correctly printed with '' starre-ypointed . ''

		I sent out enquiries all over the world , with the result that two other copies of the correctly-printed page have been discovered , one in the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and one in the library of Queen 's College ,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		All the experts are agreed that '' this page is evidently an original and contemporary print , not a reproduction in any modern sense ... The paper is contemporary . ''

		AVriting in '' Notes and Queries , ''
London	LOCATION	, on
September 6	DATE	last , Dr.
McGrath	PERSON	agrees with the above , and Col.
Prideaux	PERSON	describes it as a '' cancel leaf ... printed after the book had been placed on sale ... issued to purchasers in the same way as cancel leaves are occa - sionally issued at the present day . ''

		But I ask how comes it that after months of enquiry only two copies besides my own have been reported ; and how is it that in the third folio of the plays , printed in 1663-4 , the ungrammatical word '' starre-ypointing '' remained uncorrected ?

		The answer is obvious .

		The corrected page could only have been issued to those to whom the preservation of
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's secrets had been en - trusted .

		The page reveals to us , and it was intended to reveal to us , the name of the real author of the plays , to whom
Milton	PERSON	addressed his - Epitaph , the important part of which is contained in the first six lines -LRB- I quote from my own special page in the
1632	DATE	folio -RRB- : '' What neede my Shakespeare for his honour 'd bones , The labour of an Age , in pile 'd stones , Or that his hallowed Reliques should be hid Under a starre-ypointed Pyramid ?

		Dear
Source of Memory	ORGANIZATION	, great Heire of Fame , What needst thou such dull witnesse of thy Name ? ''

		Now '' Reliques '' must mean `` what he hath left us '' ; and
Ben Jonson	PERSON	addresses his noble verses of commen - dation , which precede the plays in the folios , '' To the memory of my beloved the Author ... and what he hath left us , '' meaning thereby the immortal plays themselves .

		And that is exactly what
Milton	PERSON	means by '' his hallowed Reliques . ''

		A '' starre-ypointed Pyramid '' can only mean a pyra - mid with a star upon its point -LRB- its apex ; just as a ball - pointed pen means a pen with a ball upon its point , a diamond-pointed drill means a drill with a diamond upon its point , such instances might be multiplied indefinitely .

		Now a pyramid with a star upon its apex is a '' Beacon '' -LRB- pronounced '' Bacon , '' '' Bacon great Beacon of the state , '' just as at that period `` tea '' was pronounced '' tay , '' '' sea '' was pronounced '' say , '' etc. -RRB-
Milton	PERSON	then proceeds to say : '' What needst thou such dull witnesse of thy Name ? ''

		This is evidently intended to tell us that people ought to have wit enough to perceive that
Bacon	PERSON	was the name of the all - wise , all-learned author of the plays , without it being neces - sary to put the dull witness of a Beacon -LRB- Bacon -RRB- upon these marvellous works .

		In quite a number of the books of the period , to which the name of
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	has not yet been attached , there will be found engravings representing a pyramid or a beacon , to reveal to the initiated the name of the real author .

		350 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	STAGE MEMORIES OF SIXTY TEAKS .

		* A follower of the stage in his boyhood , Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	began writing about it in youth , and has been writing about it ever since .

		His biographies of
Edwin Booth	PERSON	,
Joseph Jef	PERSON	- ferson , and
Richard Mansfield	PERSON	have found favor with readers , and he is now preparing a book on Sir
Henry Irving	PERSON	and Miss
Ellen Terry	PERSON	.

		These celebrities of the stage , therefore , are omitted from his present series of dramatic memories , `` The Wallet of Time , '' as are also a considerable number of other noted actors and actresses whom he hopes to write about in a subsequent work .

		The two volumes now put forth are certainly not lacking in wealth of material ; they extend to nearly fourteen hun - dred octavo pages , and are as rich in illustra - tions as one could wish .

		Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's well-known heartiness of com - mendation for what he approves , and uncom - promising censure for what he disapproves , are to be met with in abundance in his comprehen - sive `` Wallet '' - a name , by the way , that he takes from the passage in `` Troilus and Cres - sida '' that begins , `` Time hath , my lord , a wallet at his back ... '' Whatsoever things are pure , lovely , and of good report , in play - acting , he stanchly upholds and warmly praises ; but for the follies and fads of the modern stage he has nothing but withering scorn and biting sarcasm .

		In the things of his profession he is a splendid hater of what he dislikes , a valiant champion of what he deems praiseworthy .

		For instance , he declares at the outset and nobody can dispute him that `` administration of the business of the
American Theatre	ORGANIZATION	, in recent years , has been characterized by a policy of covetous , despotic , sordid commercialism , which ought to be rebuked and steadily opposed . ''

		He takes pains to emphasize his belief as a dramatic critic that `` ethical principles are more impor - tant than artistic principles , '' and adds : '' The whole experience of my life sustains the con - viction that , while the dramatic artist , whether author or actor , should never undertake directly to inculcate a moral , it is the first duty of the critic to ascertain and declare the moral influ - ence consequent on dramatic expression .

		conception of the drama , as the drama should be .

		One sentence in his preface , more than all the rest of it put together , indicates the tone of the book : '' It would be contemptible affec - tation on the part of any writer possessed of knowledge , experience , conviction , and trained literary faculty to pretend diffidence in writing on a subject which he is equipped and compe - tent to treat . ''

		After this we are prepared to find Mr.
Win	PERSON	- ter 's views of Ibsen and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's plays expressed in terms both vehement and picturesque .

		Some of the Norwegian 's compositions he considers nasty , and all of them ponderous and dull .

		Of the principal character in ``
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	'' he says : `` A nastier little female reptile has not been depicted , even by
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, ` whose spirits toil in frame of villanies , ' and whose whole fabric of dramatic writing is a pollution to the Stage , a wearisome burden upon contemporary thought , a darkness to the eyes of hope , and a blight to everything that it can touch of nobil - ity , beauty , and joy .

		Perhaps such persons as
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	exist : the
Lunatic Asylum	ORGANIZATION	is the place for them ; not the Theatre ... The play of `
Hedda Gabler	PERSON	' is a long-winded , col - loquial exposition of disease , and its heroine is an insane cat .

		No other phrase can as well describe such a monstrous union of vanity and depravity . ''

		To Mr.
Winter	PERSON	the author of `` Mrs.
Warren	PERSON	's Profession '' is , in short and simple phrase , `` a crack-brained , mischief - making English-Irish socialist , '' and the play itself a `` nuisance . ''

		Other and even more remarkable specimens of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's caus - ticity might be adduced from his sprightly pages as where he says of the author of '' The Christian '' that he `` registers himself as a blathering rhapsodist , flatulent with the wind of doctrine and giddy with self-conceit '' but it will be better to pass now to his generous , whole-hearted , soul-stirring enthusiasm for what he admires and enjoys in dramatic art .

		Mrs.
Gilbert	PERSON	, still agreeably remembered by many a theatre-goer , inspires him to the following strain : `` She was a never-failing delight and constant moni - tion .

		Her sympathy with the young was deep and quick : she was always ready and glad to speak the word of genial encouragement to inexperience and to back it with shrewd suggestion and wise advice .

		In one expedient of acting , in particular , she was preemi - nently expert , the use of time .

		It was a technical education to watch and study her employment , in speech , movement , and gesture , of pause , rapidity , or deliberation .

		She never obtruded herself .

		Each of her performances possessed the invaluable attribute of seeming inevitability .

		What she did she made to seem
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 351 exactly right to be done , and as though , under the given circumstances , nothing else could possibly occur .

		To age she would not surrender , and she was indescrib - ably amusing , and often a little pathetic , in her politely brusque resentment of any intimation that she was old or required attention or assistance .

		... As example of artistic cooperation , the ability and willingness to ` play together , ' for the right effect , without regard to self , I have seen nothing finer than
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	and
W. J. Florence	PERSON	, in The Rivals , ' and Mrs.
Gilbert	PERSON	and
James Lewis	PERSON	, in the Daly comedies .

		Mrs.
Gilbert	PERSON	and
Lewis	PERSON	, though they viewed each other with respect and ad - miration , were not close friends , and in their attitude toward each other , as age clawed them in his stealing clutch , they were comic . '

		Poor old lady ! '

		Lewis would say ; ' I 'm afraid she 's beginning to break up . ' '

		Poor James ! '

		Mrs.
Gilbert	PERSON	would remark ; ' he 's getting on getting on . ' ''

		Discussing the merits of a certain gifted English actor whose recent retirement from the stage his many admirers can not but deeply regret , the author shows both himself and the object of his encomium at their best . ''

		Willard 's representation of
Cyrus Blenkarn	PERSON	stamped him as one of the best actors of the age .

		His repre - sentation of
Judah Llewellyn	PERSON	deepened that impression and reinforced it with a conviction of marked versatility .

		In his utterance of passion Willard showed that he had advanced far beyond the Romeo stage .

		The love that he expressed was that of a man intellectual , spiritual , noble , a moral being and one essentially true .

		Man 's love , when it is real , adores its object ; hallows it ; invests it with celestial attributes , and beholds it as a part of heaven .

		That quality of reverence was distinctly con - veyed by the actor , and , therefore , to observers who conceive passion to be sensual abandonment -LRB- of which any animal is capable -RRB- , his ardor might have seemed dry and cold .

		It was nevertheless true .

		He made the tempestuous torrent of
Judah	PERSON	's avowal the more over - whelming by his preliminary self-repression and his thoughtful gentleness of reserve ; for thus the hunger of desire was beautiful with devotion and tenderness ; and while the actor 's feelings seemed borne away upon a whirling tide of irresistible impulse , his exquisite art kept a perfect control of face , voice , person , demeanor , and delivery , and not once permitted a lapse into extrav - agance .

		The embodiment was a memorable image of dignity , sweetness , moral enthusiasm , passionate fervor , and intellectual power ; but , also , viewed as an effort in the art of acting , it was a type of excelling grace , a beautiful personification of a noble ideal clearly con - ceived . ''

		Of course these passages of dramatic criti - cism with which the work abounds are largely if not wholly or thus one is left to infer culled from the author 's published reports in the daily press , or from his unpublished notes , and so constitute a sort of patchwork rather than an organic and symmetrical whole ; but no other dramatic critic now living could have made a book covering so long a period and embracing so wide a range of experience , dis - tinguished by such grace and charm of style , and revealing so close an acquaintance with a host of actors of many lands , from the days of
George Holland	PERSON	and the elder
Wallack	PERSON	, of
John Gilbert	PERSON	and
Charlotte Cnshman	LOCATION	, down to the present time .

		His collections for the enrich - ment of such a series of professional reminis - cences appear to be of the richest kind , and he scatters his treasures with liberal hand .

		An appendix brings together some remarks on ''
Ibsen	PERSON	and the Ibsenites , '' a chapter on `` Ameri - can Actors Abroad , and How They ` Fail ' There , '' and a deliverance on the subject of `` The Theatre and the Pulpit . ''

		In the
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	article the reader is again made aware of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's very poor opinion of the Norwegian , whom he takes occasion to rate far below
Charles Reade	PERSON	an unexpected comparison , to say the least . ''

		A reformer who calls you to crawl with him into a sewer , merely to see and breathe its feculence , is a pest . ''

		With that as a closing specimen of the author 's trenchant manner , we bring to an end this account of his memorable work .

		DISEASE ATSTD GENIUS .

		* We all have by heart
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's brilliant parallel between
Luxembourg	LOCATION	and
William of Orange	ORGANIZATION	, between `` the hunchbacked dwarf who urged the fiery onset of
France	LOCATION	and the asthmatic skeleton who covered the slow retreat of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Both ,
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	goes on to say , would in ancient Sparta have been exposed at infancy .

		We remember , too ,
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	's tribute to
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	, `` The little lamiter who wielded
England	LOCATION	's might on the sea . ''

		Whether great talent is a cause or an effect of disease and physical deficiency , the two things seem inseparable .

		Of course the light of fame brings out flaws which would not be apparent in ordi - nary people ; but still it is impossible to doubt that genius has to bear more than its share of such inflictions as insanity , nervous derange - ment , drunkenness , consumption , scrofula , and blindness .

		Does talent by its rapid absorption of life force throw off toxines which produce these diseases , or do the diseases by their irri - tant power produce talent ?

		The chemistry of character and ability is utterly unknown ; and when the most modern fad , eugenics , pokes a clumsy finger into this mystery , it may produce unexpected results .

		Certainly , if the past is to be taken as a guide , a sane mind in a sound body is most sedulously to be avoided , if we * !

		N SPITE OF EPILEPSY .

		By
Matthew Woods	PERSON	,
M.D. New York	LOCATION	: The Cosmopolitan Press .

		352 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	want to arrive at high spiritual , moral , or intel - lectual values .

		Once in the world a community set to work to breed men like prize cattle .

		For a time
Sparta	PERSON	did produce a race of powerful fighting machines .

		But even in arms these never more than held their own with the intel - lectual Athenians .

		Pericles told his feUow - citizens , '' We can do all that the Spartans can and many other important things . ''

		In the end the men of
Laconia	LOCATION	went down before the
Mace	ORGANIZATION	- donian barbarians , led by the drunkard
Philip	PERSON	and the half-mad
Alexander	PERSON	.

		These considerations are suggested by Dr.
Matthew Woods	PERSON	's book , '' In Spite of Epilepsy , '' which contains studies of three great epileptics ,
Julius Cassar	PERSON	,
Mohammed	LOCATION	, and Lord
Byron	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Woods	PERSON	's treatment of these three cases from the medical standpoint is of the briefest , and his sketches are really illuminating essays in biog - raphy .

		But he offers them to show the great army of epileptics that epilepsy , in appearance at least one of the most frightful of diseases , need not prevent a long life and an important career .

		Dr.
Woods	PERSON	is a promising recruit for the small group of Americans who know how to write .

		He apologizes because his work has been done in the hurried intervals of professional occupation .

		Truth to say , good proofreading would have removed a number of misprints and errors of reference .

		It might also have reformed some of the sentences which have lost their right grammatical alignment , or which are wild and whirling in meaning .

		Occasionally , too , his live - liness becomes cheap or smart .

		But these are slight blots .

		He has that instinct for saying things which lifts writing into literature and makes books readable .

		The great cause which is being tried in the world to-day is that of Genius vs. Democracy .

		The people everywhere are refusing to admit the existence of superiorities .

		Hence what M. Faguet calls '' the Cult of Incompetence . ''

		On the other hand , the trend of philosophical thought , in
Europe	LOCATION	at least , is as decidedly against Democracy .

		Democracy in art and liter - ature is certainly unthinkable , a contradiction in terms .

		These things are of and for the few , the many simply do not know what to make of them ; only in their weakest or most utilitarian forms do they appeal widely .

		So powerful in
America	LOCATION	, however , is the set of the democratic current that nothing can make head against it .

		Preachers , professors , politicians , presidents , all , like the Sausage Seller in
Aristophanes	LOCATION	, bring their sweet little honey-cake to the great Demos .

		They return in flattery what they get in pay .

		If an infinitesimal part of the effort and expense which with us have gone to make the intellectual halt half-whole or the intellectual blind capable of groping , had been given to develop promising talent , we should be to-day all one blaze of glory .

		But our motto has been , '' Let us rally round our mediocrities , for our geniuses can take care of themselves . ''

		These things are spoken of here because Dr.
Woods	PERSON	is decidedly on the side of genius , and he devotes himself to great fames with an enthusiasm which is rare enough in our arid life .

		His sketch of Ceesar is the slightest and most negligible part of his book .

		This is natural enough ; for while it is possible to add a stone to the mountainous cairn already raised to
Caesar	LOCATION	, it is not possible to alter the outline or contour of that monument .

		With Mohammed , however , Dr.
Woods	PERSON	has , in English , a com - paratively virgin field , and his admiration and enthusiasm for the Prophet has built up a memorial of great freshness and charm .

		His enthusiasm , indeed , reminds us of that story of
Carlyle	PERSON	who at an evening party , after declaim - ing with great vehemence in favor of
Moham	LOCATION	- medanism , could not in starting to leave find his hat . ''

		Perhaps , '' stammered
Charles Lamb	PERSON	, '' the gentleman came in a turban . ''

		Dr.
Woods	PERSON	would entirely alter our conception of the land East of
Suez	ORGANIZATION	, `` Where there ai n't no ten commandments , an ' a man can raise a thirst . ''

		Probably he is more than half right , and the Unspeakable Turk is very much the same com - pound of human nature as the rest of us .

		We think Dr.
Woods	PERSON	is wrong , though , in a number of points relating to Mohammedanism .

		It is a parasitic religion .

		It originated less , and has certainly less to say to us to-day , than any of the other great Asiatic religions
Juda	PERSON	- ism ,
Zarathustranism	LOCATION	,
Brahmanism	LOCATION	, or Bud - dhism .

		Mohammed took his central concept , the unity of God , from the Jews .

		He took his model and methods from Christianity .

		The later philosophy of the creed was Greek .

		Avi - cenna and Averrhoes were followers of Plato and Aristotle .

		Schoolmen born out of place .

		Again , Dr.
Woods	PERSON	seems to think that
Moham	PERSON	- medanism is all of a piece , that it has held to the original tenets of its founder .

		In the gen - eration succeeding Mohammed there was a great split in the religion which endures to-day .

		And it is probably divided into as many minor sects as Christianity .

		That Mussulmans conform more closely than Christians to the moral teachings of their faith seems to be another conviction of
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 353 Dr.
Woods	PERSON	.

		Judging from their history and literature , they could give the Christians meal for their malt in all matters of immorality .

		It would be pretty hard to find any Western book which can beat the Arabian Nights in indecency ; and
Hafiz	LOCATION	,
Jami	PERSON	, and other lyric poets are free enough .

		Omar , translated , has become the bible of the bibulous .

		Dr.
Woods	PERSON	repeats the statement that the Arabs saved Greek literature and philosophy for the world .

		To a certain extent they may have done so ; but they probably destroyed a thousand times as much as they preserved .

		Omar 's order to burn the Alexandrian library may be apocryphal , but something of the kind must have happened .

		The Arabs and their fellow religionists swept over all the regions which were centres of Greek culture .

		When they had done their work , only a few books and monuments remained to tell us what Greek civilization was .

		In spite of Dr.
Woods	PERSON	's rose - colored view of the
Mohammedan	PERSON	mind and character , we can not believe that what they substituted was equal to what they erased .

		Dr.
Woods	PERSON	's study of
Byron	LOCATION	, though largely a cento of anecdotes and quotations , seems to us one of the best presentations of that poet 's life and character that has been put forth in recent years .

		It displays the good sense of a man of the world , and the acute knowledge of a physi - cian who can make allowances for
Byron	ORGANIZATION	's un - fortunate physical inheritances .

		Particularly does it unravel that most remarkable trait in
Byron	LOCATION	's character , what might be called his hypocrisy of vice .

		From the beginning of his career he seems to have circulated defamatory reports about himself which were baseless .

		We believe that it is not uncommon for physicians to have to deal with a tendency of this kind , but
Byron	PERSON	's hints and tales about his wickedness were u too tall . ''

		The thing , however , is easily understandable in a man of genius .

		Genius at first is geniality .

		It is frank , open , warm .

		It feels that it is great enough to be known as it is , to be painted with the warts .

		Then it looks abroad and sees how the average prudent human being hides his errors and failings , and in sheer disgust at such hypocrisy it blurts out ten times more than the truth about its own de - merits , and gives the eternal whipper-snapper a hold over it .

		Stripped of such self-imputations ,
Byron	PERSON	's character would not show any worse than nine-tenths of his contemporaries of like position .

		Dr.
Woods	PERSON	rejects the charges of Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	and Lady
Byron	PERSON	's friends , though he does not go into any disproof of them .

		Leaving all this aside , there was in Byron an energy , cour - age , and scornful strength of character which would have made him notable even without the splendor of his genius .

		The filagree poets and measurers of syllables have in recent times writ - ten him down ; but it is safe to say that he will outlive them , and rank with the great poets of the world .

		CHARLES
LEONARD MOORE	PERSON	.

		TRUMBULL OF
ILLINOIS	LOCATION	.

		* If the memory of
Lyman Trumbull	PERSON	has waited long for formal biographical recogni - tion , it has at least fared well in the selection of a biographer .

		Mr.
Horace White	PERSON	was the choice of Mrs.
Trumbull	PERSON	herself , and of course the inevitable choice , since to high rank in the world of letters and active participation in the public life of the * time was added the advantage of long years of intimate acquaintance .

		With a voluminous store of personal recollections to draw upon , it would have been an easy matter for Mr.
White	PERSON	to write a `` life '' of Senator Trumbull on very short notice ; but he has never fallen into that obvious temptation of a jour - nalistic career .

		For several years he has been patiently working over the subject , and the re - sult is a thoroughly adequate setting of the man in relation to his time .

		Many a well-informed reader will lay down this volume not merely with a new store of knowledge concerning
Lyman Trumbull	PERSON	but with a broader and surer grasp of the essential facts and philosophy of the war and reconstruction period than he had ever before possessed .

		In his preface , the author makes the admis - sion that the careful study which the composition of this book has forced upon him has convinced him that his views upon one important point had been wrong from the beginning .

		He is now persuaded that the reconstruction policy of
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	was that toward which Presi - dent Lincoln himself had been working , that it was the true policy demanded by the situation , and should never have been departed from .

		Of course this does not blind his eyes to many errors in
Johnson	PERSON	's course , and to those obvious personal defects which in themselves contrib - uted largely to the disastrous break between the President and his party .

		In his acknowledg - ments of indebtedness , the recently published '' Diary of Gideon Welles '' takes first place , and is pronounced `` the most important contribution * THE LIFE OF

Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		354 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	to the history of the period of which it treats that has yet been given to the public . ''

		When
Trumbull	ORGANIZATION	entered official life as a member of the
Illinois	LOCATION	legislature , at the age of twenty-seven , those characteristics which stood out in his later senatorial career were already well marked . ''

		His style of speaking was devoid of ornament , but logical , clear-cut , and dignified , and it bore the stamp of sincerity .

		He had a well-furnished mind , and was never at a loss for words .

		Nor was he ever intimidated by the number or the prestige of his opponents .

		He possessed calm intellectual courage , and he never de - clined a challenge to debate ; but his manner toward his opponents was always that of a high-bred gentleman . ''

		As a debater , one sees in this description his close affinity with
Fessenden	PERSON	, of
Maine	LOCATION	, with whom his name became so closely linked by the vicissitudes of the impeachment of President
Johnson	PERSON	.

		The two were not always in harmony , but they were alike in keen intellectual vigor and rugged honesty of act and purpose .

		When the death of
Fessenden	PERSON	was announced in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	,
Trumbull	PERSON	said of him : '' As a debater engaged in the current business of legislation , the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	has not had his equal in my time .

		No man could detect a sophistry or perceive a scheme or job quicker than he , and none possessed the power to expose it more effectually .

		He was a practical , matter-of-fact man , utterly abhorring all show , pretension , and humbug . ''

		Mr.
White	PERSON	's comment at this point is that with
Fessenden	PERSON	passed away `` the most clairvoyant mind , joined to the most sterling character , that the State of
Maine	LOCATION	ever contributed to the national coun - cils . ''

		After all , what is the lasting worth of the glamour that later gathered around the person of
Maine	LOCATION	's `` plumed knight , '' or her `` Czar , '' in comparison with two such judgments as these ?

		While
Trumbull	PERSON	was a thorough hater of slavery , a vigorous supporter of the Union dur - ing the war , and an active champion of meas - ures for the protection of the freedmen after emancipation , he never lost sight of the solemn duty of proceeding with due respect to official oaths and constitutional obligations .

		His feel - ing against the temptation to defy law in assailing evil is well brought out in a speech made when the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	was considering a pro- posal to investigate the
John Brown	PERSON	raid . ''

		No man who is not prepared to subvert the consti - tution , destroy the government , and resolve society into its original elements , can justify such an act .

		No mat - ter what evils , either real or imaginary , may exist in the body politic , if each individual , or every set of twenty individuals , out of more than twenty millions of people , is to be permitted , in his own way and in defiance of the laws of the land , to undertake to correct those evils , there is not a government on the face of the earth that could last a day . ''

		And so during the trying years that followed , while he was generally to be classed with the more radical wing of his party , we nevertheless find him repeatedly holding back when his own judgment and conscience told him that the con - stitution , honestly interpreted , stood in the way .

		On this ground he firmly opposed the Ku-Klux Bill of
1871	DATE	: `` I am not willing to undertake to enter the states for the purpose of punishing individual offences against their authority , com - mitted by one citizen against another .

		We , in my judgment , have no constitutional authority to do that .

		When this government was formed , the general rights of person and property were left to be protected by the states , and there they are left to-day . ''

		At the outbreak of the war , he took strong ground against arbitrary military arrests , and later used his influence to bring the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus within due limits .

		And it was of course the same spirit that nerved him to stand firmly and successfully against the abuse of the power of impeachment in the case of
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	.

		For putting blocks in the way of some of Sum - ner 's more radical measures , he was angrily charged with betrayal of the cause of freedom , but that did not hinder him from coming strongly to the aid of Sumner when the latter was unjustly forced out of his position as Chairman of the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations	ORGANIZATION	, through the influence of President Grant .

		It fell to his lot to draw the Thirteenth Amendment , abolishing slavery forever from the
United States	LOCATION	and from all places under their jurisdiction , towards which the Emanci - pation Proclamation of President
Lincoln	PERSON	was merely a preparatory step , of value in its psy - chological effect on public opinion in the North rather than in actually freeing any large number of slaves , which under the circumstances it could not do .

		The man who drew this amendment , says the author , `` will never be forgotten as long as the love of liberty survives in this land . ''

		There are many points on which one would be glad to dwell , but there are other demands upon these columns , and their space is limited .

		Mr.
White	PERSON	has rendered a great service in pro- ducing this book .

		The young Americans who are growing up to-day to control the destinies of this nation need the tonic of a clean-cut presen - tation of just such lives as that of
Trumbull	ORGANIZATION	.

		It should be in every public library in the land , and discriminating librarians should exert themselves to promote its circulation .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 355 THE KITTREDGE ANNIVERSARY VOLUME .

		* For many years now , when a notable scholar and teacher has come near the end of his active service , it has been the pleasant custom for his friends and pupils to do him honor by con - tributing to a volume of essays samples , as it were , of the scholarly accuracy and habits of research which the master has inculcated .

		Such a book , for example , was the '' Miscellany pre - sented to Dr.
Frederick J. Furnival	PERSON	in honor of his seventy-fifth birthday '' in
1901	DATE	; and the '' Studies in Language and Literature in Honor of
James Morgan Hart	PERSON	'' published on his sev - entieth birthday in
1909	DATE	.

		The Italian , Fran - cesco Torraca , was so honored ; the Spaniard ,
Menendez	PERSON	y Pelayo ; the Germans ,
Sievers	PERSON	and Morsbach ; and , in
America	LOCATION	, Professors Gum - mere ,
Putnam	LOCATION	, and Toy to mention only a few .

		As a rule , however , these testimonies have come after a long generation of devotion to scholarship .

		The `` Anniversary Papers '' pre - sented to Professor
George Lyman Kittredge	PERSON	on the completion of his twenty-fifth year of teaching in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	are therefore somewhat out of the ordinary .

		Although twenty - five years of teaching is a respectable achieve - ment , Professor
Kittredge	PERSON	, now in the full vigor of middle life , promises to be good for another quarter icentury of equally brilliant and faith - ful service .

		Both the volume and the occasion of its presentation furnish opportunity for a brief review of the developments in American scholarship and higher education which have made Professor
Kittredge	PERSON	's term of service so noteworthy .

		When Professor
Kittredge	PERSON	joined the Eng - lish
Department	ORGANIZATION	at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1888	DATE	, graduates of American colleges were just beginning to find out that it was no longer essential to go abroad for graduate study .

		To be sure , Mr.
Henry Cabot Lodge	PERSON	, one of the first of
Harvard 's Doctors of Philosophy	ORGANIZATION	, had taken his degree in
1875	DATE	; but in
1888	DATE	Harvard was giving only two or three Ph.D. 's a year , as against her present average of twenty-five or thirty .

		The astonish - ing growth of the
Harvard Graduate School	ORGANIZATION	since , a growth paralleled in other universities all over the country , accompanied by an un - precedented demand for advanced teachers , has given Professor
Kittredge	PERSON	and his colleagues an exceptional opportunity to leave the impress of * ANNIVERSAKY PAPERS BY COLLEAGUES AND PUPILS OF
GEORGE LYMAN KITTREDGE	PERSON	, presented on the completion of his twenty-fifth year of teaching in
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	,
June	DATE	, MCMXIII .

		With portrait .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		their personality , their scholarship , and their teaching upon hundreds of men who have gone from their work at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	into college and university faculties .

		Some of the changes which this
last quarter	DATE	of a century has brought are reflected in the volume under review .

		For example , every one of the forty five contributors to these `` Anni - versary Papers '' is a college teacher , and twenty - three of them represent sixteen institutions other than
Harvard	LOCATION	.

		If time had served , the number of contributors might easily have been tripled , and the list of institutions represented extended very greatly .

		The conclusion is obvious , that in
America	LOCATION	almost the only road to scholarly pursuits , of the humanities at least , is offered by teaching .

		With us , men of means who take to scholarship are likely either to find teaching positions or to become bibliophiles with a leaning toward fancy bindings and volumes whose rarity sometimes has little to do with their intrinsic importance .

		In
America	LOCATION	, men like the late Dr.
Fitzedward Hall	PERSON	or the late Dr.
Furness	PERSON	are exceptional .

		In
England	LOCATION	such men are and long have been numerous .

		The fact , of course , is not necessarily disparaging to us .

		It means , for one thing , that men of exceptional bent toward scholarship find a main opportunity for service in direct contact with younger students .

		But it means also that many an American professor , with exceptional ability in research , is forced by our educational system to spend much time and energy on routine matters , when he might be of more service to his generation and to his college if he could devote himself more entirely to study .

		We do need in this country research professor - ships , and funds for publishing the results of investigation .

		Mr.
Rockefeller	PERSON	and Mr. Car - negie have made a start in science .

		Who will help out the humanities ?

		Another comment which a glance at the table of contents suggests is that all but six of the forty-five contributors are Doctors .

		Of the six , the four
A.B.	PERSON	's are Professors at
Harvard	LOCATION	, and the two
A.M.	ORGANIZATION	's are at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and their degrees date back to near the beginning of Professor
Kittredge	PERSON	's incumbency .

		Time was when a man might be too busy with teaching and research -LRB- as Professor
Kittredge	PERSON	and some of his colleagues have been -RRB- to acquire a Ph.D. .

		But * that day has passed in
America	LOCATION	, for the president of any little freshwater college may demand and get a Ph.D. to fill even an instruc - torship at almost any salary between
$ 600	MONEY	and
$ 1000	MONEY	.

		This is not , however , the place to dis - 356 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	cuss various absorbing problems connected with this change ; it is enough here to note its com - pleteness .

		Another remark which offers itself is that , although all of the contributors to this volume are teachers , not one of the papers even sug - gests pedagogy .

		They are all , as we have said , samples of the patient research and the dis - criminating and acute appraisal of facts which have made Professor
Kittredge	PERSON	's scholarship and instruction so stimulating .

		Lest someone think `` samples '' a disparaging word , let us hasten to explain that the papers range in length from three or four to fifteen pages , and that the subjects treated are necessarily either such relatively minor matters as '' The Date of Hegetor '' or an interpretation of `` Des Tors D'Arcaise '' -LRB- a phrase in the Old French `` Alis - cans '' -RRB- , or else carefully limited discussions of one or two phases of a large topic , such as `` The Modernness of Dante , '' ``
Johnson	PERSON	and his Friendships , '' or '' Hamlet and lago . ''

		Another phase of the change which Professor
Kittredge	PERSON	has had so large a share in is the broadening of the field of scholarly activity .

		Nearly half of the papers in this volume deal in one way or another with comparative litera - ture and the study of origins .

		Those who used to complain that doctoral dissertations prepared under Professor
Kittredge	PERSON	's direction treated with too monotonous a frequency the minuter and more technical Chaucerian questions will doubtless rejoice to see that only five of the papers deal with Chaucer at all .

		The general reader would probably turn first to Professor
Barrett Wendell	PERSON	's `` Fantasy concerning the Epitaph of Shakespeare , '' in which the writer sets forth a quaint but practical reason why our greatest poet may have deliberately chosen to phrase his epitaph in doggerel .

		Of the other purely literary papers , one of the most search - ing and instructive is Professor
Brewster	PERSON	's on `` The Logic of Literary Criticism . ''

		Indeed , the variety of the topics discussed here testifies to the wide range of Professor
Kittredge	PERSON	's interests .

		His pupils have drawn inspiration not merely from his thoroughgoing methods of research , but from his eager interest in and surprising knowledge of the whole field of lit - erature as well as philology .

		The volume is printed , after the American fashion , on paper so heavy that its comfortable perusal demands a Morris chair and a book - rest .

		It is almost as ponderous a tome as the `` elephant folios '' of the seventeenth century , which were kept in window recesses or chained -LRB- needlessly -RRB- on great desks .

		But the printing and the proofreading have been done with unusual care , and perhaps the book 's imposing dignity is all one should seek .

PAYSON MORTON	PERSON	.

		NAPOLEONIC CENTENARIES .

		* The widespread ignorance of Russian history accounts for the fact that the events of
1812	DATE	are remembered in
Western Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	almost solely because of the terrible disaster which overwhelmed
Napoleon	PERSON	's army .

		The heroic attitude of the Russian people , the enor - mous sacrifices they made to repel the invader T and their grim determination to abandon all rather than negotiate with him on Russian soil , are ignored .

		The memories associated with
1813	DATE	are , on the contrary , popular rather than military .

		The idea of liberation or national resistance , voiced in the stirring appeals of poets and philosophers and expressed in the desperate efforts of the German armies , commands the greater share of attention .

		Such thoughts have , doubtless , presided over the recent anniversary of the '' Battle of the Nations '' at Leipsic .

		The renewed interest in the Russian campaign has led to the republication , in English dress , of the earliest complete narrative of it , '' Rela - tion circonstanciee de la Campagne de Russie , '' written by Lieut.-Colonel Labaume and printed in 18 14 .

		During the campaign Labauine was with the
Fourth Corps	ORGANIZATION	, which the Viceroy
Eugene	PERSON	had brought from
Italy	LOCATION	.

		He loses no opportunity to praise the conduct of
Eugene	LOCATION	, while at the same time he writes bitterly of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, which has enabled the translator to give the book a new title .

		The special cause of the animus is probably the fact that the book was addressed to a Restoration audience .

		It was immediately popular , reaching a third edi - tion before the year was out .

		It continued to be reprinted until the publication of Scaur 's * THB CRIME OF

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 357 narrative ten years later .

		The story of the re - treat occupies only a small part of the volume .

		The flavor of personal experience is not so strong as in some other accounts , notably that of Ser - geant Bourgogne .

		The author has attempted to keep the balance between reminiscences and an exposition of the military aspects of the cam - paign .

		His explanations presuppose on the part of the reader more familiarity with names and places than can be expected a century after the event .

		Mr.
Petre	PERSON	's volume on `` Napoleon 's Last Campaign in
Germany	LOCATION	'' is opportune .

		Nothing in English presents with such painstaking exact - ness the complexities of the struggle .

		Indeed , the book errs , if anywhere , in the minuteness of its military descriptions .

		The narrative must be followed step by step with Mr.
Petre	PERSON	's sketch maps in hand , otherwise the reader will be confused by the moves and counter-moves of battalions , brigades , divisions , and corps .

		The comments on the topography of the battlefields are instructive .

		They would be still more help - ful were they accompanied by photographs of the countryside , such as Mr.
Petre	PERSON	has furnished in his other volumes on the campaigns of
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon .

		The special merits of the book will be found in its new information in regard to the composition of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's army and in the illuminating remarks upon the causes of French failure .

		.

		Mr.
Petre	PERSON	corrects the views current about the character of the army at the outset .

		He regards it `` as a good instrument of war . ''

		The personnel of the cavalry was good , but it was weak in numbers .

		The army used for the operations after the armistice was not so good .

		The numbers of cavalrymen had been increased , but they were inexperienced .

		Mr.
Petre	PERSON	's opin - ions upon
Napoleon	PERSON	's conduct of the campaign are equally interesting .

		He thinks
Napoleon	PERSON	was influenced in
September	DATE	and
October	DATE	more by political than by military considerations , acting as an emperor rather than as a general .

		Such considerations led him to cling to the line of the Elbe too long and influenced him to delay the order to retreat from
Leipsic	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Petre	PERSON	believes that
Napoleon	PERSON	did not show the power of quick decision which he once had .

		Too much was left to subordinate commanders whose initi - ative , hitherto suppressed , was unequal to the occasion .


St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	literature still accumulates .

		The most recent accession is the letters of
Piont	LOCATION	- kowski , a Polish officer who shared
Napoleon	PERSON	's exile a short time .

		Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, the editor of the letters , has prefaced them by a full Intro - duction and a `` Biographical and Critical '' sec - tion .

		He is evidently a devotee of the
Napoleon	PERSON	cult .

		In his Introduction he labors assiduously to call in question the good faith of
Forsyth	LOCATION	, who fifty years ago published a History of the
Captivity	LOCATION	based on the Lowe papers and other official documents .

		A part of the critical sec - tion is given to a similar attack upon
Masson	PERSON	's `` Autour de Ste.
Helene	PERSON	. ''

		Piontkowski 's let - ters give new details about
Napoleon	PERSON	's last days in
France	LOCATION	, but his account of the situation in
St. Helena	LOCATION	seems to have been written for political use , and even the editor acknowledges that it is not in all respects trustworthy .

		Dr.
J. Holland Rose	PERSON	's study of `` The Per - sonality of Napoleon '' is the most important attempt to present a complete conception of the great man 's characteristics since
Taine	PERSON	pub - lished the first part of his '' Modern Regime . ''

		The treatment suffers a little from the limita - tions of the public lecture .

		Much is said which would appear more naturally in a biography , but a sufficient knowledge of which could not be assumed even in a
Boston	LOCATION	audience .

		Dr.
Rose	PERSON	's conception of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	will , therefore , be found only by bringing together opinions dispersed through the eight lectures which make up the volume .

		Perhaps he would disclaim the intention of presenting his conception in a sin - gle comprehensive analysis .

		In the last lecture he says , '' It is futile to sum up Napoleon in any one category . ''

		In the lecture on '' The War - rior '' only a slight attempt is made to explain the elements of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's strategy .

		The im - pression is conveyed by descriptions of two or three typical campaigns .

		The little that is said about strategy might as well be left unsaid .

		What real information can be gained from such a statement as '' prompt advance in as great force as possible along the best line of opera - tions '' was a fundamental principle ?

		Almost any commander would try to do this ; but the question is , how ?

		A military writer in a recent number of the '' Revue des Etudes Napoleoniennes '' argues that
Napoleon	PERSON	had two methods : first , an enveloping operation upon the enemy 's line of communications , when his own superiority was decisive ; the second a manosuvre upon the enemy 's central position , with the idea of dividing his forces and beating him , if his army was larger .

		It may be unsafe to apply such formulas to so many widely vary - ing campaigns , but it is more satisfactory than to stop with vague generalities .

		The most pen - etrating observations on
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's character appear in the lecture oh '' The World-Ruler . ''

		358 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	Dr.
Rose	PERSON	concludes that as a result of the astonishing successes of the early years
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon suffered from a form of megalomania , and could no longer discern the limitations of his own work .

		In this later period the emperor would not listen to advice , and frequently took his wishes for facts .

		As a partial explanation of his earlier successes , Dr.
Rose	PERSON	might have made more of the aid received from the extraor - dinary group of able men by whom
Napoleon	PERSON	was wise enough to surround himself .

		Aside from his military abilities ,
Napoleon	PERSON	's genius seems to have lain in the driving power over men which he possessed and in his unmatched skill as an organizer .

		when Lady
Adela Mainwaring	PERSON	descends upon them , bent upon investigating the extent of Dicky 's per - versity , we have a delicious account of their attempt to put on appearances .

		The bubble is pricked , but
Dicky	PERSON	is no snob , and will not allow the girl to escape him .

		The story is no great matter , but it is kept alive at all points by the author 's effervescent humor , which can make the most commonplace happenings rich in delight .

		His characters are real people , incisively drawn , and we would not willingly spare the least considerable of them .

		A more refreshing story we have not read for many a day .

		Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	requires nearly six hundred pages in which to tell the story of
Mary O'Neill	PERSON	, the heroine of '' The Woman Thou Gavest Me . ''

		One hundred would have sufficed for all the story he has to tell , but the greater number permits him to slobber over his theme in the unrestrained and nauseating fashion that somehow seems to secure him a large following of readers .

		He draws his support from that subterranean or submerged public that is an eternal mystery to the critical intelligence , the public that is swayed by crude emotionalism , and upon which it seems possible to inflict any form of literary atrocity without incurring its resentment .

		Here is a book that will probably prove a `` best seller , '' along with the lucubrations of
Miss Corelli	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Wright	PERSON	, and Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	, and yet a book so offensive to anyone having the rudiments of good literary taste that its popular acceptance presents a problem in psychology that would have baffled even the com - prehensive sympathies of
William James	PERSON	.

		In its essence , the story seems to be a plea for the sanctity of illicit love , a brief for adultery , and ari argument against the salutary laws by which church and state protect the marriage relation .

		Free-and-easy divorce is the ideal preached by so many of our moralists in fiction that marriage is fast losing , in the popular mind , not only its sacramental character , but even its validity as the essential basis of any civilized social order .

		It is the easiest thing in the world to construct such a situation as is presented in Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's novel .

		Take an innocent girl , keep her igno - rant of the seamy side of life , give her a training which brings her to womanhood with a flabby will and no sense of personal responsibility , and tie her by the marriage bond to a libertine and a profligate .

		Then let life become to her a hell upon earth , and pile up the agony with all the devices of sensational rhetoric .

		Then let the man whom she should have married appear upon the scene , and pile up more agony as she struggles against temptation .

		Finally , let her succumb , desert her husband , and have ille - gitimate issue by her lover .

		This is the approved formula , and when properly worked , makes a power - ful appeal to the sympathies .

		Of course , the hus - band 's brutality must be unmitigated , the seducer 's virtues abundant and gloriously manifest , and the wife 's saintly endurance carried to the point of heart-break .

		Thus the novelist '' puts it over , '' ignor - ing only the vital facts that men and women are not as beasts of the field , that sacrifice is sometimes the THE DIAL 359 appointed agency of the soul 's salvation , and that the social obligation is paramount to the most im - perious demands of the hot individual will .

		Mr.
Caine	PERSON	has the whole evil argument at his tongue 's end , urging all the old sophisticated pleas for mak - ing the worse appear the better reason , and failing only of his desired effect because of his capacity for slobbering , because of the almost incredible rawness of his style , and because of his inability to make of even his leading characters anything more lifelike than wooden dummies upon which to hang his dis - cussion .

		His own public will not be disturbed by such things as these , but will wallow delightedly in the trough of his slimy emotionalism , spiced as it is with bits of description as salacious as he dares to make them .

		Mr.
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	's `` Round the Corner '' stands clearly out as one of the most remarkable novels of recent years , a work of serious and convincing art , a picture of life having the vitality that creative genius alone can bestow .

		We understand that it has suffered in
England	LOCATION	, along with Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	's new novel , from the sort of unofficial cen - sorship that is sometimes exercised by the great circulating libraries .

		This fact illustrates how indis - criminate censorships may be , for Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	's sincere study and Mr.
Caine	PERSON	's thoroughly meretri - cious performance are as far apart as the poles in every essential respect .

		The
Caine	PERSON	novel splurges in every chapter and is distinctly unwholesome ; the
Cannan	PERSON	novel is quiet , restrained , faithful to fact , and exquisitely artistic in execution .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	has got the trick of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, and knows how to write of the most commonplace people and situ - ations in a manner to make them fairly glow with interest .

		Since `` The Old Wives ' Tale '' we have read nothing so good in this kind .

		The novel is concerned , as the title-page informs us , with `` the life and death of
Francis Christopher Folyat	PERSON	, Bachelor of Divinity and father of a large family . ''

		The scene , at first laid in
Cornwall	LOCATION	, is soon shifted to an ugly commercial town in the north of En - gland , whither the clergyman removes and his family takes root .

		At first we took the title to imply that we had only to look `` round the corner '' to come upon just such interesting human revela - tions as are here made , but toward the end we come upon the author 's own explanation , which is a shade more subtle .

		`` Modern life is theatrical .

		Every - body is playing a part , because they are without understanding .

		Life for modern men and women is forever round the corner because they attempt to tackle their affairs with the minds of children , children who believe everything they are told and examine nothing .

		They play with everything .

		They can do nothing else .

		Unhappily , life is a serious business which yields its reward of joy only to simplicity , sincerity , and purity , or , if you like the old trinity better faith , hope , and charity . ''

		These words occur in a letter to the Rev.
Folyat	PERSON	from his oldest son , who has left home at an early age , and returned with widened outlook to the family hearth .

		His coming `` lets in the air , '' but it can not completely ventilate the stuffy recesses of the family life .

		The father , weak and easy-going , is incapable of convincing his children of the rela - tive values of life , as of dealing with the problems that confront him as they grow up .

		The mother , petty , selfish , and sentimental , is worse than useless as a guiding and restraining force .

		So the children grow up like weeds , knowing only mean ambitions and having only sordid ideals ; the girls are in par - ticularly sad case , because marriage is the only possible solution of the problem of life for them , and it proves a most unsatisfactory one .

		Mr.
Cannan	PERSON	has set himself the task of portraying life just as it is , without gloss or romantic glamor , smoldering for its time in a deadening atmosphere , and gutter - ing out at last .

		His tale is saved from being unre - lievedly dismal by the objective way in which the facts are observed .

		We think that he piles on the agony a little too much , for the life of the Folyats , who have a fair social position , and means that remove them far from penury , could hardly be quite as miserable as the author would have us believe .

		The real fault , of course , is not in their material restrictions , but in their failure to realize that there is in the human soul a
spring	DATE	of inward joy which , if only allowed to flow , can sweeten life in almost aiy environment .

		This is the teaching implicit in this very fine work of fiction , and the artistic justi - fication for what may seem its over-emphasis upon sordid detail .

		`` The Red Colonel , '' by Mr.
George Edgar	PERSON	, is a story that impels us to draw upon the unliterary vocabulary for some such word as `` corking '' or `` rattling . ''

		Either of those expressive metaphors will serve better to describe it than the more aca - demic forms of expression .

		It deals with the exploits of the Red Four , a company of international thieves and murderers , who put each other out of the way until only one of them the
Red Colonel	ORGANIZATION	remains alive , to be tracked down and driven to suicide by the persistence of a young English physician turned detective .

		What we like about
Waring	PERSON	, the physician-sleuth in question , is that his wits are a match at every point for the arch-villain whom he runs to earth , and that he is never guilty of those silly lapses from caution which , in most stories of this type , bring the hero into desperate danger in order that an escape by the skin of his teeth may be devised for him by the author 's ingenuity .

		Waring keeps his head all through , and does not make a single false move .

		The story is of the most exciting description , sprinkled plentifully with thrills , and holds the attention breathless as it progresses from plot to counterplot and from complication to com - plication .

		It is , moreover , written in the English language , and spares us the thieves ' jargon thought necessary by most writers to give realistic color to stories of this description .

		With his faculties still undimmed in extreme age , Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, in the latest of the long series of novels which have occupied him during the last 360 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov.	DATE	.

		quarter-century , gives us a work which must be reckoned among the very best that he has written .

		Few novelists can so temper the results of observa - tion with the ripe wisdom of the philosophic mind , or bring to bear upon a fictive invention so wide an experience of life and so seasoned a reflective com - mentary .

		He uses in the portrayal of a character the method of life itself , revealing to us the traits one by one , as they are brought out by circumstance , instead of employing the method of the facile novel - ist , who usually gives us the character outline at the start , and works it out in detail according to the preliminary specifications .

		Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	, no doubt , has the preconception clearly mirrored in his mind , but he imparts it to us only piecemeal , and we do not shape it for ourselves until life has progressively shaped it into unity .

		Each new manifestation comes to us as a surprise , but in the end the parts are all seen to fit themselves together as they do in our acquaintance with an actual person whom we have known for years .

		In ``
Hugh Wynne	PERSON	'' and `` The
Red City	LOCATION	, '' he has vitalized the revolutionary and post-revolutionary periods of our national history ; in '' Westways , '' he performs a similar task for the period between the days of
Clay	ORGANIZATION	's compromise , fondly but fatuously expected to calm the waters stirred by the moral uprising against slavery , and the closing days of the cataclysm which well-nigh rent our nation in twain , and blotted out forever the black disgrace of the peculiar institution .

		`` Long before the Civil War , '' he says , `` there were in the middle states , near to or remote from great centres , villages where the social division of classes was tacitly accepted .

		In or near these towns one or more families were continuously important on ac - count of wealth or because of historic position , gener - ations of social training , and constant relation to the larger world .

		They came by degrees to constitute what I may describe as an indistinct caste , for a long time accepted as such by their less fortune-favoured neighbors . ''

		Such a village is
Westways	LOCATION	, on the western slope of the Alleghanies in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and such a family are the Penhallows ,
James	PERSON	, landed proprietor , ironmaster , and retired army officer , and his wife
Ann	PERSON	, an aristocratic daughter of
Maryland	LOCATION	.

		The young people of the novel are
John Penhallow	PERSON	and
Leila Grey	PERSON	,
James Penhallow	PERSON	's wards , and respectively his nephew and niece :
John	PERSON	, orphaned by his mother 's death in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, comes to live with his guardian in
1855	DATE	, at the age of fifteen , and here the story begins .

		It is at first concerned with the making of this formal and self-conscious lad into a sturdy young American , and later with his life at West Point and his career as an engineer in the Civil War .

		The matters of historical import that are reflected in the ante-bellum chapters of the novel are the growth of the new Republican Party , the campaign of
Buchanan	PERSON	and Fre ` mont in
1856	DATE	, the intense feeling aroused by the Fugitive Slave Law , and
John Brown	PERSON	's insensate raid .

		Then we are carried all through the war , from the attack upon Sumter to the surrender at
Appomattox	LOCATION	, and the figures of
Lincoln	LOCATION	,
Grant	PERSON	, and
Stanton	PERSON	flit for moments across the pages .

		The relations of the Penhallows , husband and wife , are set at odds by politics ,
Ann	PERSON	being a stout partisan of
Buchanan	PERSON	and a sincere believer in slavery ,
James	PERSON	coming more and more to feel that in the party of Fre ` mont and Lincoln lies the only salvation for the imperilled union , and finally taking the field at the head of a regiment at
Gettysburg	LOCATION	.

		They debar politics from their conversation , but life forces politics upon them , and the deep affection that exists between them tri - umphs over the theories that would tear them apart .

		This is fundamentally a historical novel , but the history comes in only episodically , as its march affects the lives of those whose lot is cast in the little village .

		The love-story of the boy and girl runs like a golden thread through the narrative , but it is never sentimentalized , and neither the one nor the other allows it to become the whole of life .

		Leila is away for years at school , and
John	PERSON	for years fighting with
Grant	ORGANIZATION	, on the
Mississippi	LOCATION	and in the Wilderness , but in time 's due course their lives be - come united , as they were all the while destined to become .

		Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	has aimed to give us an '' impression of the multitudinous contacts which affect human lives , '' and this he has done , minutely and with unfailing sympathy and insight .

		It is good for us to know these people , and it was good for them to have lived in the critical time in which their lot was cast .

		We have here a cross-section of typical American life during the decade 1855-65 , and prob - ably no other writer than Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	could have exhibited it to us in such just proportion and in so humane and philosophical a spirit .

		It has long been an open secret that the anony - mous novel `` The Inner Shrine '' and its two suc - cessors were the work of Mr.
Basil King	PERSON	, and the authorship is now admitted on the title-page of his new novel , `` The Way Home . ''

		We find this work less interesting than its predecessors , although it is fairly their match in character delineation and subtle analysis of motive .

		It fails , perhaps , more from an obtrusive didacticism than from anything else , for the author is too evidently sitting in judg - ment upon his hero instead of leaving the reader 's decision to shape itself as the character is unfolded .


Charlie Grace	PERSON	is the son of a clergyman , and is himself intended for his father 's profession .

		But his growing manhood revolts against the hypocrisies that hedge that profession round , and his pleasure - loving instincts demand for their satisfaction a more worldly form of success .

		He goes into business and becomes materially successful , but in so doing hardens his heart toward his fellows , and does not hesitate to seize the opportunities within his grasp , building his achievement upon the failure of his rivals .

		At the climax of his selfish endeavor , he overreaches himself , and his plans are thwarted by the man whom he has supplanted .

		Married to a woman morally far too good for him , he becomes faithless to her in thought , although not in act , and is brought back to her in the end by the need of her
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 361 support when he is pulled up short in his career by a physician 's indeterminate death-sentence .

		It is thus that he finds `` the way home , '' but we doubt if he would have found it otherwise .

		There is much beautiful and impressive writing in these pages , but it smacks a little too much of the pulpit , and the process by which the hero 's soul is supposed to be saved -LRB- by a narrow squeak -RRB- too closely resembles `` conversion '' to be taken for an unimpeachable ethical regeneration .

		The American interest in `` doing things '' is chiefly responsible for the popularity of such books as Mr.
Rex Beach	PERSON	's `` The Iron Trail . ''

		The hero of this novel , an Alaskan promoter and railway contractor named
Murray O'Neil	PERSON	, is the kind of man who accomplishes his purpose , no matter what the obstacles , and the fact that physical violence and general lawlessness are resorted to as a matter of course whenever they are found necessary only endears him the more to the readers who follow his fortunes with breathless interest .

		The big thing that
O'Neil	PERSON	does is to wrest an Alaskan pass from the clutches of a rival claimant , and to carry a railway through it in the face of formidable diffi - culties .

		The difficulties are not those offered by nature alone , for in addition he has to contend with underhanded opposition , treachery , legal chicanery , and the failure of funds at the critical moment .

		It makes a big vivid story , crammed with action and sweetened with sentiment .

		Mr.
Beach	PERSON	knows his
Alaska	LOCATION	well , and can describe its terrifying aspects very effectively .

		Otherwise , his book has not much style to speak of , and does not seem to need it by reason of its surplusage of dramatic interest .

		There are two girls mixed up with the action , and
O'Neil	PERSON	, after dallying with one of them half-way through the book , shifts to the other and carries her off .

		In the course of the narrative , he has occasion to make much caustic comment upon the policy of the Inte - rior
Department	ORGANIZATION	in opposing the exploitation of Alaskan resources for private gain , and is evidently on the side of the men who go into the wilderness to win for themselves individual fortunes .

		Of course his vision is blinded by local prejudice , but he comes near to carrying our sympathies with him .

		`` Otherwise Phyllis '' is a new `` Hoosier Chron - icle , '' even richer and racier than the earlier one , which marked Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's transition from the ranks of the irresponsible entertainers to the small company of novelists who go about the exercise of their art seriously and hold it in respect .

		When we have completed the story of
Phyllis	PERSON	, we have not only made the charming acquaintance of a real girl , but we have also learned more about life in Mont - gomery ,
Indiana	LOCATION	, than several years of actual resi - dence would have been likely to impart to us .

		We know the leading citizens of the town in their private characters and in their social and business relation - ships ; we know the home ?

		, the farms , the banks , the business offices ; and we know the shady history of the
Sycamore Traction Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		The outstanding characters in this novel are Montgomerys and Holtons .

		Many years before the story opens ,
Lois Montgomery	PERSON	had married
Tom Kirkwood	PERSON	, a pro- fessor in the local college and afterwards a lawyer somewhat neglectful of his profession .

		Then
Lois	PERSON	had scandalized the community by running away with the black sheep of the Holtons , leaving her husband with a baby daughter , ' Otherwise
Phyllis	PERSON	. ''

		Later , a divorce had set Kirkwood free , and marriage with
Holton	PERSON	had regularized the social status of
Lois	PERSON	, living on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast .

		When we have got fairly well acquainted with the grown-up
Phyllis	PERSON	, which means taking her to our hearts , and when we have come to know intimately her lovable father , her three fussy and snobbish aunts , and her substantial and crusty uncle , to say nothing of various Holtons , good and bad , we are prepared for the appearance of Lois upon the scene , and the complications that follow .

		Here is where the author scores heavily , for
Lois	PERSON	does not return as the repentant sinner , begging to be forgiven , but as a level-headed woman of the world , who has long since sent the partner of her flight about his business , and who has made a large for - tune in Western investments .

		She knows that her youthful escapade was foolish , but she has long since paid the penalty for that , and thinks the world should call it square .

		There is nothing morbid or brooding about her ; she enjoys life and gets a good deal out of it ; and she returns to
Montgomery	PERSON	to see what sort of a girl her daughter has grown to be .

		She has reason to be entirely satisfied with
Phyllis	PERSON	, and the affection which she offers is returned in full measure .

		From the standpoint of
Phyllis	PERSON	, this newly-found mother is brilliant , companionable , and sympathetic , and why should she reject the love so freely offered because of those old , unhappy , far-off things that are to the girl nothing more than a misty family tradi - tion .

		The way in which Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	steers clear of sloppy sentiment in all this business deserves our profound gratitude .

		The quality of matter-of - factness attaches to this story throughout , and this is what makes its art so genuine .

		The humor of the book is particularly deft ; it is never made obtrusive , but it suffuses the entire narrative with a genial glow , and constitutes one of the chief elements of its charm .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The spiritual What a man thinks and feels and development of a believes is always so much more great Unitarian , important than what he does , that in the case of any interesting personality we would , if we could , gladly exchange the outer facts for the inner impulses .

		But to give the true story of one 's own inner life is so difficult that not often are we granted the privilege of such self-revelations .

		In ``
Charles Gordon Ames	PERSON	: A Spiritual Autobi - ography '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , we have a book of intense interest , especially for those who knew the magnetic personality of the man during his life .

		But even those who never met him , to whom even his name 862 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	may be unknown , can hardly fail to follow with keen satisfaction the charmingly written story of the development of a soul .

		Certainly , no one can read unmoved the first chapter , `` The Religion of a Boy , '' revealing what a child can suffer from being misunderstood .

		Like many another youngster , he was regarded as heedless , perverse , unfaithful ; his quickness to learn was merely a misfortune because it left him all the more time for mischief .

		Yet he was never long without serious thoughts ; there was never a day when he could not have been reached by love and sweet reasonableness .

		The chapter entitled `` How I Became a Preacher '' is scarcely less touching .

		Before he was quite eighteen years old , his fellow church-members gave him a hearing in order to determine whether his `` call to preach '' was a true one .

		He was the janitor of the church , and lighted the vestry for the occasion .

		They listened to his sermon , held a meeting afterward , and voted to approve Brother Ames in publicly '' improving his gift . ''

		His little vessel was launched and he felt himself in the ministry .

		Then followed experiences baffling enough to discourage any but the stoutest heart .


Minnesota	LOCATION	in the fifties was in its frontier stage ; hither he went , established a church , and on a salary of
two hundred dollars	MONEY	a year managed somehow to support his family , not - withstanding an expostulation from one member of his congregation on his extravagance in money matters !

		The important event of this period was a gradual change of his own religious views so great that conscience forced him to withdraw not only from the
Free Baptist Church	ORGANIZATION	of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	, which he had organized five years before , but from the denomination altogether .

		The story of the next half-century is told in the concluding chapter , called `` Fifty Years among the Unitarians . ''

		The
Epi	ORGANIZATION	- logue , written by Dr.
Ames	PERSON	's daughter ,
Alice Ames Winter	PERSON	, contributes many interesting reminiscences and some fine tributes from personal friends .

		One of these tributes characterizes him as '' the last figure of the great Unitarian group .

		There was no other quite so Emersonian .

		A hundred of his sermons were almost
Emerson	PERSON	essays .

		He had
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	's firm and quiet faith , his penetration and poetry of nature , his wit and humor and sententiousness , his gift for homely illustration , his buoyant optimism , and his democracy . ''

		Reconciling '' Tn e Meaning of Evolution '' -LRB- Mac - reltgionand inillan -RRB- , by Mr.
Samuel Christian Darwinism	PERSON	.


Schmucker	PERSON	, is a latter-day attempt at reconciling religion and Darwinism .

		According to one 's point of view such a task will be regarded as either a work of supererogation or an impossi - bility .

		Looked at either way , this particular book does not impress one as an especially strong or deep contribution .

		Its style has a bit too much of Pecksniffian unctuosity to be relished .

		Even our theological faculties of the present day demand sterner and more filling intellectual pabulum than is furnished by Mr.
Schmucker	PERSON	.

		A very dilute account of the principal factors and the course of organic evolution forms the concrete subject matter .

		From the biological side , the reviewer has not been able to discover in the book one single new idea , or even a novel development of a well-known one .

		The whole theory of the method of organic evolu - tion is just now passing through a most interesting stage of development .

		Old ideas are being criti - cized , and new ones are being tested , with such rapidity as to make it a matter of some diffi - culty even for the specialist in this field to form a just estimate of the immediate status of expert opinion about the method of evolution .

		This con - dition of affairs would seem to afford both an opportunity and a stimulus to the popular writer .

		Liveliness and life seem somehow to be related .

		How far ahead of Mr.
Schmucker	PERSON	are topics of current interest in evolution is indicated by the fact that the names of
Mendel	ORGANIZATION	,
Bergson	PERSON	,
Driesch	LOCATION	,
Galton	PERSON	, and
Karl Pearson	PERSON	are not even mentioned in his pages .

		The sole concession to modernism is a scant two pages -LRB- and a portrait -RRB- devoted to De Vries and his mutation theory .

		This discussion closes with the following truly precious thought : '' Just at present it seems premature to believe that all evolution is by mutation , although quite possibly some of it is . ''

		The personal field-observations of the author , especially some of those on birds , form the one redeeming feature of the book .

		It has been said that a nearly infallible test of a writer 's com - petency to discuss evolution is afforded by the way in which he spells the name of the most distin - guished Neo-Darwinian .

		By this test the present author fails , since throughout the text ''
Weissman	PERSON	'' is written , while curiously enough the legend of the plate facing p. 238 -LRB- presumably furnished by the publisher -RRB- correctly states that the gentlemen por - trayed is ``
August Weismann	PERSON	. ''

		As personal conductor , as lecturer , as author , he has spread the gospel of the beautiful in all parts of the land ; and his utterances , on Italian art espe - cially , are of wide acceptance .

		To these he has now added a volume on '' The Message of Greek Art '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which will well repay careful study .

		From
Winckelmann	PERSON	down , we have had many a history of Greek Art ; but they have all stuck pretty close to their text as conceived in the word `` Art . ''

		Dr. Powers apprehends that the emphasis would better be laid on `` Greek . ''

		To him , `` the subject is never dissociated in thought from its great back - ground of Greek civilization , and it derives its chief interest to the writer from the fact that it so con - stantly reveals and interprets this larger fact .

		It is therefore the message of Greek art , what it has to tell us of the Greeks , of their personality , their ideals , and their experiences , that will chiefly concern us
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 363 rather than considerations of process or later acci - dent . ''

		To this conception of his task the author generally holds true ; the result being that we have a history of
Greece	LOCATION	and one of Greek art running in parallel channels , and each explaining the other .

		A difficult undertaking ; and achieved , it must be admitted , with a high degree of success .

		Dr. Powers has never lost sight of the Greek national character as interpreted in art forms .

		Thus the curves of rosette , scroll , and cuttle-fish tentacles , so universal in Mycenaean decoration , are indicative of a gentle and effeminate civilization , just as `` the harsh zig - zags and bristling angles which marked the pottery of that civilization 's successors and conquerors reflected in its turn a more rugged and martial nature . ''

		So again , in the elaborate coiffures , frills , and edgings which ornament the draped female figures of the
Acropolis	LOCATION	, Dr. Powers sees the influ - ence of the benevolent but cramping tyranny of
Pisistratus	LOCATION	, under which true liberty was shackled and personality repressed .

		When he comes to the Great Age , it is Phidias who looms before him as a great statesman , whose life-work was to assist Pericles in making
Athens	LOCATION	imperially great , rather than that of a `` mere '' sculptor absorbed in his art .

		These are not all new views ; but we have never seen them urged so eagerly and eloquently .

		Dr. Powers writes with an enthusiasm which is more of a challenge than an appeal ; his style is high-colored , and rich in epigram and colloquialisms .

		Occasion - ally he forgets his perspective , as in his extended discussion of the nade in art , and his invective against some of the yardstick critics and Philistines who are found even in studios and lecture-rooms .

		The book is fascinating throughout ; but , like other fascinating books of criticism , must be read with some reserves .

		The 137 illustrations are beautiful and well-chosen ; some of them reproducing statues which we have not seen in other works of the kind , e. ff. , the
Vatican Eros	ORGANIZATION	and the
Boston Zeus	LOCATION	.

		In speaking of the marble copies of
Polyclitus	ORGANIZATION	's
Hera	LOCATION	, the fine head found by the
American School	ORGANIZATION	at
Argos	ORGANIZATION	, and now in
Athens	LOCATION	, is rather oddly omitted .

		A few misprints should be noted : ``
Lybia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- p 41 -RRB- , `` Colonnus '' -LRB- p. 128 -RRB- , `` properous '' -LRB- p. 129 -RRB- , `` cor - alled '' -LRB- p. 210 -RRB- .

		A high-spirited daughter of the Con - federacy has left a vivacious record of harrowing war-time experiences in a volume now published by her son after her death , and entitled by him `` A Confederate Girl 's Diary '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .


Sarah Morgan	PERSON	, afterward Mrs.
Sarah Morgan Dawson	PERSON	, as her name appears on the title - page , was the daughter of Judge
Thomas Gibbes Morgan	PERSON	of
Baton Rouge	LOCATION	; and it was at or near
Baton Rouge	LOCATION	and
New Orleans	LOCATION	that she lived through such times as may well have tried men 's souls , to say noth - ing of women 's .

		Her diary , begun in the
spring of 1862	DATE	as a distraction from the glooms and horrors of the period , extends to the
summer of 1865	DATE	, and is necessarily devoted mostly to the minor and nearer happenings in the writer 's little world .

		But as death and disaster visited her home and neighborhood in the progress of the war , she developed a cordial hatred of the Yankees and expressed herself vigor - ously in denunciation of their atrocities .

		`` And this is WAR ! ''

		she writes on an early page .

		`` Heaven save me from like scenes and experiences again . ''

		There was worse to come , however .

		Her description of the wrecked and pillaged homestead at
Baton Rouge	LOCATION	is moving indeed .

		In her satirical thrusts at `` good , kind General Butler '' we see her laughing through her tears .

		Her account , as an eye-witness , of the burning of the Confederate vessel ''
Arkansas	LOCATION	'' by her crew after her machinery had broken down , in order to prevent her capture by the '' Essex , '' would seem to throw new light on what has hitherto been accepted as a Federal victory .

		As the production of a young girl of little formal education , the diary is surprisingly vivid and vigorous in its style .

		Writ - ten often in the hurry and panic of perilous times , it maintains a certain unstudied finish of manner that is remarkable .

		Mr.
Warrington Dawson	PERSON	, the diar - ist 's son , who transcribed the faded pages for publi - cation , gives assurance that he has altered nothing , only omitted a few passages of purely personal or family interest .

		He has furnished the book with a biographical introduction , and there are portraits and other illustrative material .

Egbert Bryant	PERSON	, Associate scholar .

		Professor of English in the
Univer	LOCATION	- sity of
Kansas	LOCATION	, entitled `` The History of English Balladry , and Other Studies '' -LRB- Badger -RRB- , brings together a notable group of essays on subjects con - nected with the English language and literature .

		The title-essay is the outgrowth of a doctoral thesis at
Harvard	LOCATION	, and presents a valuable account of the emergence of the English ballad in early times , and of its development through the reign of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	.

		Wise and deep scholarship are reflected here in a study which , although uncompleted , will be of con - stant service to students in this field .

		It is unfor - tunate that the proofreading has not been done by someone familiar with
Middle English	LOCATION	, for there are instances in which thorn and the letter p have been sadly confused .

		The second essay , on Less - ing 's `` LaocoOn , '' was printed in
1906	DATE	, at the Uni - versity of
Michigan	LOCATION	, and has already received praise from eminent authorities in
America	LOCATION	and in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		A clear and penetrating analysis is made of Less - ing 's dicta regarding Description , and his inconsis - tencies are laid bare ; then the essay goes on , progressively , building up a theory of Description which contains matter very suggestive to students of this subject .

		As an instance of acute application of the newer views of psychological aesthetics , this study deserves close attention , especially from young teachers .

		The brief papers that form the latter part of the volume are connected with subjects linguistic and phonetic , appealing chiefly to the specialist , although the study of '' Conservation in Language '' 364 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	will engage the interest of any thoughtful reader .

		The loss that American scholarship has suffered in Professor
Bryant	PERSON	's death at the outset of his career is a loss that can be ill-sustained .

		We need , very greatly , just such scholars , quiet , profound , and tireless in their scrutiny of facts and of theories .

		Sound knowledge , combined with power of resist - ance to conventional dogma and a tenacious skill in penetrating to the centre of matters , character - ized the work of Dr.
Bryant	PERSON	.

		With years of study under leaders at
Michigan	LOCATION	, at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and at
Harvard	LOCATION	, with experience in libraries abroad , and with the prestige of work already noted in high places , he was equipped to enter upon a life of unusually vital scholarship .

		This volume is a significant contribu - tion to our library of critical investigation in the field of English .

		New gleanings The volume entitled `` A Pilgrimage from the prose of Pleasure : Essays and Studies '' of
Swinburne	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Badger -RRB- by
Algernon Charles Swin	PERSON	- burne is made up of gleanings from the scattered prose writings of the poet .

		Some of the eight num - bers included the `` Dead Love '' of
1862	DATE	, the essay on
Dickens	PERSON	published in the `` Quarterly Re - view , ''
1902	DATE	, and '' An Unknown Poet -LSB- Wells -RSB- '' pub - lished in the `` Fortnightly Review , ''
1875	DATE	are not so difficult of access as to make the present reprint a particular boon , but for the others we may well be grateful , as for the full bibliography that has been prepared by Mr.
Edward J. O'Brien	PERSON	. ''

		A Pilgrimage of Pleasure '' is taken from `` The Children of the Chapel , '' a tale by Mrs.
Disney Leith	PERSON	, published in
1864	DATE	.

		It is a morality , accepted as
Swinburne	ORGANIZATION	's by most of the bibliographical specialists , and in our opinion bearing the sign manual of the poet upon almost every line .

		It exhibits
Swinburne	PERSON	's uncanny imitative powers as unmistakably as any of the pieces in the first '' Poems and Ballads '' or as the border ballads of a later date .

		The critical essay on Bau - delaire and the note on
Meredith	PERSON	's `` Modern Love '' may both be found in the files of the `` Spectator '' for
1862	DATE	, but we are glad that we no longer have to resort to that source to read them .

		The
Baude	PERSON	- laire essay , indeed , belongs with
Swinburne	PERSON	's most finished critical studies .

		The notes on
Simeon Solomon	PERSON	are dated
1871	DATE	, come from a forgotten ephemeral periodical , `` The Dark Blue , '' and call our attention to a forgotten artist , whom even a Swinburnian eulogy has not been sufficient to save from oblivion .

		Much the same may be said of
John Nichol	PERSON	's '' Hannibal , '' which the poet eulogized in the '' Fortnightly Review '' for
1872	DATE	.

		The chief interest for us of Mr.
O'Brien	PERSON	's bibliography is the revelation which it affords of the great number of fugitive items , existing only in private editions of twenty copies or less , which the general reader has no chance of seeing .

		Surely something must be done to make these things accessible .

		We note that the bibliographer gives recognition to THE DIAL for being the first to publish two of
Swinburne	LOCATION	's poems -LRB- vol .

		w ju also welcome is `` In Music Land '' -LRB-
Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by the veteran musical critic , Mr.
George P. Upton	PERSON	.

		Its purpose is to introduce the reader to an acquaintance with the life-stories of the great composers , with the origin and structure of the most popular forms of musical composition , and with the chief musical instruments used by the orchestra and the special qualities of each as mediums of conveying musical thoughts and feelings .

		Precisely such a work as this , so entirely free from technicalities , has not been undertaken before ; and Mr.
Upton	PERSON	is precisely the man best fitted to have written it .

		For not only does he understand and love music , but he understands and loves children ; and we venture to guess that ''
Dorothy	PERSON	'' and the others to whom the stories are told regard him as quite one of themselves .

		In the twelve biographies beginning with
Bach	PERSON	and ending with
Verdi	PERSON	, perhaps the most notable fact brought out by the writer is the almost invariable sadness and harshness of these musicians ' childhoods .

		Men - delssohn seems almost the only exception .

		Com - menting on this , Mr.
Upton	PERSON	philosophizes thus : `` Perhaps that is one reason why his music is always graceful , refined , and beautiful , though it is not as great as that of the composers who have suffered ... When Elf-Land seems far away , and the leaves are falling , and the sky grows gray , you will turn to the greater masters . ''

		Discussing the
Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	and its instruments , the author is partic - ularly happy in his characterizations .

		For example , the harp is called '' the hermit thrush of the family because it is a lovely singer ... the only one that has got into Heaven ... the favorite of the angels . ''

		The `` Postlude '' is eloquent , and surely should do much to banish from the youthful mind the tendency to regard the study of music as drudgery , or , at best , a mere frill to more serious pursuits .

		`` It is the one art which above all others enhances the joy of the world , the one which above all others inspires to action , the one above all others which rests you when weary , which consoles you when sor - rowful ... No other labor brings such rich spiritual compensation or abundant pleasure . ''

		Many quaint illustrations by Mr.
James Bloomfield	PERSON	help to make this volume a particularly choice gift for all , young or old , who seek elementary musical knowledge .

three years later	DATE	, and very soon afterward to show him - self as capable a disciplinarian and commanding officer as he had been daring and resourceful in defying authority .

		His `` Autobiography '' -LRB- Scrib -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 365 ner -RRB- , written at last in his seventy-sixth year with the natural reluctance of a man of distinguished achievement to talk about his deeds , and only pro- duced at the repeated solicitation of friends , as his preface duly sets forth , gives with conciseness , and yet in a style that proves highly readable , the main facts of his ancestry , education , naval experience under Farragut at
New Orleans	LOCATION	and his later ser - vice in the Civil War , in the course of which he was the executive officer of nine successive ships , his part in the building of our modern navy , his appointment to the command of the Asiatic squad - ron , the battle of
Manila Bay	LOCATION	and the complex responsibilities imposed upon the victor immediately thereafter , and the chief events of his later peaceful years .

		In his account of the naval operations directed by
Farragut	LOCATION	, of the subsequent assault on
Fort Fisher	ORGANIZATION	under Admiral
Porter	PERSON	's leadership , and of the operations that ended in the complete destruc - tion of the Spanish squadron at
Manila	LOCATION	, there is no lack of movement and thrill .

		Appended documents treat of details in the important occurrences in
the Philippines	LOCATION	during those critical months of
1898	DATE	.

		Pictures of war vessels and portraits of their officers abound .

		A confusing error in dates occurs -LRB- p. 205 -RRB- in the account of movements immediately preceding the battle of
Manila Bay	LOCATION	.

		Otherwise , with few exceptions , the book shows evidence of adequate care in its preparation , for which indebtedness is acknowledged to Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	.

		One who sided with the under dog .

		The late
Edward A. Moseley	PERSON	,
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- retary of the
Interstate Commerce Commission	ORGANIZATION	from its organization in
1887	DATE	until his death in
1911	DATE	, was a whole-hearted champion of the defenceless employee whose occupa - tion exposed him to peculiar risks resulting in loss of life or limb .

		His part in securing the passage of the first safety-appliance act and the employers ' liability act , with other services to his fellow-men , is well and fully told by Mr.
James Morgan	PERSON	, a close friend of his for many years , in a substantial volume entitled `` The Life Work of
Edward A. Moseley	PERSON	in the Service of Humanity '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Though the son of a wealthy father and belonging by birth to the aristocracy of
Newburyport	LOCATION	,
Moseley	PERSON	was a democrat at heart , a strenuous toiler by choice , and always the true friend of the people , with whom he mingled unaffectedly all his life .

		A year 's experience as a common sailor under the harshest of captains and with the roughest of shipmates had early proved of what stuff he was made .

		Characteristic of the man was his organizing of a strike among the work - men of his own firm , in order to have a pretext for raising their wages .

		The book abounds in similar instances of disinterested endeavor , usually success - ful , to improve the condition of the laboring classes .

		Extracts from his correspondence and from other documents of interest are inserted here and there .

		A link connecting Mr.
Moseley	PERSON	with the literary world is found in his relationship to Mrs.
Harriet Prescott Spofford	PERSON	, whose sister he married , and with whom he and his family maintained terms of inti - macy .

		Portraits , views , appended matter , and index round out the book 's equipment as a well-executed piece of work .

		Her `` Picture Tales from Welsh Hills '' -LRB-
Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- consists of nine stories and sketches abounding in rapid portraiture of Welsh character and customs , Welsh oddities and superstitions , Welsh habits of thought and speech .

		In the opening story , `` The Madness of
Winifred Owen	PERSON	, '' the heroine rids her - self of the attentions of an unwelcome lover by taking a subtle poison that renders her temporarily insane , and afterward marries the man of her choice .

		The longest tale in the book , `` The Way He Went , '' gives the history of a phenomenally intellectual country lad who achieves an Oxford education , grieves his mother by taking to wife a girl not of his own country , and dies an early death .

		A sketch entitled `` Comic Objects of the Country '' presents in amusing form the impressions of a
London	LOCATION	gamin on being sent to an industrial school in rural

		Even the minor characters are made to stand out in dis - tinct shape by a skilful stroke or two of the pen , as the schoolmaster
Macpherson	PERSON	, `` whose career had been checked by a moral scrape of his youth , '' and whose ambition , `` under the slur of it , had finally settled down to the lifelong position of an assistant master , manufacturing brilliant products rather than shining as one himself . ''

		Some aberrations in the writer 's English , perhaps attributable to the con - tagious influence of the Welsh idiom , will be noted here and there by a critical reader , who will grieve at
Miss Thomas	LOCATION	's unabashed use of `` enthuse , '' without apologetic quotation marks , and at her dis - regard of a good old rule of grammar in speaking of `` the unkindest cut of the two . ''

EDITH WHARTON	PERSON	Has Achieved Another Great Triumph in Her New Novel THE CUSTOM of the COUNTRY Leading reviewers place it beside `` The House of Mirth '' ; Declare it `` Triumphant Fiction '' ; `` A Graphic Picture of Modern Life '' ; `` Undine Spragg a Memorable Figure . ''

		Chicago Record - Herald : '' ' The Custom of the Country ' must take its place beside ' The
House of Mirth	ORGANIZATION	' as representing Mrs.
Wharton	PERSON	's art at its best .

		The novel is written with a flashing vivacity of phrase , crisp dialogue and entire naturalness of character - ization .

		All the people are ` alive , but
Undine Spragg	PERSON	is memorable ; it would not be surprising , indeed , if her name became a synonym for the modern American type of Becky Sharp . ''

		New York Herald : '' Apart from its quality of inter - est , ' The Custom of the Country ' possesses a distinct value as a graphic picture of modern life both here and abroad , written by an ex - perienced pen from an entirely new point of view .

		It contains several excellent character sketches , the best of which , to my mind , are the fashionable portrait painter , Pop - ple , and the equally fashionable masseuse , Mrs.
Heeny	PERSON	. ''


Chicago	LOCATION	Tribune : '' It is a brilliant though a sinister performance .

		Boston Transcript : '' That he does know many , many phases of man 's inmost na - ture , his latest story clearly reveals .

		It discards all the old conventions , it upsets some of our most sacred moral traditions , it throws aside all commonplaces of fiction .

		But it is nevertheless the truth , and it is the truth that we want , especially in the novel . ''

		Chicago Evening Post : ''
John Galsworthy	PERSON	's new novel is daring in the true sense . ''

		He has set out boldly to show us passion : not scenes of passion , but something that goes more directly against the grain of our decadent Victorianism and quite directly against that of our efflores - cent Reformism , the power of passion . ''

		`` For words are but wise men 's counters , they do but reckon by them ; but they are the money of fools . ''

		Good old
Thomas Hobbes	PERSON	was one of the wisest of men , and one of those least likely to find in a word anything more than its natural significance , and yet it may be questioned whether he were not himself betrayed or deluded into a strained interpretation of the very word which supplies a title for the great treatise upon political philosophy in which this famous dictum occurs .

		If he once crystallize into a metaphor some vast central concept , the keenest of thinkers will be unconsciously influ - enced by its accidental connotations , and find himself in danger of taking it too literally .

		The figurative habit of mind will play tricks with the best intelligence , and such terms as `` levia - than '' and `` behemoth '' lend themselves too easily to forced extensions of analogy beyond what is legitimate .

		The conception of society as an organism has its working uses , but it may , if not kept under strict subordination to fact , lead to the wildest vagaries of fancy .

		There is something marvellous in the power of words to direct thought , and if we do not go so far as
Max Miiller	PERSON	in declaring that thought without words is impossible , we must at least admit our dependence on them for all but the most ele - mentary mental processes .

		To keep them our servants , instead of permitting them to become our masters , requires a degree of vigilance of which few intellects are completely capable .

		They are lurking in all the corners of the mind , seeking to instil prejudice into our reasoning , and persuading us into taking the short cuts that will spare us the difficult task of analysis .

		It was a wiser man than Hobbes who em - bodied in diabolical argument the quintessence of intellectual cynicism when he made
Mephis	PERSON	- topheles thus advise the inquiring student : '' Im ganzen haltet euch an Worte !

		Dann geht ihr durch die sichre
Pforte Zum Tempel	ORGANIZATION	der Gewissheit ein .

		Denn eben wo Begriffe fehlen , Da Stellt ein Wort zur rechten Zeit sich ein .

		Mit Worten lasst sich trefflich streiten ,
Mit Worten	LOCATION	ein System bereiten , An Worte lasst sich trefflich glauben , Von einem Wort lasst sich kein Iota rauben . ''

		How the history of thought is strewn with ex - amples of this precept in practical application !

		394 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	Science , philosophy , ethics , politics , and theology afford countless illustrations of the use of words as current coin , in forgetf ulness of the fact that they are but the counters shaped by the intellect for its own uses .

		Such words as `` vitalism , '' `` determinism , '' `` hedonism , '' and `` protection - ism '' are charged with infinite possibilities of mischievous employment , and have arrayed intellectual squadrons against one another in mortal combat .

		In the case of words in the armory of theology , the combat has been phy - sical , deluging the world with blood , as the wars of religion eloquently witness .

		Think of the malignant power of words as exemplified in the way in which the partisans of homoousion have cut the throats of the partisans of homoiousion , or in the armies that have taken the field in the defence of , and in opposition to , the doctrine of transubstantiation , or even in the conflicts that have been waged in behalf of some demonstrable mistranslation of a Scriptural passage .

		Such words have been something considerably more than counters in a game of wits .

		In the world of to-day , catch-words and epi - thets which are verbalized prejudices play an active part in muddling men 's minds , and enlist - ing the unthinking in behalf of causes which they would abhor were their concealed implica - tions once made visible .

		The most wild-eyed and subversive measure has only to be labeled with the word '' reform '' or '' progress '' to win the suffrage of that large section of the multi - tude to whom the new thing is the desirable thing .

		Of course all sensible people believe in reform and progress , and proposals which really mean deformation and retrogression find ready acceptance in the minds of thousands whose vision is blinded , and whose faculty of analysis is paralyzed by a single persuasive and question - begging word .

		The term '' Socialism '' is made a blanket to cover all sorts of aims , worthy and unworthy , and those who use it as a watchword are skilful in coating the pill of its sinister significance with the sugar of a sentiment which can not fail to appeal to all generous hearts .

		In this country , we cover the iniquities of the alli - ance between government and special privilege with the smooth word '' protectionism , '' and the evil thing is almost impregnably intrenched behind that innocent and high-sounding word .

		In
England	LOCATION	, on the other hand , the same bad cause is already half-won by the naive device of calling it '' fair trade '' and `` tariff reform . ''

		Many people -LRB- who have votes -RRB- never get beyond that label .

		They say , `` If a thing is ` fair ' and a measure of ' reform , ' of course we favor it , '' and they have no thought of probing its real meaning .

		`` Temperance '' is one of the most seductive of words , and yet what mean oppres - sions are committed in its name ! ''

		The rights of man '' is a mighty phrase with which to con - jure , yet under its aegis the French Revolution developed into a carnival of crime at which the world has not ceased to shudder .

		In an article on '' Language , Action , and Belief , '' Mr.
J. C. Thomas	PERSON	, in the
October	DATE	issue of '' Bedrock , '' discusses the mischievous power of words in the field of science .

		Speaking of ideas and beliefs , he says : '' These mental elements are materialized in language , the words of which form their discrete bodies .

		Within these verbal embodiments man has imprisoned , distorted , and tortured the ' ideal soul , ' which in revenge has retaliated by making speech a fertile and a perennial source of falsity in every department of thought .

		But it is in connection with beliefs that language has in - flicted upon humanity the full blight of its curse .

		Beliefs are our springs of conduct our very guides in life hence our weal and woe are bound up indissolubly with our opinions and our creed . ''

		It matters nothing that there exists no reality cor - responding to the idea which is the basis of belief ; for that reality can be made to exist in the language which communicates it , by the simple device of coining terms and phrases which assume such existence .

		And these verbal embodiments have greater power of generating belief than even sense-impressions .

		A Roman youth found no difficulty in believing that
Jupiter	ORGANIZATION	and Juno were real beings , for they were real beings in the language which conveyed to him the ideas . ''

		The writer then goes on to say that '' we live in an age when language is strained to its utter - most to suggest and to engender belief in the untrue and the unreal . ''

		Taking for his special text the term '' psychical research , '' he points out that its content is not psychical and its method is not that of research in any scientific sense . ''

		Its nomenclature is a new coinage , bright from the mint , and specially struck off for the use of the Society -LSB- for
Psychical Research	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- .

		It includes amongst others the terms : clairvoyance , clairaudieiice , astral-stage , psychic-force , telepathy , second-sight , levitation , auto - matic writing , rematerialization , double-sight , super - normal , thought-reading , and thought-transference every one of which is a question-begging epithet ; that is , its function is simply and solely to insinuate beliefs in ideas and not to store or revive them . ''

		Call it by its proper name , `` occult '' or `` magi - cal , '' and the charm would vanish , for then it would stand on its own merits , and its cause would not be prejudged by its vocabulary .

		At the present day , the work of education is being thoroughly demoralized by the obsession of the word `` vocational '' and its countless derivative phrases , such as `` practical educa - tion '' and '' training for life . ''

		Call Greek and Latin `` dead '' languages , and their defence
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 395 becomes hopeless against minds for whom the word is a coin and not a counter .

		Let the dead past bury its dead , and let us store the youthful mind with useful knowledge about farming and book-keeping and the art of advertising .

		The ultimate aims of education are clean forgotten , and only its immediate material aims are pursued .

		The old cultural ideal is a `` fetish , '' and we know that a fetish is an object of ridicule to all sensible persons .

		We are calling all sorts of things fetishes now - adays , including the most precious and hard - won conquests of civilization .

		Mr.
Jesse Macy	PERSON	has just declared : '' We must cease to worship as a fetish a written Constitution whose framers knew it to be inadequate and defective , '' and Mr.
Felix Adler	PERSON	said the other day of that document : '' We have indulged in a kind of fetish worship of it , as if that remarkable in - strument had been directly revealed from on high . ''

		Now if ever the speech and gesture of fetish worship were justifiable , they would be so in the face of the ominous and scatter - brained attacks upon the Constitution that figure so largely in current political discussion .

		There are times when , as we remarked in our last issue , it is necessary to use exaggeration and over-emphasis in defence of a cause that is menaced by the sort of insidious and un - principled warfare now waged - * against the noblest work of political construction achieved in modern times .

		We may find morality itself characterized as a fetish before long in fact , that is what
Nietzsche	PERSON	has practically done , to the admiration of ingenuous iconoclasm all over the world .

		And pending the universal accept - ance of that belief , we have endless novelists and dramatists who are seeing to it that no specific virtue escapes being held up to ridicule as an outworn fetish of religion or ethics in the totem - pole stage of its evolution .

		Let the vices take the place of the virtues as the objects of our worship ; they are likely to furnish a far more popular pantheon .


Schopenhauer	PERSON	says some - where that if a child be taken early enough , and taught to say Mumbo - Jumbo with firmness and conviction a sufficient number of times , nothing that he learns later in life will shake his belief in that omnipotent spirit .

		Similarly , if we build up the association of `` fetish '' with any or all of these things on which
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	counselled us to think , we shall readily so great is the maleficent power of a word find better furniture for our minds , metal more attractive for the hommes sensuels moyens that most of us are .

		ON EDUCATION .

		Great nations at great epochs of their life think little of education .

		At such times the theory of doing things gives place to the art of doing things .

		Every man springs to his post , a wave of enthusi - asm and inspiration rolls over the land , great deeds are done , great arts and literatures are born , all , as it were , on the spur of the moment .

		For a state to be over-concerned , to make a special fuss , about education , is almost a confession that the generation which is on the stage at the moment is of little account , and that the only hope is to prepare a new one which may amount to something .

		America is paying a great deal of attention to education to-day , Are we willing to accept this depreciatory estimate of ourselves ?

		If , instead of spending so large a part of our income in educating for the future , we were to put some of the money into rewarding great and notable deeds , encouraging art and literature , erecting beautiful buildings , and laying out healthful parks and towns , it would be better both for us in the present and for the genera - tions to come .

		It is less important to educate ten thousand Philistines than to develop one great poet , artist , or thinker for humanity .

		Probably the present agitation and activity in the educational field are largely due to woman 's increasing influ - ence in affairs .

		Women rarely believe in their hus - bands , but they always think their children are going to set the world afire .

		However , we must take things as they are ; and it is worth while to try to assess a little what is being done in education , to review the main ideas and tendencies of our time in that respect .

		We have been reading lately a book entitled `` Culture , Discipline , and Democracy '' by Dr.
A. Duncan Yocum	PERSON	of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a really admirable work , but it is perhaps too calm in its closely reasoned argument to attract the attention it deserves .

		If Dr.
Yocum	PERSON	had any single panacea to propose to mankind .

		if , like
Rousseau	PERSON	, he rushed out into the streets crying `` Back to Nature ! ''

		or like some modern propagandists , `` Back to the land ! ''

		; or if , on the other hand , he preached the study of Sci - ence or any cultural discipline as a cure-all for our ills , he would be move likely , we believe , to have a large following .

		But he tries to hold a balance between all the elements that enter into life or the preparation for life .

		He gives a view of the present status in educational matters , and shows the lessen - ing confidence in formal discipline , the increasing demand for direct preparation for life .

		He thinks the latter the more certain of the two .

		He makes an analysis of formal or general discipline , and the conditions favorable to it .

		He admits the compara - tive uselessness of the old disciplinary subjects , the classics and mathematics , for the average scheme of life .

		As regards the classics , we think he is mainly right ; because the rise of modern languages and lit - eratures and the re-discovery of Asiatic literatures 396 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	and philosophies have disturbed the old balance of power in knowledge .

		He harks back , then , to the interdependence of culture and direct preparation for life , and has some most wise remarks about the folly of attempting to develop artistic expression at the expense of aesthetic appreciation .

		In the end he decides that a dominating system of education must be ensured primarily through direct prepara - tion , and secondarily through specialization .

		The `` old '' education and the `` new '' must be complemen - tary .

		Either one of them has been enough for the wits of youth in the past , we do n't know how they are going to stagger on under the burden of both .

		Masters of pedagogy are perhaps like doctors who think more of the colored drugs in their bottles than of the constitutions of their patients .


Intel	ORGANIZATION	- lectually men are so different .

		They differ as the fibre and grain of the trees in the wood do .

		Some trees cut up into timber which will bear great strain ; some have a density and beauty of marking which fit them for polish and adornment ; some are only good for firewood .

		Or they differ like the crystals of the rock in weight , color , lustre , and value .

		Men , trees , and crystals all bear witness to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	's inexorable demand for an aristocracy .

		If we could only arrive at a system of education penetrating enough to detect these differences of quality in the youth of our race , flexible enough to fit each human being for his proper occupation , and opulent enough to give him a chance at it , then there would be little to complain about .

		We do not in the least mean that these differences in quality in mortals go by classes , that the rich and the poor differ as fine and coarse .

		On the contrary , the precious gifts of the intellect are scattered pretty evenly through the whole structure of society .

		It follows that a large percentage of those who go through our universities and institutions of learning are educated far beyond their wits ; while innumerable potential scholars , inventors , artistic creators , among the poor , do not get the education which would be good for them .

		We confine real education to the intellectual qualities because , like physical health and strength , the moral qualities of man courage , endurance , sympathy , goodness are so instinctive , so widely diffused , that they can hardly be considered sub - jects of education at all .

		They are in widest com - monalty spread .

		Of course they may be the better for organization , may be intensified by religious training ; but every man who has gone through the usual experiences of life , every woman who has borne children or earned her living , has put forth some of the highest qualities of our nature .

		We live in the thick of heroes and heroines .

		Though we only realize this when some crisis occurs , when some girl telegraphist sticks to her post in the face of a flood , or some
Marconi	ORGANIZATION	operator goes down in his ship calling for help , yet the response to duty is so general and so ready that in this respect there is hardly a pin 's - point of difference between ninety per cent of the members of the human race , edu - cated or uneducated .

		Of course different races and classes do vary in their ideas of morality and duty , but the primal instincts are everywhere the same .

		It is with the intellectual aptitudes , therefore , that culture and preparation must deal .

		And there are two methods : education and training .

		To educate is to educe , to draw out all the inherent capabilities of the student , to make him many-sided , refined , polished .

		To train is to inform him , exercise him , and make him efficient in one direction , usually that he may be able to earn his living by the practice of his profession , trade , or calling .

		The great mass of our youth , even if they had the ability , simply can not give the time to cover both kinds of culture .

		They must choose one or the other .

		Even with stu - dents in the higher professions , the two courses can seldom be run together .

		Lawyers are acute but nar - row .

		Clergymen lack many-sidedness and knowl - edge of life .

		Doctors are apt to be materialists .

		For a hundred years in
America	LOCATION	, education , an - swering the democratic demand , has tried to give everyone a sip at all the fountains of knowledge .

		It has tried to give all the people an even chance .

		Of course with the time at the disposal of the great majority of students , anything like thoroughness has been impossible .

		And we have found out that this slight taste of many kinds of knowledge is about the worst possible preparation for the struggle of life .

		We have found out that it does not pay to try to educate fifty million prospective Presidents of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The demand for vocational train - ing , therefore , has sprung up and is becoming daily more and morte irresistible .

		Vocational training is a step towards the institu - tion of caste .

		It can not hope to produce whole men , men open to every influence of nature and life and art , capable of the profoundest appreciation of the work of the past , of the greatest joy in the ex - istence of the present , of the best planning for the future .

		The vocationalized or specialized man is bound to be more or less of a machine , driving at his own ends and oblivious of a great part of that which makes life worth living .

		But perhaps caste is a shade better than chaos .

		Once in the world a community of free men was really educated .

		The Athenian youth entered the gymnasium at an early age .

		He recited the works of Homer and Hesiod and the lyric poets .

		He learned music and the use of the lyre .

		He lived in the shadow of marble palaces and temples , and the statues of gods and goddesses looked down upon him to lure him on to rival their beauty .

		He took part in processionals and festivals .

		His body was trained in all athletic exercises , and he saw or contended in the great games of
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Growing older , he walked and talked with the philosophers and teachers of wisdom , under their porches or in the open air .

		He haunted the law courts , and heard the orators dis - cuss public questions and affairs of state .

		He gath - ered with the whole mass of his fellow-citizens in the great open-air theatre , and saw imaged forth the mighty myths of his race , its historic triumphs , or
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE JD1AL 397 the personages of the day in a guise of wit and satire .

		Then , at the call of battle , he took his place in the ranks of the hoplites , or light-armed troops , and fought for his country .

		If , as was probable , he had estates in the archipelago or Asian mainland he made voyages thither and saw strange lands and peoples .

		But all this was possible only because the twenty thousand freeman of
Athens	LOCATION	held in leash a hundred thousand slaves to do their work for them and give them leisure to be forever running about telling some new thing .

		They could indulge in the wittiest gossip , the divinest speculations of philos - ophy , the production of perfect works of art and literature , because they were not compelled to do anything else .

		Under conditions of life in
America	LOCATION	, the best we can hope to do will be , as the English statesman said , `` to muddle through . ''

		It strikes us that in the end vocational education will be fatal to Democracy .

		It will leave all higher culture to the few who have wealth and leisure , or who have force and determi - nation enough to acquire it in spite of circumstances .

		Fortunately , genius , whose flowering seems to be the one certain purpose of life , is usually strong enough to force its way up through the hardest and most barren soil ; though doubtless it flourishes best where the ground is prepared to nourish and dis - P av lt '

		CASUAL COMMENT .

London	LOCATION	would have been starved .

		But fine weather set in next day with a heavy rain . ''

		At a much later period , little more than a month before he died , we find dashes of humor , of a subtler and rarer flavor , in a letter to the congenial friend of his old age ,
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	.

		Here is a random passage , again touching on things meteorological : `` I agree with your boys in being glad that you did not have the chance to see and feel a
West India	LOCATION	hurricane .

		Even the sight of cows and chickens carried through the air would not make up for the horror of such an extravagant exhibition of the powers of nature .

		I do not like these noisy , violent convulsions of such uncontrollable forces .

		I feel as old Dr.
Popkin	PERSON	did in regard to the character of the Greek tragedies , ' They are too horrible . '

		He liked to see , as he said , everybody peaceful and happy , and I like to see Nature in her calm and beautiful moods rather than in her passionate excesses . ''

		Calm and beautiful are the moods in which
Norton	PERSON	wrote his letters , and his wit and humor glow with a gentle radiance , never coruscate in blinding flashes .

		THE BIRTH OF A NEW WORD , when the new word supplies a real need , is cause for rejoicing ; but the careless introduction into the language of barbarous or hybrid or otherwise philologically objectionable terms is a thing to be deprecated .

		An offender already familiar to many is the verb `` enthuse , '' which is being more and more freely used in both a neuter and an active sense .

		In a late number of `` The Newarker '' occurs this sentence : `` They were stimulated and enthused by their communion with the live thinkers and workers of the world . ''

		A noteworthy publication of the season , Patience
Pennington	PERSON	's `` A Woman Rice Planter , '' which , even without its highly commendatory introduction from Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	's pen , would win its way in the world , has at least one of its fair pages dis - figured with this vulgarism , used in all deliberation and seriousness ; and the otherwise admirable `` Picture Tales from
Welsh Hills	LOCATION	, '' by Miss
Bertha Thomas	PERSON	, cools the cordiality of our welcome by giv - ing its sanction to this misbegotten monster of a word .

		Why it is to be called misbegotten will be made plain by a little reflection or a brief study of the dictionary .

		Enthusiasm -LRB- or , in
Greek	LOCATION	, enthou - siasmos -RRB- is connected with the Greek verb enthou - siazein ; and the corresponding English verb , if we must have it , would be enthusiaze , just as we have dogmatize , from the Greek dogmatixein .

		To dog - mat would be just as allowable as to enthuse ; and if we permit ourselves to enthuse and to be enthused , why should we not ecstase our neighbors and be ecstased by them ?

		But the truth is , there is no call for any of these grotesque absurdities .

		We have the verbs , stimulate , animate , kindle , excite , electrify ; and we have no need of enthuse .

		Never - theless , it has already secured a foothold in the language , and it would be safe to predict its unquali - fied recognition in the next edition of `` Webster . ''

		THE DEATH OF MRS.
SAMUEL J. BARROWS	PERSON	,
October 25	DATE	, calls renewed attention to her recent admirable biography of her husband , whose death preceded hers by four years and six months .

		`` A Sunny Life '' is such a book as any man might be proud to have dedicated to his memory .

		Mrs. Bar - 398 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	rows was a remarkable woman .

		She was born at
Irasburg	LOCATION	,
Vt.	LOCATION	,
April 17 , 1845	DATE	; was educated at the
Adams Academy	ORGANIZATION	,
Derry	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	, studied medicine in
New York	LOCATION	,
Leipzig	LOCATION	, and
Vienna	LOCATION	, and for a while practiced as an oculist .

		But journalism and other literary work drew her from her first profession into the ranks of writers .

		She was the first woman stenog - rapher ever employed by the
State Department	ORGANIZATION	at
Washington	LOCATION	; she also served as phonographic sec - retary of the
National Prison Association	ORGANIZATION	, and for seventeen years as secretary of the
Lake Mohonk Conference	ORGANIZATION	and editor of its publications .

		For twenty years she assisted her husband in the editorship of `` The Christian Register , ''
Boston	LOCATION	, and at different times contributed editorials to `` The Independent , '' `` The Outlook , '' the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post , '' `` The Survey , '' and `` other journals .

		With Mr.
Bar	PERSON	- rows she wrote `` The Shay backs in Camp , '' that early and still unsurpassed example of back-to-nature lit - erature .

		And with all these activities she found time to be a wife and mother ; in fact , she was twice married , first at eighteen to
William Wilberforce Chapin	PERSON	, a missionary in
India	LOCATION	, who died
two years later	DATE	, and then , in
1867	DATE	, to
Samuel June Barrows	PERSON	, whose record of manifold and notable achievement it was her privilege and pleasure to make public in `` A Sunny Life . ''

		THE FUTURE OF ENGLAND 'S ACADEMIC COM - MITTEE , , which has bravely survived the jests and sarcasms directed against it at the time of its forma - tion in the
summer of 1910	DATE	, looks bright to Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, himself not the least eminent mem - ber of that body .

		In the current `` Edinburgh Review '' he begins an article on `` The Foundation of the French Academy '' with a few words on the similar but much younger institution in his own country , of which he says that '' now , for more than three years , without claiming any excessive publicity , this
Academic Committee	ORGANIZATION	, founded for the protection and encouragement of a pure English style in prose and verse , has occupied a position in letters which gives every evidence of persisting and increasing .

		It was assailed , as was natural and right , by satire and by caricature , but it has survived the attacks which were directed against it , and there can be little doubt that , with good luck , it will become a prominent feature of our intellectual and social system . ''

		Already , as he reminds his readers , the initial thirty-three have suffered losses that confer a certain solemnity , a certain increase of dignity , upon the young academy .

		Butcher ,
Verrall	PERSON	,
Alfred Lyall	PERSON	,
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, and
Edward Dowden	PERSON	have followed one another to the grave in rather quick succession ; and both their fellows on the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	and the larger world still feel their loss .

		HELPS TO READ was the old name sometimes applied to spectacles , and the passing years give most of us abundant proof of the appositeness of that designation .

		But an even greater help in read - ing , or rather a prime necessity , is a good light on the matter under perusal .

		The late convention of the
National Gas Institute	ORGANIZATION	has called attention to the marked progress made in artificial illumination within the last few years , and it may also serve to remind us of the defects and also the excesses even now prevalent in our modes of lighting the printed page when inclination or necessity protracts our studies beyond the limits of daylight .

		It is a com - mon assumption that the stronger the artificial light , the nearer its approach to the illumination enjoyed from the sun , and hence the better for the eyes .

		But the assumption is erroneous .

		Sunlight is dif - fused , and unless turned directly upon the page before one is far less trying to the eyes than an equal amount of artificial light shining immediately upon the book or paper in hand .

		Hence the impor - tance of choosing a somewhat subdued light , like that of a good oil lamp , for reading , and of seeing that its rays are directed so as not to be reflected from the white paper into the eyes .

		As every schoolboy knows , and he need not be one of
Macau	LOCATION	- lay 's schoolboys in order to know it , the angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence ; and also highly glazed or `` sized '' paper is ruinous to eyesight ; and , lastly , just as water dropping day by day will wear the hardest stone away , so a repeated disregard of proper rules for reading will in time reduce the strongest eyes to a condition prohibitive of any reading at all .

		FIFTY YEARS OF A LIBRARIAN 'S LIFE form the link inseparably associating the name of Dr.
Philip R. Uhler	PERSON	with the
Peabody Institute Library	ORGANIZATION	of
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		But it was science rather than letters that first made Dr.
Uhler	PERSON	a worker among books .

		Born in
1835	DATE	at
Baltimore	LOCATION	, he early became familiar with country life , his father having bought a farm near
Reisterstown	LOCATION	, and he was especially drawn to the study of insects .

		Entering the service of the newly-started
Peabody Institute	ORGANIZATION	in
1862	DATE	, he attracted by his talents the attention of the elder
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, who invited him to
Cambridge	LOCATION	to work in the great naturalist 's museum of comparative zoology as as - sistant librarian , and afterward sent him to make explorations in
Hayti	LOCATION	.

		In
1867	DATE	the young entomol - ogist was again at the
Peabody Institute	ORGANIZATION	, acting as assistant librarian and , upon leave of absence , pur - suing entomological researches in
Colorado	LOCATION	.

		The head librarianship came to him in
1870	DATE	, and in
1890	DATE	he was also made Provost of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		Other dignities and numerous memberships in learned societies fell to his share as the years passed , but the best of his energies were devoted to the fine library in his charge , and he left his mark upon it in the modern system of cataloguing and classification that he introduced , and in the notable additions he made to its store of books , spending much time in
Europe	LOCATION	in quest of these works .

		Among his amiable peculiarities , of which many stories are told , was his readiness to grant leave of absence to an assistant wishing to attend a church picnic , and his hesitation in granting such leave when
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 399 the less joyous function of a burial was in question .

		He died
October 21	DATE	, after a retirement of two years , and is succeeded in the librarianship by his long-time assistant , Mr.
John Parker	PERSON	.

		FIRST AID TO THE FOREIGNER , in his attempt to find his bearings in a new country , may often be best rendered by the public library .

		At a recent conference of educational and other workers at
Springfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, discussion turned upon the best way to make the public library serviceable to the immigrant population .

		The lowly toiler of alien birth is seldom seen in the splendid halls of our city libraries .

		The books he needs and desires may be there , and the attendants eager and willing to serve him ; but he does not come .

		Hence the necessity , as was urged , of a system of small branch libraries at the very doors of the foreign families , and with books in their several tongues served to them by assistants speaking those tongues .

		A small room , open an hour or two in the
evening	TIME	, will often do better service of this sort than a
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	library that employs a score of assistants and holds its doors open from eight in the morning till ten at night .

		The less awe-inspiring and formal the ap - pearance and methods of these branches or stations among the immigrants , the better will be the results attained ; and from these humble training schools in library usage the Italian , the Hungarian , the Greek , and the Lithuanian are likely to graduate in time and find themselves fitted to avail themselves of the larger privileges of the central library ; or at least their children are pretty sure to do so .

		PRICE COLLIER , AUTHOR , SPORTSMAN , AND TRAVELLER , whose ``
Germany	LOCATION	and the Germans from an American Point of View '' is one of the more important books of the season , died suddenly on the third of this month in the island of
Funen	LOCATION	, in the
Baltic Sea	LOCATION	, where he was visiting Count
Weddel	PERSON	as member of a shooting party .

		He was born in
1860	DATE	, son of the Rev.
Robert Laird Collier	PERSON	, and was educated at
Geneva	LOCATION	and
Leipzig	LOCATION	, but fitted for the ministry at the
Harvard Divinity School	ORGANIZATION	.

		After brief pastorates at
Hingham	LOCATION	and
Brookline	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, he devoted himself to letters , acting as European editor of `` The Forum '' for two years , writing many magazine articles , and issuing a number of books , chiefly concerning his travels .

		He wrote also the volume on driving in
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	's '' Sports - man 's Library . ''

		Of his books not already noted , mention should be made of ``
America	LOCATION	and the Amer - icans from a French Point of View , '' `` England and the English from an American Point of View , '' and `` The West in the East from an American Point of View . ''

		He held an officer 's commission in the
United States Navy	ORGANIZATION	in the Spanish - American War .

		Briskness , vigor , and alert observation showed themselves in his entertaining chapters of travel and foreign sojourn .

		A MONUMENT TO
HENRI FABRE	PERSON	, the tardily rec - ognized genius whose researches in the insect world have proved him to be a naturalist and a thinker of rare insight and vision , will probably add not very much to the happiness of his remaining years , but it will at least gratify his increasing company of ad - mirers and the chosen few admitted to his intimate friendship to see his fame perpetuated not only in his books , themselves a monumentum cere peren - nius , but also in some suitable erection of stone or bronze bearing his name and effigy .

		To this end a committee headed by the Mayor of Se `` rignan , and numbering many French notables , has beeif formed , and a circular sent out in solicitation of subscrip - tions .

		It is hoped that the response will be prompt and generous .

		THE LITERARY AGENT IN
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I am , unfortunately , old enough to remember the days when the Literary Agent made his first appearance in the world of writers , and was hailed with enthusiasm by the authors of that epoch as the harbinger of brighter days .

		For in those far-off times the Man of Letters knew himself to be no Man of Business : he confessed it even with a sort of pride .

		What had a writer of books to do with this pettifogging affair of getting paid for the books he produced ?

		The publisher gave him some - thing for his trouble , and it was not the part of an artist or of a gentleman to cavil at the amount .

		We still had our literary traditions , dating from the days when Lord
Byron	PERSON	considered it beneath his dignity to receive re - muneration for his copyrights .

		Mr.
R. C. Dallas	PERSON	, who arranged for the publication of '' Childe Harold '' with
John Murray	PERSON	, divided the profits of that transaction with the publisher .

		In a sense , he may be counted as the first Literary Agent of whom we have actual knowl - edge , and he was well rewarded for his pains .

		Our authors to-day are beginning to complain about the far more modest rate of commission charged by his suc - cessors in a growing trade .

		The Literary Agent , I suppose , evolved himself out of the Literary Executor .

		It was early recognized as a convenience that some duly authorized person , with some knowledge of business as well as of letters , should take over the task of collecting and publishing such stray fragments a `` S might be left inedited at the writer 's death .

		His pay varied .

		Sometimes it was considered that the honor of his position -LRB- with the opportunity of writing an Authorised Biography -RRB- furnished sufficient remu - neration ; sometimes , on the other hand , the materials were left to him absolutely to use at his own discretion and for his own profit .

		Out of this welter of confusion emerged by slow degrees the great principle of the Ten Per Cent commission , in defence of which the agent of to-day is prepared to fight to the last gasp .

		It looks as though he may have to fight , too .

		For a long time , when his business was still a novelty , the Literary Agent received nothing but praise from the authors who employed him .

		Successful novelists used to button-hole their less successful brethren at clubs , and urge them , with tears in their eyes , to follow the path that led so easily to glory and increased royalties .

		And , one by one , the conservative gentlemen of the old 400 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	school , who exist in literature as in other professions , fell into line and began to talk about `` my agent '' with a pleasant sense of business acumen .

		It really was a great point to have a representative who could be trusted to do the unpleasant part of the business , who could ap - proach the selling of a book without being hampered by any absurd considerations of sentiment , or any ridiculous qualms of nervousness .

		The publisher , of course , made a fuss over the innovation : he talked a good deal about the good old times when there was a real friendship be - tween author and publisher ; he trotted out a number of musty old stories about generous publishers of the past who had gone beyond the terms of their original agree - ments and handed over cheques for large amounts to writers who had made an unexpected success .

		He instanced firms who had undertaken , and paid liberally for , works that could not be expected to show a profit .

		This sort of thing , he intimated in conclusion , could not be expected to continue if the Literary Agent were allowed to interpose himself as a middleman .

		In a very little time the publisher would be squeezed dry : not a drop of the milk of human kindness would be left in him .

		In effect , he desired to point out that the author could not have it both ways .

		Either let him be a friend , or a grasping man of business ; if he chose to be the lat - ter -LRB- by proxy -RRB- he must not complain if he were treated according to the strict letter of the agreement .

		In short , the author must not expect any more cheques by way of bonus if he employed an agent to make his agreements .

		The author , I regret to say , made fun of these pro- testations in a manner that must have caused his old friend and ally considerable pain .

		He said rudely that he did not want his friendship : that he preferred the cash ; and that this so-called friendship , in any case , had been merely a cloak behind which the publisher had been wont to conceal his avaricious and grasping hands .

		It was now the author 's turn , and he meant to do a little squeezing on his own account .

		I must admit that he triumphed rather too openly for my taste ; he displayed something too much of that exultant pride so distaste - ful to the Greek tragedians ; it was felt that he was pre - paring a whip for the Fates to use upon himself in his turn .

		And yet it is difficult to blame him severely .

		The sudden acquisition of money is at least as intoxicating as strong drink .

		And for centuries the author had been kept very short of cash .

		Since
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	first turned for support from the patron to the bookseller , the capitalist had no doubt enjoyed the better share of the bargain .

		But then , the capitalist generally succeeds in business ; if he fails , he soon ceases to be a capitalist .

		I do not know that the publisher had behaved worse to the author than the employer in general had to his laborers .

		But of late years Labor has been showing a decided tendency to squeeze Capital , and it was not to be expected that authors -LRB- whose work , after all , demands a modicum of brains -RRB- should lag behind their brother operatives .

		They could not very well organize a strike , but at least they could sell their wares to the highest bidder , and employ a man of business to superintend the sale and the subsequent collection of money that might become due .

		There are now , I suppose , some dozen or more Literary Agents of repute settled in this city of
London	LOCATION	.

		There are many more , no doubt , whose methods will not bear investigation , men who live upon the fees they con - trive to extract from young authors before they make any pretence of exhibiting their work to editors or publishers .

		But the few who are perched securely at the top of the tree have done very well for them - selves , so well that the author , forgetful of the benefits he has reaped from their services in the past , is already beginning to turn round and ask why he should pay these high rates of commission for work that he could -LRB- as he sometimes says -RRB- do as easily him - self .

		Recently '' The Author , '' which is the official organ of the
Incorporated Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	in this country , and is always ready to open its columns to the grievances , real or imaginary , of those who write , has been dealing with this matter of a ten per cent commission for the mere collecting of accounts .

		With the accumulation of wealth , it may be noted , Avarice increases .

		The author does not think of grumbling at the agent who deducts a sovereign from a ten pound account , or even ten pounds from a hundred ; but when the amounts begin to run into higher figures he asks himself if the middleman is so indispensable after all .

		And of course the agent is by no means indispensable ; he is merely a convenience .

		There are not wanting authors of eminence who declare roundly that they will have none of him , that they can manage their own affairs without his assistance , at a saving both in tem - per and in pocket .

		Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	and Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	are two of the most important writers who have thus declared their independence ; on the other hand , Mr.
Arnold Bennett	PERSON	has acknowledged eloquently his indebtedness to the tribe of agents , and Mr.
Charles Garvice	PERSON	assures us that the more his commission account comes to the better he is pleased .

		Which seems , on the face of it , a reasonable enough way of looking at the matter .

		The agent has done so much for the author during the last twenty years that it seems the basest ingrati - tude to cavil at the amount of his profit .

		It is all very well for the successful novelist to allege that he can make better terms for himself with the publishers , but it was the agent who showed him the way to do so .

		Yet it may be that the middleman has now become somewhat careless in the performance of his trust .

		Complaints are beginning to be made now that , when once the contract has been drawn up for the publication of a book or the production of a drama , the agent does nothing more to earn his commission .

		He does not , for example , keep his eye upon publisher or producer to see that the terms of the contract are fulfilled .

		In cases where there is delay in the furnishing of accounts -LRB- and publishers on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	are often unconscionably slow in payment of royalties -RRB- the agent is too apt , they say , to make excuses .

		He has even been known to urge that , if he presses too hardly for immediate settlement , he may prejudice his position as to the placing of other manuscripts .

		When the accounts do at last come in , it is stated that they are too often not in accordance with the agreements .

		In short , the author is oppressed with doubts whether his new servant is not attempting the difficult task of serving two mas - ters .

		It is remarkable that the publisher no longer displays the old objection to the agent .

		Cases have been reported where , indeed , he has expressed a prefer - ence for dealing with them rather than with the author direct .

		This , not unnaturally , has given rise to horrid suspicions .

		What consideration does the publisher receive from the agent to induce this attitude ?

		Some - how he seems to have made terms with his ancient enemy , and the soul of the author is vexed within him .

		The agent is suspected now of acting as principal , of
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 401 having a financial interest in some of the firms with whom he deals .

		But the root of all this trouble is , I imagine , nothing but the ten per cent commission .

		It goes on and on : there is no getting rid of it ; it is as certain as the income tax , and , like the income tax , it is deducted before the payment of dividends .

		So long as a book continues to sell , so long do the royalties come in shorn of their just amount by one-tenth .

		There will have to be an amending of the contract , and a time limit .

		The weak point of the author 's position under the existing arrangement is that he has not -LRB- unless he has made some special arrangement -RRB- any power to stop his agent from collecting royalties on any work that has been once put in his hands and placed by his efforts .

		In his view , the placing of a book and the collection of the royalties thereon should be set in different cate - gories , and the author should have the power to take the latter function out of his agent 's hands after a cer - tain agreed minimum had been reached .

		The point is one that is not likely to interest any but the successful writer ; but it interests him very much indeed .

		MILTON 'S '' STARRE-YPOINTING PYRAMID . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Sir
Edwin Durning-Lawrence	PERSON	's letter , in your last issue , on
Milton	LOCATION	's epitaph on Shakespeare seems to call for a reply even if for no other purpose than to show up the methods of Baconians when they set out to prove their obsession and the flimsy foundation whereon they build .

		Says
Sir Edwin	PERSON	, '' starre-ypointing has been the despair of English grammarians for more than 250 years ... because y , like the German ge , is never prefixed to a present participle , but only to a past participle . ''

		The augment ge has , as we know , wholly disappeared from modern English , notwithstanding its great popularity before the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	.

		If Sir
Edwin	PERSON	means that ge was limited to past participles he is mistaken ; there is absolutely no question that during its lifetime ge was prefixed to any part of the verb .

		In later English the inflectional ge was reduced or softened to y -LRB- e. g. , yclad , yclept , ysterved , etc. -RRB- , i -LRB- e. g. , iwis = gewiss -RRB- or e -LRB- e. g. , enough = genug -RRB- .

		So our beloved is the
Saxon	PERSON	gelufed , belief is gelyfan , become -LRB- = to suit -RRB- is gecweman , belong is geiang , beseech is gesecan , beholden is gehealden , etc. .

		This be , the representative of the old ge , occurs in numer - ous modern and Elizabethan infinitives and present parti - ciples .

		In Shakespeare we find the present participle beholding -LRB- = obligated -RRB- some twenty times , and the past participle beholder , not at all , some of his modern editors to the contrary notwithstanding .

		There is therefore nothing astounding in
Milton	LOCATION	's '' starre-ypointing , '' as - suming that he wrote that and not , as has been con - jectured , '' starry-pointing . ''

		Starre-ypointed was as much an archaism in
Milton	LOCATION	's day as starre-ypointing .

		Sir
Edwin	PERSON	makes much of the fact that only a few of the extant copies of the Second Folio read '' starre - ypointed , '' a fact from which he draws the '' obvious '' conclusion that cancel pages containing the corrected reading '' could have been '' issued only to those pur - chasers of the volume to whom had been entrusted the preservation of
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's secrets .

		`` The page reveals to us , and it was intended to reveal to us , the name of the real author of the plays . ''

		Of course it does .

		Does not
Milton	PERSON	explicitly say , `` What neede my Shakespeare ... that his hallowed Reliques should be hid Under a starre-ypointed Pyramid ? ''

		But this is too simple for Sir
Edwin	PERSON	; `` reliques , '' he says , `` must mean what he hath left us '' ; but common sense says it means the poet 's mortal remains , his `` honour 'd bones . ''

		`` A starre-ypointed Pyramid , '' continues Sir
Edwin	PERSON	, '' can only -LSB- stc -RSB- mean a pyramid with a star upon its apex , i. e. , a Beacon , pro- nounced Bacon , '' although common sense says that a star-ypointing -LRB- or ypointed -RRB- pyramid means a monu - ment pointing to or directed at the stars .

		But it is not impossible , nay , it is highly probable , that
Milton	PERSON	meant a monument so high that it seemed to touch the stars or to be surmounted by a star .

		Not even such a monu - ment could add one inch to '' the great Heire of Fame . ''

		Moreover , Sir
Edwin	PERSON	's paraphrase of `` hallowed Reliques '' as the immortal plays can not be right be - cause
Milton	PERSON	would never have applied the adjective hallowed to profane writings , not even to
Shakespeare 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hallowed does not , and never did , mean immortal .

		In no English dictionary known to me is '' beacon '' defined as a '' pyramid with a star upon its point . ''

		Then how could any owner of the corrected Second Folio , unless he were a Baconian looking for such skimble-skamble stuff , know that the '' starre-ypointed Pyramid '' meant '' a Beacon , pronounced Bacon '' ?

		Furthermore , even if , for the sake of argument , we admit that beacon was then pronounced like our bacon , that proves nothing , for it is more than likely that '' Bacon '' was then pronounced the way we would pro- nounce '' backon '' or `` bahcon . ''

		`` What needst thou such dull witnesse of thy Name ? ''

		means only '' Thou needst no such dull testimony as that offered by a pyramid of piled stones to witness thy fame , '' and not that it was not '' necessary to put the dull witness of a Beacon -LRB- Bacon -RRB- upon these marvellous works . ''

		That the
Third Folio	ORGANIZATION	retains the word '' starre - ypointing '' is due to the fact that this edition of the poet 's works was set up from an uncorrected copy of the
Second Folio	ORGANIZATION	, and that the editors , not being of the '' initiated , '' saw nothing ungrammatical in starre - ypointing .

		With reference to the note on

Nov. 16	DATE	A HERO OF THE GENTLE LIFE .

		* In closing his `` Literary Friends and Ac - quaintance , '' written while
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	was still alive , Mr.
Howells	PERSON	speaks , with the restraint he knew would be desired by Mr.
Norton	PERSON	, of `` the creative sympathy of a man whose contributions to our literature only par - tially represent what he has constantly done for the humanities , '' and adds : `` I am sure that after the easy heroes of the day are long forgot , and the noisy fames of the strenuous life shall dwindle to their essential insignificance before these of the gentle life , we shall see in
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, the eminent scholar who left the quiet of his books to become our chief citizen at the moment when he warned his countrymen of the ignominy and disaster of doing wrong . ''

		Somewhere else , unless memory is at fault , the same writer points to Mr.
Norton	PERSON	as the finest example of one whose scholarly capacities have been cultivated to their fullest extent .

		It is this impression of continual growth in scholarship and refined taste and high sym - pathies that one receives in reading the two ample volumes of Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's letters now carefully edited with biographical comment by his daughter , Miss
Sara Norton	PERSON	, and Mr.
M. A. De Wolfe Howe	PERSON	.

		First we see their writer young , ardent , eagerly acquisitive of knowledge and experience , and then , as the wisdom of age is added , reflective , reminiscent , philosophical , tasting the wine of life with a more keenly dis - criminating relish , infusing himself more and more into the generations growing up about him , and , in his letters to old friends , falling back at last on those mutual sympathies and comprehen - sions that are finally felt to be the really endur - ing and desirable things of existence .

		From the very beginning , too , he shows himself possessed of a singular maturity and poise , a capacity for inspiring confidence as an adviser and for winning hearts as a friend .

		Indeed , he had a veritable genius for friendship , high and noble , warm and lasting friendship , and it is signifi - cant that many of his earlier friends were men and women considerably older than himself .

		Reared as the companion rather than the son of a scholarly father , he early displayed an unusual development of mental powers , strength of * LETTERS OF

		character , and ripeness of judgment .


Ruskin	PERSON	's attachment to and confidence in
Norton	LOCATION	is well known .

		In his '' Praeterita , '' after describing their first meeting on that memorable day in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, he concludes : '' And thus I became possessed of my second friend , after Dr.
John Brown	PERSON	; and of my first real tutor ,
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	. ''

		The relationship of the two is well shown in the letters from
Ruskin	LOCATION	to
Norton	LOCATION	, as published a few years ago .

		An uninformed reader would not suspect the age of the '' tutor '' to be almost nine years under that of the pupil .

		Another Englishman of note who con - fessed himself indebted to the young American scholar 's benevolence and wisdom , was
Arthur Hugh Clough	PERSON	, also
Norton	PERSON	's senior by nearly nine years .

		``
Charles Norton	PERSON	is the kindest creature in the shape of a young man of twenty - five that ever befriended an emigrant stranger anywhere , '' writes
Clough	PERSON	from
Cambridge	LOCATION	, where
Norton	PERSON	was sagely advising him on the publication of his `` Plutarch '' and aiding him in reading the proofs .

		Striking instances of
Norton	ORGANIZATION	's happy way of quickly ingratiating himself , without effort , wherever he went and whomsoever he met , are found in the record of his first journey abroad , that memorable voyage made by him as super - cargo to
India	LOCATION	, whence he returned , nearly
two years later	DATE	, by way of
Suez	ORGANIZATION	,
Cairo	LOCATION	, and
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In
Italy	LOCATION	the Brownings appear to have felt his charm immediately , and to have given him their cordial friendship .

		The younger man 's way of referring to
Browning	PERSON	and other friends older than himself , and of addressing them in his let - ters , using often only the last name , is significant of his reception among them on a footing of perfect equality .

		That he viewed under no false glamour the celebrities among whom he moved and of whom he heard , is evident from such passages as the following , written to his mother after a tete-a-tete dinner with
John Kenyon	PERSON	, Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's elderly cousin : '' We talked much this evening of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	and of
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	said that much as he ad - mired and respected
Wordsworth	PERSON	, there was hardly a more disagreeable man in some positions ; that he was very selfish , and , as
Sara Coleridge	PERSON	said of him , his sen - sibility seemed to be in him and not of him .

		Coleridge once said that if
Wordsworth	PERSON	had a coat of arms , the crest should be a laurel crown , and the supporters , a bishop on the one side , and an attorney on the other .

		He was a man weak enough to care for the distinctions of rank , and to bow to them , and if you , his best friend , said Mr.
Kenyon	PERSON	, met him in a party of lords and bishops , it was very likely that he would not know you while they were in the room .

		We talked , too , of
Rogers	ORGANIZATION	, of
Miss Mitford	LOCATION	, who is still living at
Three Mile Cross	ORGANIZATION	, and
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 403 who , being relieved from the necessity of writing , has laid aside her pen , to live quietly on her narrow but sufficient income . ''

		Side by side with this dinner at
John Kenyon	PERSON	's should be placed
Norton	PERSON	's evening at
Lamar	LOCATION	- tine 's , where the clear-eyed young American detected at once the enormous vanity of his host .

		`` The stories which are heard of Lamartine 's vanity , '' he wrote home afterward , `` would be almost incredible were they not confirmed and repeated on every side .

		Some of them are too bad to tell .

		By a little skilful drawing out one can any day induce him to say that he is physi - cally superb and morally sublime . ''

		But it is more profitable to dwell on
Norton	ORGANIZATION	's admirations and enthusiasms than on the objects of his good - natured contempt though that is too strong a word to describe his feeling .

		An early reference to the dearest friend of his maturity and later life occurs in a letter to
Clough	LOCATION	, written in Nor - ton 's twenty-sixth year and while
Lowell	LOCATION	.

		was still keenly feeling the loss of his first wife . ''

		Lowell was with me
last night	TIME	till near one o'clock , so that if I am stupid this morning there is no cause for wonder ; he was very bright and pleasant and we should neither of us be dull to-day , could we have sat talking all night and not gone to bed at all .

		My affec - tion and admiration for him quicken every time I see him ; he bears the trial of his life , a loss which grows only more palpable in the course of time , with the best spirit , and the truest right feeling .

		Sometimes , after he has been long at home , surrounded only by those things which suggest continually to him his sorrow , I have found him very sad ; but he quickly rallies , and no word of unmanliness or complaint ever shows that he has lost even for a moment the serenity and patience of his heart . ''

		An earlier letter to the same correspondent has a paragraph prophetic of the writer 's attitude in a national crisis of almost half a century later , and not unprofitable reading for us at this very moment . ''

		The administration have got a very pretty quarrel with
Cuba	LOCATION	, and will make the most of it .

		One of the
New York	LOCATION	steamers has been confiscated in
Havana	LOCATION	owing to informality in her manifest .

		The accounts as yet are all from one side and we have not heard the Spanish version of the story .

		But we do not care to wait for that and propose to seek redress whether Spanish laws are violated or not .

		Such an opportunity as this can not be lost .

		So the President sends an undignified message to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and all the passion that can be ex - cited is being stimulated by every proper means ... In the existing state of feeling in this country in regard to
Cuba	LOCATION	it was , so far as can be now seen , an immense mistake on the part of the Spanish authorities to commit such an inflammatory act as the seizure of this vessel . ''

		In a notebook kept by
Norton	PERSON	at the time of his second visit to
Europe	LOCATION	there are found entries indicating the beginning of that course of study which was to make the young student , in process of time , our foremost Dante scholar .

		From
1856	DATE	, therefore , to the end of his life more than half a century later ,
Norton	PERSON	is to be thought of as giving the best of his intellectual energies to the Italian poet .

		That his prose rendering of the `` Divine Comedy '' should be accounted the most faithful presentation of it in our language , need not surprise anyone who knows the translator 's lifelong abhorrence of slovenliness in literary work .

		A passage from a letter to Mr.
Edward Lee	PERSON	- Childe arrests attention because it so aptly applies to the writer himself . ''

		You are leading a rational life , and in securing the best culture for yourself you are doing good service to society .

		There is great need of men who may keep up the standard of cultivation , without aiming at the cheap personal distinction for which most men strive .

		I know no worse calamity that can overtake a man than to have a thirst for publicity , and yet it is the common vice of able men in this epoch of the newspaper reporter . ''

		Passing now to the later letters , we select a passage from a communication to Gold win Smith that reveals a healthy rationalism and a sane optimism such as not all the world has yet attained to . ''

		You gave me a great pleasure in sending to me two or three months ago a copy of your book on the ' Riddle of Existence . '

		It was a great satisfaction to me to find myself in entire agreement with you on every main point , and to have my own convictions set forth with such lucidity , temperance , and force .

		Possibly I regret less than you do the giving up of the old faith , and the being compelled to renounce as hopeless every attempt to solve the problems which excite our curi - osity .

		The position toward the universe in which we find ourselves seems to me on the whole the manliest which has been attained .

		We are thrown back on our own resources to make the best of our lives .

		A new sense of responsibility is aroused in us , and , by the narrowing of the limits of our hopes and expectations , we find ourselves more capable of using our faculties for legitimate and rational ends .

		I do not find it hard to quench the eagerness of curiosity about the unknow - able , and to accept as sufficient this brief , incompre - hensible existence on earth .

		Man seems to me to be for the most part in a very early stage of development , and the loss of religious faith among the most civilized portion of the race is a step from childishness toward maturity .

		That it will have many sad results I do not question , that the progress will be very slow and irreg - ular is certain , but in the long run I have no fear in regard to improvement in the general morality of the race .

		Our morals seem to me the result and expression of the secular experience of mankind .

		As such they have a solid foundation .

		The doctrine of love is the one ultimate achievement in this field .

		And the validity of that doctrine as the rule of life is but confirmed by such convictions as you and I have reached . ''

		In one of his last letters
Norton	PERSON	cheerfully wrote : '' The end can not be far off , and although few men have more to leave than I , I am neither 404 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	reluctant , nor sentimentally sorry to leave it . ''

		Among those last letters , which are , naturally enough , the best letters in the collection , one finds and would like to quote from many a genial message of greeting to such sympathetic friends as
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	,
E. L. Godkin	PERSON	, Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	, and
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	.

		Following the letters are twenty pages of delightful personal reminiscence from Mr.
Arthur Sedgwick	PERSON	, Nor - ton 's brother-in-law ; then come appended items of interest , and , finally , an index that success - fully stands the test of repeated use .

		Portraits and other illustrations abound .

		Even more memorable than the appearance of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's correspondence , which
Norton	PERSON	himself edited , is this publication of the letters of him who was our most finished scholar and our most intelli - gently and fearlessly public-spirited citizen .

		In the best sense of those much abused words , this is emphatically the book of the year .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		THE SOCIAL , DEVELOPMENT or MODERN ENGLAND .

		* The past century of English history has been a period of great and growing `` unrest . ''

		As the years pass the disturbing forces appear to be increasing in number and strength .

		The situation has produced much perplexity among conservative Britons , and has inspired a con - siderable body of literature largely of the polemic order .

		Among the more recent works that have been called forth by these newer social facts is a historical study by Dr.
Gilbert Slater	PERSON	, which he calls '' The Making of Modern England . ''

		Dr.
Slater	PERSON	belongs to a class of writers who sometimes speak of themselves as `` sociological historians '' -LRB- whatever that term may mean -RRB- , and whose interest seems to be limited to the larger and wider aspects of social life and development .

		For such a study the recent history of
England	LOCATION	is surely not wanting in opportunity .

		The author states his purpose clearly in a brief preface from which the following sen - tences may be quoted : '' My aim in this book is to set out in language as simple and clear as I can command those facts with regard to the recent history of our country which it is most important for English men and women to know .

		... For the citizen , historical study with the ulterior object of gaining light in the future and guidance in * THE MAKING OF MODERN ENGLAND .

		By
Gilbert Slater	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, D.Sc .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		the present , is an imperative duty .

		... I should have liked to lavish much more time and labor on this effort if it had been possible .

		As it is , I must now present it , for what it is worth , to those who are seeking for light from the past on the difficulties and dangers of this most critical moment in the life of our nation , of the empire , and of humanity . ''

		Dr.
Slater	PERSON	is principal of
Ruskin College	ORGANIZATION	, an
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	institution which is frequently spoken of as '' the workingmen 's college '' ; it was organ - ized a dozen years ago to give certain opportu - nities for study both in residence , by `` extension '' courses , and by correspondence , that were not to be found elsewhere .

		This position has brought the author into close touch with the most discontented of all the disturbing forces , the workingmen .

		But it has also given him a view - point that the '' more solid classes '' will refuse to accept .

		There are no traces of Tory sym - pathies in Dr.
Slater	PERSON	's work .

		`` The Making of Modern England '' is not a history in the traditional sense : the political element , which surely has had a large part in the '' making '' of that nation , is almost omitted .

		Only where politics and politicians are associa - ted with great social or industrial changes do they appear in the narrative ; the first reform act , which paved the way for the social reforms of the thirties , is naturally treated in some detail .

		Gladstone and
Chamberlain	PERSON	are prom - inent in Dr.
Slater	PERSON	's narrative , but the greater number of the other famous parliamentary names are wanting ; their places are taken by those of
Brougham	LOCATION	,
Cobbett	PERSON	,
Huskisson	PERSON	,
Edwin Chadwick	PERSON	, who did such efficient work for san - itation , and the leaders of the trades union movement .

		But on the subjects that fall within the author 's purpose he writes clearly and fully .

		They are chiefly such topics as parliamentary and municipal reform ; the industrial revolution and factory legislation ; the labor movement in its various phases ; the corn laws and tariff re - form ; the poor laws , educational reforms , and sanitation ; and other related subjects .

		Three chapters are devoted to conditions in country and town in the years immediately following the close of the Napoleonic wars ; and the picture is one of hopeless distress .

		Six chapters take up in detail the earlier reforms in constitution and industry ; more than half of the work is given to the period prior to the Crimean War .

		The remainder of the volume is devoted chiefly to education , municipal activities , and changes in the industrial system .

		Dr.
Slater	PERSON	has his views on present-day Eng - lish problems and movements , and expresses
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 405 them without fear .

		On the subject of tariff reform he holds very moderate views .

		He seems to be a believer in state support for in - dustry , but sees little to be gained from the political programme of the Unionists . ''

		It is unfortunate that the case between free trade and neo-protectionism has had to be argued before a public which has been denied any general education in economics , and therefore is not well prepared to under - stand the sounder arguments on both sides .

		The controversy has , therefore , degenerated , through the irresistible temptation offered to both sides to rouse pre - judices and to use arguments , however unsound , which happen to appeal to the uninstructed voter ... There is a tendency on both sides to grossly exaggerate the net economic gain or loss to the country as a whole of a system of free imports on the one side and of small import ' duties on the other . ''

		He also fears that , as the political parties are rather evenly balanced , '' the country may oscil - late between the two systems and so suffer greater loss and damage than from a continued adher - ence to even the worse of the two . ''

		For imperialistic ambitions , as the term is usually understood , he has no sympathy .

		Against the imperial system itself he brings a terrible indictment . ''

		We are accustomed to think of the British Empire as consisting mainly of men of the Anglo-Saxon blood , and as being on the whole well governed , highly civilized and wealthy .

		As a matter of fact the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	consists mainly of Asiatics ; it is more cursed by deep poverty than any other great state , and the great majority of its adult population are unable to read and write . ''

		The greatest problem is the Indian service .

		England has too few civil servants in
India	LOCATION	; they are poorly trained and they govern accord - ing to obsolete ideas `` the ghost of the eco - nomic doctrine of laissez-faire '' clings to actual practice .

		On the matter of training for the civil service the author is emphatic : '' To vari - ous audiences I have urged that the first step for the salvation of the Empire must be to abolish compulsory Greek at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and Cam - bridge and substitute compulsory geography . ''

		But he hopes that out of imperialism will grow internationalism , that the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	will serve as a long step toward the `` federation of the world . ''

		With the feminist movement the author is in evident sympathy .

		English women demand the ballot because it is a symbol of equality and because they `` believe in its overwhelming importance . ''

		`` The state is equally concerned with men and women ; its business is no longer the extension of territory , but chiefly the securing of a better environment for the coming generation ; and the exclusion of women from a share in that business can be defended only on the ground of their intellectual inferiority . ''

		The modern British industrial system Dr.
Slater	PERSON	believes to be fundamentally wicked : '' The whole structure of business of the modern type is built upon a foundation of injustice . ''

		Of the three groups that are interested in a public service corporation , the shareholders , the laborers , and the public , the first has the least personal interest .

		The capitalist , because of his scattered investments , becomes '' less and less able to discharge the duties and responsi - bilities attaching to ownership '' ; his prudence in investing reduces him '' to a mere parasite on the business which he , with his fellows , owns . ''

		The author looks for great changes in industrial organization ; these may be Socialistic or
Syndi	PERSON	- calistic , or possibly both forms will appear ; but he does not believe that any new form will pre - vail to such an extent as to eliminate all the earlier types .

		It seems to the reviewer that Dr.
Slater	PERSON	has been more anxious to interpret his facts than to find and state them ; that he expresses his opinions too freely and too positively ; and that consequently his work can scarcely be classed as history .

		But as a summary of the causes that have led to the disturbed conditions of the pre - sent , written from the viewpoint of one who is sympathetic toward the yearnings and strivings of the toiling masses , it has an interest and a value of its own .

		But it is an argument rather than a historical narrative .


LAURENCE M. LARSON	PERSON	.

		STUDIES OF THE ENGLISH Histories of literature continue to multiply .

		If the classics of our tongue were increasingly read in proportion as they can be increasingly read about , there would be cause for great grati - fication .

		It is to be feared , however , that the latter employment is too likely to be a substitute for the former , from the elementary schools up to women 's clubs and the universities .

		Doubt - less this is no reason why we should be inhos - pitable to the new guides made for those who would read systematically and intelligently .

		But the difficulty of making such a guide both a practical manual and a readable history is very great ; and one frequently lays down the book querying whether it is not , after all , a graceful tour de force , exhibiting how much ground may be covered with the greatest agility , * LYRIC POETKY .

Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		406 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	without laying the writer open to charges of omission from his fellow-scholars and reviewers .

		For illustration , take such a sentence as this , from one of the two volumes now before us : `` Passing
Thomas Love Peacock	PERSON	, best recol - lected , notwithstanding a lyric or so of distinc - tion , for his incomparable wit and humor in rime ,
John Hamilton Reynolds	PERSON	, friend and com - panion in poetic adventure of
Keats	PERSON	, and Lam an
Blanchard	PERSON	, preacher , jester , and writer of society verses , we reach in Hood the most gifted of the poets that
fall	DATE	between the early romanticists and the great Victorians . ''

		Is this not skilful ?

		And is it not at the same time suggestive of studying a subterranean water-system from an aeroplane ?

		Or this : '' It might be difficult to find four writers more in contrast as men and authors than
Macaulay	LOCATION	,
Praed	PERSON	,
Mangan	PERSON	, and
Barnes	PERSON	; indeed , only their likeness in years and the circumstance that they all began to write well before the accession of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	could justify the treatment of them together . ''

		Yes , there is one other justification , that the writer was obviously in despair as to how to in - clude the necessary names in the pending chap - ter without frankly descending to the method of a text-book , and saying `` 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . ''

		The re - sult of such efforts is that the reader versed in the subject-matter of the book perceives that its author knew his material well , but that its sig - nificance is questionable for those not acquainted with the field .

		Such is the conspicuous case with the horde of brilliant literary histories turned out by Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	: any intelligent reader is eager to know what Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	has to say of his favorite book , but one who would have the landscape mapped out for him must be directed to some guide at once humbler and safer .

		And the fault here is not with the author alone , but with the method of these compendia .

		Of late such suspicions as these have given rise to a new type of literary history in which each mode or kind is treated by itself , and more econ - omy and thoroughness are thereby made possi - ble .

		Two series of this sort are now well under way , one made in this country , called `` The Types of English Literature , '' whose general editor is Professor
W. A. Neilson	PERSON	; and its British coun - terpart , called '' The Channels of English Lit - erature , '' under the direction of Mr.
Oliphant Smeaton	PERSON	.

		The volumes treating of the lyric , in these two series , are now at hand , and both have been committed to writers of proved scholarship and assured competence in critical technique .

		That both are at once learned and readable may therefore be assumed without danger .

		It does not follow , however , that they escape altogether the queries which have been raised regarding the task they undertake to accomplish .

		If such a treatise can give us a real history of the form in question , discerning its evolution , its modify - ing environment , its quasi-organic life , then the type-history justifies itself in a special way .

		This is characteristically possible in a form like tragedy or novel , for there one may predicate a certain consciousness of type on the part of the authors concerned , as well as a fairly obvious series of vital influences .

		But the lyric is a form essentially unconscious and essentially individualistic ; there is , therefore , less signifi - cance in treating its history among a given peo - ple than in the case of almost any other type .

		Try as we will , then , the task becomes in some measure the mere picking up of one name and the setting of it down to take up another .

		Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	and Professor
Schelling	PERSON	have miti - gated this tendency in quite different ways .

		The former has felt free to please himself by expanding his treatment of that period which at once evidently interests him most and is most susceptible of scientific and historical treat - ment , the mediaeval .

		Here the evolution of the type is handled with more care , and more richness of illustration , than can easily be found elsewhere , and the result should prove very stimulating to any who can read
Middle Eng	ORGANIZATION	- lish without difficulty .

		Professor
Schelling	PERSON	, on the other hand , has consulted the interests of the general reader , which are sure to be dis - proportionately concerned with recent litera - ture , and gives nearly half his book to the English lyrists from
1798	DATE	to the present , the period where individuality is most marked , and the historical method least available .

		* But he takes care to meet the needs of the real student of the subject by providing at every point hints concerning the deeper matters to which indi - vidual poets are related , as well as bibliograph - ical references in an abundance just not too great to be practicable .

		On a subject so doubtfully defined as the lyric , one compares with interest the limits which the two critics seek to set for their * In this matter of proportion , then , neither book appears so much to advantage , despite their greater charm of style , as Professor
Edward B. Reed	PERSON	's '' English Lyrical Poetry , '' reviewed in THE DIAL for
September 1 , 1012	DATE	.

		Those seri - ously interested in the subject will perhaps find convenient a definite , not to say mechanical , comparison of the three books so recently published on the same subject .

		Reed 's book , then , contains some 174,000 words ,
Rhys	PERSON	's some 148,000 , and
Schel	PERSON	- lings 's some 87,000 .

		To the mediseval lyric
Reed	ORGANIZATION	devotes about
14 %	PERCENT	of his space , Rhys
23 %	PERCENT	, and Schelling
6 %	PERCENT	; to the lyric of the
19th century	DATE
Reed	ORGANIZATION	gives
21 %	PERCENT	, Rhys
10 %	PERCENT	, and Schelling
38 %	PERCENT	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 407 territory .

		With
Rhys	PERSON	it is primarily the rhyth - mical or musical element , the primitive spon - taneous impulse to song , to which the defining lines are always referred .

		`` Lyrical , '' he tells us at the outset , `` implies a form of musical utterance in words governed by overmastering emotion and set free by a powerfully concordant rhythm . ''

		This leads him to find his subject - matter , on occasion , even in narrative poetry , as when he cites
Chaucer	PERSON	's `` lyric remark '' about the Squire : `` He sleep no more than doth a nightingale , '' adding , `` One may think that not a lyric line at all , but in fact it is an enhancing of sound and sense alike by the poet 's conscious and tuneful exuberance of pleas - ure in the fact he is communicating , and there lies the essence of the lyric principle . ''

		So of the '' Comus '' songs : you feel '' the voice-chords strong in them ; ... there is an actual present music of the sounds apart from the syllabic and intelligible pattern of the words . ''

		This is admirably suggestive in both thought and phrasing .

		Elsewhere Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	recognizes the development of the more literary element , which came in , for example , with
Surrey	LOCATION	, `` the silent lyric which is written and meant to be read to oneself '' ; while with
Wordsworth	PERSON	, he says , `` the converting of the lyrical to the sub - lyrical , the verse of sung melody and pure vocal rhythm to that of reflective and medita - tive expression , was complete . ''

		* One can see that with this tendency he is more or less impa - tient .

		He is suspicious of the sonnet , for example ; and , though he admits that Shake - speare makes us forget that it is `` a book-song , a lyric in a cabinet , '' he gives only a page to the Shakespearean collection .

		Professor
Schel	PERSON	- ling is more catholic in temper , less interested in rhythm , and disposed to emphasize , as mod - ern literature inevitably emphasizes , the test of subjectivity rather than songfulness .

		Both writers , as we have said , are possessed of a skilled and liberal critical style , and pro- vide us with obiter dicta which are not the least valuable products of this handbook fashion .

		Here are some of the best of Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	's : ''
Chaucer	PERSON	was the most delicately syllabic verseman who ever wrote in English , so that , reading him after the later poets whose fashion is more like our own , we are impressed as by the clear but unusual enunciation of a child . '' ''

		Sidney 's poetry floats on that full stream of history * Compare
Wordsworth	PERSON	's own words concerning his poems : '' Some of these pieces are essentially lyrical , and therefore can not have their due force without a supposed musical accompaniment ; but , in much the greatest part , I require nothing more than an animated or impassioned reci - tation . ''

		-LSB- which characterized the Elizabethan court -RSB- like leaves on a broad river , whose water keeps them fresh . ''

		The mode of perceptivity which
Dryden	PERSON	and his school cultivated ties the imagination to the fence , and no matter how the wind blows , the range is determined by the rope . '' ''

		The tough
Saxon	PERSON	fibre remained , ... to give it something of that occasional stiffness of English poetry , which is apt to affect her verse-writers when they are not inspired , ... and at the same time to give it that grip on the earth , which we found first in
Widsith	LOCATION	and Csedmon . ''

		And here is a hand-cull from Professor
Schel	PERSON	- ling -LRB- whose book is characterized , however , not so much by salient passages as by the ample knowledge , catholicity , and gentle humor which underlie nearly all his judgments -RRB- : '' Elizabethan poetry revels in the art of song , in variety and experiment in verse , in the artifices of style ; it plays upon words and elaborates ingenious figures of speech ; it bubbles with voluble joy , or , if cast down , its despair or petulance are those of childhood . '' ''

		It is not so much the possession of new or startling qualities that characterizes the artistic endowment of Shakespeare as it is the superlative degree in which he is endowed with qualities which are ordinarily associated with the sanity of talent as contrasted with the abnor - mality of genius . '' ''

		Keats is the antithesis poetically of
Wordsworth	LOCATION	, in place of whose artistic thrift he practised a splendid liberality , in place of whose scrutinizing search for the hidden meaning of things he was content to blazon in a gorgeous heraldry of his own their outward glories . ''

		In connection with Professor
Schelling	PERSON	's book , two or three queries suggest themselves , if only for the sake of varying the monotony of agree - ment which must , in general , meet the author 's dicta .

		For
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets he contents himself with the easy traditional statement that they '' are made up of two series , '' the first addressed to a youth , the second to a dark lady ; this , despite the fact that the statement has never been undisputed , and that recent criticism has tended to react against it .

		Of
Donne	PERSON	we are told that he is free '' from the slightest interest in nature or in similitudes drawn from nature , '' a saying which gives us pause when we remember the lines '' A pregnant bank swelled up to rest The violet 's reclining head , '' the wonderful `` Nocturnal upon St.
Lucy	PERSON	's Day , '' and the metaphysical toying with the five-petaled blossom in `` The Primrose . ''

		And is it not at least questionable to group
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	with the poets who are more intent on form than on `` the thing said '' ?

		A final comparison of the two volumes should revert to the humble matter of their practical service to the serious reader , and here the admi - rable bibliographical apparatus furnished by 408 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	Professor
Schelling	PERSON	, as already noted , must have weight .

		The index to his manual , too , is worthy of more than the reviewer 's usual part - ing word .

		By searching here , not merely for the names and titles with which the professional index-maker contents himself , but for such captions as `` Celtic Revival , '' `` Classical influ - ences , '' `` Conceit , '' `` French influences , '' `` Mad - rigal , '' `` Oxford Movement , '' '' Petrarchism , '' `` Pre-Raphaelite , '' and the like , one may read - ily be enabled to follow out threads of topical importance which are not conspicuous in the main pattern of the book .

		In these respects Mr.
Rhys	PERSON	's volume is conspicuously inferior .

		There are no accurate references ; bibliography is provided in neither notes nor appendix ; and the index is only of proper names .

		The proof - reading is also left with much to be desired ; one may note particularly the illiterate spelling ''
Sampson	PERSON	'' twice on page 228 , and what can hardly be laid to the printer 's door an unpar - donable garbling of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's lines on Shake - speare 's sonnets , page 338 .

		In view of the present progress of these undertakings in literary history , a concluding suggestion may not be untimely .

		We now have plenty of histories of English literature as a whole , and are coming to have plenty of such histories by types .

		The next step needed is to give the student who wishes to gain the view - point of what is awkwardly called '' comparative literature '' a view of the types without regard to national boundaries .

		It is desirable to get either a complete longitudinal section or a com - plete cross-section , to see either the evolution of our literature as a whole , or that of one form of literature in the modern western world .

		Some of the volumes in Professor
Neilson	PERSON	's series will perhaps approach this desideratum , at least if one may judge from the announcements already made ; `` the short story , mediaeval and mod - ern , '' one would think , can scarcely be confined within the boundaries of
England	LOCATION	, nor can one easily fancy Professor
Irving Babbitt	PERSON	writ - ing a history of English criticism alone .

		But the value of Professor
Thorndike	PERSON	's volume on tragedy , already issued and proved helpful , is impaired by the fact that to treat English tragedy by itself , especially in certain periods , is almost to throw away the possibility of under - standing it .

		In , the lyric this is not so true .

		But eventually , when the training of our literary scholars has become more liberal without losing its soundness , we shall have a series dealing with the Novel , the Tragedy , the Lyric , and the rest , of modern
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Till then , students exploring these subjects in existing works will continue to feel like visitors to a public build - ing who find many alluring doors and galleries marked '' Closed to the public for the present . ''

		THE MAX .

		* `` When half-gods go , '' says
Emerson	PERSON	, `` the gods arrive . ''

		Perhaps no more than other peoples , but certainly to a marked degree , we Americans tend to make our national heroes something more than merely human , some - thing more , indeed , than demi-gods .

		In the process of ascribing to them characteristics suit - able to their eminence , we strip them of their humanity , until we find them lifted beyond our sympathies into monsters of perfection , crea - tures much `` too bright and good for human nature 's daily food . ''

		As a consequent reaction , books are being written , like Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	's `` The Seven Ages of
Washington	LOCATION	, '' for the purpose of proving that the great Virginian , too , was hu - man ; and his case seems to require proof that he could laugh upon occasion with any of us , quite as much as that he could suffer .

		In the latter contingency , we certainly lose the lesson that human sufferings can be nobly borne , as with
Washington	LOCATION	, seemingly setting him on a pedestal so remote that we can see neither his smiles nor his tears .

		The best compliment ever paid an actor is that recently accorded Sir
John	PERSON	- ston Forbes-Robertson by a young girl who said of his Hamlet , `` I never before thought it could happen . ''

		And many an American , it is to be feared , has dismissed the Father of his Country with the half - formed reflection that such a man never really happened .


Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	is rapidly being accorded a similar elevation beyond our daily humanity ; and the process can only be stopped , if it can be stopped at all , by such a book as the late
Francis Fisher Browne	PERSON	's `` Everyday Life of Lincoln , '' now rewritten to include everything worthy that has been brought to light since its first appearance twenty-seven years ago .

		If ever there was a thoroughly human man , it was the great Liberator .

		If ever an Ameri - can lived from whom his countrymen could derive comfort , not only for success but for failure , it was he .

		If any man in any age was wrought by the hand of destiny from common * THE EVERYDAY LIFE OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 409 clay into true nobility and imperishable har - mony , it was this same Lincoln .

		And if , in spite of all things , whether of good or ill repute , a great man ever remained a simple , sane , sweet , comprehensible human being , again it was
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	.

		Nothing is to be gained by trimming his words and deeds to fit the exi - gencies of a later and , it may be , a better age .

		In fact , he was so emphatically of his own time , its best , most typical , and most characteristic product , that all attempts to harmonize his life with another environment must end disastrously .

		No descriptive phrase accorded him has met with more general approval than
Lowell	PERSON	's '' the first American '' ; nothing is to be gained , but much lost , by seeking to make him also the last American .

		And
Francis Fisher Browne	PERSON	, a man of Lin - coln 's type if ever there was one , has brought together out of his great understanding and sympathy a mass of opinion , incident , anecdote from the most varied sources , fused them into a single whole , and left us a vivid portrait which shows Lincoln the Man the man who was always himself .

		Some concession has been made to the spirit which would make him the man who was better than himself , but not much , and that only in the words of others ; in the eloquent links which bind together the statements and sentiments of others , the feeling of the biogra - pher is clear : Lincoln was a man like ourselves , humbler , commoner , less `` gentlemanlike '' than any of us dare think ourselves , moulded by tremendous stress and strain into a figure unique in the annals of the world .

		Like
Washington	LOCATION	, he is one of
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	's men , but springing from the boundless prairie rather than from the closer vicinage of a classical age , a Boeotian who loved beauty , a Spartan who could shed tears , a Roman who read entirely new meanings into the phrase , Imperium et libertas .

		The plan of the book is simple .

		If anything dealing with
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's life from its inhospitable beginning to its
august	DATE	close is fully authenti - cated and bears the mark of truth , it has been deemed worthy of inclusion .

		`` Many of the stories told of Lincoln at the bar , '' we read on page 139 , '' are extremely ridiculous , and repre - sent him in anything but a dignified light .

		But they are a part of the character of the man , and should be given wherever there is reason to suppose they are genuine . ''

		Thereupon one prime reason for the book 's excellence discloses itself : '' Besides , they are usually full of a humor that is irresistible . ''

		And what follows is a warning to all solemn asses who would have it otherwise ; for if there was anything human that
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's heart did not warm to it was the solemn ass .

		It is not with history that this book is chiefly concerned , it is with the man in history .

		Only such chronicle of the events that marked so portentous an epoch in the world 's long life has been included as is needful for an under - standing of the individual who did so much to sway these events and bend them to his will .

		These are dealt with in a spirit that it is no exaggeration to call truly Lincolnian .

		Nearly all previous historians and biographers in this field , still moved , it would seem , by the bitter - ness of that age , have been partisans .

		Notably has this been the case in dealing with the relations between Lincoln and
McClellan	PERSON	; the mere mention of the two names has seemed to call forth the challenge in `` King Henry IV. , '' '' Under which king , Bezonian ?

		speak , or die ! ''

		But here we find portrayed two men , equally zealous , equally anxious , each in possession of knowledge he would impart to the other , each doomed by his own limitations to imperfect understanding of the situation ; yet , in spite of all these things , good friends to the end , and upon the whole freer from acrimony than any of their followers .

		For it is no part of this book 's purpose to make men and events out better than they were and are , nor yet to make them worse .

		Lincoln 's own breadth of view and insight into human nature are shown to be in full control throughout .

		One can love Lincoln without hating
McClellan	PERSON	, or admire the general 's man - ifest good qualities without dishonoring the memory of his commander-in-chief .

		An equal catholicity of treatment is accorded such mooted questions as
Lincoln	LOCATION	's religion ; he is shown in his everyday life to have been truly religious , and the lesser question of creed is left to take care of itself .

		Here and again something is said about his abstemiousness regarding liquor ; it is made evident that he was one of the most temperate of men at a time when temperance was rather less valued than at present , and that , surely , is all that need be proved .

		But such a book speaks more favorably for itself than any reviewer , however sympathetic , can possibly speak for it .

		As it stands , it is a monument of patient labor , almost as conspic - uous for what it rejects as for what it includes , for it is evident that everything has been duly weighed .

		Matters made public as recently as
February	DATE	last find due place in its pages ; noth - ing has been neglected that adds to a rounded 410 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	conception of a great man .

		The book will stand as an impressive memorial both to its subject and to its biographer .

		In its external aspects the volume is dignified and comely .

		An analytical index , probably the fullest and most serviceable ever included in a Lincoln biography , will be welcomed by every reader and will give the work a unique refer - ence value in the library .

		Two portraits of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, one a strikingly characteristic study by Mr.
J. N. Marble	PERSON	never before reproduced , together with a portrait of the author , are included .

GERMANY	LOCATION	'S DREAMS OF EXPANSION .

		* `` The vital factor in the modern interna - tional situation , '' asserts Professor Usher in his recently published treatise on Pan-Germanism , '' is the aggression of
Germany	LOCATION	, her determina - tion to expand her territories , to increase her wealth and power . ''

		The general fact is one with which the world is familiar , one which , indeed , the world is given little opportunity to forget .

		The full and final import of it , how - ever , is considered in some quarters to be such as few men even dream .

		In his description of the Pan-German movement , Professor Usher has sought both to lay bare the hidden forces of German aggrandizement , thus seriously con - ceived , and to forecast the consequences of it for the principal nations of
Europe	LOCATION	, for our own country , and for the world at large .

		The basal factors in the existing situation are assumed to be so obvious and so familiar as to call for little more than mention : the amazing rapidity of the growth of
Germany	LOCATION	as a national power , the phenomenal rate of increase of the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	's population , the multiplication of in - dustries and the ever-growing pressure for mar - kets , the rapidly diminishing area of the lands remaining to be brought under profitable culti - vation .

		The logic of cold facts , it is declared , points , and can point only , to expansion . ''

		To ask a German whether the expansion of
Germany	LOCATION	is desirable is merely to ask him whether he believes it desirable from any point of view for the German nation to survive .

		Of course there can be but one reply .

		Ex - pansion in
Europe	LOCATION	, however , can take place only at the expense of other and independent states , either the pow - erful rivals ,
France	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, or the weaker neighbors ,
Belgium	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	,
Sweden	LOCATION	; and even if such acquisitions were to be made the difficulty would not be solved , for the real problem is to find territory suitable for German exploitation and settlement which is not * PAN-GERMANISM .

		already heavily populated , at least not populated with men and women of an advanced type of civilization .

		The conclusion is that
Germany	LOCATION	must seek added dominion , not alone in
Europe	LOCATION	, but in the temperate and produc - tive portions of the outlying world ; and not merely on land , but on the sea , to the end that she may command highroads to and from her possessions which shall be safe from the attacks of her enemies . ''

		These are the considerations upon which the Pan-Germans base their propaganda .

		The essentials of their programme are set forth by the writer as follows : '' The Germans consider perfectly feasible the con - struction of a great confederation of states including
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	,
Hungary	LOCATION	, the
Balkan States	LOCATION	, and
Turkey	LOCATION	, which would control a great band of territory stretching southeast from the
North Sea	LOCATION	to the
Persian Gulf	LOCATION	.

		A railway from
Constantinople	LOCATION	to
Baghdad	LOCATION	would effectually tie the great trunk lines , leading from the Rhine and Danube valleys , to
Constanti	PERSON	- nople and the
Persian Gulf	LOCATION	, and so establish a shorter route to
India	LOCATION	than that via
Suez	ORGANIZATION	.


Egypt	LOCATION	,
Syria	LOCATION	,
Arabia	LOCATION	,
Persia	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	herself , the mother of nations , would fall into German hands and be held safe from conquest by this magnificent overland route to the
East	LOCATION	.

		Pan-Germanism is , therefore , in the first place , a defensive movement for self-preservation , for escap - ing the pressure of
France	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	, both bent on her destruction .

		It is , in the second place , an offensive movement directed against
England	LOCATION	, its object , the conquest of the English possessions in the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	and in
Asia	LOCATION	.

		She expects thus to obtain an outlet for her surplus population and manufactures and to create an empire as little vulnerable politically , economically , or strategically as any the world has yet seen . ''

		In so far as these purposes are known , they are denounped by other nations as involving a return to the methods of sheer force long ago outgrown , presumably , by the civilized world .

		The Germans , however , we are told , `` derisively point to the presence of the English in
India	LOCATION	, of the French in
Morocco	LOCATION	, of the Russians in
Manchuria	LOCATION	, of the
United States	LOCATION	in
Panama	LOCATION	, '' and insist that their own aims and methods are '' absolutely identical with those their de - tractors have so long employed . ''

		The question that arises perhaps most insistently in the reader 's mind is , In how far is the programme thus outlined concurred in by , or even known to , the mass of the German people ?

		In other words , Is Pan-Germanism essentially national in its constituency and spirit ?

		Upon this point we are given no very definite information .

		Per - haps the obscurities surrounding the subject are so impenetrable that definite information can not be had .

		`` The extent to which the German nation as a whole , '' we are told , `` is conscious of the existence of Pan-Germanism is not demonstrable .

		There can be no doubt that the
Government	ORGANIZATION	has consistently attempted to shape public opinion in favor of it . ''

		That
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 411 Germans of all parties and sects appreciate the seriousness of the economic problem by which the country is confronted can not be gainsaid ; nor , indeed , that the impulse which constitutes the driving force of Pan-Germanism is present , and is realized in some measure , in other coun - tries even as in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		And in
Germany	LOCATION	at least , the tendency of government influence , of education , and of literature is distinctly to accentuate the high mission and the unlimited possibilities of the nation .

		Whatever the pres - ent situation , the Pan-German ideal appears not unlikely , as time goes on , to be stamped more indelibly than ever upon the national consciousness .

		In the judgment of Professor Usher , the pros - pect of the realization of the ideal is dubious .

		After due allowance has been made for the many elements of strength in the programme , the final impression seems rather to be one of essential weakness and uncertainty .

		The strongest evi - dence to be had at present of the feasibility of the Pan-German idea is affirmed to be the sheer fact that `` the statesmen and diplomats of
Europe	LOCATION	, who know more about the situation than historians ever will , believe that its success is probable , '' and have so believed '' for more ' than a generation '' ; and , furthermore , the fact that in the autumn of
1912	DATE	circumstances so shaped themselves that the Pan-German confederation was apparently within measurable distance of completion .

		After all , however , this is incon - clusive .

		And over against these considerations must be set the extreme difficulty of creating any such confederation as that which the Pan - Germans expect to bring into existence for the furthering of their plans .

		It is the belief of the author that the subversion of the naval and commercial power of
Great Britain	LOCATION	might more readily be accomplished than the proposed recon - struction of the continent ; yet this is the second , rather than the first , point in the present pro- gramme . ''

		Pan-Germanism , '' it is asserted , '' is weakest at its centre .

		Its success is least prob - able at home .

		Withoufthe cooperation of Aus - tria and
Italy	LOCATION	, the scheme is impossible '' ; and it is easy to show , not only that scarcely two gen - erations ago the relations of the present members of the Triplice were fundamentally hostile , but that the spirit of distrust and jealousy among them is still such as to threaten any great pro- gramme of political reconstruction involving their cooperation .

		The instability of the racial situation , the growth of socialism , and the tradi - tional effectiveness of English diplomacy and naval power are cited as additional obstacles of large import .

		Altogether , the programme seems too ambitious to be possible of more than very partial realization .

		But undoubtedly it will continue to supply a key to much that is vital in world politics and diplomacy .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The imperial
William Scott Ferguson	PERSON	, development of whose work on '' Hellenistic
Athens	LOCATION	'' ancient
Greece	LOCATION	.

		was rev iewed in THE DIAL last year , holds the chair of Ancient History at
Harvard Uni	ORGANIZATION	- versity ; and has apparently been devoting especial attention to the field of
Hellenistic Greece	LOCATION	.

		As a companion volume to the above-mentioned book , he has just issued a work entitled '' Greek Imperialism '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , containing seven lectures delivered at the
Lowell Institute	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	, in
Febru	LOCATION	- ary of this year .

		In the earlier chapters the main lines of imperial development in
Greece	LOCATION	are traced .

		In the others , Mr.
Ferguson	PERSON	discusses the imperial growths in the Greek city-states as illustrated in the empires of
Athens	LOCATION	,
Sparta	LOCATION	,
Alexander	PERSON	, the Ptolemies ,
Seleucids	LOCATION	, and Antigonids .

		Claiming continuity of constitutional development within the whole period , he insists that while the city-state reached its greatest efficiency in the time of
Pericles	LOCATION	, yet the federation was still being perfected
two hundred years later	DATE	.

		To which he adds the dictum : '' In government , as in science , the classic age was but the youthful bloom of
Greece	LOCATION	, whereas its vigorous maturity in which it was cut down by
Rome	LOCATION	came in the Macedonian time . ''

		This is calculated to open the eyes of the intelligent reader who has been accustomed to think of the Hellenistic Age as a period of decline .

		The author 's brief and original statement of his thesis is this : `` The city-states of
Greece	LOCATION	were uni - cellular organisms with remarkable insides , and they were incapable of growth except by subdivision .

		They might reproduce their kind indefinitely , but the cells , new and old , could not combine to form a strong nation .

		Thus it happened that after
Athens	LOCATION	and
Sparta	LOCATION	had tried in vain to convert their hegemonies over
Greece	LOCATION	into empires , a cancerous condition arose in
Hellas	LOCATION	, for which the proper remedy was not to change the internal constitutions of city-states , as
Plato	ORGANIZATION	and Aristotle taught , but to change the texture of their cell walls so as to enable them to adhere firmly to one another .

		With a con - servatism thoroughly in harmony with the later character of the Greek people , the Greeks struggled against this inevit - able and salutary change .

		But in the end they had to yield ; saving , however , what they could of their urban separate - ness , while creating quasi-territorial states by the use of the federal ` system and deification of rulers . ''

		It must be admitted that the scientific working out of this theory will be followed with less interest than the detached and vigorous narratives which form its several supports .

		The explanation of the Athenian kelicea -LRB- popular jury-courts -RRB- and ecclesia -LRB- popular assembly -RRB- is not very clear at first reading ; while the description of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	of five hundred and its constituent prytanes a somewhat perplexing ar - 412 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	rangement is perfectly lucid ; and Mr.
Ferguson	PERSON	's characterization of the Athenians as a '' nation of noblemen '' and of their ecclesia as `` high-class am - ateurs '' is both striking and just .

		The curious and impressive contrast between
Athens	LOCATION	and
Sparta	LOCATION	is emphasized , and the little-appreciated fact brought out that Spartan institutions as we generally regard them succeeded a many-sided and progressive cul - ture , which was crushed out , to the end that her citi - zens might become trained soldiers having but one spirit , the esprit de corps of a professional army .

		A warning to some modern educators is contained in this remark of Mr.
Ferguson	PERSON	's : `` The singleness of purpose with which
Sparta	ORGANIZATION	made vocational training the aim of her public education achieved the happy result that she had no men of letters to betray to posterity damaging secrets of state . ''

		The way in which the world-empire of Alexander the Great broke up at his death and threw off nebulous frag - ments each destined to become a powerful kingdom is graphically described by Mr.
Ferguson	PERSON	in the chapters devoted to the empires of the Ptolemies ,
Seleucids	LOCATION	, and
Antigonids	LOCATION	; and there is a brief but weighty concluding section tracing the fluctuations and transfers of power among the various leagues Achaean ,
Hellenic	ORGANIZATION	, and others with
Macedon	PERSON	as the interfering and controlling factor , down to the time when the real world-conqueror stepped in , wrested from
Macedon	LOCATION	its chances , and began those attacks on Hellenic independence which culminated at
Corinth	LOCATION	in 146 B. c .

		The book is well printed , is provided with an index , and has a select bibliography after each chapter .

		On page 42 `` pitch '' is prob - ably intended for pith '' ; Chronus '' -LRB- p. 143 -RRB- should be `` Kronos '' or `` Cronus . ''

		Some time ago we had the pleasure of reviewing a book called Survival and Reproduction '' by Mr.
Herman Reinheimer	PERSON	.

		This consisted of a vigorous plea , intended to be at once scientific and transcendental , in behalf of vegetarianism .

		The plea must have failed , in some degree at least , because the same au - thor now comes forward with another work , `` Evo - lution by Cooperation : A Study in Bio-Economics '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , which in essentials is as like the former as two peas from the very same pod .

		The thinking here is just as muddy , and the diction just as tur - gidly technical , as ever .

		And best of all , `` Bio - Economics '' turns out to be our old friend vegetar - ianism in a new disguise .

		Now a vegetarian diet is undoubtedly a good thing for those who like that sort of thing .

		But to attempt to make it the basis of all evolution , philosophy , ethics , and the problems of sex is going a bit too far .

		It is open to question whether the method of injunction should not be brought to bear to restrain Mr.
Reinheimer	PERSON	from correlating all things cosmic with cabbages , which he seems in a fair way to do unless somehow held in check .

		The present volume contains one novelty in the form of a most enticing mystery .

		At various places in the book , cryptic references are made to '' Love - Foods . ''

		Nowhere are we told precisely what these delectable morsels are .

		One wonders .

		Is a '' love-food '' a new sort of super-heated , steam-rolled , fine-combed breakfast cereal , or is it a
Burbank	LOCATION	creation perchance a new variety of cucumber , or finally is it a new
Eustace Miles	ORGANIZATION	entree ?

		To pon - der the problem is only to become the more baffled .

		Mr.
Reinheimer	PERSON	has a weakness for quotations as chapter headings .

		The range of authors so quoted extends all the way from
King Solomon	LOCATION	to
Henry Drummond	PERSON	.

		For utter irrelevancy they are only to be surpassed by the concatenation of ideas in the text itself .

		There are six classic lines , however , whicli ought to stand at the beginning of the first chapter of each of Mr.
Reinheimer	PERSON	's books .

		They fit the case more aptly than anything else which could be found in the whole realm of literature .

		They are : '' ' The time has come , ' the Walrus said , ' To talk of many things : Of shoes and ships and sealing wax Of cabbages and kings And why the sea is boiling hot And whether pigs have wings . ' ''

Edward S. Corwin	PERSON	's volume for national , .

		, j , , - vr , i c > supremacy in entitled '' .

		National Supremacy : treaty - making .

		Treaty Power vs. State Power '' -LRB-
Holt	PERSON	-RRB- is a study of relations between the federal treaty power and the state police power .

		The author 's thesis is that the treaty power is practi - cally unrestricted by constitutional limitations , the sole checks to its abuse being of a political nature .

		After disposing of all constitutional limitations on the treaty power , he undertakes to show that the federal treaty power is unrestricted by any state powers .

		Under the Articles of Confederation the treaty power was regarded as supreme .

		Paragraph 2 of Article vi .

		of the Constitution clearly indicates national supremacy in this regard , and the courts early adhered to this view .

		Though a different attitude was evolved in certain judicial dicta in the period of `` states rights '' agitation before the Civil War , the original precedents have never been over - ruled .

		By the theory of the federal Constitution , there are no `` reserved '' state powers which the federal government may not encroach upon if it does so in the pursuance of a constitutional power or a power `` necessary and proper '' for carrying into effect some specified constitutional authority .

		Present-day constitutional jurisprudence upholds national supremacy , as also does the vast prepon - derance of learned opinion on the subject ; in proof of which the author cites Kent , Story ,
Calhoun	PERSON	, Gushing , and
Willoughby	PERSON	.

		In concluding , Mr.
Corwin	PERSON	summarizes his reasons for believing the treaty power to be supreme over state authority .

		He also points out several reasons why no vital dangers to the rights of the states need be appre - hended from this view .

		The political check offered by the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and frequently also by the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	, together with the consideration that national policy and state interests are in most cases identical , he thinks will always be sufficient
1913	DATE	-RSB- 413 to prevent any abuse of the treaty-making power .

		The whole question is treated solely from a consti - tutional standpoint ; and while the author intimates that political expediency will always be an impor - tant factor in the execution of treaties , this phase of the matter is not dwelt upon .

		The main theme of the work has to do with the treaty-making power , but the general question of federal suprem - acy in other fields is also discussed .

		The book is a careful and scholarly piece of work , and its argu - ment for national supremacy in the field of treaty - making seems to be irrefutable from a constitutional standpoint .

		__________ The short ttorv Four recent works on the short story at literature and illustrate the different ways in which a * merchandise .

		this form of literature is viewed .

		Professor
Henry S. Canby	PERSON	's '' Study of the Short Story '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , though intended for college classes and general readers , presents the results of scholarly investigations that have already won the respect even of those who differ most radically from the author 's conclusions .

		The first seventy-five pages of the book trace the development of the short story in English , from mediaeval times to the present .

		The remaining two hundred pages are occupied by eleven selected illustrative tales .

		Like all collections , this latter part will call forth individual question and protest .

		Why , for instance , is the work of Kipling , or even the uncopyrighted work of Kipling , represented by `` On Greenhow Hill '' ?

		The preliminary essay is concise and interestingly written ; and the fact that the author refers for evidence and fuller discussion to his earlier book , '' The Short Story in English , '' defends him from the charge of being dogmatic on mooted questions .

		Mr.
Nathaniel C. Fowler	PERSON	, Jr. , begins `` The Art of Story - Writing '' -LRB-
Sully & Klein	ORGANIZATION	- teich -RRB- with the assertion that '' The writing of stories ... may be considered as a trade '' ; and his book is one of several which appeal to untrained persons who wish easy directions as to how to secure literary fame and large publisher 's checks .

		The remarks on the construction and technique of the short story are very general , and many of them very trite .

		The directions regarding the form of MS. , dealings with publishers , etc. , are more explicit , and may be safely followed .

		These instructions regard - ing the mechanical matters of authorship may be useful to the man who by critical study and practice has come to understand the literary form that he attempts .

		Unfortunately , many of the readers of Mr.
Fowler	PERSON	's manual will never see a book like Professor
Canby	PERSON	's , and would lack the acquaintance with literature to appreciate it if they did .

		Similar in aim to Mr.
Fowler	PERSON	's book is '' The Art of Short Story Writing Simplified , '' in which Dr.
Modeste Hannis Jordan	PERSON	of '' The Writer 's Magazine '' gives in fifty diminutive pages the whole secret of winning editorial approval , including a two-page `` list of verbs to indicate speech or reply . ''

		Mr.
Benjamin A. Heydriek	PERSON	's `` Types of the Short Story '' -LRB-
Scott , Foresman & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a modest little volume intended A queen of shreds and patches .

		primarily for students of secondary schools , but of possible value to other readers .

		It contains thirteen stories , the choice of which is perhaps as satisfactory as that in most collections , with brief but sensible critical comments and good working bibliographies .

		In his volume on '' Mme. Tallien : Notre Damede Thermidor '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- ,
M. Gastine	PERSON	appears less as a biog - rapher than as an avenging spirit .

		He confesses that he has been prompted to his severities `` by thoughts of her guilty participation in the craven and criminal deeds of the Revolutionaries . ''

		He even expresses resentment at the attempts of the Chimay family , into which she finally married , to suppress the documents bearing upon her early adventures .

		The translator has emphasized this attitude by changing the secondary title from `` Heine du Directoire , '' which the book bore at its publica - tion in
Paris	LOCATION
four years ago	DATE	, to `` A Queen of Shreds and Patches . ''

		The single deed to which the Tal - liens owed a brief popularity was the part they took in the overthrow of
Robespierre	LOCATION	.

		According to a familiar legend , Mme.
Tallien	PERSON	, then the divorced wife of the
Marquis de Fontenay	PERSON	and a prisoner at
La Force	ORGANIZATION	, sent a letter to
Tallien	PERSON	, her lover , accus - ing him of cowardice in leaving her to perish , accompanying the message by a Spanish dagger with which to strike down the '' Tyrant . ''

		This legend
M. Gastine	PERSON	seeks to discredit .

		He declares that Tallien could not have been spurred to action by love for his mistress '' for the simple reason that he was incapable of a genuine affection . ''

		He also argues that the part taken by
Tallien	PERSON	in the affair of the Ninth of Thermidor was unimportant .

		It has long been known that , while
Tallien	PERSON	's role was spectacular , the real engineer of
Robespierre	LOCATION	's destruction was
Fouche	PERSON	' .

		But anyone who reads without prejudice the story of the struggle in the Convention will not feel that
Tallien	PERSON	was the coward
M. Gastine	PERSON	believes him to have been .

		M. Gastine follows the discussion of this affair by an account of Mme.
Tallien	PERSON	's adventures during the period of the Directory and of the
Consulate	ORGANIZATION	.

		He treats more summarily the
last thirty years	DATE	of her life , after the voice of scandal ceased to be occupied witboher , except retrospectively .

		His rhetorical Denunciations of both the Talliens are multiplied wearisomely , and details are given which belong more appropriately in a chronique scandaleuse .

		The romantic lt would be interesting if one could story of learn how the Latin races regard the
California	LOCATION	.

		earlier English settlements on the American continents .

		Do they , we wonder , find in these exploits any of the spirit of high romance that de
Heredia	PERSON	found in the deeds of the
Conquista	LOCATION	- dores as indicated in that wonderful sonnet about them .

		For it is certain that even those of us who trace our American origin back to early
Virginia	LOCATION	and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	fail to find , even in the records of Pocahontas and
King Philip	LOCATION	, any of the thrill 414 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	that attaches to the early Spanish and French adventures in the
New World	LOCATION	.

		On this account , the most interesting portions of American history are not yet firmly fixed in the popular mind ; for the southwestern and
Pacific Coast	ORGANIZATION	commonwealths have seldom found historians and poets to do for them what has been done for the more northerly
Atlantic States	LOCATION	.

		All of which is merely preliminary to an expression of satisfaction that in `` The Story of
California	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , Mr.
Henry K. Norton	PERSON	should have incorporated so much of the charm of the beginnings .

		The aboriginal inhabitants were devoid of charm ; and there is a distinct loss of interest when the gold-seekers of
1849	DATE	, Argonauts though they were called , arrive to destroy the older charm of the missions and the great estates of the Spanish .

		But this is only the romantic view ; there was an abundance of event in
California	LOCATION	's history , and life in the state has not yet become dull .

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	is fortunate in holding little or no prejudice to distort his pages .

		Even so quarrel-provoking a topic as that of
Fremont	LOCATION	's asserted conquest is treated with a dispassion that makes further quar - relling needless .

		The sub-title of the book notes that its story runs `` from the earliest days to the present , '' and in fact the ground is covered from the days of the Digger Indian to the approaching exhibition in honor of the opening of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal .

		Nothing of consequence is omitted , and the tale is told smoothly and animatedly .

		The book is heartily commended to all who wish to satisfy themselves that this nation really borders upon two oceans .

		The problem The appearance of the substantial of university volume on `` University Control '' control .

		-LRB- Science Press -RRB- , edited by Professor
J. McKeen Cattell	PERSON	, the chief contributor , gives op - portunity to reinforce the place of this vital move - ment in the present educational situation .

		THE DIAL has repeatedly expressed its approval of this desire for a professional status on the part of the university professor .

		The present volume makes it possible to present the basis of this reform in a dignified and impressive manner .

		It has a special message for those authoritatively connected with the administration of universities .

		The volume begins with a series of essays by Professor
Cattell	PERSON	, indica - ting the undesirable status of the professor 's present position , together with a brief account of its his - tory and a programme for reform .

		This is fol - lowed by a series of extracts from two hundred letters , in turn selected from a still larger number , presenting a variety of views but with an over - whelming agreement in favor of an urgent and com - prehensive change .

		The purpose of the reform is to give the faculty as a whole and the professor as an individual a decisive voice and an influential rep - resentation in the direction of university affairs .

		If it succeeds , it may save a career in serious danger of further degeneration , and may reinstate the Amer - can university on a footing comparable to the uni - versities of foreign lands .

		The third portion of the book contains a group of essays upon special phases of the problem of university control , contributed by ten writers .

		Eight of these are university pro- fessors ; one is a man of business who has held a position of trustee ; and the last is a university presi - dent .

		It is probable that these individual essays , carrying as they do a more direct appeal and a vigor - ous personal statement , will create the sympathetic atmosphere predisposing to a favorable hearing .

		The collection in a single volume of the data showing how universal is the protest against the status quo , a definite programme of reform , and a varied expres - sion of dissatisfaction , should succeed in giving this problem the right of way which its urgency demands .

		It is with more than the usual sense of approval and good wishes that this book is welcomed as an instru - ment in the cause of higher education .

		Thin s seen Miss
Helen Keller	PERSON	's fine refusal of an with the mind 's endowment , and her determination eyes only .

		^ o win her own way as one of the world 's workers , in spite of her tremendous handi - cap , have gained her the increased admiration and respect of her friends and of the larger public ; and in her latest book , '' Out of the Dark '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , she again demonstrates her ability to stand on her own merits as a thinker and writer .

		She follows with alertness and understanding the news of the great world about her , and writes with conviction on such topics of general interest as `` The Modern Woman , '' `` How to Become a Writer , '' and `` The New College Girl , '' as well as on subjects connected with the treatment and education of the blind and of the deaf .

		Bits of autobiography occur in such chapters as `` How I Became a Socialist , '' `` Christ - mas in the Dark , '' and `` An Apology for Going to College . ''

		In fact , it is the writer 's personality that gives peculiar interest and meaning to what she writes .

		One likes her modest answer to the blind boy asking her how to become a writer : `` Alas !

		I do not know how to become one myself .

		No one can be taught to write . ''

		But she gives him some good advice , good for the seeing as well as for the sight - less .

		Pathetic is her lament , in connection with a widespread report of her having become a socialist , luat the subject is aired , not because the newspapers care anything about socialism , `` but because I , alas , am a subject for newspaper gossip . ''

		The volume contains , as the preface announces , `` all hitherto uncollected magazine articles and addresses which seem for any reason worth preserving in book form . ''

		It supplements in a notable manner `` The Story of My Life '' and `` The World I Live In . ''

		An introduction `` Working-men 's lectures '' were , in to the study Huxley 's day , the occasion of some of Evolution .

		popular scientific writing which has never been surpassed in excellence .

		Apparently this kind of stimulus has not entirely lost its potency .

		Not long ago Dr.
S. Herbert	PERSON	published , under the title of '' The First Principles of Heredity , '' a series
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 415 of lectures given to a class of working-men .

		This is now followed by a similar series , dealing with a closely related topic , `` The First Principles of Evo - lution '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author has endeavored to give a simple , comprehensive , and scientific pres - entation of the problem of evolution , and the pro- gress which has been made towards its solution .

		It is fair to say that he has succeeded very well at this by no means easy task .

		Mr.
Herbert	PERSON	writes in a clear , straightforward way , and shows excellent judgment in the choice and treatment of his mate - rial .

		The discussion of the `` higher '' aspects of evolution is much more adequate , both in amount and character , than is ordinarily the case in ele - mentary treatises .

		Special chapters are devoted to `` Mental Evolution , '' `` Moral Evolution , '' and `` The Evolution of Society . ''

		Apparently the most pains - taking care has been given -LRB- as is proper -RRB- to the verification of quotations and proof-reading .

		But in spite of this punctiliousness , the reader who chanced to open the book at page 255 and looked at the run - ning head would be in doubt as to whether the chap - ter on '' Morel Evolution '' dealt with mushrooms or ethics .

		But these are crosses which everyone who writes must bear .

		The book as a whole may be rec - ommended without qualification as an excellent in - troduction to the subject of evolution , both for the general reader and for college classes in biology .

		Roman lessons J * is alwa y s .

		gratifying to find men for the in public life who still adhere to
United	ORGANIZATION	states .

		Macaulay 's tenet that history is phi - losophy teaching by examples , and believe that the wise statesman or economist of the present will con with eagerness the lessons of the past .

		As to the particular period of history that offers the most in - structive parallels to our own problems , there must be some doubt ; but many thinkers would agree with
Senator J. Hamilton Lewis	PERSON	, author of `` Two Great Republics '' -LRB-
Rand	ORGANIZATION	,
McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in selecting ancient
Rome	LOCATION	.

		`` The five centuries of republican institutions on the banks of the Tiber still remain the richest quarry to which the student of republican governments is able to resort . ''

		In this belief the author reviews the course of Roman history to the establishment of the Empire , and sets forth the les - sons he has been able to read in the period .

		In the more strictly historical portions Senator
Lewis	PERSON	does not hesitate to traverse the verdict of eminent men , like
Mommsen	PERSON	, confidently and even pugnaciously , as may be seen , for example , in his trenchant treat - ment of
Julius Caesar	PERSON	; but it would scarcely be expected that this should prove the significant fea - ture of his work .

		In fact its essence lies in the conclusions formulated in the first chapter and the two closing chapters of the book .

		Herein Senator
Lewis	PERSON	is suggestive and stimulating , although the thoughtful reader will often find himself unable to see eye to eye with the author .

		To the reviewer , however , the interest of the volume is neither in the historical sketch nor in the conclusions per se , but in the fact that
Senator Lewis	PERSON	has declared himself so forcibly and tangibly in favor of the spirit suggested in our opening sentence .

		If any country at any hour ever needed to be reminded that the path toward to-morrow can not best be built by closing our eyes to the lessons of the past , surely it is our own country at the present hour .

		Mrs.
Emily Huntington Miller	PERSON	, a writer of graceful verse and for several years -LRB- 1891-8 -RRB- dean of the woman 's department at
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	, died 416 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	on the
1st of this month	DATE	at
Northfield	LOCATION	,
Minn.	LOCATION	.

		She was born in
1833	DATE	.

		From
1867	DATE	to
1875	DATE	she edited The Little Corporal , '' a Western magazine for children which was afterwards merged with '' St.
Nicholas	PERSON	. ''

		Mrs.
Miller	PERSON	's published works include four volumes of poems , and a long list of stories for children .

		The annual list of '' The Mosher Books '' is so much more than a mere book catalogue that we feel justified , as heretofore , in warmly commending the new issue to our readers ' notice .

		The unique and handsome typog - raphy , the interspersed lyrics from various out-of-the - way sources , the eloquent introductory tribute to Rus - kin , all go to make this brochure something that every proper book-lover should wish to possess for its own sake , quite apart from its character as a list of the most distinctive book-wares offered by any American publisher .

		A revised and enlarged edition of its '' Handbook of the Libraries of the
University	ORGANIZATION	'' is published by the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, giving a full history and descrip - tion of the
Harper	PERSON	memorial building and information concerning the various book collections housed there and elsewhere in the
University	ORGANIZATION	, with instructions for the intelligent use of these resources .

		A fine view of the new building , with plans of its several floors , and with other pertinent and interesting matter , will be found in the Handbook .

		ALFRED
RUSSEL WALLACE	PERSON	.

		The doyen of English scientists , Dr.
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	, died on the 7th of this month , in his ninety - first year .

		In the establishment of the doctrine of evolution on a scientific basis , his name will always be linked with that of
Darwin	LOCATION	, as he had independently thought out the theory on which
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	's work is based before the latter 's results were placed before the public ; but in generously yielding the field to his rival he gave to the world perhaps the finest of all examples of that spirit of personal disinterestedness in which science is rich beyond any other field of human endea - vor .

		He was born
January 8 , 1823	DATE	, in
Monmouthshire	LOCATION	, and at an early age fitted himself for work as a sur - veyor and engineer .

		Soon , however , a marked bent for natural science began to assert itself .

		In
1848	DATE	he joined the South American expedition organized by
H. W. Bates	PERSON	; and the following fourteen years of his life were mainly spent in scientific collecting and research work throughout
South America	LOCATION	and the
Malay Archi	ORGANIZATION	- pelago .

		In 1886-7 he visited
America	LOCATION	, travelling from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the
Pacific	LOCATION	.

		Numerous scientific studies of the first importance have appeared from his pen .

		But it was not to science alone that he devoted his fine intellectual powers .

		Always an interested student of sociology , he had the keenest of eyes for detecting the rotten timbers in our social structure , and was fearless in expressing his carefully-reached convictions , however radical .

		The more fundamental tenets of Socialism had his endorsement ; he was President for a long term of years of the
Land Nationalization Society	ORGANIZATION	, advocat - ing constantly those policies with reference to the soil which the Liberal government in
England	LOCATION	is now putting into practice .

		As in the case of
Ruskin	LOCATION	, his heterodoxy brought upon him a liberal measure of abuse and ridicule from the hidebound of his own coun - try and ours ; but , like
Ruskin	PERSON	, he never recanted or compromised in the face of obloquy .

		His life has been a long and noble service to humanity , performed in a spirit of modest self-effacement as rare almost as the achievement itself .

		In The Story of the Early Sea People are embodied the stirring and inspiring elements of the old myths and tales of fairy princes , yet it is really a chronicle of our prehistoric ancestors based on the most authentic knowledge of them obtainable .

		Vivid incidents show how an inland tribe , forced to the seacoast by oncoming foes and the need of a more bountiful food supply , gradually become adapted to a seafaring life .

		By accident , ingenuity , and observation , they convert the materials about them to their use , and their final conquest of the waters , when once more driven in search of a better home , forms the climax of a remarkable and fascinating book .

Dec. 1	DATE	NEALE 'S FOR DECEMBER Our Alien Army By
General R. K. Evans	PERSON	,
U. S. A. Relatively	PERSON	few persons know the political status of the man who binds himself to give his life if need be to ` the American people .

		That he is an alien on whom is inflicted the punishment of disfranchisement seems beyond belief .

		Yet , crisply and authoritatively , General
Evans	PERSON	, who com - mands the
Second Brigade	ORGANIZATION	,
First Division	ORGANIZATION	, with
Headquarters	ORGANIZATION	at
Atlanta	LOCATION	, and who is perhaps the leading authority of the world on infantry fire , tells us that our national army is really denationalized .

		He does more than this , he suggests a practical remedy for the loss of the political rights of our soldiers , and offers a proposal that , if carried out , will bring about the restoration of the degraded enlisted soldier to useful citizenship .

		The General bravely thrusts his sword into the cancer that is consuming the most vital member of our body politic , the army that protects it .

		Five Great Serials By
Five Eminent Authors	ORGANIZATION	`` The Walls of Concarneau , '' by
George K. Baker	PERSON	, author of ''
Haliefa	PERSON	, '' is a novel broidered on the historic fabric of the struggle of the devoted Bretons to hold
Brittany	PERSON	against the French for the young Duchess Anne ; `` Broken Lights , '' by
Mowry Saben	PERSON	, who is among
America	LOCATION	's foremost essayists , is the general title given to this author 's most noteworthy essays , which are now being published for the first time ; `` Brilla , '' by
Anna M. Doling	PERSON	, is an irresistible serial , the story of a lie , in which the
Ozark Mountains	LOCATION	form a picturesque background for the figures that move through this striking American novel ; `` Our Jungle Man '' is a series of highly important articles in which the relations of the white man and the black as they exist throughout the
United States	LOCATION	are discussed with the utmost freedom by prominent members of both the Caucasian and the Negro races , among these writers being Professors
Thomas Pearce Bailey	PERSON	,
Berrian Beverley	PERSON	, and
Kelly Miller	PERSON	, and Major
John R. Lynch	PERSON	; `` Into the Sunset , '' by
Edward S. Van Zile	PERSON	, author of `` With Sword and Crucifix , '' and other highly successful novels , is a story in which
Columbus	LOCATION	is the great central figure , a story of romance largely concerning two young men and two young girls , who are supposed to have accompanied
Columbus	LOCATION	on his first trip to
America	LOCATION	.

		Our Opportunity in
Latin America	LOCATION	By
James Drey	PERSON	We Americans , so-called , have never seemed to understand why we have no share in the vast affluence of
South America	LOCATION	.

		The author of this paper passed sufficient time in our twin continent to learn how neglected have been our opportunities and how beneficial to
Europe	LOCATION	are the relations exist - ing between that continent and
South America	LOCATION	.

		How to establish trade with our Southern neighbor that will increase our prosperity is the problem that Mr.
Drey	PERSON	has undertaken to solve in this article .

		Regular Departments By Six Distinguished Authors and Editors The regular departments of NEALE 'S MONTHLY alone are sufficient to make this magazine noteworthy .

		The Stage is a department of brilliant , trenchant , fearless criticism of plays , actors , and dramatists ; in Editorial Comments all sorts of subjects are treated , now seriously , now lightly , but always vigorously , fearlessly , and independently ; The Fraternity of the Fields is the eyes and the ears of him who may not be with Nature in aFl her moods ; In
Motley	ORGANIZATION	is a department of wit and humor , not mere jokes , but inoffensive pointedness , directed chiefly at persons in the limelight ; Letters to the Editors are really short articles that are written by the foremost authors and public men of our time .

		ClaSS Legislation By
William W. Crehore	PERSON	Mr.
Crehore	PERSON	's study of the tariff question , '' Our Tribute to Protection , '' that was published in NEALE 'S for
September	DATE	attracted widespread attention .

		In the present paper he treats of class distinction by legislation .

		The way in which the
Government	ORGANIZATION	selects it own beneficiaries is here explained in a masterly way .

		And he supplies new ideas to those seeking a readjustment of the principles on which our Government was founded , without encouraging the spread of Socialism , which would seem inevitable if his plan should be made effective .

		My Neighbor and Myself By Major
John R. Lynch	PERSON	This article of '' Our Jungle Man '' comes as a revelation to him who holds the idea that the Negro is merely a near-animal in his relation to affairs social , educational , religious , and political .

		Major
Lynch	PERSON	is a Negro , who rose from a lowly estate to be a Member of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, Fourth Auditor of the
United States Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, and Temporary Chairman of the
Republican National Convention	ORGANIZATION	of
1884	DATE	.

		The late Senator
Hoar	PERSON	in his book of reminiscences refers to
Major Lynch	LOCATION	as the ablest colored man who served with him in public life .

		Short Fiction By
Various Authors Short	ORGANIZATION	fiction and various timely and interesting articles , besides the features enumerated above , make NEALE 'S MONTHLY for
December	DATE	noteworthy among American magazines .

		At
$ 3.00	MONEY	a year ,

		Union Square The Neale Publishing Company
New York	LOCATION	1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 447 SELECTED FROM NEALE 'S NEW BOOKS Haliefa By
GEORGE K. BAKER	PERSON	.

		We confidently affirm that among the younger authors
America	LOCATION	possesses no greater writer of fiction than
George K. Baker	PERSON	.

		There are in '' Haliefa '' properties suggestive of Kipling , not that any influence of Kipling is there discernible , but for the reason that the story , while old as humanity itself , possesses something of the freshness that Kipling brought to literature thirty years ago .

		These prop - erties make the story essentially new .

		Brilla By
ANNA M. DOLING	PERSON	.

		This unique and irresistible story , the story of a lie , was first published seri - ally in NEALE 'S MONTHLY .

		A region yet unexplored in literature , the
Ozark Mountains	LOCATION	, forms a picturesque background for the figures that move through this striking American novel .

		Seldom is it the good for - tune of a reader to find so interesting a story written so simply and so well , yet so compellingly .

		The Devil 's Discharge By WILLARI > FRENCH .

		While the ghosts of the past are evaporating in their own mist science is giving birth to others by far more weird .

		In this story Colonel French discharges the Devil and his spirits ; but he is a trained scientist as well as a trained soldier , a great writer of fiction as well as a great war corre - spondent .

		In the place of Satan and his imps he gives us new but real spirits , all made real by science .

		A story of adventure , a story of love , '' The Devil 's Discharge '' also possesses the mysticism of the
East	LOCATION	.

		Early in his career Colonel French , whose literary work is now the talk wherever books are discussed , achieved distinction as a war correspondent in
Egypt	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, and in
South Africa	LOCATION	.

		Last autumn '' The
Dragon	ORGANIZATION	's Daughter '' was issued by our house .

		It immediately attracted widespread attention in
Europe	LOCATION	as well as in
America	LOCATION	.

		This fine story of the sea , a detective story , is un - doubtedly the most notable fiction that Mr.
Westover	PERSON	has written .

		We know of no other sea story that is comparable to it .

		It is romantic literature at its best .

		498 OLD FRIENDS IN NEW DRESS .

		With the recurrent holiday season come recurrent books , old friends in new dress .

		Though the familiar features may often be of little importance and much disguised , yet they do not fail to show themselves , here and there , recognizable under all their bravery of new trappings and modern modes ; and their pres - ence is by no means unwelcome .

		The Preach - er 's despondent iteration of the truth that there is no new thing under the sun that there is nothing whereof it may be said , See , this is new , for it hath been already of old time , which was before strikes no responsive chord in the breast of one interested in noting the count - less combinations and permutations that take place among the limited stock of themes and motives available for the use of the literary craftsman .

		It is this very union of a familiar idea or plot with a novel setting that charms and delights ; for it is sameness in variety that we crave , not an absolute newness , which would but bewilder and repel .

		When , for instance , a painting is exhibited in which a lady descend - ing a flight of stairs is represented by so novel a combination of lines and surfaces that the beholder can not distinguish lady from stairs , or indeed discern any suggestion of either without a previous consultation of the catalogue , the feeling is one of mystification and vexation ; whereas if the representation vividly recalls or even remotely suggests a certain concrete in - stance of lady and stairs , the resultant sensation may be highly pleasurable .

		The elder
Disraeli	PERSON	long ago said , in the man - ner characteristic of his time , that '' one of the most elegant of literary recreations is that of tracing poetical or prose imitations and simi - larities , '' and that `` it forms , it cultivates , it delights taste to observe by what dexterity and variation genius conceals , or modifies , an original thought or image . ''

		The reader 's enjoyment of
Wordsworth	PERSON	is not lessened by his recogni - tion of an old acquaintance in the line , `` The child is father of the man . ''

		Pope expressed the same thought when he wrote , '' The boy and man an individual makes . ''


Dryden	PERSON	put it , `` Men are but children of a larger growth . ''

		And among minor poets ,
Lloyd	PERSON	has the couplet , `` For men in reason 's sober eyes are children 464 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	but of larger size '' ; while in Mallet occurs the line , `` She kissed the father in the child , '' and someone has said in French , '' C'est que 1 ` enfant toujours est homme , c'est que 1 ` homme est toujours enfant . ''

		When the young reader discovers that the one-eyed Polyphemus of the ninth book of the `` Odyssey '' is almost identical with the `` tre - mendous black giant , as high as a tall palm - tree , with only one eye in the middle of his forehead , '' described in the third voyage of Sindbad the Sailor , and further remarks the slight variations in the two legends as , for example , the employment of ten red-hot spits in the one version to perform the office of the single immense implement in the other a new interest is imparted both to Homer and to the Arabian tales that are separated from Homer by many centuries of time .

		The usual order of reading the wanderings of Odysseus and the inventions of Scheherazade is , as indicated here , the reverse of the chronological , but need not therefore lessen the pleasure of tracing the re - semblances and differences in the two versions of the Cyclops myth .

		If also the young reader chances to discover a certain likeness to Sche - herazade in the biblical
Esther	PERSON	, the interest is further enriched and enlarged .

		But , on second thought , it is altogether probable that the young reader , if he be not a prig , will care not a straw for these studies in comparative literature until he has grown into an old reader .

		Another familiar example .

		A reader of the
Sherlock Holmes	PERSON	stories will enjoy them none the less for their reminding him of the preter - natural acuteness of observation displayed by
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's Zadig in that ingenious episode of chapter three which begins , '' Un jour , se prome - nant auprds d'un petit bois , '' etc. .

		Also , to cite still another familiar instance , one 's enjoyment of
Tennyson	PERSON	's `` Idylls of the King '' is likely to be heightened by a previous acquaintance with the `` Morte d'Arthur , '' despite the fact that
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	feels bound to confess , in his recently-published letters , that he found the step from
Malory	LOCATION	to Tennyson a descent . ''

		I like old Sir
Thomas Malory	PERSON	better , '' he says .

		In the same department of literature , once more , the lover of
Wagner	PERSON	's `` Parsifal '' will trace with zest the influence of
Chretien de Troyes	ORGANIZATION	and
Wolfram von Eschenbach	PERSON	.

		But enough of these ancient illustrations , which will more than suffice to emphasize the truth , lately re-affirmed by the genial author of `` A One-Sided Autobiography , '' that it is `` like meeting an old friend to come across the same plot , or incident , or figure , or even verbal expression , in writers of different times and different lands . ''

		In turning over some recent numbers of the '' Easy Chair , '' attention was attracted to a witty and playful disquisition on current American fiction , in the course of which occurred the following -LRB- the immediate connection of which is unimportant -RRB- : '' The fact was interestingly illustrated a little while ago , in the contrasting receptions which American and English criti - cism gave an American novel treating of the average American life , in characters drawn from those wide levels of society which were once our boast .

		It was a simple story of the fortunes of a country minister and his family : kindly , hu - man folks , with the foibles as well as the virtues of their sort .

		The father was proud of his chil - dren and of his wife 's housekeeping and thrift , and the mother was of a satisfaction in their sense and beauty , and his learning and righteous - ness , which extended to her own gifts of repartee and fatuous inconsequence of mind .

		A series of dramatic accidents deprived them of the little competence which they had enjoyed ; the engage - ment of the eldest son was broken off by the par - ents of his betrothed ; the youngest was buncoed out of part of the little money that remained .

		The father lost the parish where he had long been loved and honored , and was glad to find one among farmers and laborers , with whom his wife and daughters were obliged to associate .

		The elder daughter was deceived by a mock marriage , and the false lover had the effrontery to pursue the younger after the ruin of her sister .

		This scoundrel found means to persecute the father and to secure his imprisonment , while the family sank lower and lower into misery .

		Then , by the magic which novelists possess , the uncle of the wicked lover offers himself to the younger daughter , the father is freed from jail , and restored to the enjoyment of his property and his old parish ; the daughter 's marriage turns out to have been performed by a real clergyman ; the eldest son 's engagement is re - newed ; the sharper who plundered the boy is arrested , and all ends happily . ''

		This unex - pected meeting with our old friend Dr.
Primrose	PERSON	, even in skeleton , was an agreeable surprise , and it also aroused a momentary query whether by any possibility the writer could have had in mind an actual American work of fiction so unblush - ingly built upon this well-known English found - ation a query rather encouraged than silenced by the fact that the outline , as here quoted , dif - fers from
Goldsmith	PERSON	in one or two particulars ^
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 465 as in the '' series of dramatic accidents , '' which is wholly lacking in the '' Vicar , '' and in making the youngest son , instead of the third from the youngest , the sharper 's victim .

		But although the facetious occupant of the Easy Chair pre - serves his gravity throughout his subsequent dis - cussion of the supposed `` American novel , '' we shall spend no time hunting for the book , nor shall we make miserable the lives of any libra - rians or assistant librarians in trying to procure its identification , content to have had this chance meeting with an old friend in epitomized form , and to have enjoyed the Easy Chair-man 's innocent little hoax .

		In an actual American novel of the present year , and one that has figured conspicuously among the `` best-sellers , '' a spiritual struggle is depicted that is essentially like that which made `` Robert Elsmere '' so engrossing with readers not of a frivolous turn of mind a quarter - century ago .


John Hodder	PERSON	has , of course , his own special problems and perplexities , but it is an interest of a similar sort that is awakened by both the English and the American story , and that waits to be awakened again and again by whatsoever master shall choose to refashion the old materials in new form .

		Another note - worthy book of the season carries the reader to the rice swamps of
South Carolina	LOCATION	and shows a plucky woman wrestling with the problems of plantation-management , just as Mrs.
Raven	PERSON	- ell 's life of
Eliza Pinckney	PERSON	presented an earlier experience of the same sort in the same imme - diate region , though under more favorable auspices .

		`` A Woman Rice Planter , '' the auto - biographic record of one who signs herself `` Patience Pennington , '' has in its pages so much that is new and distinctive , and the writer is evidently a person of so heroic traits -LRB- mod - estly and unconsciously revealed -RRB- , that no addi - tion of reminiscent interest , of parallelism with an earlier narrative , such as is here indicated , was needed to insure the book an eager reading ; but it will not suffer by reason of that addition .

		Although , as
Whittier	LOCATION	says , `` the new tran - scends the old , '' he presently adds that `` the olive waves with roots deep set in battle graves . ''

		It would be but a thin and unsatisfying new - ness that did not
spring	DATE	from the old and carry much of the old with it .

		The same familiar joys and sorrows of the race have to be felt in new form by each individual , the very fact of their antiquity and their commonness giving value and meaning to the fresh expe - rience .

		The time-worn themes of literature , like abraded coins , have to be reminted ; even the separate words that clothe them lose their power of vivid appeal , and new ones , or new applications of the old ones , are called upon to take their place .

		The products , too , of the illustrator 's art that adorn the books of one generation cease to be wholly satisfying when the next generation has grown to maturity .

		Hence the pleasing certainty that each succes - sive Christmas season will in the future , as in the past , see the bookshops overflowing with literary wares not only attractive to the passing shopper , but necessary to the transmission of the torch from hand to hand down through the ages .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE REGION OF THE UNROMANTic , where statis - tics displace sentiment , and hard-and-fast certainty crowds out all the delightful possibilities that love to lurk in the penumbra of the uncertain and the problematical , is deemed by some to be the chosen abiding-place of librarians .

		Especially does the presiding genius of the information desk have the reputation of one who scorns the delights of vague - ness and lives laborious days in clearing the cob - webs of dubiety from his mind and in flooding its every nook and corner with the pitiless glare of the light of positive knowledge .

		The English delegate who attended our late
A. L. A.	PERSON	annual conference reports to his fellow-librarians at home on this zeal of our librarians for reducing the unknown if not the unknowable to its lowest terms . ''

		It is difficult , perhaps , '' he says in the course of his report , 4 < just at this time to estimate the intellectual and spiritual loss entailed on the race of men by the reaching of the two poles , reducing almost to the vanishing point those places of the earth where imagination may still lose itself untrammeled by the deadening reality of the topographer and the map-maker , and foreshadowing the time when it will be as easy to get to the poles as it is to
Bournemouth	LOCATION	.

		Let us express the hope that the librarians may leave the poles and a few other areas of what
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	calls the
Globe Intellectual	ORGANIZATION	in their virgin remoteness , untouched as long as may be by the ` civilizing ' influences of the cataloguer , the bibliographer , and all those agencies for hustled information which centre them - selves in that generally speaking excellent , but unromantic , department of the American public library known as the Information Desk . ''

		But after all , there is no real cause for alarm .

		As
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	long ago reminded his readers , the enlarg - ing of the sphere of the known , so far from dimin - ishing the volume of the unknown , only increases the amount of surface exposed to that circumjacent element , or , in other words , multiplies our points of contact with it and makes its magnitude more appreciable to the senses .

		466 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	A VANISHING TYPE OF SCHOLARSHIP , such schol - arship as the late Dr.
Furness	PERSON	possessed in addition to his vast store of Shakespeare learning , and such as
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	had acquired together with his special erudition as an eminent Dantean , is pictured in the following `` words of a contemporary , '' ap - pended to the recently published `` Letters '' of Mr.
Norton	PERSON	: `` The prescribed curriculum of our day for it had not changed much down to the time of the war had one great advantage , that it made a solidarity or freemasonry of knowledge among the graduates , which in the modern system must be very much lost .

		All graduates -LSB- of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	-RSB- possessed a common fund of learning and training which , as far as it went , represented what was expected to be known by those who called themselves educated men what had been handed down in the modern world as the summary of necessary human knowl - edge .

		And what was taught was taught accurately .

		Slovenly students there were who scraped through , but such a type as a slovenly teacher was to me almost unknown .

		To be a professor at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	under the old system was to be a ` master of those who know . '

		In this ,
Child	ORGANIZATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	, Gray ,
Gurney	ORGANIZATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	,
Lane	LOCATION	,
Torrey	LOCATION	,
Goodwin	PERSON	,
Peirce	PERSON	all the members of the Faculty resembled each other .

		They were not merely specialists , but belonged to the old fraternity of scholars to none of whom any branch of learning was alien .

		The atmosphere in which they lived was almost entirely academic .

		The idea of a college as a place primarily for distinction in sport , or even primarily for ` vocational ' objects , would have filled them with aversion . ''

		It used to be said of President
Chad bourne	PERSON	of
Williams	ORGANIZATION	that he was capable of holding any of the professorships in the college .

		Could a like assertion be made of any college president to-day ?

		INTELLIGENT BOOKSELLING , as practiced by the alert and cheerful salesman or saleswoman , well informed on literature in general and familiar with every book in the shop , is always a delight to the book-buyer .

		In marked contrast to this intelligent and wide-awake person is the dull-eyed attendant not seldom met with at the book-counter of the twentieth-century department store , whose look brightens with no glad response when perchance request is made for a copy of
Johnson	ORGANIZATION	's '' Rasselas '' or Mrs.
Shelley	PERSON	's `` Frankenstein . ''

		Instead , there probably comes a weary request to repeat the title , and then a hopeless shake of the head in half - doubtful negation , or a vague shuffling of the piles of current fiction as if in forlorn hope of discovering the book beneath `` T. Tembarom '' or mixed up with `` The Coryston Family '' and `` The Passionate Friends . ''

		The `` Bulletin '' of the Authors ' League of
America	LOCATION	calls attention to the indisputable fact that the sales-clerk is a '' most vital factor in the make-up of a successful book shop , '' and it reprints from the
London	LOCATION	`` Book Monthly '' the following , which will be news to many readers : `` It may not be known on this side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	that there is now a bookseller 's school in
America	LOCATION	.

		It has just closed a successful first year with good promise of becoming a permanent institution .

		The idea of it was to help young men in the book trade to acquire fuller knowledge of that trade in an all-round way .

		Lectures were delivered sometimes in the great book shops of
New York	LOCATION	amid very fitting surround - ings .

		This shows us that modern
America	LOCATION	appre - ciates the ancient craft of bookselling , and that if we are not careful she will be producing better booksellers than we do . ''

		PLEA FOR A RESEARCH INSTITUTE is made by Mr.
Aksel G. S. Josephson	PERSON	, chairman of the recently constituted
Committee on Research Institute	ORGANIZATION	, in a circular letter reprinted from `` Science '' of
July 11 , 1913	DATE	.

		Fifty thousand dollars , or ten thousand an - nually for five years , would suffice to establish the proposed institute on a firm basis .

		It would soon become partly self-supporting , or such is the expecta - tion , since its practical value to commerce , manufac - tures , and agriculture would be speedily recognized and its services gladly paid for .

		It would , says Mr.
Josephson	PERSON	, '' collect titles from all sources and of all dates on a definite number of subjects , concerning which information is actually wanted . ''

		It would seek the cooperation of similar establishments in other countries , such as the
Institut International de Bibliographie	ORGANIZATION	, at
Brussels	LOCATION	, and the Internationales Institut fur Sozialbibliographie , at
Berlin	LOCATION	.

		And if with the starting of the proposed research institute there could also be called into being that bibliothecal desideratum , a central library for libraries , for the collection and preservation of those large and expen - sive publications -LRB- serials , transactions , costly refer - ence books , and so on -RRB- that only a few separate libraries can now afford to buy , what more fitting headquarters for the researchers could be conceived of than this
Central Library	ORGANIZATION	for Libraries ?

		The activities of the two organizations would fit together and supplement each other like the two blades of a pair of scissors not the worst possible comparison in connection with a clipping bureau .

		Seriously , there is every reason to desire and to hope for the early success of the plan here inadequately outlined .

		THE IDEAL EDITOR , as conceived by
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	, who had himself had considerable editorial experience in connection with `` The North American Review , '' the
New England	LOCATION	Loyal Pub - lication Society , and in other less direct ways , is not one whose policy is dictated to him by the capitalist or capitalists financing his journal .

		As is well said by
Norton	ORGANIZATION	's brother-in-law , Mr.
Arthur Sedgwick	PERSON	, in a supplementary chapter to the
Norton	PERSON	`` Letters , '' '' The modern idea of an editor as a mere agent for the dissemination of readable papers on all sides of all subjects , however inconsistent with each other or with his own opinions , would have been intolerable to him ; the object he had in view was a publication for which he was willing to be responsible , with a wide range of topics and discussion , but always
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 467 with the idea of advancing what he believed to be the truth .

		It was the adherence to this plan the tradition of editorship , once almost universal which gave the periodical press of fifty years ago a weight for which no sensationalism and no amount of contributors ' names can ever make up .

		When the publication spoke , it spoke for itself ; with the combined force of all the brains and character and repute behind it . ''

		In harmony with this ideal were
Norton	ORGANIZATION	's habits and methods in all his literary and editorial work . ''

		Like all men who are conscientious about their work , '' writes Mr.
Sedgwick	PERSON	, '' he took the most careful pains with everything he did , leav - ing no stone unturned to avoid inaccuracy and error , and even all looseness of expression .

		He detested exaggeration .

		This made his style sometimes seem laboured , and affected his letters and conversation .

		But it was as far removed as possible from that preciseness of speech , tone , and style which affecta - tion sometimes produces . ''

		THE OVERWORKED PHRASE probably causes a fastidious reader even more annoyance and bore - dom than does the startlingly new and boldly dar - ing idiom .

		Fertility of invention speaks in the novel epithet or unhackneyed metaphor ; mental sloth and poverty of imagination betray themselves in the outworn turn of expression and the thread - bare bit of imagery .

		Every reader of fine taste has a dislike for the author whose characters are forever '' getting in touch with '' this , that , or the other per - son , or are '' by way of being '' amateur concholo - gists , or are engaged '' in the same line '' of research , or are working `` along different lines , '' or are wait - ing for their expectations to `` materialize , '' or , in the hunting field , are noted for their skill in '' nego - tiating '' a hedge or a ditch .

		What an exhilarating effect it has on a reader to encounter an author who uses only an irreducible minimum of ready-made phrases .

		There is no somnolence possible in read - ing sentences every one of which brings to birth a new and exquisitely apt or strikingly picturesque idiom .

		The
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' in a recent comment on stock phrases , says that where such phrases abound and the demand on the reader 's attention is consequently small , `` he may like this little holiday ; indeed , some writers are popular just because their stock phrases are so numerous that the reader 's mind can enjoy a complete idleness among them . ''

		This kind of popularity , if it really exists , is decid - edly not a popularity to be envied .

		A BIG CITY WITHOUT A PUBLIC LIBRARY is almost as hard to find in this land of enlightenment as a town without a telephone or a village without a post-office .

		But recent reports from
Virginia	LOCATION	will have reminded those interested in the extension of our public library system that in the capital of that
State	ORGANIZATION	we see a city of considerably more than one hundred thousand inhabitants still unprovided with what is certainly not the least of educational agen - cies .

		No other city in the
United States	LOCATION	, fortunately , can show a population exceeding the hundred - thousand mark and at the same time a lack of public provision for the literary needs of its citizens .

		The Business Men 's Club of
Richmond	LOCATION	, however , is now bestirring itself in an endeavor to procure the estab - lishment of a library by the city , and early success is hoped for .

		Professor
Metcalf	PERSON	, of
Richmond	LOCATION	Col - lege , has spoken before the club and called atten - tion to the benefit sure to accrue from the starting of a public library .

		What such an institution can do for a community he illustrates by pointing to the cities of
Nashville	LOCATION	and
Grand Rapids	LOCATION	, each of about the size of
Richmond	LOCATION	.

		The
Nashville	LOCATION	library is freely used by artisans and business men , as well as by students and persons of leisure .

		No fewer than 36 blacksmiths , 563 bookkeepers , 483 brokers , 70 carpenters , 69 cash boys ,
1859	DATE	clerks ,
2000	DATE	labor - ers ,
1748	DATE	merchants , and 741 stenographers are enjoying its privileges , says Mr.
Metcalf	PERSON	, who dis - closes an unfavorable contrast in his own city , where current books of importance are in so little demand that even Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's volume on
South America	LOCATION	has had but ten buyers .

		Were a public library once established , dozens of useful books on the countries to the south of us would be freely avail - able to all , and would be read by many .

		That so necessary a part of municipal equipment , in this day and generation , should still be lacking to
Richmond	LOCATION	, is cause for surprise .

		THIS YEAR 'S AWARD OF THE NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE is for the first time to an Asiatic , the
Bengali	LOCATION	poet ,
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	, who has visited both
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	and given public lectures on the literary renaissance that for nearly a century has been in progress in
Bengal	LOCATION	, and of which his own poetry is the most noteworthy product .

		Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	's introduction to '' Gitanjali '' is the chief source of what is popularly known of him in the En - glish-speaking world ; and from that we become aware that the
Bengali	LOCATION	poet enjoys at home a renown such as perhaps no living European poet can claim among his own countrymen .

		Only of late has some impression of his genius been conveyed to us through the medium of translation as if a poet could ever be translated .

		`` To read one line of his is to forget all the troubles of the world , '' declares an enthusi - astic admirer ; and he is as gifted in music as in poetry , his songs being sung wherever
Bengali	ORGANIZATION	is spoken .

		He comes of a family of distinguished men : two of his brothers are artists , and another is a noted philosopher .

		A greater interest in
Rabindranath Tagore	ORGANIZATION	will now be aroused in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	by reason of the late award of the Nobel prize .

		ALFRED
RUSSEL WALLACE	PERSON	'S IMPATIENCE OF BOOK-LEARNING was undoubtedly one of the factors that operated to make him a leader in science and a conspicuously independent and original thinker and writer .

		Now that the voice and pen of this eminent nonagenarian have fallen silent , it is interesting to look back upon his schoolboy days in Monmouthshire 468 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	and to see him chafing under the irksome restraints of the schoolroom and condemning as useless the antiquated methods of instruction there employed .

		To him , at least , the printed page could convey no lesson comparable in importance with that of the larger page of nature ; and he was but seventeen years old when the love of botany and the collector 's passion seized him .

		Of his subsequent wanderings and explorations as a naturalist , the story is a long one , and may best be read in the autobiographic work , * ' My Life , '' which came out a few years ago .

		Probably his best-known contribution to the litera - ture of science is his volume on '' Darwinism , '' which many readers have found more easily mastered than the writings of the great evolutionist himself .

		Other and later works of importance are his `` Studies , Scientific and Social , '' `` The Wonderful Century , '' `` Man 's Place in the Universe , '' and `` The World of Life . ''

		A complete list of his writings , including those published in periodicals , would more than fill one of these pages .

		... EXTRAORDINARY VALUE IN AN ALMANAC comes to our notice in the recent auction sale of a 32-page pamphlet bearing the title : `` Calendrier Francais Pour I ` Anne'e Commune
1781	DATE	.

		Contenant le Calcul ordinaire du lever & du Coucher du Soleil , de la Lune & leur De ` clinaison .

		THE STEVENSON FELLOWSHIP DINNER .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		It may interest your readers to know that on the
evening	TIME	of
November 13	DATE	there occurred in
San Fran	LOCATION	- cisco the ninth annual meeting of the
Stevenson Fellow	ORGANIZATION	- ship , an organization which held its initial meetings in
1901	DATE	and
1902	DATE	, in the
Bush	PERSON	Street restaurant where in 1879
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	ate his frugal meals .

		In the march of improvements the little restaurant gave way to a larger building , which , in turn , yielded to the great fire of
1906	DATE	; but the Fellowship , without formal organization , has persisted , and year by year , with few exceptions , has commemorated the birthday of
Steven	PERSON	- son by decorating with a wreath of bay the memorial fountain erected to his memory in
Portsmouth Square	LOCATION	, and by a dinner with appropriate toasts and addresses .

		Many personal friends of
Stevenson	PERSON	have had a part in these proceedings , some by letter and others in person .

		Among the former ,
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	, Will Low ,
Miss Balfour	PERSON	,
Alison Cunningham	PERSON	, and Metaafa , the Samoan chief , may be named ; among the latter , Mrs.
Virgil Williams	PERSON	, with her husband , the friend of
Stevenson	PERSON	's
San Francisco	LOCATION	days , old
Jules Simoneau	PERSON	, the French restaurant keeper of Monterey with whom
Stevenson	PERSON	played chess and discussed the universe , and Miss
Annie Ide	PERSON	-LRB- now Mrs.
Bourke Cockran	PERSON	-RRB- to whom , as a child ,
Stevenson	PERSON	bequeathed his birthday .

		Now the growing years find the personal friends of
R. L. S.	PERSON	more widely scattered , or passed to join him on the other side ; but those who cherish his memory , who admire his writings and find inspiration in his life and character , are no fewer than before .

		This year sixty met around the board to do him honor , having first placed a wreath on the monument a few blocks away .

		Here Dr.
Edwin T. Wiley	PERSON	, of the
University of Cali	ORGANIZATION	- fornia , gave a short and feeling address on '' The Optimism of
Stevenson	PERSON	, '' which was followed by the reading of Mr.
John N. Hilliard	PERSON	's poem , '' At the
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	Fountain . ''

		Between the courses of the dinner many tributes in prose and verse were read .

		There were messages from several prominent literary people , and poems from
Ethel Talbot Scheffauer	PERSON	,
Clarence Urmy	ORGANIZATION	,
George Sterling	PERSON	, and
A. de B. Lovett	PERSON	, all testifying to the vital hold
Stevenson	PERSON	still has on the hearts of men .

		It is doubtful if the name of any other author could be the nucleiis for such a gathering , or could call forth such heartfelt tributes of admiration and affection , such testimonies of courage revived and inspiration received .

		The dinner was followed by a finished and careful study of ''
Stevenson	PERSON	as a Book Reviewer '' by Professor
William Dallam Armes	PERSON	r of
the University of California	ORGANIZATION	.

		These early book reviews of
Stevenson	PERSON	's are not familiar to the average reader , since they were not deemed worthy of a place in the permanent collections of his writings .

		The researches of Professor Armes brought to light brilliant passages of satirical wit not unworthy of
Stevenson	PERSON	's later years , and some sharp thrusts only a little less keen than the invective employed in '' Father
Damien	PERSON	. ''

		Some of the opinions expressed are amusing for a quality of cocksureness which
Stevenson	PERSON	would probably have modified in later years .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 469 THE GREATEST OF AMERICAN SCULPTORS .

		*
Augustus Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	left no rival among American sculptors , and there are not a few who would claim for him the highest position in the entire republic of the arts in this country .

		During the last years of his all-too-short sojourn among us he found leisure to dictate the frag - ments of an autobiography .

		Sickness , weak - ness , and finally death prevented his carrying the work to completion ; but , like several of his sculptural sketches , the project has been taken up by another , and in this instance at least the result is most satisfactory .

		The artist 's son , Mr.
Homer Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	, is a writer by profession , and naturally his best efforts have been enlisted in this labor of filial piety .

		He has united and amplified the precious fragments -LRB- though always keeping them distinct from his own con - tribution through the use of a separate font of type -RRB- , and his familiarity with his subject , his sympathy and frank admiration for his father 's achievement , make this work a delightfully intimate and illuminating resume of an excep - tional life .

		It is something that was needed , and it is an occasion for gratitude that the task fell to hands so competent .

		The strongest impression that comes to one in reading these volumes is of the immense activity of the man 's life and of his splendid citizenship .

		He seems to have been seized early with the conviction that however fine a thing it may be to be an artist , it is a vastly finer thing to be an artist-citizen .

		Probably he never formulated a confession of faith ; but there was within him a generous impulse , an innate sense of the respon - sibilities as well as of the power of art , which pointed the way toward a continual expansion of his interests and sympathies .

		Opportunity was his in abundance , and his associates were men of affairs and broad outlook .

		Given such an environment , it was inevitable that this retiring and ever-modest man should be marked from the first to become a national figure .

		One can imagine another , possibly quite as perfect a craftsman , with a horizon precisely bounded by his studio walls , with interests limited to the piece of work upon his modelling stand .

		This could hardly be the case , however , with a man who has endeavored to teach .

		* THE REMINISCENCES OF
AUGUSTUS SAINT-GAUDENS	PERSON	.

		Edited and amplified by
Homer Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	.

		In two volumes , illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	's sympathy with struggling be - ginners , with the efforts of his many ardent and oft-times bewildered pupils , was the logical preparation for larger fields of usefulness .

		He taught for many years the sculpture classes of The Art Students ' League , and no teacher ever had more loyal and appreciative disciples .

		His earliest public effort seems to have been in con - nection with the founding of the
American Soci	ORGANIZATION	- ety of Artists , a secession from the
National Academy of Design	ORGANIZATION	.

		This strong organization fulfilled most admirably its purpose , and then returned amicably to the parent body .

		We still have lively memories of the master 's inestimable service as adviser in the planning of the Col - umbian Exposition ; the splendid MacMonnies fountain , the monumental `` Republic , '' and the imposing peristyle were his suggestions among many .

		Later , even in illness ,
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	took an active share in the work of the import - ant
National Art Commission	ORGANIZATION	in
Washington	LOCATION	; and finally , in the founding of the
American Academy	ORGANIZATION	in
Rome	LOCATION	, we have repeated glimpses of his glowing enthusiasm and high endeavor .

		Indeed , so strongly did this notable enterprise appeal to him that he overcame for the moment his almost invincible terror of speaking in pub - lic , and made an address for the cause at a great dinner in
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It is safe to say that no hope of personal gain could ever have persuaded him to attempt this .

		Obviously such service can not be bought or recompensed .

		In all of his noble enthusiasms ,
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	exemplified
Thoreau	PERSON	's admirable words : '' An efficient and valuable man does what he can whether the community pay him for it or not . ''

		One of our up-to-date and therefore irrev - erent young critics has recently observed that if there were no more passion in real life than is to be found in Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's characters , then there are some eighty or ninety millions of us who would not be here at all !

		One has at first something of the same feeling in reading
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	's chronicle of his work .

		One protests that surely there must have been more emotion than this behind those magnificent achievements .

		Is it possible that masterpieces which speak to us so convincingly , which fairly thrill us over and over again , have had no pas - sionate conception , no tender development , in the soul of the artist ?

		This is unbelievable .

		Is it not more likely that
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	's reticence upon the subject is rather a frank acknowledg - ment of an emotion too profound and too sacred to share with all ?

		There is no pose in the atti - tude of the artist-author .

		He does not disclaim 470 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	the deep feeling which must have given birth to the
Lincoln	LOCATION	, the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, and the Adams memorials ; he simply refuses to talk about it to the curious crowd .

		But a man who could labor upon a work like the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	relief for fourteen years , fairly loving it into noble perfection , has a right to leave the result to time and to the work itself .

		Yet how we wish that we could penetrate the silent past and see the master in the midst of his vision , or hear his glad cry of exultation over a hard-fought triumph !

		The book preserves for us one such joyous shout , where
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	, engaged upon his
Sherman	PERSON	, writes playfully to his niece : `` I think I told you that my ` Victory ' is getting on well .

		It is the grandest ' Victory ' anybody ever made .

		Hoorah !

		and I shall have the model done in a month or so . ''

		A studio resounds from time to time with many a happy hurrah , but they are not often recorded .

		Of his father 's excep - tional reserve , Mr.
Homer Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	writes : '' In other directions , however , his autobiography fails to awaken an interest beyond that of the more outward events of his life .

		Because of his horror of ' art talks , ' he has given few opinions on art or sculp - ture , which frequently seemed good or bad to him only through the presence or absence of a peculiar power exceeding the reach of definition .

		Often he would say , I could not answer that man , but I knew he was wrong . '

		So with a faith founded more on intuition than on theory or reason , he became reluctant to discuss even answerable questions . ''

		True to this characteristic ,
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	writes in his opening chapter : '' If the reader hopes to find herein a disquisition on art or the pro- duction of artists , it will be well to close the book at once .

		There is nothing of that in these pages . ''

		But what an interesting life was his , what privileges of companionship and mental stimulus !

		The two volumes are full of anecdotes , piquant incidents , and experiences ; and one feels that there were many more exciting ones behind those .

		Indeed ,
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	says himself at the begin - ning : '' Like everyone else , were I to set down everything about myself , as well as everything I know of others , I could a tale unfold that would make what follows appear like candle - light in sunshine ; but various considerations , conventional and otherwise , bar the way vexa - tiously . ''

		One is afforded delightful and some - times amusing glimpses of
Whistler	LOCATION	and La Farge , of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	and General
Sherman	PERSON	, of
Richard Watson Gilder	PERSON	,
Daniel H. Burnham	PERSON	, and many more .

		We catch old Doctor
McCosh	PERSON	in innocent prevarication the while
Stanford White	ORGANIZATION	quotes scripture , such are some of the surprises of the recital .


Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	was of humble parentage , and probably owed much to this circumstance .

		The one drawback was the lack of systematic educa - tion , which hampered him somewhat in utterance , so that he always found letter-writing a cruel punishment .

		Time , and intercourse with the best , gradually atoned in great measure for these deficiencies , and we find his diction always as simple and purposeful as his clay sketches developing in flexibility and charm before our very eyes .

		It is safe to say that he might have become an admirable writer .

		As it is , these pages betoken the kind of man that he was , recalling in their unpretentious directness the autobiography of
General Grant	ORGANIZATION	, showing the same quiet humor , and strangely enough written amid circumstances of similar heroic patience .

		Born in
Dublin	LOCATION	in
1848	DATE	, of a French father and an Irish mother ,
America	LOCATION	's greatest sculptor grew up in
New York City	LOCATION	with his father 's little shoe-shop as his principal background .

		It chanced that at an early age he was apprenticed to a cameo-cutter .

		It was upon this slender thread of the fates that depended our country 's good fortune !

		Had his parents selected any one of a hundred other callings , his life would doubt - less have remained as colorless and inglorious as that of the boy next door .

		It was not entirely chance , however , that turned the scales , for he tells us : '' But , now , since I was just thirteen , my father said to me one day : ` My boy you must go to work .

		What would you like to do ? ' '' '

		I do n't care , ' I replied , ' but I should like it if I could do something which would help me to be an artist . ' ''

		Consequently father apprenticed me to a man named Avet , a
Savoyard	ORGANIZATION	, dark , with a mustache which extended down along the side of his cheek and jaw .

		When he was not scolding me he sang continuously .

		I believe that I am not wrong in stating that he was the first cameo-cutter in
America	LOCATION	, though stone seal - engravers there were already in
New York	LOCATION	, as well as shell cameo-engravers , at which occupation
Palmer	PERSON	and
Launt Thompson	PERSON	were adepts in the early periods of their careers .

		For it was the fashion at that time for men to wear stone scarf-pins with heads of dogs , horses and lions cut in amethyst , malachite and other stones .

		I was Avet 's first apprentice and the stones I prepared for him he would finish , occasionally allowing me to complete one myself .

		He was employed principally by Messrs.
Ball	PERSON	, Black , & Company , who had their store on the corner of Spring Street and Broadway , and now and then by
Tiffany	ORGANIZATION	, to both of which shops I took cameos when completed , always with a profound impression of the extraordinary splendor of those places . ''

		At the end of three years the youth took his last scolding , packed up his belongings , and went home ; and another period of three years happy ones this time was begun in the
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 471 shop of a shell-cutter .

		During all this time he was studying drawing in the night classes of
Cooper Union	ORGANIZATION	or
The Academy of Design	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thus , at the age when the average educated man begins his special studies , this youth was thoroughly grounded in drawing and already a master of low relief , a master in the sense in which no belated beginner ever becomes a mas - ter , for with him it was both mental and phys - ical mastery .

		In
February , 1867	DATE	, the boy of nineteen sailed for
Paris	LOCATION	, with a steerage ticket and a fortune of one hundred dollars in his pocket , and his cameo-cutter 's kit for his principal bag - gage .

		Of the school days at the Beaux-Arts there are delightful glimpses .

		Here , for in - stance , is the description of the Professor : ''
Jouffroy	PERSON	was tall , thin , dark , wiry , with little intel - ligent black eyes and a queer face in profile , his fore - head and nose descending in a straight line from the roots of his hair to within an inch of the end of his nose , which suddenly became red and round and pim - ply though the ball was discreet in size ; it would have been in bad taste had it been larger .

		He also had stringy hair and a nasal voice .

		He made his criticism in a low , drawling tone , nine-tenths of the time in a perfunctory way , looking in an entirely different direc - tion from the model and from the study .

		Occasionally he worked on the figures in a strange fashion , his right hand pawing the clay , while in his left he held a little wad of bread which he constantly rolled .

		He was much in vogue at the Tuileries at that time , although he achieved his distinction some ten or fifteen years before my arrival . ''

		There was a famous walking trip in
Switzer	PERSON	- land with comrades of the atelier , and later , upon the opening of the Franco-Prussian war , a visit to
Italy	LOCATION	which prolonged itself ultimately to a stay of some five years .

		Now follow the familiar and sometimes plaintive stories of the early essays at professional work , the hopes and disappointments .

		The beautiful angel reliefs which Saint -
Gaudens	PERSON	modeled from drawings of
John La Farge for St. Thomas 's Church	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	were the chief work of
1877	DATE	, and did much to win friends .

		They were destroyed by fire a few years ago .

		The story of the struggle to obtain the Farragut commission is a tense one , and we realize how near we came to losing a masterpiece .

		From the moment , in
May , 1881	DATE	, that this monument was unveiled in
Madison Square	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, Saint -
Gaudens	PERSON	became a public character , taking his place at the head of American sculpture ; for the un - known young sculptor had made the finest portrait statue in this country , to be sur - passed only by himself .

		There is a picturesque account of an eventful journey in
1883	DATE	through the far west , from the wastes of
Arizona	LOCATION	to
Tacoma	LOCATION	, and thence home .

		It concludes as follows : '' The night we crossed the plains of
Kansas	LOCATION	we went through the gilt-edged edition of Hell .

		But I had one recompense .

		The sleeping-car conductor , after hard spelling , got my name . '

		Why , you 're the man who made that great statue in
New York	LOCATION	?

		Well I declare !

		Allow me to congratulate you ! '

		Then a squeeze with his big fist .

		Such is fame . ''

		Of the evolution of the
Shaw Memorial	ORGANIZATION	, that extraordinary bronze relief which pictures so poignantly the white commander leading his colored regiment to almost certain death , Mr.
Homer Saint	PERSON	-
Gaudens	PERSON	says : '' Through fourteen years of such endeavor , then , the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	relief remained in the studio , while other com - missions came and went ; fourteen years , during which my father returned to this work
winter	DATE	and
summer	DATE	with an unflagging persistence .

		Even the hottest of
August	DATE	days would find him high up on a ladder under the baking skylight , as he developed and eliminated these details of his task ; for the details , as has been seen , he changed and changed , though the original con - ception , according to his almost consistent practice , he never altered .

		Early morning would grow to noon , scarcely marked by more than a hasty munching of an apple .

		Noon would fade to dusk without a falter in the steady toil .

		And then , after the evening meal , he would take his place again beneath the flaring gas jets when the special task was of a sort to permit night work . ''

		And
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	betrays his own enthusiasm in writing to Mrs. Van Rensselaer : '' I 've done nothing but model , model , model furi - ously for the last month .

		I 've been putting negroes of all types in the
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	, and it 's been great fun .

		I 'm as happy as a clam over it , and consequently beautifully negligent of every friend , no matter how much they may have passed before my vision as I was driving away at my darkeys . ''

		Every incident in connection with the growth of the `` Lincoln , '' the ``
Deacon Chapin	PERSON	, '' above all the mysterious Adams Memorial of Washing - ton , is of surpassing interest .

		It is wonderful to get into the studio and watch the progress of these mighty works , to see the original sketches and their rejected rivals , and to imagine what the work might have been had the artist 's taste wandered to another choice .

		Of the
Columbian Exposition and Saint	ORGANIZATION	-
Gaudens	PERSON	's part therein much is said .

		He writes thus of the MacMonnies fountain : '' I then urged that the execution be placed in his hands , and there is no other piece of work with which I have been associated as adviser that has approached this in the satisfaction it has given me .

		It seemed to fit in absolutely with his temperament , with his appre-r ciation of the joy of life , beauty , and happiness , and 1 consider his composition as a whole , and particularly the central motive of the boat , the rowing maidens , the young figure of
America	LOCATION	on top , the most beautiful 472 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	conception of a fountain of modern times west of the
Caspian Mountains	LOCATION	.

		It was the glorification of youth , cheerfulness , and the American spirit , and I think it is a calamity greatly to be deplored that it should have gone to ruin .

		It would have made a remarkable .

		monument to that extraordinary exhibition . ''

		The days that I passed there linger in the memory like a glorious dream , and it seems impossible that such .

		a vision can ever be recalled in its poetic grandeur and elevation .

		Certainly it has stood far beyond any of the expositions , great as they have been , that have succeeded it . ''

		Of a magnificent building which
Chicago	LOCATION	permits to fall to decay as it permitted the destruction of the MaoMonnies fountain , Mr.
Burnham	PERSON	writes to Mr.
Homer Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	: `` The Art Building had just been finished .

		Your father came to my rooms late in the afternoon .

		He took tore by the shoulders and said , Old fellow , do you realize the rank of
Atwood	ORGANIZATION	's building ?

		In my judgment , it is the best thing done since the
Parthenon	LOCATION	. '

		This con - clusion has been justified by the statements of many eminent critics . ''

		Saint-Gaudens '' .

		discovered '' the little town of
Cornish	LOCATION	,
N. H.	PERSON	, and loved it more than any other .

		spot on earth .

		Much of his later work was done there , and there for many months he peacefully awaited death , guiding his studio force from his sick bed to the very end .

		He died on
August 3 , 1907	DATE	.

		One of the most charming bits in the whole work , and wonderfully true in local color , is the following glimpse of the maturer artist life in
Paris	LOCATION	, showing the gift of the French to find interest and contentment amid surroundings of the humblest character .

		The occasion was a flying visit to
Paris	LOCATION	in
1889	DATE	: `` I was there but two weeks and was desirous of returning in what measure I could to my student life and environment , and , for that reason , occupied a little box of a room that
MacMonnies	ORGANIZATION	offered to me fronting on a charming court where he had his studio .

		The first day , on awakening , I turned to the tiny window over - looking the little garden in the cool gray of the morn - ing .

		Presently , from one of the ; studio doors which opened on the court , an old chap appeared in his dressing-gown , peacefully smoking a pipe .

		He trudged along in among the paths over to one particular flower - bed which was evidently his little property , and with great care watered the flowers with a diminutive water - ing-pot .

		Soon another codger appeared from another door , in trousers and slippers .

		He also fussed and shuffled quietly in his little plot .

		And then a third came from the other end of the garden , with a skull - cap on .

		This one , with the greatest caution , mounted a step-ladder , tying here and cutting away there , among his plants , while the others raked away in the earth below among the flowers , and murmured and chatted about this little plant , and that little flower , this bit of earth and so on , with apparently no other thought than that of the Greek in ` Candide ' to ` Cultivate your garden ' ; the blue smoke from their pipes of peace rising philoso - phically among the greenery in harmony with it all .

		These were the Satanic comrades of my youth at the Beaux-Arts , the Devils who made me bawl Marseillaise for months , and it was all so far away from the Hell 's Kitchen of Thirty-fourth Street and Broadway that it gave me much to reflect on . ''

		The many illustrations in these two volumes are of exceptional beauty and interest .

		The great works are adequately shown .

		Particu - larly fascinating are the sketches and studies for these well-known figures , and an unlooked - for revelation is found in the sculptor 's whim - sical caricatures of himself and his friends .

		The volumes are singularly free from errors .

		But there never was a book without some mis - takes , so its editor will pardon us for calling attention to the fact that
Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	's `` enthusiasm for
Rodin	ORGANIZATION	's early work such as the ` St. John Preaching ' '' could not have been '' revived by the production of ` Age of Brass , ' '' since the last-named was
Rodin	PERSON	's initial achieve - ment and was followed by the `` St.
John	PERSON	. ''

		`` Brieux '' and `` Donnay '' are not the names of eminent sculptors , though given as such .

		In 1875-1877
George Bissell	PERSON	was undoubtedly `` as active as ever , '' but it chances that he had not yet taken up sculpture .

		The use of
Frederick MacMonnies	PERSON	's boyhood name of
William	LOCATION	in later chapters is confusing , and the familiar misspell - ing of French names is regrettable .

		But these are small matters , easily overlooked in the great pleasure which this brave and cheery recital will afford every person of culture .


Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	has left us his great message for all time in his monuments ; but this is a supplementary , hu - manizing revelation , a sort of hand-clasp and good-bye which will keep his personality vivid in our memories .

		Would that the grateful thanks of a nation could reach him !

		LORADO
TAFT	ORGANIZATION	.

		CONTEMPORARY VERSE .

		It used to be thought that anthologies were the accompaniments of the death of a literature , that they partook of the nature of funeral wreaths .

		However this may be , there is cer - tainly a mania to-day for weaving these gar - lands , and all sorts of expected and unexpected persons are putting their hands to the work .

		If their efforts help to increase the reading of poetry they are doing the world a service .

		And per - haps the bargain-loving public does prefer to buy specimens of fifty or a hundred poets for about the same price it would have to pay for * THB LITTLE BOOK OF MODERN VERSE .

		GEORGIAN POETRY , 1911-1912 .


London	LOCATION	:
The Poetry Bookshop	ORGANIZATION	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 473 one complete .

		But from a critical point of view we doubt whether the majority of recent anthol - ogies are helpful .

		Certainly anyone is entitled to have a bede-roll of favorite poems ; and if he or she can induce some publisher to print these in a book , it must be convenient and gratifying to the compiler .

		But we must protest against these collections being considered canonical ; we must deny that they have any authority or finality of fame .

		It is not so bad in regard to the poetry of the past , for most gatherers of poetic flowers are content to wander along the roads and ruts made by
Time	ORGANIZATION	.

		But in the present , which is as uncharted as the air is for the aviator , how are they to know which way to turn for the most beautiful cloud - wreaths ?

		Contemporary opin - ion of poetry is so untrustworthy largely because it is ignorant of what is being done .

		Who for instance in
England	LOCATION	, say circa
1875	DATE	, would have dreamed of including poems by
George Darley	PERSON	,
James Clarence Mangan	PERSON	,
Emily Bronte	PERSON	, and
Edward FitzGerald	PERSON	in a collection of modern verse ?

		Yet , barring the four or five accredited poets of the age , these writers are the stars of Sir
Arthur Quiller-Couch	PERSON	's last big , and we think otherwise most unsatisfactory , anthology .

		To be a good anthologist requires an almost impossible combination of intensity and univer - sality of taste .

		English lyric poetry has had but one great editor of this kind ,
Palgrave	LOCATION	; and he failed dismally when he tried to select from his contemporaries .

		Palgrave 's indebtedness to
Tennyson	LOCATION	's judgment may have been more than is known .

		Only the divining rod of a great poet could have so surely indicated the true veins of ore , and
Palgrave	PERSON	was not a great poet .

		In
America	LOCATION	,
Frederic Lawrence Knowles	PERSON	gave us a nearly perfect , though small , anthology of our poets of the past .

		We have before us two recent anthologies , one American , `` A Little Book of Modern Verse '' ; and one English , `` Georgian Poetry , 1911-1912 . ''

		The English book seems to con - tain a good deal of poetry in solution , but it does not crystallize into anything distinct .

		Most of the poems are intolerably long for lyrical verse , the writers sprawl and scrawl all over the shop .

		As far as we can see , none of the pieces are new or vital or supremely fine .

		The con - cluding `` Dirge '' has a charming note , but it is rather an echo of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In the Poppy Field '' is good , but it is reminiscent of Words - worth .

		We shall not be suspected , we hope , of any desire to disparage verse ; but we think that the prose phantasies of Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	are more poetic in conception and execution than anything in this book .

		On the whole , this Georgian poetry is very different from the Georgian poetry of a hundred years ago .

		We turn to the American volume and we are in another atmosphere .

		Here , in the main , the poems are short and succinct , their outlines clear and definite .

		Nearly every one of the American poets quoted has a sense of form , both in verbal style and in the evolution of their pieces .

		And poetry is almost as much a form as the old French king was .

		As the English anthology only gleans from the poetry crop of the
last two years	DATE	, and as many of the poets in the American volume date back thirty-five or forty years , it would mani - festly be unfair to treat the books as represen - tative of the two literatures .

		The American book , however , is quite inadequate even as a glimpse of what we have done within the limits indicated .

		What system of selection or exclu - sion the compiler has followed would be diffi - cult to say .

		Such names as
Aldrich	LOCATION	,
Stedman	PERSON	,
Stoddard	PERSON	,
Bret Harte	PERSON	,
Bunner	PERSON	,
Sill	ORGANIZATION	,
Eugene Field	PERSON	,
Gilder	PERSON	,
Lampman	PERSON	,
Helen Hunt	PERSON	, Father
Tabb	PERSON	, and a score of others , who were easily contemporaneous with many she quotes , are omitted .

		As far as she does permit herself to range , her work has apparently been done with good judgment .

		It is perhaps invidious to select from a selection , but we please ourselves by naming a few pieces .

		Miss
Louise Imogen Guiney	PERSON	's '' The Kings '' is a superb lyric , hardly surpassable in expression ; it may fairly pair off with
Bryant	PERSON	's great piece , `` The Battlefield . ''


Frederic Lawrence Knowles	PERSON	's '' Love Triumph - ant '' has a classic perfection indicative of a master , dead , alas , too soon .

		Mr.
Arthur Colton	PERSON	's `` Harps Hung up in Babylon '' and Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	's '' As I Came Down from
Lebanon	LOCATION	'' have the lyric movement that stirs and the verbal conciseness that stays .

		Miss
Helen Gray Cone	PERSON	's `` The Ride to the Lady '' has the Rembrandt gloom and atmosphere of the past ; and
Miss Anna Hampstead Branch	LOCATION	's ``
New York	LOCATION	Shop-Girl '' has the brightness , lightness , and pathos of the present .

		With the additional weight of metal which could easily be thrown into it , an American anthology of the work of the past thirty-five years or so might , we think , be produced which would hold its own against a similar English volume .

		Our public is entirely too fond of im - porting its literature , art , and wine from abroad .

		Apropos of this , we are tempted to give a story which has probably already appeared in print , 474 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	but which will bear repetition .

		It was related by Mr.
Hall Caine	PERSON	as an experience of his own in
Iceland	LOCATION	.

		He was out in the open country with a guide ; and , gazing at the spectacle about him , he exclaimed : '' Ah , yes !

		This is grand , this is sublime !

		But I came to
Iceland	LOCATION	to see your glaciers .

		Where are your glaciers ? ''

		`` Glaciers ! ''

		said the guide , `` why , you are sitting on them ! ''

		We think it is unfortunate that during the last generation , during the period when most of us were getting more kicks and curses than half - pence , attempts have been made to groom and boom two American poets for the great succes - sion .

		The first of these was
Lanier	PERSON	.

		He came at a juncture when the older American writers were looking around for a new laurel wearer , and were anxious to please and placate the South .

		He must have been a charming personality , brave , good , untiring , eager , and interested in many things .

		And he had considerable com - mand over metres , was , in fact , a miniature and moral
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		But his intellectual value is not great , his criticism being more or less absurd .

		And in poetry he lacked the one thing necessary , poetic expression .

		His first biog - rapher admitted that he possessed little verbal charm or distinction .


Thomas Bailey Aldrich	PERSON	, in one of his letters , relegated him to the rear rank of minor poets , adding that he had never talked with more than two or three literary men who thought otherwise .


Stedman	PERSON	, in his answer to this letter , intimated that his own opinion was not very different , but that considerations other than literary had compelled him to force
Lanier	PERSON	's rank .

		English criticism has always smiled at the attempt to place him as a great poet .

		We fear that in the end his fate will be something like that of
Henry Kirke White	PERSON	, who , because he was amiable and interesting and had consump - tion , was borne for fifty years on the rolls of English literature as a great poet , the equal of Gray and
Collins	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	.

		The bubble was finally pricked , and White has vanished from the field of view .


William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	is the other poet who has received an amount of praise which will probably cause a reaction .

		His reputation was made , and largely rests , on his '' Ode in
Time of Hesitation	ORGANIZATION	, `` a work of great moral force and sus - tentation , which echoes the views of an immense mass of intelligent readers .

		We will not criti - cize it directly , but will ask if even its warmest admirers really rank it with
Lowell	PERSON	's `` Com - memoration Ode . ''

		To us , it seems as inferior in literary merit as it is in theme and occasion .

		Yet
Lowell	PERSON	's poem is fading on our hands .

		It does not hold its colors as do other of his pieces , '' The Vision of Sir Launfal '' or '' The Courtin ' , '' for example ; or as do the long elegiac poems of his rival ,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	.

		There are many rea - sons for this .

		It suffers under the blight which seems to await all political poetry .

		It is too long , and is written in that pseudo-Pindaric form which is too flabby and ungirt to race well with
Time	ORGANIZATION	.

		And it is rhetorical .

		Now a certain alloy of rhetoric is needed in poems of length to harden and toughen the pure gold of poetry .

		A number of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , and the poems of
Coleridge	PERSON	and
Keats	PERSON	, are almost the only con - siderable poetic works in the language which are without this alloy .

		But
Lowell	PERSON	's '' Ode '' has more of oratory than of poetry .

		Its effect was overwhelming at the time of its production , like the effect of a great speech .

		But , of all the utter - ranees of man , great speeches are the hardest things to keep alive .

		All these considerations apply to
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's '' Ode '' as much as to
Lowell	PERSON	's , and wise underwriters will hardly insure its immortality .

		DRAMATIST .

		* In
England	LOCATION	,
ten years ago	DATE	, there were cer - tain young men of rich promise yet quiet dignity who were frequently cited , by the illu - minati , as the predestined literary leaders of the theatre to-day .

		They were not leaders then , but they were earnest , sincere , self - searching ; and they never surrendered their work to the devouring gaze of the public until they really approved it , and were ready to stand back of it .

		These same men are not the lead - ers to-day , for some are dead , some diverted to other more urgent channels , some finally are still struggling vainly for the `` new '' drama which demands two indispensable factors : a repertory theatre , with short runs periodically repeated ; and a sophisticated public of highly cultivated people , cultivated in sensibility and emotion , who will not judge , finally , every play on the basis of the '' happiness '' of its ending .

		St.
John Emil Clavering Hankin	PERSON	, for some inscrutable reason , left the scene with shocking suddenness , `` arose from life 's feast '' and left behind him a memorial of such striking merit and arresting quality that the sense of loss will deepen with the passage of time .

		During the seven years preceding the year of * THE DRAMATIC WORKS OF ST.
JOHN HANKIN	PERSON	.

		With Introduction by
John Drinkwater	PERSON	.

		In three volumes , with photogravure portraits .


New York	LOCATION	:
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	.

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL , 475 his death -LRB-
1909	DATE	-RRB- , he wrote seven plays and began an eighth which establish the founda - tion of his reputation .

		Whether , under con - temporary conditions , he bade fair to produce plays of popular success , it would be hazardous to affirm or deny ; but certain it is that he had the root of the matter within him .

		The tone , the quality , the point of view , the `` philosophy '' were fresh and nai ' ve , and yet naive only in their singular sophistication .

		If
Hankin	PERSON	had one capital fault , it was the oppressive sense of `` society , '' the crushing weight of the upper social strata .

		Once this is conceded , and for - gotten , critical judgment will surely own that
Hankin	PERSON	left upon all of his plays the stamp of an alert and shrewd personality , and sur - charged his terse creations with a tempera - mental charm and color which constitute their most poignant excellence .

		In the deeper sense , surely ,
Hankin	PERSON	was a stylist .

		That he followed
Wilde	PERSON	was only an - other way of saying , accurately , that he admired Wilde extravagantly , employed his methods , imitated him deliberately .

		The quality of the amateur , which even the best of
Hankin	PERSON	's comedies reveal , is , I think , the result of just this one thing : he was unable to conceal his imitativeness .

		Yet , despite this patent fault , his dialogue is , from the purely dramatic stand - point , notably superior to that of the man whom he chose as master .

		For with
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	, as I have more than once pointed out , real characteriza - tion , in the deeper sense , is subsidiary to epigram .

		And so we have the singular spectacle of a group of characters uttering fascinating , clever gen - eralizations in the most frivolous manner , which , mutatis mutandis , would be equally appro - priate to any of the other characters .

		Wilde 's characters can not be recognized by the epigrams which they create ; all are equally facile in their creation .

		With eyes closed , we can not , iii
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's plays , guess the speaker from his overheard conversation .

		Nevertheless ,
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's conversation is the most scintillating , the most delightful , we have had upon the modern English stage .

		It is often not drama , not germane , that is , to the emotional content of the play ; but it is always art .


Hankin	PERSON	has fairly distanced
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	in dia - logue ; for his characters do two things with sin - gular excellence , an excellence superior to that exhibited by the irresponsible
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	.


Hankin	PERSON	's characters are perfectly self-contained , perfectly consistent , both finely conceived and firmly grasped .

		Each new play exhibits strengthening of power in this particular the power to create characters who always speak and act `` in char - acter . ''

		In the second place ,
Hankin	PERSON	's char - acters speak with a certain sharp neatness , a certain distinct finality , which means , in the last analysis , that they have the art of expressing themselves with an effectiveness and a perti - nency more crystalline and more clairvoyant than the current speech of life .

		This is not the epigrammatic coruscation of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	, the dialectic shrewishness of
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	; it is a very high form of artistic simplicity .

		The note of naturalness is enhanced , rather than vitiated , by the unusual skill in interpreting a given situation or in realizing a chosen mood .

		In another respect , scarcely less noteworthy and modern ,
Hankin	PERSON	's plays represent the newer mode of expressing life through the medium of drama .

		He realized , as dramatists now must inevitably realize , that the drama is a form of art which must be presumed to be literature .

		To read a play of
Hankin	PERSON	's is to have a sense of actual happening irrespective of the immediate categories of the theatre .

		There is no suggestion of the stage or of the player : we have only a sense of real people in real situations .

		By that I mean that in all respects , even to the minutest stage-directions , these plays are authentic projections , representations , of reality .

		The subconscious , instinctive feelings and accompaniments of action are not left to the none too ready imaginations of player or spectator .

		We are made to realize how people feel from being told , not only what the players say , but also how they act and react , intellect - ually and emotionally , from the dramatic con - junctures which actually arise .

		A single stage direction may give the clue at once to the actor and through the actor to the situation .

		`` GENERAL BONSOR -LSB- too broken with the world 's ingratitude to protest further -RSB- .

		Boring !

		-LSB- Follows
Miss TRIGGS	PERSON	, shaking his poor old head .

		There is a pause while we realize that one of the most tragic things in life is to be a bore and to know it .

		MRS. EVERSLEIGH , however , not being cursed with the gift of an imaginative sympathy , wastes no pity on the
General	ORGANIZATION	.

		Instead of this she turns to her sister , and , metaphorically speaking , knocks her out of the ring . -RSB- ''

		This stage direction clearly supplies a certain convention for the newer drama .

		It has the virtue of enforcing the intent of the dramatist , too often missed through the inefficiency or unimaginativeness of the actors .

		Without press - ing home the point too hard , it must be at least indicated that stage-directions , however artistic or however skilful in enforcing the desired effect , should remain impersonal .

		The printed play should be as realistic as fiction ; imperfect 476 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	objectivity is the outcome of following
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's dictum that the drama should be `` as personal a mode of expression as the lyric or sonnet . ''

		But the aim which
Hankin	PERSON	kept before him , despite lapses into too obvious personalism , is an aim truly commendable : to interpret situa - tions with refined art and wholly graphic effect .


Hankin	PERSON	's plays , imaginatively conceived , artistically executed , transfused with tempera - mental quality , delight through qualities which are not always , it must be acknowledged , in - trinsically dramatic .

		The major situations of his plays seem scarcely worthy of the elabora - tion with which they are treated ; and the characters seem not infrequently too thin to win our dignified attention .

		Even granting this , the plays have a curious sort of satiric effectiveness ; and the characters , even when they do not excite our admiration , seldom fail to win our affectionate sympathy .

		The calcu - lating dexterity of the mother in '' The Cassilis Engagement , '' with its mixture of mercilessness and pity , has the memorable , the classic timbre .

		However much our feelings may protest against the sacrifice of
Stella Faringford	PERSON	, in `` The Return of the Prodigal , '' we ungrudgingly acknowledge that
Eustace	PERSON	is and can be only what he is : the invertebrate , of intellectual shrewdness and moral impotence , taking the easiest way literally because he is honest with himself in the admission that he can not suc - cessfully achieve self-sacrifice .

		The most beau - tiful and profound of the plays the one ` provocative of deepest reflection is '' The Last of the De
Mullins	PERSON	. ''

		The force and clar - ity of vision of
Janet De Mullin	PERSON	are memorable and fortifying : we would love her if we but dared .

		The scene between
Janet	PERSON	and her erst - while lover , in its economy and inevitability , is truly great only redeemed from the tragic through the vision and utter insight of the woman , compact of intuition without self-pity .

		The author of this play , had he lived , might have written one of the great dramas of the new century .

		that the professed stylist delights to run down and capture .

		Colonel
Roosevelt	PERSON	's autobiography , which not unfittingly bears its writer 's name as title , is thoroughly characteristic of the man ; and the man himself is so well known to all the world that there would be something absurd as well as superfluous in offering a formal and extended review of the chapters wherein he re - hearses the already familiar account of his boy - hood , youth , early and later manhood , and the chief things he has accomplished in the great world of politics and public affairs .

		Parts of these chapters have already appeared in print , and much of the book as a whole has found expression , in one form or another , in some of the author 's many utterances as writer and speaker .

		The vigor and directness for which he is justly admired show themselves in every sentence of his book ; and if here and there a little more study of brevity or a little greater practice of restraint might have been desired , one must remember that it requires the leisure of the man of letters to achieve conciseness , and a modest reticence is incompatible with certain other qualities that have every right to demand recognition .

		With the exception of a few most welcome chapters of a personal or `` intimate '' character `` Boyhood and Youth , '' `` The Vigor of Life , '' `` In Cowboy Land , '' and `` Outdoors and Indoors '' the narrative deals chiefly with pol - itics and policies as exemplified in the writer 's public life and more or less connected with his administrative acts .

		Much of it is in the nature of an apologia , a word that might seem gro - tesquely inappropriate if put here in its English form .

		In defending , for example , his sending a telegram of sympathy to the widow of a prom - inent
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	politician , recently deceased , the author says : `` A paper which constantly preached reform , and which kept up its circulation by the no less constant practice of slander , a paper which in theory condemned all public men who violated the eighth commandment , and in practice subsisted by incessant violation of the ninth , assailed me for sending my message to the dead man 's wife .

		I knew the editors of this paper , and the editor who was their predecessor .

		They had led lives of bodily ease and the avoidance of bodily risk ; they earned their livelihood by the practice of mendacity for profit ; and they delivered malignant judgment on a dead man who , whatever his faults , had in his youth freely risked his life for a great ideal , and who when death was already clutching his breast had spent almost his last breath on behalf of humble and friendless people whom he had served with disinterested loyalty . ''

		As was to have been expected , the piquantly personal and not always first-personal ele - ment is not lacking in the book .

		References
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 477 to a successor who `` means well feebly '' are sufficiently frequent and full , and are not counterbalanced by earlier and friendlier rem - iniscences of the same person in other walks of public life .

		But there is no need here to dwell on the disputatious portions of the book .

		Those who have a taste for the controversial in litera - ture will enjoy the chapters on `` Practical Politics , '' `` Applied Idealism , '' `` The War of
America	LOCATION	the Unready , '' `` The Presidency ; Making an Old Party Progressive , '' and '' The Big Stick and the Square Deal . ''

		Let us for the present cite a few illuminating passages of especial autobiographic interest , and then leave the rather bulky volume to those prepared to undertake the reading of it in its entirety .

		From the earlier pages dealing with the writer 's education , the following is significant : '' I thoroughly enjoyed
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	, and 1 am sure it did me good , but only in the general effect , for there was very little in my actual studies which helped me in after life .

		More than one of my own sons have already prof - ited by their friendship with certain of their masters in school or college .

		I certainly profited by my friend - ship with one of my tutors , Mr.
Cutler	PERSON	; and in
Harvard	LOCATION	I owed much to the professor of English , Mr.
A. S. Hill	PERSON	.

		Doubtless through my own fault , I saw almost nothing of President
Eliot	PERSON	and very little of the professors .

		I ought to have gained much more than I did gain from writing the themes and forensics .

		My failure to do so may have been partly due to my taking no interest in the subjects .

		Before I left
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	I was already writing one or two chapters of a book I afterwards published on the Naval War of
1812	DATE	.

		Those chapters were so dry that they would have made a dictionary seem light reading by comparison .

		Still , they represented purpose and serious interest on my part , not the perfunctory effort to do well enough to get a certain mark ; and corrections of them by a skilled older man would have impressed me and have commanded my respectful attention . ''

		With no expectation of entering public life , the young collegian neglected elocution and took no part in debate ; and though this was a loss in one way , in another the author considers it a gain .

		He was not called upon to make the worse appear the better cause , and he now feels convinced that the present method of conduct - ing college debates is injurious to the debaters .

		Only from conviction and in defense of principle would he have a young man make his voice heard in public argument .

		Here is a pleasing picture of family life , from a later period of the writer 's history .

		It has a literary and an educational interest that warrants its reproduction : '' There was also much training that came as a by - product and was perhaps almost as valuable not as a substitute but as an addition .

		After their supper the children , when little , would come trotting up to their mother 's room to be read to , and it was always a sur - prise to me to notice the extremely varied reading which ' interested them , from
Howard Pyle	PERSON	's '
Robin Hood	PERSON	/
Mary Alice Owen	PERSON	's ' Voodoo Tales , ' and
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	's ' Aaron in the Wild Woods , ' to '
Lycidas	PERSON	' and ' King
John	PERSON	. '

		If their mother was absent , I would try to act as vice-mother a poor substitute , I fear super - intending the supper and reading aloud afterwards . '

		The children did not wish me to read the books they desired their mother to read , and I usually took some ' ; such book as ' Hereward the Wake , ' or ' Guy Manner - ing , ' or ' The Last of the Mohicans , ' or else some story about a man-eating tiger , or a man-eating lion , from one of the hunting books in my library .

		These latter stories were always favorites , and as the authors told them in the first person , my interested auditors grew to know them by the name of the ` I ' stories , and regarded them as adventures all of which happened to the same individual . ''

		Colonel
Roosevelt	PERSON	has wisely omitted from his present volume the African hunting episode , as that has already been fully related ; but there is abundant matter left , and a consider - able part of it has been relegated to fine-print appendices .

		There is also a wealth of graphic illustration , including many photographs and cartoons of especial interest .

		Emphatically and unmistakably the author has stamped himself on every page of his book , and no reader desir - ing a better acquaintance with him will be disappointed in this ample autobiography .

		THE D1AJL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	many of his most interesting ideas and experi - ences can not be utilized in a novel or staged in a play , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	still continues the practice of journalism .

		Glorified journalism it is , to be sure ; not the hard-driving monopoly of his best hours with which he began his literary adventure .

		Even to the most perfunctory of it , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, out of his abounding energy , brings a zestf ul clever - ness that redeems it from commonplace .

		Those frankly manufactured reminiscences of his American tour , for instance , were picturesque and brilliant , though lacking in any depth of conviction .

		And in the best of his fugitive sketches , the pastels of
London	LOCATION	life , for example , that for some weeks , not long ago , constituted a series of particularly delightful columns in the
London	LOCATION	`` Nation , '' Mr.
Ben	PERSON	- nett shows the high gifts of subtle analysis , imaginative illumination , and critical irony that give distinction to his best work .

		About fifty of these occasional sketches , many very good and some decidedly mediocre , have been chosen from the output of some seven years , and gathered into a volume entitled ''
Paris	LOCATION	Nights and Other Impressions of Places and People . ''

		It is a decidedly bulky volume ; large type and thick paper , and wide margins , with many illustrations , all casual and some very charming , by Mr.
E. A. Rickards	PERSON	, make a setting somewhat too pretentious to suit the airy , unpretentious , unpremeditated notations to which Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	was inspired by various contacts and experiences at home and abroad .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's genius is unfailing in the matter of titles . ''

		How to Live on Twenty - four Hours a Day '' was suggestive enough to throw a glamour over the essential obviousness of some excellent ideas about the saving of time . ''

		Clayhanger , '' again , vaguely connotes symbols and mysteries , investing an unprepos - sessing hero with a curious significance .

		And so ``
Paris	LOCATION	Nights '' evokes a thrill , hinting at passionate gaiety in high relief against sombre shadow ; at concentrated drama , swiftly played and cynically ended , only to be perpetually renewed ; at shining romance rubbing shoulders with sordid misery . ''

		Paris Nights r '' in short , may be paraphrased as a conventional designa - tion for life at its highest pitch .

		And it is exactly that of which Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	writes ; only for him the special value , the titillating charm of life , lies largely in being able to pluck it in unexpected places , in dim recesses , in experi - ences that the average man accepts calmly as utterly banal and unmeaning .

		In
Paris	LOCATION	, for example , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	spends one of his significant evenings dining with a family of rich and stupid bourgeois . ''

		Curious existence ! ''

		is his final comment on their dull , contented , unthinking , perfectly ordered , ex - pensive round of living ; and thus from their impossible self-satisfaction he extracts a certain characteristic interest .

		His '' Artistic Evening '' has all the elements with which he loves best to dally . ''

		The first invitation I ever received into a purely Parisian interior might have been copied out of a novel by
Paul Bourget	PERSON	.

		Its lure was thus phrased : ` Un pen de musique et d'agreablesfemmes . '

		It answered to my inward vision of
Paris	LOCATION	.

		My experiences in
London	LOCATION	, which fifteen years earlier I had entered with my mouth open as I might have entered some city of Oriental romance , had , of course , done little to destroy my illusions about
Paris	LOCATION	, for the ingenuousness of the artist is happily indestructible .

		Hence , my inward vision of
Paris	LOCATION	was romantic , based on the belief that
Paris	LOCATION	was essentially ' different . '

		Nothing more banal in
London	LOCATION	than a 1 little music , ' or even ' some agreeable women ' !

		But what a difference between a little music and un pen de musique !

		What an exciting difference between agree - able women and agreables femmes !

		After all , this dif - ference remains nearly intact to this day . ''

		Such distinctions delight the indestructible ingenuousness of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's artistic soul .

		Generally he contrives that they shall delight his readers .

		There is nothing recondite about this final analysis of the glitter of a great Lon - don restaurant ; one has felt it all before in a way , but not articulately : '' This is a fearful and romantic place .

		The romance of it rises grandiosely storey beyond storey ... And the most romantic and impressive thing about it all is the invisible secret thoughts , beneath the specious bravery , of the uncountable multitude gathered together under the spell of the brains that invented the organism .

		Can you not look through the transparent faces of the young men with fine waistcoats and neglected boots , and of the young women with concocted hats and insecure gay blouses , and of the waiters whose memories are full of Swiss mountains and Italian lakes and German beer gardens , and of the violinist who was proclaimed a Kubelik at the Conservatoire and who now is carelessly pronounced ` jolly good ' by eaters of beefsteaks ?

		Can you not look through and see the wonderful secret pre - occupations ?

		If so , you can also pierce walls and floors , and see clearly into the souls of the cooks and the sub - cooks , and the cellar-men , and the commissionaires in the rain , and the washers-up .

		They are all there , in - cluding the human beings with loves and ambitions who never do anything for ever and ever but wash up ... The place is grandiose and imposing ; it has the dazzle of extreme success ; but when you have stared it down it is wistful enough to make you cry . ''

		Swiss hotels and Florentine pensions , Italian opera , the roll of an Isle of Man steamboat , the superiority of
Manchester	LOCATION	, system-playing at
Monte Carlo	ORGANIZATION	, the forest of
Fontainebleau	LOCATION	and its villages , the British home , the Russian ballet -
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL dancers , these give a fair indication of the variety of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's inspiration .

		None of his impressions are profoundly important .

		Some - times the `` indestructible ingenuousness of the artist '' seems a bit over-done , degenerating into mere pose .

		But generally Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	s com - ment is vivacious , provocative , alert to modern issues , investing the casual encounters of every - day living with that fresh interest and charm with which it is the function of the artist to supply them .

Margaret W. Morley	PERSON	's full and well-illustrated work on `` The
Carolina Mountains	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Herself a resident of the region depicted , and of proved skill in writing about nature and the denizens of field and forest ,
Miss Morley	PERSON	shows herself thor - oughly at home in the scenes and among the primi - tive people she has chosen to describe .

		A veritable paradise , she assures us , opens before the visitor to this little-frequented part of our country .

		`` As finally you approach the mountains that form the western end of
North Carolina	LOCATION	, you catch glimpses of heights so divinely blue that you seem about to enter some dream world through their magical portals . ''

		A water-color view of these mountains is supplied as frontispiece , and another appears on the cover ; and a map is given at the end of the book .

		The many and good uncolored illustrations are from photographs taken by the author .

		Mr.
Ernest Peixotto	PERSON	is well equipped for the pro- duction of such a book of travel and description and graphic illustration as `` Pacific Shores from
Panama	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The approaching completion of the
Panama Canal	ORGANIZATION	will open a way for winter tourists down the little-visited west coast of
South America	LOCATION	, and such books as this from Mr.
Peix	PERSON	- otto 's pen will become much more common than at present .

		Just now this volume is something of a pioneer in its field , and is sure to attract attention by its novelty , to say nothing of its other merits .


Peru	LOCATION	and its wonders as the ancient domain of the Incas , with a brief glimpse of
Bolivia	LOCATION	and some passing calls at points of interest in the northward voyage from
Panama	LOCATION	, furnish the substance of the volume .

		The author 's well-known skill as an artist is exhibited in many an exquisite drawing to accom - pany the work of his pen .

		So much excellence of 480 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	more than one sort is seldom included within a single book of travel .

		A gorgeous but not inappro - priate cover-design distinguishes the volume .

		Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	's manner of describing and photographically illustrating the highways and by - ways of various parts of our country is now so well and so favorably known as to make necessary only a brief notice of his latest achievement in this sort . ''

		Highways and Byways from the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	to
Virginia	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is published as number six of the series , and conducts the reader through the states of
West Virginia	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	,
Delaware	LOCATION	,
Maryland	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, and
Virginia	LOCATION	, and also into the
District of Columbia	LOCATION	, the Adirondack region being the nearest approach to the river named in the title .

		As in the other volumes of the series , local color , local idioms , local human nature , give life and variety to the successive chapters , and the illustrations are well chosen and of high quality .

		FOREIGN TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION .

		Of a richness like that which distinguished his book on the Holy Land is Mr.
Robert Hichens	PERSON	's sumptuous volume on `` The Near East '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , presenting in six leisurely chapters the chief attractions -LRB- to a seeker of the picturesque , the striking , the characteristic -RRB- of
Dalmatia	LOCATION	,
Athens	LOCATION	and the surrounding country , and
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		The writer 's descriptive powers are now well known , and are at their best in placing before the reader such matchless scenes as the view from the Acro - polis on a fair
summer	DATE	day , or in rendering with a few strokes the strange sights of the Turkish capi - tal .

		Of the first-named he says : '' Very pure , very perfect , is this great view .

		Nature here seems purged of all excesses , and even nature in certain places can look almost theatrical , though never in
Greece	LOCATION	.

		The sea shines with gold , is decked with marvellous purple , glimmers afar with silver , fades into the color of shadow .

		The shapes of the moun - tains are as serene as the shapes of Greek statues . ''

		In a later stage of his eastern journey , and in another mood , he writes : ``
Pera	PERSON	has all that is odious of the Levant : impudence , ostentation , sly - ness , indelicacy , uproar , a glittering commonness .

		It is like a blazing ring of imitation diamonds squeezing a fat and dirty finger . ''

		Eighteen orien - tally brilliant paintings by Mr.
Jules Gue	PERSON	* rin , with a much greater number of photographs , have con - tributed to the illustration of the book , which is a royal octavo in form , with beautiful print , wide margins , and handsome binding .

		One memorable
Saturday	DATE
afternoon	TIME	, in the Mer - cantile Library ,
Baltimore	LOCATION	, a lad of seventeen , look - ing up from his book , beheld the distinguished author of `` Vanity Fair , '' and has ever since cherished the remembrance of that massive head and pink face , and those bespectacled eyes .

		The lad was F. Hop - kinson
Smith	ORGANIZATION	, who now , many years later , reverts fondly to the occasion in his introduction to a series of illustrated chapters which bear the title , '' In
Thackeray	PERSON	's
London	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		With both pen and pencil he pictures some of the haunts frequented by the great novelist , choosing first of all those asso - ciated with
Colonel Newcome	PERSON	, a prime favorite with Mr.
Smith	PERSON	.

		Thus we have both an exterior and an interior view of the
Colonel	ORGANIZATION	's rooms , and following these are glimpses of
Grey Friars	ORGANIZATION	,
Smithfield Market	ORGANIZATION	, Staple Inn ,
Berkeley Square	LOCATION	,
St. George 's Church	ORGANIZATION	in
Hanover Square	LOCATION	, the
Cock Tavern	ORGANIZATION	,
Lamb Court	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	Bridge , and so on , to the number of one-and - twenty excellent drawings accompanied by hardly less excellent chat on the themes they suggest .

		The volume is of quarto size , printed in large type , and durably bound in cloth .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's recent sight-seeing in
Spain	LOCATION	has furnished entertainment to readers of ``
Harper	PERSON	's Monthly , '' and his pleasant remembrances of that outing are now gathered into a volume entitled '' Familiar Spanish Travels '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- familiar because the ordinary tourist route seems to have been followed , with no side trips into the unknown .

		Thus the author 's pen confines itself to picturing the things seen at
Madrid	LOCATION	,
Toledo	LOCATION	,
Cordova	LOCATION	,
Seville	LOCATION	,
Valladolid	LOCATION	, and other easily-accessible and often - visited places .

		But to view these scenes through Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's eyes is a privilege to be prized by his readers .

		The genial philosophy of a mellow ma - turity pervades the book , and its pages reveal the author at his best .

		Of its many illustrations , some are the exquisite work of Mr.
Norman Irving Black	PERSON	, and one of peculiar charm bears the signature of Mr.
Walter Hale	PERSON	; the others are from photographs .

		A pleasing and appropriate design adorns the cover , and an `` Argument '' in verse , from Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's pen , is printed on the wrapper .

		Miss
Lilian Whiting	PERSON	's `` Athens the Violet - Crowned '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is written in that pleasing manner which has won so many readers for her score or more of other books , from `` The World Beautiful '' to her study of the Brownings .

		Sensitiveness to beauty , and a faculty for discover - ing it in the things about her , give her writings a bright and cheerful and optimistic tone that renders them not inappropriate as Christmas gifts and not unsuited to Christmas reading .

		Her present volume is especially enjoyable and informing in its descrip - tion of things seen by the writer herself in the
Athens	LOCATION	of to-day , though passages on the older
Athens	LOCATION	are not lacking .

		An account of the archae - ological schools established at different times in the Greek capital , and a short chapter on contemporary Greek literature , contain in brief space some facts of interest .

		Her treatment of the literature and arts of ancient
Greece	LOCATION	is necessarily of a cursory nature .

		A short chapter on `` Ethical Poetry of
Greece	LOCATION	'' contains fragments from noteworthy En - glish versions of Greek poets , and in her running comment
Miss Whiting	LOCATION	takes occasion to inform her readers that `` the traditional counsel to ` Count no man happy till he dies , ' is condensed from a passage in the -LRB- Ediptis Tyrannus '' a translation of
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 481 which is added .

		Has she forgotten
Solon	ORGANIZATION	's famous reply to Croasus , long before Sophocles was born ?

		The book is well and profusely illustrated from photographs . ''

		On the first day of
May , 1911	DATE	, we began our exploration of the '
Scott Country	ORGANIZATION	. '

		I say we , be - cause I was accompanied by the companion of a much longer journey , of which that year was the twenty-fifth milestone . ''

		Thus begins '' The Country of Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Charles S. Olcott	PERSON	, who three years ago gave us a good book on the scenes and characters of
George Eliot	ORGANIZATION	's novels .

		After an introduction and a biographical chapter , the author takes up
Scott	PERSON	's chief works in the order of their writing , and brings together the pertinent facts of geography and history , with other and more personal items of interest , adding also a great num - ber of fine full-page views of historic scenes and beautiful landscapes from his own camera .

		The
Raeburn	PERSON	portrait of Scott serves as frontispiece .

		With a final chapter entitled '' A Successful Life , '' and a full index , the book comes to an end .

		The tone and spirit of Mr.
Oliver Huckel	PERSON	's '' Through England with Tennyson '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- distinguish it from most travel books of its kind , in that the journey in this instance seems not to have been undertaken primarily for book-making purposes , but out of an earnest desire to see the places once so familiar to the traveller 's favorite poet , and to tread the ground once pressed by that poet 's foot .

		Mr.
HuckePs	PERSON	descriptions of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's haunts and homes , in
Lincolnshire	LOCATION	, in the Isle of
Wight	LOCATION	, and among the
Surrey	LOCATION	hills , are agreeably interspersed with anecdote , reminiscence , quotation , and ever and anon a glimpse of his travelling companions , the Lady and the Laddies , and of the incidental hap - penings by the way .

		A map and numerous views and portraits , with a list of Tennysonian poems con - nected with the places visited , and a concluding index , round out this attractive and instructive volume .

		Subjects in plenty for historical research and for readable description have been found by Miss
Ella Noyes	PERSON	in the rolling plain about
Salisbury	LOCATION	, in the famous cathedral of that city , in the city itself , in the stones that propound their riddle to every visitor to Stonehenge , in
Old Sarum	LOCATION	and
Wilton	PERSON	and Wileybourn , in the Avon valley , the roads that traverse the plain and the villages that sprinkle it .

		`` Salisbury Plain : Its Stones ,
Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	,
City	LOCATION	, Villages , and Folk '' -LRB- Button -RRB- presents the results of long and loving study on the part of one who evidently knows every nook and corner of the region dealt with , knows its history and legends , its people and its customs , its natural beauties and its features of interest due to the hand of man .

		Miss
Dora Noyes	PERSON	has illustrated the book with deli - cately pleasing colored drawings and equally grace - ful line sketches both in abundance , and of more than ordinary artistic merit .

		Literary and historic associations make the region , and hence the book , memorable to every intelligent reader .

		`` A Stained Glass Tour in
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , by Mr.
Charles Hitchcock Sherrill	PERSON	, enjoys the advantage of having a title rather out of the ordinary , and the kind of promenade on which it takes the reader is not exactly of an every-day sort .

		The beauties of stained glass windows are studied in successive Italian cities ,
Rome	LOCATION	,
Orvieto	LOCATION	,
Perugia	LOCATION	,
Assisi	LOCATION	, and so on , to
Milan	LOCATION	and
Pavia	LOCATION	, not omitting
Florence	LOCATION	and
Pisa	LOCATION	and
Siena	LOCATION	and
Venice	LOCATION	.

		Illustrations in plenty help out the verbal descriptions , but no attempt has been made to reproduce in color the glories that inspire the writer 's pen perhaps because such attempt was sure to disappoint .

		The technicalities of the subject are but cursorily treated , as the book is evidently intended for gen - eral reading , as are the same author 's similar works relating to
France	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	.

		Forest-lovers will enjoy Mr.
Arthur	PERSON	0 .

		Cooke 's fine volume , '' The Forest of Dean '' -LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with its graphic descriptions of things to be seen in the great Crown woodland lying between the Severn and the Wye in
Gloucestershire	LOCATION	, and also of other scenically or historically noteworthy places that were formerly within the limits of the Forest , but now outside .

		Walks and talks with the foresters are agreeably reported , a multitude of matters relating to forestry , to local history , to the people and the industries of the region , are mentioned in passing , and every now and then a pencil sketch or a colored drawing is introduced to give point and fuller mean - ing to the narrative or description .

		If the reader wishes additional information as to the Forest 's history , he is referred to
H. G. Nicholls	PERSON	's '' Historical and Descriptive Account , '' published half a century ago .

		An amusing preface in the form of an imaginary conversation between publisher and author explains the plan and purpose of Mr.
Frankfort Somerville	PERSON	's book , `` The Spirit of
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author attempts to seize and embody in his pages something of the je ne sais quoi that makes the French capital so irresistibly fascinating to all the world .

		Description , narrative , dialogue , anecdote , and , not least of all , colored drawings by Messrs.
Fraipont	PERSON	,
Gautier	PERSON	,
Kirchner	PERSON	, and others , contribute in their several ways to the production of some such effect as an actual visit to
Paris	LOCATION	and a mingling with its light-hearted , pleasure-loving , quick-witted populace might produce .

		Parisian amusements , costume , cooking , Parisian theatres , fgtes , cafe 's , the races , the artists , the typical Parisienne , Americans in
Paris	LOCATION	, with much beside , give liveliness and variety to Mr.
Somerville	PERSON	's chapters .

		Some of the colored drawings are remarkably good , others not so good , but all in accord with '' the spirit of
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		With a camera , a motor-car -LRB- even a hired one -RRB- , and a fairly abundant supply of ready money , one can in a few days of assiduous touring collect mate - rial for an entertaining and plentifully illustrated book of travel . ''

		Old Countries Discovered Anew '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- gives in bright and rather novel form Mr.
Ernest Talbert	PERSON	's experiences in a family flight by 482 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	automobile through parts of
Holland	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	, and
France	LOCATION	, in a few weeks of early
summer	DATE	.

		Many curious and little-frequented scenes were visited , local history and photographed views were gathered for the prospective volume , and on the whole a rollicking good time seems to have been enjoyed .

		Much useful information for future auto-tourists is furnished , with earnest advice to hire rather than transport over-seas the needed automobile .

		A map , appendix , special index of practical matters , gen - eral index , and seventy-one illustrations , including a colored frontispiece , are a part of the book 's handsome equipment .

		Mr.
Henry C. Shelley	PERSON	's assiduous pen gives us a small and useful volume on `` Shakespeare and
Stratford	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which points out agreeably and with sufficient erudition the places of Shakespearean interest in the
Warwickshire	LOCATION	town , and presents them to the eye in illustrations from photographs taken by the author .

		In connection with the so-called birthplace of the poet , the reader is duly advised of the serious doubt as to its being really the birthplace , and of the claims of the so - called
Brook House	ORGANIZATION	, no longer standing , to the honor in question .

		Chapters on
New Place	ORGANIZATION	, on the Strat - ford church , the town , and the eight neighboring hamlets known as the Shakespeare villages , make up , with a few pages of notes for tourists , the rest of the book .

		A new edition of Mr.
W. J. Loftie	PERSON	's excellent historical and descriptive account of
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	is offered through the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In addition to the colored frontispiece , the repro - ductions of old prints , and the illustrations from photographs , there are many fine drawings of espe - cially interesting parts of the
Abbey	ORGANIZATION	from the skilled hand of Mr.
Herbert Bailton	PERSON	.

		A fuller index might have been made for the book 's three hundred and sixteen compact pages of varied infor - mation , instead of the meagre performance that now completes the book .

		Mr.
Loftie	PERSON	's chapters on the monuments , the epitaphs , and the heraldry of the
Abbey	LOCATION	, as also that on the Poet 's Corner , and that on royal coronations , make the work both useful to the tourist and interesting to the arm - chair reader .

		HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE .

		Like each of his four previous volumes from
Thoreau	PERSON	's works , Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	's edition of sundry selections grouped under the title `` Excur - sions '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- has thirty-three illustrations from his camera , chiefly views taken here and there in the
Thoreau	LOCATION	country , as we may call Concord and the neighborhood most frequented by the naturalist .

		Emerson 's biographical sketch of his famous fellow - townsman opens the book , and is followed by
Thoreau	PERSON	's notes on certain
Massachusetts	LOCATION	natural - history reports that appeared about
1842	DATE	, his description of a walk to Mt. Wachusett , his short paper on `` The Landlord , '' another describing a winter walk , his address before the Middlesex Agri - cultural Society on `` The Succession of Forest Trees , '' considerable passages of his in praise of walking , others relating to the splendors of autumn foliage , his well-known chapter on wild apples , and , finally , some observations on night and moonlight .

		Indication of the exact source of these selections is often wanting ; also , the pictures , beautiful and gen - erally appropriate as they are , have seldom a close connection with the reading matter .

		Nevertheless it is a well-planned , well-executed , and very attract - ive book , beautifully bound and suitably boxed .

		New books of travel appear and disappear , but
Kinglake	PERSON	's `` Eothen , '' first published sixty-nine years ago , reappears in edition after edition , usually with a diminishing interval between each later edition and its successor .

		In
England	LOCATION	alone , nineteen editions had been issued between
1844	DATE	and
1910	DATE	, and the twentieth , which makes its appeal to American pur - chasers through the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	, is now on the market .

		An appreciative introduction by Mr.
S. L. Bensusan	PERSON	prefaces the book , and some gor - geously oriental colored plates , by Mr.
Frank Brangwyn	PERSON	, with smaller drawings from the same hand as chapter-headings , enliven its pages .

		King - lake was a pioneer in eastern travel , and his braving of its dangers and hardships was no train-de-luxe or motor-car tour .

		That journey of his into the unknown Near East of
1835	DATE	was an adventure well worth recording ; and the record will live .

		The yearly reprints from
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	and
Gilbert White	PERSON	and
Thoreau	PERSON	attest the unfailing interest of the reading public in those gifted interpreters of nature .

		`` The Story of My Heart , '' that wonderful mingling of spiritual autobiography and impassioned nature-study and wide-ranging speculation , appears this year in a new and fitting dress , with eight beau - tifully drawn and almost as satisfactorily colored illustrations by
E. W. Waite	PERSON	.

		The letters from
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	to
Longman	LOCATION	, his publisher , leading up to the publication of the book , also his analysis of the work as given in the publisher 's `` Notes on Books '' of
November 30 , 1883	DATE	, are prefixed to the present edition , together with an anonymous '' foreword '' of the briefest sort .

		In all the particulars of its form and appearance , this reissue of a favorite classic is everything that could be desired .

		A box protects the book 's ornamental binding .

		-LRB-
E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- '' The Jungle Book '' seems to be the most endur - ingly popular , or one might say the most increasingly popular , of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's works , with young readers , as well as many older ones ; and its circulation will be further enlarged by this season 's issue of an edition having sixteen full-page illustrations of tropical lux - uriance in their color-effects , designed by Messrs.
Maurice	PERSON	and
Edward Detmold	PERSON	.

		Uncolored drawings introduce the several chapters , and each page is bordered with representations of jungle foliage in light green .

		Similar decorations adorn the end leaves , and a cover design in gold and three shades of green presents in still another form the beauty
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL and charm of the jungle .

		A splendid setting is this for the fortunes of
Mowgli	ORGANIZATION	and his four-footed friends .

		-LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- So good a story as ''
Tom Brown	PERSON	's School Days '' can well bear occasional re-issuing .

		A handsome edition , furnished with interesting historical and biographical comment , and provided with illustra - tions from various sources , including , of course , portraits of
Thomas Hughes	PERSON	and Dr.
Arnold	PERSON	, takes its place among the more important reprints of the season .

		Lord
Kilbracken	PERSON	, an old Rugbeian , con - tributes a short preface , and Mr.
F. Sidgwick	PERSON	writes an extended introduction .

		Both the camera and the pencil furnish illustrations in profusion , and the cover-design shows a view of the school buildings .

		It is indeed an elaborate and tasteful form that the famous story now assumes .

		-LRB-
G. P. Putnam	ORGANIZATION	's Sons . -RRB-

		In a rich volume of spacious dimensions and bearing the title , `` Tales from
Washington	LOCATION	Irving 's Traveller '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , are gathered a baker 's dozen of the immortal stories of ''
Geoffrey Crayon	PERSON	, '' with nearly as many large colored plates , the work of Mr.
George Hood	PERSON	.

		Typography , paper , and binding are all in harmony with the general design of the book , and the vivid and variegated hues of the illustrations also accord not badly with the spirit of romance pervading the volume .

		The work will commend itself to lovers of what is striking and at the same time not too gaudy in book-manufacture .

		The striking illustrations , oriental in their rich coloring , which made Mr.
Willy Pog	PERSON	^ ny 's edition of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	's Rubaiyat a memorable work a few years ago , are all reproduced without change in the less expensive reprint of the book now offered by its publishers -LRB-
Crowell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and certainly worthy of a large sale .

		The version is of course
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's , in which one is glad to see the earlier and more admirable opening , '' Awake !

		for morning in the bowl of night , '' etc. .

		Tinted paper , graceful border-designs , a text imitating in general appear - ance the Persian original -LRB- not the Arabic , as the publishers announce -RRB- , a beautiful binding , and , above all , the twenty-four full-page illustrations , combine to make this an artistically satisfying edition .

		Two tasteful volumes in white covers of parch - ment-like appearance , delicately ornamented , are devoted to the more pleasing of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's songs , sixteen in number , and to a selection -LRB- fifteen -RRB- from the sonnets .

		Ornamental text , illuminated initials and borders and vignettes are the handiwork of Miss
Edith A. Ibbs	PERSON	.

		Each page is a separate work of art ; there are no repeated designs , and the whole effect is most pleasing .

		As gifts to and from per - sons of discrimination , these little books will be appreciated .

Dutton	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		HOLIDAY ART BOOKS .

		Bringing to his task a devout and appreciative spirit , the late John La Farge executed a remark - able piece of work in `` The Gospel Story in Art '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , the final product of his genius , and one that he had planned many years before it was act - ually carried through .

		Born and reared in the older faith of
Christendom	LOCATION	, as we are reminded by the author 's close friend who prefaces the book , Mr.
La Farge	PERSON	was in thorough sympathy with his sub - ject , and also , of course , amply equipped with the technical knowledge necessary for its satisfactory treatment .

		Beginning with characters and events antedating the gospel story , he weaves his discourse about the great works of sacred art , from
Raphael	PERSON	's '' Heliodorus '' to
Bordone	PERSON	's '' Pentecost , `` with repro - ductions of these masterpieces to the number of eighty , in full-page plates , delicately tinted .

		A few last touches have been given to the work by the editor , but virtually it is all as the author himself left it when death stayed his hand .

		The narrative and comment make nineteen chapters , which fill more than four hundred quarto pages .

		An illu - minated design of great beauty adorns the cover , and the book is suitably boxed .

		A more acceptable Christmas gift to one qualified to appreciate it could not easily be imagined .

		Evolution in household furniture during the first two centuries of American history becomes a fasci - nating study as treated by Mr.
Luke Vincent Lock	PERSON	- wood in his `` Colonial Furniture in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , which now , eleven years after its first appearance , is expanded into two massive quarto volumes with eight hundred and sixty-seven illus - trations of representative pieces .

		In fact , so much new material has been discovered by the author that he has felt it necessary to rewrite his book throughout , so that the much enlarged work is now virtually a new treatise , and its several chapters as exhaustive as they could well be made without be - coming too technical for general interest .

		After an introductory sketch of the origin and character of our early furniture , the author begins the body of his work with chapters on chests and chests of drawers , passing in logical sequence to cupboards and sideboards , thence to desks and writing-tables , and closing his first volume with looking-glasses .

		Volume two treats of chairs , settees , couches , and sofas , tables , bedsteads , and clocks .

		How the rude pine chest mounts through all the spires of form to the carved mahogany dressing-table of exquisite Chippendale design , and how the severely plain settle becomes elaborated into the gracefully orna - mented settee and the luxurious couch , may be traced in Mr.
Lockwood	PERSON	's graphic pages with their lavish accompaniment of excellent half-tones .

		The ideal that at last successfully got itself realized was the production of furniture combining a minimum of material with a maximum of grace , and at the same time having due regard to strength and ser - viceability .

		The attainment of this ideal coincides pretty nearly with the close of our colonial period , so that the study of colonial furniture has a certain completeness in itself that gives an added satisfac - tion to its pursuit .

		Incidentally there is much politi - cal and religious history to be read in the lines of an old rush-bottomed chair or oak bedstead or grandfather 's clock .

		The
Plymouth	LOCATION	settlers ' years 484 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	of residence in
Holland	LOCATION	were attested in such simple articles of furniture as they brought with them to the New World , and the Puritan emigrants from the west of
England	LOCATION	also carried with them similar evidences of their former place of habita - tion and more prosperous mode of life .

		Indeed , it is in
New England	LOCATION	that the author has found the most abundant and the most interesting examples of early furniture , while the South , he says , '' is wof ully lacking in any pieces prior to the mahogany period , although the inventories show that such pieces existed more abundantly there even than in the North . ''

		The causes of this dearth might not be very difficult to trace .

		In preparing his work , Mr.
Lockwood	PERSON	seems to have ransacked most of the available sources of information , examined the principal collections , and pushed his researches wherever there was promise of a valuable discovery .

		An owner 's unwillingness to let photographs be taken of his treasures has sometimes balked him in part , but the result of his labors is , on the whole , highly satisfactory .

		Mr.
Seymour de Ricci	PERSON	's study of ``
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		Furniture '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a quarto of sumptuous appearance , comprising chiefly full-page plates and smaller illustrations , picturing the grace and charm of the tables , chairs , mantel-pieces , bedsteads , mural carving , and so on , that are associated with the name of the monarch whose reign came to so dire an end with the outbreak of the French Revo - lution .

		A short account of the origin and rise of the
Louis	LOCATION	Seize style precedes the rich collection of photographic representations of typical examples , and in the course of this brief treatise the author maintains that the culmination of the style was reached considerably earlier than is commonly sup - posed , or at about the close of the reign of Louis XV .

		The illustrations , covering two hundred and fifty-six large pages , furnish a feast to the eye of him who loves beauty of form and wealth of orna - mentation in the appointments of a room .

		Such rich collections as those of the Musde des Arts Decoratifs ,
Paris	LOCATION	, and the Kunstgewerbe-Museum ,
Berlin	LOCATION	, as well as many private collections , have been drawn upon for typical examples .

		Art stu - dents and collectors will find the book of great value , and hardly anyone can turn its pages without enjoyment and instruction .

		NATURE AND OUT-DOOR LIFE .

		Fourteen papers , `` written in many moods , and in many places , during the past half-dozen years , '' and originally published in various magazines , are collected by Mr.
Walter Prichard Eaton	PERSON	in a vol - ume entitled `` Barn Doors and Byways '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which with deft strokes of pen and pencil and brush opens to view a variety of scenes chiefly in rural
New England	LOCATION	, with a few
Southern	ORGANIZATION	vistas to mark a contrast .

		Two papers one on `` Wild Life in
New York	LOCATION	'' -LRB- city , not state -RRB- , and the other entitled ''
Washington	LOCATION	Square : A Meditation '' are of a slightly urban character , though even here the things seen are things sugges - tive of the country .

		For example : `` The
spring	DATE	hats this year are wonderful affairs an acre sown with flowers .

		Beyond the fountain one of the green ` busses rolled by , its top loaded with sight-seers , and the hats of the women made it a gay garden in transit down the Avenue . ''

		Even the sky-scrapers suggest mountain scenery and are spoken of as an `` Andean pile . ''

		Tasteful full-page plates in tint , with smaller black-and-white drawings as decorative headings to the successive chapters , are supplied by Mr.
Walter King	PERSON	Stone .

		Mr.
Ernest Thompson Seton	PERSON	has long ago proved that he can see with his eyes and draw with his hand and reason with his brain .

		In his `` Wild Animals at Home '' -LRB-
Doubleday	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- there is much sketching and photographing of untamed creatures in their native haunts , and admirable discourse con - cerning them .

		In the
Yellowstone Park	LOCATION	and else - where in the great West the author has carried on the nature-studies now reduced to writing and pre - sented in twelve enjoyable chapters with a wealth of illustrations .

		The coyote , the prairie-dog , the famous fur-bearers , the swift runners , the squirrel and the rabbit , and other wild animals , are inti - mately interviewed by this skilled reporter of the forest and the field ; and what he has to say , com - bined with his manner of saying it , is not likely to disappoint .

		Humor of a choice kind speaks in both the printed page and in the accompanying marginal sketches , while the half-tone plates have the soberer excellences of such products of the illustrator 's art .

		Human nature is not neglected in the author 's stud - ies ; animals were not the sole living beings he en - countered .

		Mrs.
Seton	PERSON	furnishes an original and appropriate cover design , and has otherwise assisted in the preparation of the book .

		It is evident that no expense has been spared in the preparation of Mr.
H. Inigo Triggs	PERSON	's '' Garden Craft in
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , a handsome quarto abounding in reproductions of old engravings , paint - ings , illuminations , and of photographs from nature .

		Having published ten years ago a work on '' Formal Gardens in
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Triggs	PERSON	here confines his attention chiefly to the Continent , and especially to
France	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Austria	LOCATION	, and
the Netherlands	LOCATION	.


Russia	LOCATION	and
Scandinavia	LOCATION	have not greatly distinguished themselves in landscape gardening .

		After two necessarily short chapters on ancient and mediaeval gardens , the author lavishes his resources on the garden craft of the sixteenth , seventeenth , and eighteenth centuries .

		Le Notre and the triumphs of his art at
Versailles	LOCATION	naturally claim extended notice , and it is Le N6tre 's portrait that serves as appropriate frontispiece to the volume .

		The final chapter deals with `` The English Land - scape School and its Influence on the Continent . ''

		A ten-page bibliography gives a list of nearly two hundred and forty special works on garden design , and a full index to text and illustrations closes the volume .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 485 Mr.
David Grayson	PERSON	, fearing that his farm and his live-stock and the rest of his worldly possessions were beginning to own him , rather than to be owned by him , broke loose from them one day and ran away , or walked away , out over the inviting ribbon of road that stretched alluringly into the romantic un - known .

		The story of his adventures is told by him in a book called `` The Friendly Road '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- .

		As a dusty pedestrian , and often regarded as not much better than a tramp , the author met with sundry experiences of suggestiveness and value , the result , he says , of `` coming up to life from under - neath ; of being taken for less than I am rather than for more than I am . ''

		This was refreshing after those long and weary earlier years of trying to keep in proper position a sort of dummy that he had set up and striven to make appear as he imagined the man bearing his name ought to appear in the eyes of the world .

		As in his `` Adventures in Contentment '' and `` Adventures in Friendship , '' the writer here comes close to the real things and the only things that matter in life . ''

		New Adventures in Content - ment '' is the book 's appropriate sub-title .

		Mr.
Thomas Fogarty	PERSON	illustrates it well and generously , both in color and in black-and-white .

		A set of strikingly beautiful views of
Williams	ORGANIZATION	- town ,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and its surroundings , not omitting the more important college buildings , serves as a fitting frame for a half-dozen nature poems by Professor
George Lansing Raymond	PERSON	, introduced by an appreciative preface from the pen of Dr.
Marion Mills Miller	PERSON	.

		`` The Mountains about
Williamstown	LOCATION	'' is the book 's title , and
Grey	PERSON	- lock ,
West Mountain	LOCATION	, and
Berlin Mountain	LOCATION	are especially celebrated in the poems .

		Ford 's
Glen	PERSON	gives its name to another , while the remaining two are entitled `` A Woodland Reverie '' and `` Amid the Mountains . ''

		They are all in ten-syllable verse , usually unrhymed , and hence a little monotonous in effect , though full of high feeling .

		The thirty-three full-page plates are excellent , and the scenes they represent well chosen by the poet and his assistants at the camera .

		-LRB-
G. P. Putnam	ORGANIZATION	's Sons . -RRB-

		In `` The Four Seasons '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , a poetic apologue by
Herr Carl Ewald	PERSON	, translated by Mr.
Alexander Teixeira de Mattos	PERSON	, the seasons are represented as great and powerful princes who divide the year among themselves and then proceed to exhibit their prowess and might , each in characteristic fashion , with birds and beasts and plants and trees as minor characters in the wonderful drama .

		Frequent songs , turned into English by Mr.
Osman Edwards	PERSON	, give pleasing variety to the story , and the whole is taste - fully printed with decorative page-borders and a suitable frontispiece .

		RECORDS OF THE PAST .

		In `` The Story of Harvard '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is presented a conveniently succinct account of our oldest university by one of her graduates , Mr.
Arthur Stanwood Pier	PERSON	, of the class of
1895	DATE	.

		Those who have read Mr.
Pier	PERSON	's early novel , that vivid and amusing story of the
Harvard Summer School	ORGANIZATION	, `` The Pedagogues , '' will be prepared to find him handling with a light touch and a pleasant humor certain aspects of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	history and Har - vard life .

		Notably do these graces of style blossom forth in his opening chapter , wherein are depicted the experiences and sensations of a graduate of twenty years ago upon revisiting his old haunts , now so changed , and in the closing chapter , which is entitled `` Freshman and Senior . ''

		In the body of the book are gathered the main facts of Har - vard 's history , drawn largely from such standard authorities as
Peirce	PERSON	and
Quincy	PERSON	and
Peabody	ORGANIZATION	, with occasional suggestions and quotations from other sources , to all of whom indebtedness is duly acknowledged .

		Mr.
Vernon Howe Bailey	PERSON	has made sixteen pencil drawings , pleasing and appropriate , to accompany the reading matter , and both binding and box are embellished with the depiction of a familiar
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	building .

		The hackneyed term , a '' human document , '' will suggest itself to readers of `` A Woman Rice Planter '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- as the best brief description of the vivid though quiet and unpretending pages of that remarkable narrative .

		Mrs. Patience Pen - nington tells in the form of a diary the story of her struggle to carry on a large rice plantation on the
South Carolina	LOCATION	coast , a struggle heroic in its nature , though so simply and modestly and un-self - consciously narrated that a careless reader would never suspect half of what is to be read between the lines .

		Death and other misfortunes had left on her shoulders a burden such as a strong man might have sunk beneath ; and the courage and spirit , as well as the quiet humor and infinite patience and self - control , revealed in her pages , are qualities beyond a hurried reviewer 's powers to do justice to .

		Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	introduces the book with a few para - graphs of cordial commendation , and a sympathetic artist illustrates it with drawings redolent of the South .

		The previous serial appearance of the work in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Sun '' is a voucher , if such were needed , for its readable quality .

		As is remarked in the preface to `` The Romance of the American Theatre '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Mary Caroline Crawford	PERSON	, there exists no complete history of the stage in this country , though scores of pens have written entertainingly about it .

		To these scattered chapters
Miss Crawford	ORGANIZATION	makes a notable contribution in her ample sheaf of memo - ries gleaned from many sources and extending from
Nance Oldfield	ORGANIZATION	and Peg Woffington -LRB- whose connec - tion with the American theatre is certainly not close -RRB- to Miss
Marlowe	PERSON	and Mrs.
Fiske	PERSON	and Mr.
John Drew	PERSON	and other stars of the present-day stage .

		Among themes of interest are her observations on the ups and downs of the theatre in the South , her account of
Edwin Forrest	PERSON	as actor and man , her passages devoted to Booth and his immediate con - temporaries , and her concluding remarks on the theatre of
New York	LOCATION	and the drama of to-day .

		The book shows diligence in compilation and skill in 486 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	arrangement of material , with evident intent to be broadly and generously inclusive .

		But among things perhaps unavoidably omitted one notes with some surprise that , good Bostonian though she is ,
Miss Crawford	PERSON	has barely mentioned that favorite comedian of
Boston	LOCATION	play-goers of half a century ago ,
William Warren	PERSON	, while other names are looked for quite in vain .

		The book is generously and suitably illustrated , handsomely bound , and neatly boxed .

		Between the dandy with a leaning toward letters and the man of letters with a leaning toward dandy - ism there are many grades , representing varying proportions of the two ingredients of foppery and devotion to literature .

		Some typical examples of more or less literate men of fashion and more or less fashionable men of letters are presented in rapid and dexterous portraiture by Mr.
Leon H. Vincent	PERSON	in his `` Dandies and Men of Letters '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which contains a dozen chapters on as many celeb - rities of the early nineteenth century in
England	LOCATION	.

		Beau Brummel naturally leads the list , followed by Count D'Orsay ,
Lord Byron	PERSON	,
Samuel Rogers	PERSON	,
Thomas Moore	PERSON	,
Thomas Hope	PERSON	,
William Beckford	PERSON	,
Thomas Love Peacock	PERSON	,
Charles Kirkpatrick Sharpe	PERSON	,
Benjamin Disraeli	PERSON	, Bulwer-Lytton , and
Henry Crabb Robinson	PERSON	.

		Portraits of these gentlemen illustrate the book , which is of that informal , inti - mate , anecdotal sort that seldom fails to entertain .

		A resplendent binding is appropriately provided for these followers of fashion .

		A vast store of facts interesting to those who follow the progress of ship-building is contained in Mr.
E. Keble Chatterton	PERSON	's `` Ships and Ways of Other Days '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , a book setting forth in a baker 's dozen of ample chapters , aided by one hundred and thirty illustrations of various kinds , the eventful story , `` how men managed to build , launch , equip , and fit out different craft in all ages , '' from the time of the Phoenicians to the
last quarter of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		The iron or steel steam - ship , or `` tea-kettle '' as the old-time sailor contempt - uously styled it , has no place in Mr.
Chatterton	PERSON	's pages .

		As already shown in his `` Sailing Ships and their Story '' and in his `` Fore and Aft , '' his love is not for the ocean greyhound or the modern fight - ing craft .

		In his chosen field he writes with full knowledge and with experienced pen .

		HOLIDAY FICTION .

		An ingeniously constructed little romance , brisk , eventful , dramatic , and with a capital climax most happily led up to , comes from the pen of Mr.
Jeffery Farnol	PERSON	in a dainty volume with colored pictures by Mr.
Charles E. Brock	PERSON	, and entitled `` The Honour - able Mr.
Tawnish	PERSON	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The time of the action is in that indefinite past when wigs and ruffles and laced coats were in fashion , as also were duelling and gambling and hard drinking ; and the story is enlivened with plenty of adventure , with highway robbery and dexterous play of swords and some letting of blood , with a love affair to bind everything together within the limits prescribed by the dramatic unities .

		The hero , who first poses as a fop , turns out to be a gallant and fearless gentle - man , and all ends happily with his winning of the heroine and rescue of her father from certain death at the hands of the villain .

		Mr.
Farnol	PERSON	here shows himself at his least prolix and , some will say , his best .

		This season 's love-story from the pen of Mr.
Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	has the alluring title of `` Lady Laughter '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , and relates how
Richard Hollidge	PERSON	,
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	graduate and formerly
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	instructor in English , thought himself to be hard at work on his forthcoming textbook on `` The Princi - ples of Good English , for the Use of Schools and Colleges , '' while in reality he was falling more and more irretrievably in love with his second cousin ,
Betty Lee	PERSON	, the Lady Laughter of the little romance , which of course ends happily with declarations of undying attachment on both sides and the prospect of wedding bells and orange blossoms iu the near future .

		This story of the preoccupied scholar who has to be helped into a consciousness of the state of his heart , and then requires what is virtually a proposal from her who has caused all the mischief , is older than the Pyramids , but always a favorite .

		Good colored pictures and graceful decorations embellish Mr.
Barbour	PERSON	's inviting volume , which is ornately bound and boxed .

		In a beautiful holiday edition , with sixteen brightly-colored illustrations from the brush of Mr.
Frederick S. Coburn	PERSON	, Miss
Anna Fuller	PERSON	's idyl , `` A Venetian June '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , makes its appearance in the twenty-third printing since first it delighted its readers seventeen years ago .

		Venice forms a pleas - ing setting for tale or romance , as has been proved often enough ; and with the resources of art and fine book-making placed at her disposal , Miss Fuller can - not complain of any sombreness in the dress that now clothes her graceful work .

		Venice is a city of color , and even if Mr.
Coburn	PERSON	's tints are perhaps rather gaudy as is likely to be the case at present in all colored illustrations the general effect is cheerful and festive , or , in other words , appropriate to the season .

		`` The Valley of Shadows '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , by Mr.
Francis Grierson	PERSON	, appears in a new edition with good illus - trations in color by Miss
Evelyn Paul	PERSON	.

		The
Grier	PERSON	- son family removed to
Illinois	LOCATION	, from
England	LOCATION	, not long before the outbreak of our Civil War , and the boy
Francis	PERSON	received indelible impressions of prairie life and prairie folk , which are realistically repro - duced in his book .

		He heard Lincoln and
Douglas	PERSON	in one of their famous debates , he acted as page to General Fre ` mont just after
Frdmont	PERSON	had succeeded General
Harney	PERSON	as military commander in
St. Louis	LOCATION	, and he had an older cousin in
Grant	LOCATION	's army who made the family name illustrious by his daring cavalry raids .

		His abundant material for the fur - nishing of a good book has been skilfully handled by the author in the narrative that has already made him favorably known to many readers .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 487 MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS .

		The story of `` Parsifal '' this year receives the benefit of Mr.
T. W. Rolleston	PERSON	's interpretative skill in a poetic version of beauty and charm .

		He will be remembered as the author of a notable rendering of the `` Tannhauser '' legend a year ago .

		He allows himself considerable freedom in his treatment of the themes already popularized by
Wagner	PERSON	and others , adding new features and reshaping the old where such liberties seem desirable .

		For instance , of the character Blanid , in his `` Parsifal , '' he says in his preface : `` She and her relations to the hero are an invention of the present writer , who in this and other respects has used the same freedom in reshaping the details of the old legend as the mediaeval writers , who often differ widely from each other , did not scruple to employ . ''

		He uses the rhymed iambic ten-syllable verse , and his poem runs to the length of about two thousand lines .

		Due acknowledgment is made to
Wagner	PERSON	.

		The setting of the poem , in an elaborate accompaniment of colored illustration and ornamentation , the work of Mr.
Willy Poga	PERSON	`` ny , is of very unusual richness and beauty .

		There are sixteen full-page color-plates , and many drawings in monochrome .

		Even the letter-press is from the artist 's hand , and is reproduced by lithography , together with the border designs .

		Apart from the literary excellence of the work , it is a splendid piece of book-making .

		-LRB-
Thomas Y. Crowell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Chiefly noteworthy among Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	's offerings for the present season is the folio volume containing '' Ten Spiritual Designs '' engraved by
Edward Calvert	PERSON	, one of that little group of
Blake	PERSON	's contemporary disciples whose work has been too heavily dimmed by the refulgence of their master .

		Calvert 's imagination , like
Donne	PERSON	's , led him into a realm where the spiritual and the sensuous were strangely blended ; and the '' visionary gleams '' which he has given us in these drawings will always be cherished for their rare and exquisite beauty .

		Enlarged as they are , the reproductions here pub - lished doubtless do fuller justice to the originals than even the artist 's proofs from which they were made .

		A '' Foreword '' by Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	, a reprinted essay on Calvert by Mr.
Herbert P. Home	PERSON	, and some brief notices from various sources , contain whatever in - formation is necessary to a proper understanding of the artist and his work .

		Next in interest is a quarto reprint of
Alexander Smith	PERSON	's '' Dreamthorp : A Book of Essays Written in the Country . ''

		First published a half-century ago , '' Dreamthorp '' has made its way all too slowly into popular recognition , though the elect long since gave it a place on their shelves at no great distance from the acknowledged masters among English essayists .

		With Mr.
James Ashcrof	PERSON	t Noble 's eloquent appreciation included by way of Introduction , this first adequate edition of '' Dream - thorp '' is a boon for which lovers of literature should be heartily grateful .

		Professor
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	's fame as a translator of the great Greek tragedies has rather obscured the reputation of his original three-act play , an experiment in the Greek manner , entitled '' Andromache , '' first published in 1 900 .

		Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	has therefore done well to give this a place on his list , in an edition that is typographi - cally all that could be desired .

		Three of Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's new books are reprints , in different form , of works previously published by him but which have long been out of print .

		These are Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	's sonnet-sequence , `` The Growth of Love , '' now issued with a portrait of the author ; that charm - ing anthology , '' Songs of Adieu : A Little Book of Finale and Farewell '' ; and Mr.
Charles Johnston	PERSON	's remarkable renderings from the ancient wisdom books of
India	LOCATION	, `` From the Upanishads , '' now in - cluded in the '' Vest - Pocket Series . ''

		It only remains to mention three small miscellaneous vol - umes : a rubricated edition of '' The Sermon on the Mount '' ;
Ernest Dowson	PERSON	's dramatic fantasy , `` The Pierrot of the Minute , '' now added to the `` Lyric Garland '' series ; and `` Songs from an Italian Gar - den '' by Mrs. A. .


Mary F. Robinson	PERSON	, issued in the `` Venetian Series . ''

		We have so often praised the form in which Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	publishes his books , that anything further on that score would be superfluous .

		From the elaborate folio to the little paper-covered pocket volume , every title on his list is given a typographic setting at once strikingly attractive and distinctive .

		Among Christmas gift-books conforming to
Dorothy Wordsworth	PERSON	's familiar petition we know of nothing better .

		A book about
Cambridge University	ORGANIZATION	life from the pen of a Tennyson -LRB- even though not an
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	-RRB- can not fail to excite pleasurable expec - tations on being opened .

		Mr.
Charles Tennyson	PERSON	's `` Cambridge from Within '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- has that per - sonal and reminiscent quality that can raise chronicle and description out of the bleak category of guide - book literature and make the writer 's pages glow with something of the warmth and color of life .

		In his introductory chapter Mr.
Tennyson	PERSON	observes that `` a prudent chronicler will do well to confine himself to the comparative certainty of personal rem - iniscence '' in handling a subject of so many varied aspects as his .

		Then follows a series of pen-pictures of academic routine and academic customs , college dons and college undergraduates , methods of work and modes of diversion , interspersed with frequent illustrations , in water-color or in sepia , from Mr.
Harry Morley	PERSON	's experienced hand .

		The book 's hu - morous dedication , `` to the friends who may recog - nize each other , but I hope not themselves , in the following pages , '' is in itself a promise of good things to come .

		To her series of `` Myths and Legends '' Miss
Katharine Berry Judson	PERSON	adds this year a fourth volume entitled '' Myths and Legends of the Great Plains '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , which she frankly acknowledges to be a compilation from such sources as the annual reports of the
Bureau of American Ethnology	ORGANIZATION	, the publications of the
United States Geographical and Geological Survey	ORGANIZATION	, and the works of various ethno - logists .

		A great number of legends , ascribed to various Indian tribes , are brought together in brief 488 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	and readable form , sometimes in verse , and with occasional illustrations of native origin .

		A petro - glyph in
Nebraska	LOCATION	is reproduced , portraits of two Indian chiefs are given , and other suitable pictures are provided .

		The book is excellent as a popular and at the same time faithful treatment of its subject .

		Zeal and industry and an equipment of rather unusual learning have gone into the making of Mr.
Lewis Spenee	PERSON	's elaborate volume on `` The Myths of
Mexico	LOCATION	and
Peru	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The subject is one that still invites the researches of archaeologists and philologists , and the author laments that so little interest in it has yet been taken by English scholars .

		Notable is his emphatically-declared belief in the native origin of the civilization of
Mexico	LOCATION	,
Central America	LOCATION	, and
Peru	LOCATION	, a subject on which , as he remarks , much mistaken erudition has been lav - ished .

		Rather more than two-thirds of his book is devoted to
Mexico	LOCATION	, the concluding portion to
Peru	LOCATION	, with appended maps , bibliography , language notes , and a combined glossary and index .

		Sixty full - page illustrations , some in color , add to the book 's attractiveness .

		Some of the last productions of the pen of her whom her readers will ever remember by her maiden name of
Myrtle Reed	ORGANIZATION	, rather than by her married name of Mrs.
James S. McCallough	PERSON	, are gathered into a lavender-bound volume under the title , `` Happy Women '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Happy these women were in that they had a high purpose in life and attained it .

		Here is the list :
Dolly Madison	PERSON	, Queen
Louise	PERSON	of
Prussia	LOCATION	,
Dorothy Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Caroline Herschel	PERSON	,
Elizabeth Barrett Browning	PERSON	,
Charlotte Cushman	LOCATION	,
Lucretia Mott	PERSON	,
Florence Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	,
Dorothy Pattison	PERSON	,
Jenny Lind	PERSON	,
Louisa Alcott	PERSON	, and Queen
Victoria	PERSON	.

		A portrait of each is given , also a sympathetic introduction , biographical and appre - ciative , contributed by Mrs.
Mary Badollet Powell	PERSON	, a friend and admirer of the author of the book .

		A series of '' Fellowship Books '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- under the general editorship of Miss
Mary Stratton	PERSON	, starts with four short and wholesome treatises on '' Friend - ship , '' by Mr.
Clifford Bax	PERSON	, '' The Joy of the Theatre , '' by Mr.
Gilbert Cannan	PERSON	, `` Divine Discontent , '' by Mr.
James Guthrie	PERSON	, and `` The Quest of the Ideal , '' by Mrs.
Grace Rhys	PERSON	.

		Each writer is left to choose his or her own subject , and only those who are in sympathy with the purpose of the series are invited to contribute .

		The series is described as `` a new contribution toward the expression of the human ideal and artistic faith of our own day , '' and it seeks `` to recall the elemental truths whence springs all that makes life worth living , the factors that increase our common enjoyment of nature , poetry and art . ''

		A list of able writers for forthcoming volumes is announced .

		Each issue is attractively bound in blue and gilt , with paper wrapper .

		Press-work is of the best .

		The quality and inexpensiveness of these little books should secure them a good circulation .

		They are an excellent corrective to materialism in its manifold forms .

		A delightful spirit of frivolity pervades the five little volumes of the ''
Onyx	ORGANIZATION	Series , '' books made up of snippets of prose and verse rather more verse than prose all from the nimble pen of Miss Car - olyn Wells .

		The titles of these five smile-begetters are : `` Girls and Gayety , '' `` The Eternal Feminine , '' `` Pleasing Prose , '' `` The Re-echo Club , '' and ''
Christmas Carollin	PERSON	' . ''

		The connoisseur will prob - ably like best of all `` The Re-echo Club , '' in which bits of verse on nonsensical themes are given in the manner of various eminent poets .

		Faithful to its name , the series is printed on paper of onyx pat - tern and hues , and a cover-design in imitation of lace decorates the binding .

		Miss Wells proves her - self the possessor of an all but inexhaustible fund of fun ; her hilarity chimes well with the Christmas season .

		-LRB-
Franklin Bigelow Corporation	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		Another book is added to Mr.
Wayne Whipple	PERSON	's '' Story-Life '' series in '' The Story-Life of the Son of Man '' -LRB-
Revell	PERSON	-RRB- , which , following the plan so successfully adopted in the similar biographies of
Washington	LOCATION	and
Lincoln	LOCATION	, has brought together into an elaborate mosaic nearly a thousand well-considered selections from many sources from Geikie ,
Eders	PERSON	- heim ,
Farrar	PERSON	,
Beecher	PERSON	, and a large company of more recent writers , with occasional extracts from the poets , and frequent insertions of suitable illustra - tions , also gathered from a variety of sources .

		A comprehensive index closes the book , which extends to nearly six hundred pages .

		Such unity and sym - metry as it is possible to give to a structure built of so varying material , the guiding mind of the com - piler seems to have given to this `` book of a thou - sand stories , '' as he calls it , and '' story of a thousand books . ''

		The water-color illustrations from the brush of Mr.
Harry Morley	PERSON	constitute not the least admirable feature of Mr.
Alfred Hyatt	PERSON	's latest additions to his series of topographical anthologies that began with `` The Charm of
London	LOCATION	, '' illustrated by Mr.
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	, and continued with a similar work on
Venice	LOCATION	, illustrated by Mr.
Harald Sund	PERSON	, and is now further enlarged by the addition of `` The Charm of
Paris	LOCATION	'' and `` The Charm of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	. ''

		Each volume has twelve colored plates , light and graceful in character , and the reading matter includes both prose and verse from a wide range of authors .

		`` My Old Kentucky Home , '' `` The Swanee River , '' ``
Massa	PERSON	's in the Cold , Cold Ground , '' and `` Nellie Was a Lady , '' all by

		The narrative is based on original documents , official and private , in English , French , and Spanish .

		An illustrated holiday edition of Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	's popular anthology , '' The Open Road , '' will be pub - lished immediately by Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	.

		Sixteen pictures in color are supplied by an English artist , Mr.
Claude Sheppardson	PERSON	.

		It is evidently Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	's intention to attempt every known literary form .

		A play from his pen is now announced by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		Its title is '' Magic , '' and it is described by the author as '' a fan - tastic comedy . ''

		The publication of Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	's forthcoming novel , '' The Flying Inn , '' has been postponed by the
John Lane Company	ORGANIZATION	until
January , 1914	DATE	.

		This will permit of simultaneous publication in
Canada	LOCATION	and Eng - land also .

		The story of one of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	's favorite musi - cians , a great singer of his time and an arbiter of fashion , is told in `` Pierre Garat : Singer and Exquisite '' by Mr.
Bernard Miall	PERSON	, announced for immediate publication by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		Among other
Oxford Press	ORGANIZATION	books in active prepara - tion are a volume of '' Studies in the Odyssey , '' by Mr.

		The Sonnets of
William Shakespeare	PERSON	: New Light and Old Evidence , '' by the
Countess de Chambrun	ORGANIZATION	, is announced by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		According to its pub - lishers , this new edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's sonnets con - tains , in the editor 's introductory discussion , `` a piquantly readable as well as scholarly contribution to one of the most unsettled of literary problems . ''

		Two new volumes by
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	, to whom the Nobel Prize for literature was recently awarded , will be issued at once by Messrs.
Macmillan	PERSON	.

		These two books are '' The
Crescent Moon	PERSON	, '' a volume of child poems with illustrations in color by a Hindu artist , and `` Sadhana : The Realization of Life , '' a number of essays , some of which were delivered as lectures at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Indiana Library Association	ORGANIZATION	has issued a '' hand - book , '' in pamphlet form , giving the history of its origin in
1891	DATE	and its subsequent growth .

		Miss
Mary Eileen Ahern	PERSON	, whose portrait appropriately faces the title-page , called the association into being when she was assistant librarian of the
Indiana State Library	ORGANIZATION	; and from an 494 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	initial membership of eight it has grown to a member - ship of one hundred and forty , not including nineteen institutional members , '' chiefly libraries .

		It is a highly creditable record .

		To the library of
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	has been presented by the class of
1872	DATE	the private library formerly owned by Dr.
Adrian Scott	PERSON	, a member of that class and at one time Associate Professor of Germanic Languages in the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		The collection numbers about one thousand volumes , chiefly philological and literary in their con - tents , and is especially rich in
Sanskrit	LOCATION	,
Pali	ORGANIZATION	, and Ice - landic works .

		It also has many of the Greek and Latin classics , often interleaved and enriched with translations from Dr.
Scott	PERSON	's pen .

		That the discontinuance of the
Doves Press	ORGANIZATION	, about which we have heard rumors of late , is not a matter of the immediate future at least is rather proved by the announcement of nine new volumes now under way at
the Press	ORGANIZATION	for issue in
1914	DATE	and
1915	DATE	.

		During the coming year we are to have the '' Coriolanus , '' which has been held back for some time by Mr.

T. J. S.	PERSON	to Lord and

ELEANOR HULL	PERSON	T ^ HE wide range and variety of Irish Gaelic poetry has L never been adequately represented in English prose and verse .

		Arising in pre-Christian times , many of the ancient poems bear the mark of their primitive heroic origin ; and from that period , through the poems and hymns of early Christianity , the patriotic vterses of the bards , and the tender religious and love sBngs still to be found among the Gaelic - speaking districts of
Ireland	LOCATION	, we have an unbroken output of beautiful verse .

		Miss
Hull	PERSON	has attempted to give a repre - sentative collection of these poems , including selections from the important early religious poem , the `` Saltair na
Rann	PERSON	, '' of which no part has hitherto been published in English .

		Poems by
Mangan	PERSON	, Sir
Samuel Ferguson	PERSON	, Dr.
Hyde	PERSON	, Mr.
A. P. Graves	PERSON	,
Padraic Colum	PERSON	, and others are included in the Anthology , but the larger number of the translations in prose and verse are new .

		The book contains an Introduction and Notes , and is adorned by initial letters , title-page , and bind - ing design , drawn from Celtic manuscripts .

		The frontispiece is reproduced from the opening lines of the `` Saltair na

		The studies which compose this volume deal mainly with the middle period of
Milton	PERSON	's poetical life , and are an examination of his development as a poet and of the vari - ous circumstances which shaped and brought to its final effectiveness his lifelong purpose to write a great epic poem .

		The comparatively meagre expression in verse belonging to this part of his career is illustrated by comparison with the rich product of his muse in the preceding and following periods .

		These years , although almost barren of poetic fruit , were vital and formative ones , educating and enrich - ing his nature , enabling him finally to speak with com - manding power as poet , statesman , moralist , and impas - sioned lover of liberty .

		The last essay , entitled CertainAspectsofthePoeticGenius , affords the author opportunity to examine the contribu - tions of several of the great masters of poetry , and to dwell with somewhat of care upon a very fascinating subject .

		536 A FEW WORDS ABOUT MOSS .

		A correspondent writes to inform us that , in his amiable opinion , THE DIAL no longer gives '' the time o ' day , '' and '' is getting moss-grown . ''

		By way of specification , he adduces certain recent `` reactionary defences of some of our crumbling inheritances , a Constitution framed for a social condition no longer actual ; an edu - cation which wastes years on irrelevant matters , a chaotic spelling which does not represent the phonetic values of our speech to-day . ''

		At one point in his charge , our correspondent is decid - edly astray .

		As regards the metaphorical `` moss '' indicated by this bill of particulars , we must avow that it is no recent growth , but is at least as hoary as our thirty odd years of existence .

		Our opinions upon these three sub - jects have been expressed during all that period with unswerving fidelity to our convictions .

		Stripped of their question-begging qualifications , the animadversions cited become very harmless indeed .

		We hold the federal constitution in reverence because we realize that for a century and a third it has given stability to our national life and continuity to our history , and the virtue by which these things have been achieved is precisely that it was not framed for any fleeting social condition , but upon such broad lines of principle that it provides a polity no less fitted to the needs of one hundred millions of people than it was to the three millions who first put it into operation .

		By the irrelevant matters on which our cor - respondent thinks years of education are wasted , he probably means the language disciplines and the humanistic studies described by such terms as the classics , literature , and history .

		At least , that is what people of his mental habit usually mean when they employ such language .

		Now we have always stood for these studies as the only ones really relevant to education in its deeper meaning , and have stigmatized as the most consummate folly the attempt to displace them by what are thoughtlessly called `` prac - tical '' subjects .

		If to do this is to be nauseous , we welcome the aspersion .

		A writer in '' The Nation '' from
Los Angeles	LOCATION	tells us that the schools in that city have become so modern as to acquire a deficit of half a
million dollars	MONEY	, while 512 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	'' distinguished , self-made men tell children how to become educated without studying , '' and `` the Teachers ' Institute meets at
Christmas	LOCATION	- tide to talk about social obligation and brotherly love and sneer at intellectual effort and attain - ment . ''

		There is nothing moss-grown about that .

		In a more elevated strain , we may quote from a recent address by Mr.
Paul Elmer More	PERSON	, who says : '' The classics have pretty well gone , and if we study them at all it is as if they were dead languages , useful it may be as a gymnastic dis - cipline for the mind , but with little or no sense that they contain a body of human experience and tried wisdom by which we may still guide our steps as we stumble upon the dark ways of this earth . ''

		Quotations of this sort might , of course , be multiplied indefinitely , for everybody who has ever written anything worth saying on the vital subject of education has paid a similar tribute to the value of the classics , and in sub - scribing to this opinion we find ourselves in the very best of intellectual company .

		As for the orthodox spelling , our position on that subject has been so frequently expressed as to need no restatement now .

		Our corre - spondent dislikes the spelling because it `` does not represent the phonetic values of our speech to-day . ''

		Bnt suppose we made it represent them , would it do so fifty years from now ?

		Or shall we keep on reforming it at stated intervals , so that the palaeographist of the future may be able to refer any page of English print to the decade of its origin by a - study of its ortho - graphical vagaries ?

		It required centuries of effort to standardize our spelling , but the thing was finally done sometime in the eighteenth century , and ever since then we have had the immense advantage of possessing a corpus of printed literature varying but slightly from the standard , and all intelligible without difficulty to every reader of to-day 's newspaper .

		This is a boon not lightly to be scorned , and certainly not to be rejected for any of the petty reasons suggested by apologists for the new phonetic heterodoxy .

		Our correspondent describes himself as '' im - patient of that futile iconoclasm of conservatism which pettishly condemns every new image which is tried in the vacant niches of our de - populated Pantheon . ''

		This is turning the tables with a vengeance !

		We had not thought to be classed with the iconoclasts for defending the old established ways , and insisting upon the value of the fruits of experience .

		To the motto , '' Whatever was , is wrong , '' which seems to be the watchword of the host that commits violent assault upon the old politics and the old ideals , we much prefer the
Pauline	PERSON	injunction : '' Prove all things ; hold fast that which is good . ''

		In any given case , the chances are at least nine out of ten that the old way is the better one , and no reform that does not accept the principle of festina lente is likely to accomplish anything in the way of real progress .

		The most plausible suggestion , once put into operation , is sure to bring unanticipated evils in its train , and its actual working is incalculable in advance .

		For the sentimental gain immediately offered there is more than likely to be bartered some very solid good the loss of which will prove irremediable .

		It was with a sense of these truths that
Ruskin	PERSON	, whom most of our reformers-in-a-hurry would claim for their own , described himself as '' a violent illiberal , '' and refused to accept the pre - posterous proposition that the new thing must be good just because it is new and untried .

		Quite the most ominous characteristic of our unsettled modern thought is its apparent readi - ness to cast off all the political , social , and ethical moorings that hold it in its hard-won haven , and to steer an uncharted course into the unknown .

		It is the duty of every sober lover of his kind to counsel prudence in all such reckless depart - ures , and to offer the teachings of history as a counterbalance to the speculative visions of the theeorist and doctrinaire .

		The Zeitgeist is now , as perhaps never before , obsessed by night - mares , and needs to be restored to the normal condition of waking mental activity .

		Criticism in the broadest sense criticism not of art alone , but of life is the crying need of the time , for its searching light alone can dispel the mists that obscure our thinking and people with
Brocken	PERSON	spectres our groping upward path .

		It is above all things else for the open mind that we plead not for the mind that admits light through a few cracks only and especially for the mind that is opened wide on the side of the past , with its accumulated wisdom for our guidance , and which respects , because of the immense weight of its authority , the present institutions and ideals into which the thought of that past has become crystallized .

		On the other hand , the querulously intolerant type of mind represented by the correspondent from whom we have quoted , seems to us quite impotent to contribute any - thing of value to the advancement of the race .

		Its fundamental postulate is a denial of sincerity to the mind that is not in agreement with its ill-considered conclusions , and upon that basis no real threshing-out of the questions that per - plex the modern world is possible .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL 513 CASUAL COMMENT .

		A NOTABLE TRIBUTE TO AN AMERICAN HIS - TORIAN was that paid to Professor
John Bach McMaster	PERSON	in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	on
November 22	DATE	.

		To commemorate the completion of his thirty years ' work in writing his `` History of the People of the
United States	LOCATION	'' a testimonial dinner was given to Dr.
McMaster	PERSON	in the great hall of the Historical Society of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	by eminent men of
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia ,
New York	LOCATION	, and other places .

		The guests included Presidents and leading professors of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	,
Johns Hopkins	PERSON	, Prince - ton ,
University of Michigan	ORGANIZATION	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and many colleges .

		There were present railroad presidents and directors , Governors of States ,
United States Senators	ORGANIZATION	, magazine editors including the editors of `` The Atlantic Monthly '' and `` The Review of Reviews , '' famous military leaders , economists , ambassadors , judges , publishers , historians , biogra - phers , novelists , poets , lawyers , preachers , and phy - sicians .

		The toastmaster was Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	.

		Addresses were made by
Dean West of Princeton	LOCATION	,
Provost Smith of the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	,
Ex-Governor Pennypacker	PERSON	of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, Pro- fessor
Max Farrand	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	of '' The Review of Reviews , '' Professor
McGuckin	PERSON	of the College of the City of
New York	LOCATION	, Dr.
Talcott Williams	PERSON	of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, and Professor
McMaster	PERSON	.

		Cordial letters of congratulation came from many countries .

		Ex-President
Roosevelt	PERSON	wrote that he was taking
McMaster	PERSON	's final volume to
South America	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
George Otto Trevelyan	PERSON	wrote from
England	LOCATION	: '' I have turned my
third quarter	DATE	of a century .

		It is sad to know that I shall never visit
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		Professor
McMaster	PERSON	is indeed fortunate in being entertained on such an occasion in a city so devoted to historical inquiry and so rarely acquainted with everything that relates to its own famous past .

		To the generosity with which
Philadelphia	LOCATION	imparts the results of that knowledge to others I have for many years owed a large debt of gratitude .

		The senti - ment with which Professor
McMaster	PERSON	's readers regard the completion of his invaluable work is one of genuine admiration of the warmest character . ''


Guglielmo Ferrero	PERSON	wrote from
Turin	LOCATION	expressing his gratification at the realization of the importance of the social mission of the historian .


Brooks Adams	PERSON	,
George W. Cable	PERSON	,
Joseph H. Choate	PERSON	,

Stephens	PERSON	of the Uni - versity of
California	LOCATION	,
President Thwing of Western Reserve University	ORGANIZATION	, and the Ambassadors
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	,
Walter H. Page	PERSON	, and
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	were among the hundreds of prominent men sending hearty letters of congratulation to Dr.
McMaster	PERSON	and of admiration for his work .

		THE TRANSLATOR 'S OPPORTUNITY to do what might almost be called creative work in interpreting a foreign author has been perceived and grasped by a few gifted writers .

		An exact reproduction of the effect of the original is manifestly impossible , and a slavishly literal rendering , except in scientific or technical literature , is about the last expedient to be resorted to for the conveying of that effect .

		This being the case , adaptation , more or less free , but not by any means lawless , remains the only method available for adequate interpretation of a foreign poem or drama or other work of the imagi - nation .

		In this connection , the name of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	naturally comes to mind as that of a highly gifted adapter or reshaper of other men 's productions .

		His famous quatrains from the Persian are perhaps indefensibly free in their variations from the original , but the incontestable fact remains that no other rendering of the Rubaiydt has been offered that can compare with his in poetic charm .

		And his versions from
Calderon	PERSON	are scarcely less remarkable for their easy flow and their entire freedom from the stiffness of ordinary translation .

		Mr.
William Poel	PERSON	, writing in `` The Contemporary Review '' on '' Poetry in Drama , '' gives high praise to these
Calderon	PERSON	pieces of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's as being suitable for actual production on the stage , and contrasts them with the scholarly verse translations of Professor
Gilbert Murray	PERSON	from the Greek tragic poets , which , he says , '' do not act well , '' since they fail to reach the height of tragic poetry and afford insufficient scope for vocal flexibility .

		`` Decorous but dull , '' he calls them .

		FitzGerald , too , it should not be forgotten , did good work in turning Greek tragedy , notably the `` Agamemnon '' of ^ Eschylus , into English verse .

		Coleridge 's adaptation of
Schil	PERSON	- ler 's ''
Wallenstein	PERSON	'' is another instance of the ad - vantages , for acting purposes , of free rather than literal translation , and Mr.
Poel	PERSON	does not omit to cite it .

		In a humbler walk of literature , Mrs.
Wister	PERSON	's long series of unusually popular renderings of German fiction offers a remarkable example of what a translator 's genius can effect in reshaping material not too promising in itself .

		Though the Italian proverb , traduttore , traditore , warns one of the pitfalls yawning at the translator 's feet , they can be avoided and are avoided by the translator with a real gift for his work .

		THE VALUE OF GREEK STUDIES is not perceived or acknowledged by many men immersed in the cares and perplexities of modern business .

		All the more remarkable , therefore , is the recognition of their utility as well as charm on the part of Mr.
S. S. McClure	PERSON	in his noteworthy autobiography now appearing in the magazine bearing his name .

		A more strenuous struggle for a college education has seldom been witnessed than that of this determined Irish-American lad at
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- of which he is now a trustee -RRB- in the old days before the time - honored classical course had fallen into its present 514 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	neglect .

		`` This course , '' writes Mr.
McClure	PERSON	in the
December	DATE	instalment of his life-story , '' still seems to me the soundest preparation for a young man , and I still feel that Greek was the most important of my studies .

		During the years that he reads and studies Greek a boy gets certain standards that he uses all the rest of his life , long after he has for - gotten grammar and vocabulary .

		I enjoyed Greek and mathematics more than any other subjects I took at college , and Homer more than anything else we read in
Greek	LOCATION	.

		After I began Homer , I used always to give four hours to the preparation of the next day 's lesson , my best hours , too from six to ten in the
evening	TIME	.

		I looked forward to those hours all day . ''

		Moving and at times intensely pathetic is the story of the young student 's undiminished passion for learning in the desolate period when a fireless room , a diet of frozen bread , a hopeless attachment to a professor 's daughter -LRB- who finally became his wife -RRB- , and other items of dreariness and discourage - ment combined to test his pluck and endurance to the utmost .

		Not since Mr.
Riis	PERSON	issued his '' Making of an American '' have we had so stirring an account of marked achievement under the most forbidding of conditions .

		... REMINISCENCES OF A VETERAN LIBRARIAN con - tributed recently to the entertainment of those who read the
Peoria	LOCATION	`` Herald-Transcript . ''

		Nearly half a century ago forty-eight years , to be exact Mr.
E. S. Willcox	PERSON	, leaving his position as teacher in
Knox College	ORGANIZATION	because of the drain on the student body caused by the Civil War , removed to
Peoria	LOCATION	and at once became interested in the library affairs of that city .

		A small subscription library was func - tioning rather feebly , with a collection of two thou - sand volumes and under a directorate not alive to the possibilities of the institution .

		Mr.
Willcox	PERSON	, with other progressive spirits , procured the removal of the old board and the voting-in of themselves instead .

		In
1872	DATE	he drafted a Free Library Bill and was successful in having it passed by the
State	ORGANIZATION	legislature ; and its wise provisions are still in force .

		Stimulated by this success , Mr.
Willcox	PERSON	and his fellow-directors started a campaign for a new library building , achieved their purpose , and after a few years found still another change of quarters desirable .

		Then in
1897	DATE	, an advantageous sale of .

		this property being effected , the present library building in Monroe Street was erected on land granted for the purpose by the city ; and there it is probable that Mr.
Willcox	PERSON	will finish out his term of conspicuously useful ser - vice to his community his term as librarian , we mean , for that office he has held twenty-two years , with a constant and rapid growth in the library 's activities , as evidenced in part by the opening of a branch library in
Lincoln Park	LOCATION	and the promise of another in the northern section of the city .

		A WELL OF ENGLISH NOT ALWAYS UNDEFILED is the daily newspaper press of English-speaking countries .

		A compliment , comparable with that paid by Spenser to
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, is just now being quoted with self-complacence by the newspapers from the reported remarks of an
Iowa State College	ORGANIZATION	professor .

		`` With all its faults , '' avows the lowan , `` I still believe in the news style as the most efficient style of this modern day for presenting information through the written word .

		It has been hammered out in the heat and stress of newspaper work to meet the demands of millions for something to com - pel their attention , interest them , and give them information in the quickest , clearest way ... The news sense , the ability to see what is new , and its new meaning to the great world of humanity , is necessary to men in every field of endeavor , but especially to men who write . ''

		No less an authority than Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, with his well-known passion for the new and his depreciatory estimate of the old , has been heard to declare , if memory errs not , that journalism deserves to be ranked very high , perhaps in the highest class , among the different forms of literature .

		All honor to those that have helped to dignify the profession of journalism ; but not yet will it be universally conceded that the highest function of literature is to '' compel attention , '' to startle , to '' see what is new '' and therefore too often ephemeral and of trivial import ; and undoubt - edly the
Iowa	LOCATION	professor would assent to this .

		As a contributor , however , of an element of crispness , raciness , breeziness , and often of admirable pictur - esqueness to English style , the American journalist does render a service not to be despised , and his British cousin is now not far behind him in this particular .

		... A NEGLECTED ART , that of reading aloud , has already been the subject of comment in these col - umns , and is likely to receive further attention from time to time in the future .

		In a recent talk to the Teachers ' Club of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, Provost
Edgar F. Smith	PERSON	of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	complained that students of to-day do not know how to read aloud intelligibly and agreeably .

		`` It is a deplorable fact , '' he affirmed , `` that we have many students in the university who are unable to read a page from a textbook aloud to the class and read it correctly . ''

		He might with truth have added that there are many professors as well as students who lack the art of accurate and effective interpretation of the printed page .

		Curiously enough , the decline in this one of the formerly indispensable `` three R 's '' seems to date its beginning with the discontinuance of the teach - ing of the alphabet in the old-fashioned way , and the relaxation of severity in the matter of spelling .

		Perhaps our best readers-aloud the compound must be pardoned since no simpler term presents itself are still to be found among those whose education was acquired in the little red schoolhouse , whose advantages comparatively few of the present generation of infants can ever hope to enjoy .

		It may be , furthermore , that the great increase of reading matter in modern times has discouraged the practice of reading aloud , so slow is that process compared
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 515 with the silent skimming of book after book .

		But there is a time to skim and a time to read slowly .

		This we ought to have done , and not to have left the other undone .

		... A CERTAIN DEFECT IN THE MANNERS OF LITER - ART FOLK has been remarked over and over again , but will probably never be remedied .

		It is , indeed , a defect noticeable in others beside the men and women of the pen ; but it is in those who write much and rapidly that the fault is commonly most pronounced .

		A former
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	professor of the history of art , whom just now one feels especially tempted to quote with considerable frequency and freedom , used to say that `` a plain handwriting is a part of good manners , '' and one of his old pupils recalls the assiduity with which he devoted himself to the imitating of his instructor 's beautifully legible style , as a first step toward acquiring some of his fine culture .

		Another Harvard celebrity of the past who wrote a hand of exceptional clearness was
John Fiske	PERSON	, whose term of useful service as assistant librarian is pleasantly recalled , in connection with the passing of
Gore Hall	PERSON	, by a writer in the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript . ''

		He says , in the course of his remin - iscences : `` His very manuscript itself was a thing of beauty , and must have delighted the compositors who had to struggle with the librarian 's scraps and scrawls .

		Mr.
Fiske	PERSON	wrote the round , clear , open style which he said he inherited from his English ancestry of clarks , or clerks , and so perfect was his first draft that he rarely rewrote a page . ''

		Not all of us are born artists , even in handwriting ; but unless one is physically crippled , one ought to be able to write in such a manuer as not to encourage in others a resort to impolite language .

		... BOOK-SELECTION FOR PUBLIC LIBRARIES is not the least important or least difficult part of public library work .

		Some libraries make their selections largely through a book-committee formed of several members of the directing board ; others throw the burden chiefly on the librarian ; others invite the public itself to take as active a part as may be in this branch of the library 's functions ; and nearly all are glad to receive intelligent suggestions from those for whose benefit all the book-purchases are or should be made .

		At
Manitowoc	ORGANIZATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, as the latest report of its librarian explains , '' the purchase of books is under the direct supervision of the board , the books being divided into classes , and to each member of the board there is assigned one or more of these classes .

		In that way the different kinds of books in the library are kept well balanced , no one kind being shown favoritism . ''

		This plan of making the whole board of directors a book-committee , each member specializing in one or more classes of litera - ture , is certainly somewhat unusual , and has other considerations beside novelty in its favor .

		Notice - able also in the government of the
Manitowoc	ORGANIZATION	library is the exact balancing of male and female members on its board ; and -LRB- a minor detail , it is true -RRB- in the list of '' officers '' we find , at the bottom , not a janitor , but a janitress .

		It hardly needs to be added that the librarian , as well as the assistants , is a woman .

		Evidently the rights of women are respected in
Manitowoc	ORGANIZATION	.

		... THE WORK OF A MASTER PRINTER may attain an importance approximating that of a prince of pub - lishers .

		Indeed , the printer was the publisher in early times , and the two industries are still more or less closely allied .

		The recent death of
J. Stearns Gushing	PERSON	, founder of the
Norwood	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- printing house of
J. S. Gushing & Go.	ORGANIZATION	, brings to its close a long term of remarkably productive and successful activity in the manufacture of books .

		The firm name , on the reverse of so many title-pages , is famil - iar to thousands of readers , who will now feel some interest in the history of the head of that firm .

		From the age of fourteen Gushing was engaged , first as compositor and later in a less humble capacity , in the printing business .

		After working some years for
the University Press	ORGANIZATION	at
Cambridge	LOCATION	and in other printing establishments , he began , in
1878	DATE	, with a few hundred dollars ' capital , to do printing in his own name , making a specialty of textbooks and pro- viding himself with fonts of type in
Greek	LOCATION	,
Hebrew	LOCATION	,
Assyrian	LOCATION	, and other alphabets , and in the symbols used in mathematics .

		These fonts were of widely recognized excellence , and spread his fame as a printer over the country and even beyond its bor - ders .

		The great establishment at
Norwood	ORGANIZATION	is the significant monument to his ability and honorable success as a printer .

		Honors of another sort also came to him , as the command of the Ancient and
Honorable Artillery Company	ORGANIZATION	, the commodoreship of the
Winthrop Club	ORGANIZATION	, a seat in the Governor 's
Council	ORGANIZATION	, and a high place in the order of Masons .

		THE STORY TELLER 'S
VADE MECUM	PERSON	, a book for all who find themselves called upon , from time to time , to furnish oral entertainment for importunate and insatiable young folk in those eager '' believing years '' that should be made the most of while they last , is furnished in Miss
Helene A. Guerber	PERSON	's `` Book of the Epic , '' a compact collection of the world 's chief romantic tales that have been immor - talized in epic form .

		Miss Guerber tells these stories again in simple prose , condensing consider - ably , but leaving the kernel intact in its nutshell of abbreviated narrative .

		A score or more of the great epics are given in some detail , with frequent quota - tions in verse , and many others are less elaborately outlined .

		Where not exactly suited to the age of one 's listeners ,
Miss Guerber	LOCATION	's versions can easily be modified by a skilful story-teller and thus made acceptable to young hearers of whatsoever age or mental equipment .

		Thus the ''
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	'' and the '' Mahabharata , '' and the Japanese epic of '' The White Aster , '' and perhaps also the Persian `` Shah - Nameh , '' may be presented in attractive form to children by an expert and sympathetic narrator .

		Material for the story-hour that so many public libra - 516 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	ries now make it their business to conduct , is ever in demand , and the demand increases year by year .

		Hence the propriety of calling especial attention to Miss
Guerber	PERSON	's thesaurus of story-telling matter collected from a wide range of approved sources .

		FIRST STEPS TO THE ACQUISITION OF KNOWLEDGE are not seldom the most difficult , for it is the first step that costs , as the French maintain .

		A little familiarity with the equipment of a public library is the beginning of useful learning ; and yet how few there are , comparatively , who seem equal to the effort of acquiring that familiarity . ''

		That an ' educated ' person of to-day , '' says Mr.
Edward F. Stevens	PERSON	, Librarian at
Pratt Institute	ORGANIZATION	, '' should find himself helpless in the preseace of a modern library equipment so that his sole confidence in making his approach lies in his dependence on the help of a library assistant , is as pitiful as it is inexcusable .

		To see an able-bodied person of undoubted mental powers feebly standing about while an overworked librarian dances attendance upon him in a matter of commonplace inquiry , is neither unusual nor in - spiring . ''

		Mr.
Stevens	PERSON	then tells some of the things the library and the library school attached to the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	are doing to make library-users more self - dependent .

		One public lecture , if the '' educated '' citizens would only attend it , ought to give them all the information needed to relieve them of the neces - sity of standing feebly about while an overworked librarian thumbs the encyclopaedia or consults the card-catalogue for them .

		It is to be hoped that the time will come , before many decades , when it will be as humiliating to confess inability to use a public library 's resources with intelligence as it now is to acknowledge one 's helplessness in the presence of a dictionary or a time-table .

		THE
RUSSELL SAGE FOUNDATION LIBRARY	ORGANIZATION	has issued its first Bulletin , wherein is set forth the his - tory of the library 's formation , with an account of its present resources , its methods , its generous policy toward all who may be interested in its special department of literature , and some intimation of what it hopes to accomplish in the future .

		Four charitable associations of
New York	LOCATION	have united in establishing this library , which starts with the advantage of ample and suitable quarters in the new building of the
Russell Sage Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, at
Lexington Avenue	LOCATION	and Twenty-second Street , and already has about ten thousand bound volumes and fifteen thousand pamphlets , with two hundred and fifty periodicals on its subscription list .

		The library 's purpose is to make itself as nearly complete as pos - sible in publications relating to charity and social work , including a great number of related and sub - sidiary topics , and to extend its privileges and courtesies to all applicants .

		Already it has 878 registered users , and a yearly circulation of more than thirty thousand volumes .

		Bulletins will be issued bi-monthly , and they will give much attention to the bibliography of those subjects in which the library specializes .

		THE TATTERDEMALION OF THE PRINTING PRESS is , of course , preeminently the daily newspaper , being in its texture nothing but pulverized wood fibre , and subject to speedy disintegration from atmospheric causes even when handled with the extreme care which it never receives .

		In the cur - rent yearly Report of the
Pratt Institute Free Library	ORGANIZATION	occurs a significant paragraph under the heading , '' Rag in Paper or Papers in Rags , '' from which we learn -LRB- or are reminded -RRB- that `` the
Brooklyn	LOCATION	` Daily Eagle ' has earned the distinction of being the first daily newspaper in
America	LOCATION	to print an edition on paper containing a considerable propor - tion of rag for purposes of preservation in public libraries . ''

		With the beginning of the present year the
Pratt Institute Library	ORGANIZATION	has procured this special edition `` in monthly consignments for immediate binding , '' and it deplores the failure of the other great dailies to pay similar regard to the needs of future historians and other students engaged in research requiring much consultation of old files of newspapers .

		At present the `` Eagle '' seems assured of an enviable future preeminence of which other journals could easily win a part for themselves .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		THE OLD ACADEMIC SPIRIT AND THE NEW .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Is not the paragraph regarding '' a vanishing type of scholarship '' in your latest number a bit pessimistic , like the lament of the aged Nestor : `` Such men 1 never saw nor shall I see again ! ''

		In a way , of course , each generation produces its own type of scholarship , which does its work and is succeeded by a better , which does a better work .

		Only a few years ago the chemist was able to know practically the whole field of chemistry : just as in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	,

		Now , the field of chemistry is so enor - mous that often one `` element '' carbon , for example offers room enough for a dozen specialists , each working separately .

		The college president , even in the smaller institutions , is mainly a business-manager ; he is a living trolley meant to con - duct some of the electricity from the great overhead system of finance so as to run the machinery which he has in charge .

		If we could turn backward the wheels of progress and restore the conditions that prevailed fifty or seventy-five years ago , there would be found among the multitude of university and college profes - sors , now engaged in their specialized work , just as many such men to do the individual work as Child ,

		Lowell 's somewhat slipshop scholarship as well as his appeal to a very limited band of scholars , and

		SLOVENLY ENGLISH IN POPULAR BOOKS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		When correspondence courses in various phases of English can be had for only twenty dollars apiece , surely a usage free from errors of grammar should not be beyond the attainment of anyone who aspires to see his name on the title-page of a book .

		And yet present - day American books of travel and other informative literature do not measure up to such a standard .

		A reader of such books soon ceases to be shocked by slips in grammar .

		As to any higher requirement than mere grammatical correctness , one dare not apply it .

		Many a book issues from the presses so vulgarly slip-shod that a moderately sensitive reader is offended on almost every page by poverty of vocabulary , ignorance of sen - tence forms , failures in clearness , false placing of em - phasis .

		If the authors of such publications are too far advanced in life to profit from instruction in high school English classes , they should engage the teacher of En - glish in a neighboring high school to revise the manu - script for the press .

		These teachers would feel per - fectly at home , since the task would be similar to their daily grind in the correcting of student themes .

		Their remuneration should be very slight , for the wretched English we have to read is a stigma upon their own reputations .

		With all the millions of themes written , criticized , and rewritten by millions of students in our high schools and colleges , why is it that in simple clear - ness we fall so far behind such writers as
Bunyan	PERSON	,
Defoe	PERSON	, and
Franklin	PERSON	?

		And where is the conscience of the publishers of such books ?

		Does a monetary profit atone for the absence of all literary fineness , all dis - tinction of tone , all sense for style ?

		We might do better if half our writers of popular books of informa - tion would go into training and become revisers for the other half !

		`` YE '' AND `` AMPERSAND . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		How does it happen that in copying and reading ancient manuscripts we call the character our ancestors meant for `` the '' by the ridiculous `` ye ' ?

		They said `` the '' just as we do , and the only apparent reason for mistaking the character is that two centuries ago the letter '' h '' was usually written with a tail below the line , and with a razeed top , which made it look like our `` y. '' Then the word was so frequently used that it was contracted , just as the word `` and '' was then treated , and continues to be treated to this day by many of us .

		When I was a boy , more than eighty years ago , the alphabets in our school books always ended with the `` short and . ''

		We called it `` ampersand , '' and considered it a fine snapper when we rattled off the alphabet .

		Sometimes when sufficiently cultured we gave it the full title '' and-per - se-and . ''

		Now it is likely that our '' & '' will become obsolete , just as `` ye '' has become .

		Then our descend - ants of the next century or two will be puzzled , perhaps ; but I do not think they will be so foolish as to say `` ampersand '' when reading our manuscripts and com - ing to the little quirk we meant for `` and . ''

		Do let us drop saying '' ye . ''

		THE ENGLISH AT THE SOUTH POLE .

		* Curious mixtures of good and evil , wisdom and folly , ability and incompetence , we jog along through this world , making what we can of ourselves and our environment .

		Then , some - where in our midst , arises a man who does the things we have vaguely wished to do , and expresses in tangible form the realization of our ideals .

		It is not , properly speaking , a mat - ter of genius .

		The man of genius is one who possesses a particular kind of ability in a very high degree , and is , as a rule , anything but representative of the social ideals of his age .

		He is not necessarily honest or virtuous outside of his particular field of activity .

		Our debt to genius is enormous , but these intellectual giants are no more to be imitated by us than the physical giants of the dime museum .

		There is of course every transition between the different types of men , and few if any fall without quali - fication into a particular category ; but we seem to need a new descriptive term for the small but enormously important group of those who represent the gold of the common people with - out the dross , and thus appeal to that which is in every one of us , awaiting new stimuli to development .

		Pedagogically , the distinction here indicated is of the greatest importance .

		What we may become , individually and nationally , depends to a critical degree upon our ideals , and these ideals will never fructify unless they are more or less capable of being realized .

		Incal - culable harm has come from holding up before the young , as worthy of emulation , those who by no means illustrate the normal development of our abilities or desirable social activities .

		Christianity itself exhibits the classical example of this unhappy confusion .

		Christ as a miracle - worker , Christ as the
Lord of Heaven	ORGANIZATION	, is above and beyond us ; it is Christ as an illustration of the possibilities inherent to some degree in every man who is the real mainspring of the Christian faith ; and the idea that he was an actor playing a part , instead of a man living a man 's life , is fatal to the very spirit of the religion he founded , as well as contrary to the obvious historical facts .

		We have in the history of the world and of our nation men who , in their day and genera - * SCOTT 'S LAST EXPEDITION .

		tion , realized social ideals , but it is not enough that such men once were great , as were our Lincoln and
Washington	LOCATION	.

		It is already diffi - cult to picture them in this environment ; and the attempt , while profitable up to a certain point , begins to savor a little of that incongruity which attached to speculations as to what would happen if Christ came to
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		It appears to be necessary that each new period should have heroes of its own , belonging to it and characteristic of its particular field of progress .

		When we ask ourselves what sort of man the modern hero may be , we realize at once that he may be of many kinds , suiting the diversified civilization in which we live .

		He must , however , represent his country in its function of helping , not destroying , the prosperity of the rest of the world .

		If he is engaged in scientific work , he may be said without qualification to do this thing .

		He must work hard and continuously , paying as close attention to small as to great matters , not seeking to succeed by some sudden spectacular play .

		He must rise superior to the common vices of his kind , to commercialism , sensationalism , and the rest .

		Then , beneath all this , he must be filled with the zeal and love of his fellows which have always marked his kind ; and then , as the one thing which enables him to use his powers to the utmost , he must be without fear .

		Such a man may be an example to us , not because we may be like him , but be - cause his virtues are all such as we may cultivate , and can vastly improve by cultivation .

		General as our definition is , we have only to attempt to apply it , to see how few meii it will absolutely fit .

		It does , however , entirely fit Captain
Scott	PERSON	and his companions who perished on their journey from the
South Pole	LOCATION	.

		This fact must answer forever the question '' Was it worth while ? ''

		Was it worth while , indeed , to vivify and confirm the best ideals of the whole Anglo-Saxon race ?

		Was it worth while to show the whole world that the sacred flame is yet alive , that the mass of degradation which has piled upon us in so many ways has not yet extin - guished the basic virtues of mankind ?

		Was it worth while , especially , to show that the best spirit of to-day , which stands for hard work unaccompanied by pomp and circumstance , offers possibilities of achievement second to those of no other age ?

		The circumstances attending the death of
Scott	PERSON	and his fellows appeal strongly to our emotions .

		Probably very few have read of them unmoved .

		We can not help wishing very , very keenly that they had come through alive .

		Yet ,
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 519 when we consider the whole history of the ex - pedition , and the lives of those men as revealed by the record , it is impossible not to see that the sacrifice is justified .

		When we read the whole record , as now pub - lished , we get some idea of the vast amount of scientific work accomplished , and the difficulties and dangers overcome in doing it .

		Unfortu - nately it is not possible as yet to give any proper abstract of the scientific results , as it will take many months , at least , to go over all the ma - terials collected , and arrange the data obtained .

		In the meanwhile , the public must believe those who know something of this work , when they say that it will contribute to the understanding of innumerable problems of importance for sci - entific progress .

		The second volume describes the various journeys for scientific purposes , other than that to the
Pole	LOCATION	.

		The men did not spare themselves in the effort to make the most of their opportunities , and in fact took risks as great in many directions as they did in going to the
Pole	LOCATION	.

		Thus the midwinter journey to
Cape Crozier	PERSON	, undertaken to obtain the eggs of that singular and primitive bird the Emperor Pen - guin , certainly justified Captain
Scott	PERSON	's remark when the men returned : '' But look here , you know , this is the hardest journey that has ever been made . ''

		The three men who did this work were
Wilson	PERSON	,
Bowers	PERSON	, and
Cherry	ORGANIZATION	-
Garrard	PERSON	, the first two afterwards
Scott	PERSON	's companions in the final catastrophe on the way from the
Pole	LOCATION	.

		As we read the details we see clearly that while every precaution was taken to insure safety , it was really impossible to avoid danger ; over and over again circumstances arose which might , had things gone a little wrong , have proved fatal .

		There was no recklessness , certainly no desire to take any needless risks , but in order to do the work it was necessary to take chances .

		On the journey to the Pole the attitude was the same .

		In his last message to the public , Captain
Scott	PERSON	says : '' I maintain that our arrangements for returning were quite adequate , and that no one in the world would have ex - pected the temperatures and surfaces which we encountered at this time of the year .

		On the summit in lat .

		85-86 we had 20 , 30 .

		On the Barrier in lat .

		82 , 10,000 feet lower , we had 30 in the day , 47 at night pretty regularly , with continuous head wind during our day marches .

		It is clear that these circumstances come on very suddenly , and our wreck is cer - tainly due to this sudden advent of severe weather , which does not seem to have any satis - factory cause . ''

		In the Meteorological Report by Dr.
Simpson	PERSON	-LRB- vol .

		2 , p. 319 -RRB- attention is called to the continual blizzards experienced by
Scott	PERSON	's party , and the comparatively fine weather reported by
Amundsen	PERSON	.

		After a close study of all the data , it is concluded that '' one can now say definitely that the blizzards which have been so fateful to British Antarctic exploration are local winds confined to the western half of the
Ross Barrier	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Thus , as we can now see , the Norwegians not only had the advantage of a base nearer the Pole , but were in a region of better weather .

		Nevertheless ,
Scott	PERSON	's party would still have come through alive , but for the sickness which overtook them and the shortage of fuel .

		The loss of oil through evaporation is explained in the appendix , but it certainly ought to have been possible to guard against it .

		The oil , how - ever , would still have been sufficient except for the extreme cold and the delay .

		In spite of everything , rescue might have been possible if those who went out to meet the returning polar party had been able to go a little farther .

		On
March 10	DATE	,
Cherry	ORGANIZATION	-
Garrard	PERSON	and
Demetri	PERSON	, with dogs , were at One Ton Depot , only eleven miles from the place where
Scott	PERSON	and his companions perished .

		Had they been able to proceed for a few days and deposit the two weeks ' provisions they had brought , this would have saved the party ; but the bad weather and their physical condition made this impossible .

		On
March 10	DATE	Captain
Scott	PERSON	wrote in his diary : '' Yesterday we marched up to the depot , Mt.
Hooper	PERSON	.

		Cold comfort .

		Shortage on our allowance all round .

		I do n't know that anyone is to blame .

		The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed . ''

		Thus the disaster was due to a combination of adverse circumstances , which could not be overcome in spite of every effort ; and though we can now see how it might conceivably have been pre - vented , every man did his very best at the time in the light of such knowledge as was available .

		There is absolutely no justification for the suggestion which has been lightly made , that the polar party , after losing priority in the dis - covery of the
Pole	LOCATION	, had no heart to do their best .

		One hesitates even to mention such an idea , and I do not believe it is possible care - fully to read the narrative and still entertain it .

		Naturally and very properly , they desired prior - ity in this matter , but it was by no means their only aim .

		In
October , 1911	DATE	-LRB- vol .

		1 , p. 297 -RRB- ,
Scott	PERSON	wrote : `` I do n't know what to think of
Amundsen	PERSON	's chances .

		If he gets to the
Pole	LOCATION	, it must be before we do , as he is bound to travel fast with dogs and pretty certain to start early .

		520 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	On this account I decided at a very early date to act exactly as I should have done had he not existed .

		Any attempt to race must have wrecked my plan , besides which it does not appear the sort of thing one is out for '' On the whole journey , the scientific end was kept in view ; and even during the difficult march down the glacier , Dr.
Wilson	PERSON	studied and sketched the geology , while very important collections of fossils were made , which will throw a flood of light on former conditions in the south , and have an important bearing on general problems of evolution .

		These fossils were dragged , in spite of every hardship , to the last camp .

		The volumes are abundantly and beautifully illustrated , principally by drawings by Dr.
E. A. Wilson	PERSON	and photographs by Mr.
H. G. Ponting	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Leonard Huxley	PERSON	, who arranged the mate - rials , seems to have done his work well , and the type and paper leave nothing to be desired .

		A few small misprints or errors in copying should be corrected ; thus in vol .

		1 , p. 4 13 , '' shipped '' should apparently be `` slipped , '' and on p. 417 , line 9 , `` last '' should be `` hot , '' as the facsimile of
Scott	PERSON	's letter plainly shows .

		After a time , especially when a good abstract of the scientific results can be added , a smaller , single volume should be published , giving the account of the polar journey and a brief discus - sion of the other work .

		No doubt this will be done ; but , in the meanwhile , the two - volume edition will have a wide circulation , and thanks to the public libraries , will be available to thou - sands who could not afford to purchase so large a work .

		Parents and teachers should make themselves familiar with the facts , and the story should be told to successive generations of young people for many years to come .

		painting is less perturbed .

		Fiction , which rivals the stage and the picture in the popular mind , is staid in comparison .

		So far as the drama is concerned , we in
America	LOCATION	, as a rule , get only the echoes of the great things being done .

		If we have a drama and dramatic ideas of our own , they take but a slight place in the minds of cultivated people when compared with the sensations we get from abroad .

		American playwrights have produced many plays which have been extremely popular in
America	LOCATION	and elsewhere .

		Some , indeed , have produced plays singularly characteristic ; few dramatists in the world have produced anything as typical of the society in which they live as Mr.
George W. Cohan	PERSON	.

		But in the main , recent excitements have come from abroad .

		Ibsen ,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Rostand	PERSON	,
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	and
Yeats	PERSON	,
Synge	PERSON	and
Lady Gregory	PERSON	, we have nobody who fills such a place in the eyes of the world as any of these .

		Not merely is this so in the writing of plays , but in the setting of them also .

		The present is a time of immense activity abroad in dramatic productions , in the minds of many , the pro- ducer seems more important than the poet .

		These activities are little known among us . ''

		Everyman '' and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	without scenery we appreciated ; `` Surnurun '' and `` The Yel - low Jacket '' also pleased , as they say ; the Russian Ballet and `` The Blue Bird '' are even now received with warm welcome .

		We have heard of
Gordon Craig	PERSON	and Max R ^ iuhardt .

		But the connection of all these , what they have to do with each other , how any of them is different from any other dramatic sensation , is something that few of us know or care any - thing about .

		We in
America	LOCATION	are , on the whole , well content with the realistic stage .

		Mr.
Belasco	PERSON	is our ideal .

		We do not , in theory , attach much importance to the matter of stage setting .

		Yet one can see that importance may be at - tached to it .

		The Shakespearean performance without scenery showed us how different we are from the
Elizabethans	LOCATION	.

		We can not enjoy a drama without setting .

		`` The Yellow Jacket '' was an exotic : amusing , and to many more than amusing , but not something that stimulated one to follow .

		Absolute imagination will not do for us .

		But a little thought shows that a realistic presentation , whether of Shakespeare or of any - thing else , can never be the best that art can do , partly because the better it is the less imaginative is it ; and partly because however good it is , it can never be more than moderately realistic ,
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAJ ^ 521 never really real .

		However far we go with real water and real trees and so on , there must always be so much convention on the stage that there might as well be more , if there be anything to be gained by it .

		The bare Shakespearean stage has been a challenge to the theatre of to-day .

		`` The best in this kind are but shadows , '' said the good-natured Theseus , as he looked at the clumsy attempts at realism of the Athenian clowns , '' ` and the worst are no worse if the imagination amend them . '' ''

		It must be your imagination , then , '' said the impatient
Hippolyta	LOCATION	, `` and not theirs . ''

		How stir the imagination of the audience ?

		Shakespeare did it with poetry and rhetoric , and his actors helped him out with elocution and gesture .

		But we prefer our poetry and our rhetoric in books , and elocution and gesture we incline to leave to the politician .

		What can the stage give us ?

		Realism , it was thought ; and so we still think in
America	LOCATION	.

		But elsewhere they think differently .

		How to suggest the spirit of the play , how to make the art of the theatre really an art , how to make the drama truly a thing of the theatre , those questions interest people abroad .

		To state what they have done and what they hope to do was the purpose of Mr.
Huntly Carter	PERSON	in the tour among continental cities in which he gathered material for his book .

		He wanted to observe and to study the new spirit in the drama -LRB- which to him , apparently , was most active on the mate - rial side -RRB- , to generalize or get by intuition the secret of the movement .

		I am sorry that I must begin by being disagreeable , and saying that he does not seem very successful in his latter effort .

		Many will be pleased at his material who will by no means think he has been successful in analyzing or in expressing the spirit which gives it life .

		Owing , perhaps , to my not knowing enough to start with , I find it impossible to see what he has seen in the things he tells us of .

		His evidences are still chaotic in my mind .

		One better acquainted with such matters , or perhaps more sensitively attuned to their novel rhythms , will do better .

		The book is almost a journalistic summary of what the author observed upon his brief trip .

		Yet even so , there is much in it that will be very interesting ; certainly there is much in the way of picture and plan , fact and refer - ence , that it would be very hard for one to get at otherwise .

		And to have done so much is no slight task ; while to generalize on such material is still more difficult .

		No one has yet done it satisfactorily .

		There are productions of the new movement all over
Europe	LOCATION	, but no common aim is obvious .

		I utterly disbelieve that all are aim - ing at Rhythm , as Mr.
Huntly Carter	PERSON	appears to think ; but what they are aiming at is by no means clear .

		Some are trying for one thing , some for another .

		Reinhardt ,
Gordon Craig	PERSON	,
Bakst	PERSON	, to mention a few , agree in one thing : they are not realistic .

		But otherwise it would be hard to find much in common , for instance , in
Reinhardt	ORGANIZATION	's production of
Gorki	PERSON	's '' Nachtasyl , ''
Bakst	PERSON	's '' Scheherazade , '' and
Gordon Craig	PERSON	's drawings for '' Macbeth . ''

		All are entirely ar - tistic , without doubt ; but each seems intent on working out ideas of his own .

		We may doubt - less see this much , that all three aim at signifi - cance in their settings .

		And herein lies the im - portance for the drama of these matters , which might otherwise seem rather material .

		As the tendency of all this theatrical movement is from realism to significance , so has been the tendency of the drama .

		Ibsen , the great dramatic influ - ence of modern times , is wrongly understood if he be thought to be realistic ; his whole tendency is toward significance .

		His plays , plots , char - acters , words , all stand for something .

		So this theatrical movement is in the same direction , Mr.
Carter	PERSON	would say ; in fact , it precedes the dramatic .

		As the drama is really a matter of the theatre , the change in the theatre is a change in the drama .

		Mr.
Carter	PERSON	presents a mass of material on this subject containing much that will be new to almost anybody .

		Of the many subjects he deals with , two at least are worth saying more about , namely the work of
Max Reinhardt	PERSON	and of
Gordon Craig	PERSON	.

		People may easily find out for themselves something about these two : a while ago we called attention to the latter 's book .

		`` On the Art of the Theatre , '' in which he propounded his theories ; this was followed by the present work , '' Towards a New Theatre , '' ' which gives some ideas as to how he would carry out his ideas .


Gordon Craig	PERSON	differs from
Max Reinhardt	PERSON	in one important respect .


Max Reinhardt	PERSON	has for some time been able to carry out his own ideas .

		He has been a regular producer of plays for a long time ; and while he has an abundance of ideas on that subject he does not go beyond it .

		Mr.
Craig	PERSON	, too , has been producing plays , but only that he might learn how to produce ; his real idea has been to express himself , not to real - ize the impressions of others .

		Since
Reinhardt	PERSON	became his own master , as we may say , he has produced over a hundred plays as different as
Gorki	PERSON	's '' Nachtasyl '' is from
Oscar Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's 522 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	'' Salome . ''

		But he has always had one princi - ple in mind , and that principle is the same that is of importance to Mr.
Craig	PERSON	, namely , the idea that stage setting is to strive against natural - ism , that it is to be decorative rather than realistic , that one is to use color , light , ma - chinery , all the resources of modern art , in ex - pressing the idea .

		Add to this the feeling that the piece for the theatre is for the theatre , and not a matter of philosophy , morals , or any - thing else but the theatre , and you will see that there will be something in common between the settings of
Max Reinhardt	PERSON	and the sketches of
Gordon Craig	PERSON	.

		I wish there were something in English about
Reinhardt	PERSON	that one could refer to .

		The book by
Jacobsohn	PERSON	will be of interest ; but it appears to me to be too largely an account of details and not enough a presentation of aims and purposes .

		Perhaps in
Germany	LOCATION	those mat - ters are so commonly understood that one can take them for granted .


Gordon Craig	PERSON	is of more interest to us because we can study some , at least , of his work at first hand in the collection before us .

		His fundamental idea differs from that of
Max Reinhardt	PERSON	, in that it is , if one may say so , more fundamental .

		Reinhardt believes that one should present plays in a certain way ; Mr.
Craig	PERSON	believes that presentation of plays is but a part of the artistic process which should con - ceive , express , present , in the theatre as in the other arts .

		Mr.
Craig	PERSON	, therefore , is the more radical , the more far-reaching of the two .

		Nothing he has yet done is a full carrying out of his idea .

		He has had to handle other men 's ideas in his own way .

		The real thing he wanted to do was to handle his own ideas in his own way .

		His plan is not that scenery , lights , cos - tumes should be used in such and such a way to present the thought , language , characters of Shakespeare or sombody else , but that scenery , light , costume , as well as thought , language , poetry , should be the means whereby the artist of the theatre sought to express himself .

		Such an idea can not come to expression nearly so easily as an idea like that of
Max Reinhardt	PERSON	, which limits itself to production rather than creation .

		It is said , however , that a plan has finally been formed whereby real advance will be made .

		In the
London	LOCATION	'' Times , '' some time last
February	DATE	, announcement was made that Lord
Howard de Walden	PERSON	had pro- vided the funds necessary to start Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's School for the Art of the Theatre .

		This school is not in
London	LOCATION	, but in the
Arena Goldoni	LOCATION	in
Florence	LOCATION	, one of the most beautiful open-air theatres in the world .

		I have heard nothing of the project since
last summer	DATE	, but I men - tion it to show that this book of Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's is a sort of exhibit of what he has been able to do before he was able to do what he actually wanted to .

		The first impression of Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's forty plates will , save to the fully initiated , be very confusing .

		But when you have become used to the style , and have mentally put together those that are but suggestions of theatrical pos - sibility , for instance , and those that are scenes of plays actually presented and so on , you will begin to feel more at home .

		Note the sketches for the scenes in `` Hamlet '' and `` Macbeth '' : they would not serve as models for a stage manager , perhaps , but they are easily under - stood .

		Then look at some of the scenes or set - tings never realized : ``
Henry V.	PERSON	, '' `` Hamlet '' -LRB- in the frontispiece -RRB- , `` Dido and ^ Eneas . ''

		Here the artist is freer , perhaps less bound by the thought of another , more clearly bent upon rendering some sort of impression or sensation .

		Then look at some mere suggestions : `` Enter the
Army	ORGANIZATION	, '' `` The Steps , '' `` Study for Move - ment . ''

		When you are used to the manner you will readily catch the general idea , at least .

		Such things will undoubtedly be mere fan - cies to many , if not crazy visions .

		Many who glance at them may not have the patience to look at them long enough to see what they are about .

		But to me they are of an immense value , far greater than that of the photographs of the actual settings of
Max Reinhardt	PERSON	in Mr.
Jacobsohn	PERSON	's book .

		I will not pretend to have always a good idea of their purport or always to like them .

		I often fail to get Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's idea , or else do not sympathize with it when I do get it .

		But if I do not always appreciate the plates themselves , I believe I do appreciate their spirit ; and that is something so valuable that were it possible it would be well worth while to work over the things one did not under - stand till one did understand them , and to study the things one did not like till one did like them .

		Get a mind like Mr.
Craig	PERSON	's full of a fine idea , and it is something worth having .

		Do not fancy that his work for the stage is con - nected with this kind of scenery or that , with this kind of costume or dancing , or some other .

		He will use any of such things or all of them , whatever be the right things , for the carrying out of whatever idea he may have in mind for artistic expression .

		His main idea is to present a motive by means of the theatre , which means by whatever resources the theatre may possess :
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 523 poetry , music , acting , dancing , scenery , light , costume , and whatever else there may be .

		And it would be a mistake to imagine that these things concern only the theatrical manager , or the actor , or the person who goes to see plays .

		If you understand them thoroughly -LRB- not through such transmissions as have preceded -RRB- , you will find them the most influential ideas in the study of the drama that you have ever known .

		Read a play of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's and imagine that you have the chance to devise a setting for it .

		Do not be disturbed because you could not pos - sibly do so ; go right ahead .

		Think first what it would be to devise a setting archaeologically correct ; then try to devise a setting that will truly present the spirit of the play .

		Never mind if you have no idea how to design : the main thing is that you should first appreciate the spirit of the play .

		Read a play of
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	's and ask yourself how you will set it .

		Will you try to present the miserable family of a Nor - wegian roue or the ill-assorted marriage of some high-spirited woman ?

		Or will it be something larger , something more significant , in the his - tory of humanity ?

		In some such way , I fancy , may one see that all these experiments on stage settings are illuminating even to one who studies the drama as literature .

		For even if litera - ture , certainly the drama is theatrical literature .

		Whatever else they may be , the plays of Shake - speare are plays , not poems , or novels , or essays .

		And if one wants to understand a play one must do at least something to realize it as a play .

		So Shakespeare did , and so Ibsen and the rest ; and so must we if we would know them -

		RECOLLECTIONS OF AN AMERICAN SINGER .

		* The volume of reminiscences by
Clara Louise Kellogg	PERSON	takes us back to an epoch in singing and stagecraft which seems to have definitely closed , for the time being at least ; with small indication that its purposes and ideals will ever find such revival as the more potent manifesta - tions of art are sure to evoke .

		The coloratura singer and the melodramatic opera are no doubt still with us , but our admiration and enjoyment are subject to an undercurrent of influence which emanates from the strenuous teachings of
Wagner	PERSON	and his compeers .

		Nevertheless , there is many a good word which may truthfully be said in * MEMOIRS OF AN AMERICAN PRIM A DONNA .

Clara Louise Kellogg	PERSON	-LRB- Mine .

		favor of the bel canto , the dazzling Italian opera of the florid school , and the singers who were made illustrious by these outbursts of the musical spirit .

		Clara
Louise Kellogg	PERSON	ranks with the best coloratura singers of history , and she had many elements of high character which were often lacking in other representatives of the school to which she belonged .

		She had excep - tional understanding of the numerous operatic roles in which she appeared ; she had education and refinement ; she had acquaintance with the great worlds of art and literature and mankind ; she came to her task unspoiled by a too solici - tous induction into conventions and traditions which are fetters and disturbers until so mas - tered as to become useful servitors and assist - ants ; and she brought to whatever she did her native spirit of generosity and courage and cul - tured intuitiveness .

		In consequence , her book abounds in appreciations of high interest , in a remarkably just apprehension of her own work and art , and in a wealth of suggestions which the singers of to-day will find it desirable to heed and obey .

		The general impression derived from the volume is therefore wholesome , enlightening , and even inspiring .

		Clara
Louise Kellogg	PERSON	was born at
Sumter	LOCATION	- ville ,
South Carolina	LOCATION	, of
Northern	ORGANIZATION	parentage .

		The family soon moved to
Derby	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, where her earlier years were spent .

		Of her negro nurse she tells the following story : '' She used to hold me in her arms and rock me back and forth , and , as she rocked , she sang ; I do n't know the name of the song she crooned , but 1 still know the melody , and have an impression that the words were : ' Hey Jim along ,
Jim	PERSON	along Josy ; Hey
Jim	PERSON	along ,
Jim	PERSON	along
Joe	PERSON	. '

		She used to sing these two lines over and over , so that I slept and waked to them ; and my first musical efforts , when I was just ten mouths old , were to try to sing this ditty in imitation of my negro mammy .

		When my mother first heard me , she became apprehensive , yet I kept at it ; and by the time I was a year old , I could sing it so that it was quite recognizable . ''

		The father and mother were musical , and the child was early taught to use her voice .

		She had the gift of absolute pitch , which afterwards came into useful activity when her artistry was delighting two continents .

		She tells us that she always heard a melody in the key in which it was written ; and as it sometimes happened that the same tune was played or sung in a different key , the consequent discords were distressing to her .

		She had originally no intention of going on the stage .

		She says : '' All I decided was to make as much as I could of myself and my voice .

		Many girls I knew studied singing merely as an accomplishment .

		In fact the girl who aspired 524 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	* professionally was almost unknown .

		I studied first under a Frenchman , named Millet , a gradu - ate of the Conservatory of
Paris	LOCATION	; later I worked with
Manzocchi	PERSON	,
Rivarde	PERSON	,
Errani	PERSON	, and
Muzio	PERSON	, who was a great friend of Verdi . ''


Muzio	PERSON	was her especially devoted teacher and adviser , and doubtless from him came the first impulse to go on the stage .

		Among the singers whom she heard at this time , and who influenced her pro- gress and determination , were the English artist
Louisa Pine	PERSON	, and the greatly lauded
Piccolomini	PERSON	, who is described as being like the German prima donna ,
Lucca	LOCATION	, small and dark and decidedly clever in comedy .

		But the idol of her youthful years was the stately and refined Madame De La Grange , a vocalist and actress of the highly finished French type .

		Opera in
New York	LOCATION	had gone through a num - ber of vicissitudes before
Miss Kellogg	PERSON	's debut was made .

		The early travelling companies had culminated in something like a genuine season of opera under
Garcia	PERSON	, whose famous daughter ,
Malibran	PERSON	, sang in
New York	LOCATION	before her phenom - enal successes in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Lorenzo Da Ponte , the restless and eccentric librettist of some of the Mozart operas , who had come to
America	LOCATION	to restore his waning fortunes , assisted in the ad - venture , which was by no means assured of suc - cess .

		Then came the labors of the Strakosches , under whom arose the wonder of
Adelina Patti	PERSON	's performances ; and later appeared
Maretzek	PERSON	, characterized in this book as '' the magnificent . ''

		Our author adopted the stage only after some reluctance , and her family was never wholly reconciled to her determination .

		She thus de - scribes her debut , as
Gilda	LOCATION	in `` Rigoletto '' : '' My mother was with me behind the scenes , and my grandmother was in front to see me in all my stage grandeur .

		I am afraid I did not care particularly where either of them was .

		Certainly I had no thought for any one who might be seated out in the
Great Beyond	ORGANIZATION	on the far side of the footlights .

		I sang the second act in a dream , unconscious of any audience , hardly conscious of the music or myself , going through it all mechanically , but the subconscious mind had been at work all the time .

		The newspapers found my appearance peculiar .

		There was about it < a marked development of the intellectual at the expense of the physical to which her
New England	LOCATION	birth may afford a key . '

		The man who wrote this was quite correct .

		He had discovered the Puritan behind the stage trap - pings of Gilda . ''

		Miss
Kellogg	PERSON	's first great success was made in
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	's `` Faust . ''

		The opera was then new , and her performance constituted its intro - duction to American audiences .

		The work itself was at that time considered an extraordinary reversal of the musical conventions .

		It was regarded as the beginning of a revolution in opera , so completely were the Italian traditions antagonized in its structure and methods . ''

		On the other side of the world people were all talking of
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	's new opera the one he had sold for only twelve hundred dollars , but which had made a wonderful hit both in
Paris	LOCATION	and
London	LOCATION	.

		It was said to be startlingly new ; and
Max Maretzek	PERSON	, in despair over the many lukewarm successes we all had , decided to have a look at the score .

		The opera was '
Faust	PERSON	. ' ''

		With all my pride I was terrified and appalled when the ' Magnificent ' came to me , and abruptly told me that I was to create the part of Marguerite in
America	LOCATION	.

		This was a large order for a girl of twenty ; but I took my courage in both hands and resolved to make
America	LOCATION	proud of me .

		I was a pioneer when I undertook
Gounod	ORGANIZATION	's music , and I had no notion of what to do with it , but my will and ambition were to meet the situation . ''

		The part became one of the best in her reper - toire ; and it is interesting , even to-day , to read what such critics as
George William Curtis	PERSON	said about it .

		The novelty of the opera and the in - spiration of the singer very evidently impressed the listeners .

		The rapid changes in opinion to-day about the new composers
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	, D'Indy , and others are probably significant and instructive in the same way .

		After her decisive American successes , the singer went abroad and appeared in
England	LOCATION	and
Austria	LOCATION	and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		One may refer again to the generous critic in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Easy Chair '' who followed her triumphant processions and made his witty and appreciative comments thereon , beholding the young American girl in her European surroundings , bringing her art wholly developed on this side of the ocean to the consideration of the old-world connoisseur , who placed it on a par with the best of his own con - tinent .

		Then followed many ventures in opera and concert ; and , finally , the retirement , with honor and hearty recognition everywhere .

		A word should be added here concerning the singer 's efforts to place opera in English worthily and adequately before the public .

		For several seasons she was at the head of companies pro- ducing the standard works in English ; and seems to have made substantial successes , from both the financial and the artistic points of view .

		Now that the question of opera in English appears to be again before the public , it may be worth while to find out from this book what one has to say who has toiled in that field with reason - able success at a time when the effort was probably more difficult than it is to-day .

		This review can not close without reference to the many passages in the book where the author writes about her own art , always with
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 525 singular freedom and admirable insight .

		These passages , which are scattered liberally through - out her volume , show the bent of her ability , and explain the character of her achievement .

		Her art had in especial the traits of refinement and intelligence , and her book is full of pene - tration into the secrets and labors of the singer and the actor .

		Her generous allusions to her fellows , her hearty humor and glancing wit , her memories of the notables whom she met in many places , all help to make up a book that can not fail to prove of both profit and interest to its readers .

		The reproduction of old daguerreotypes and photographs , curious and varied , gives an added attraction to the volume .

		INDIA THE CONTRADICTORY .

		* Very rarely does a reviewer light upon two volumes so delightfully antithetical as the first and second listed below .

		In reading them , one looks at
India	LOCATION	through the eyes of two women who could not have seen and reported more contradictorily if they had come from different planets .

		Miss
Margaret E. Noble	PERSON	was an Irish woman who became a convert of the picturesque
Swarni Vivekananda	PERSON	and identified herself so effectively with her adopted cause that she was soon known to a multitude of Hindus as Sister Nivedita -LRB- `` The Dedicated '' -RRB- .

		Dr.
Munson	PERSON	is an American woman who went to
India	LOCATION	as a medical missionary .

		Both crossed the seas in a laudably generous spirit of devotion to the hap - less millions of mankind .

		Both grew to love '' the land of burning plains and snow-crowned hills and sun-kissed children / ' And strangely enough , both found , or thought they found , the supreme gift of peace ,
Miss Noble	ORGANIZATION	in a mystic transcendental , modified
Hinduism	LOCATION	, Dr.
Munson	PERSON	in a practical ministry of healing guided by the spirit of Him who died on the cross .

		But what different Indias they saw !

		For instance , if one considers their respective verdicts on the difficult and insistent problem of native widowhood , it is almost incredible that two in - telligent and conscientious women with excellent opportunities for observation should reach con - clusions so flatly contradictory as the following : * STUDIES FROM AN EASTERN HOME .

		By Sister Nivedita -LRB-
Margaret E. Noble	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		JUNGLE DAYS .

		ANGLO-INDIAN STUDIES , By
S. M. Mitra	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		And yet , and yet , is there anything like the radiant purity of the widow 's plain white cloth ?

		Silk for worship , cotton for daily service but always white , without a touch of colour .

		Perhaps its charm lies in its associations .

		The austere simplicity speaks of the highest only .

		A heart free to embrace the world , a life all consecrated , a past whose sorrow makes the present full of giving , these are the secrets that the widow 's sari tells . ''

		For it must be understood that this bereavement is regarded in
India	LOCATION	as a direct call to the religious life .

		It is the only way in which what is known in Catholic countries as ' a vocation ' can come to the Hindu wo - man .

		Her life henceforth is to be given to God , not to man ; and this idea , coupled with an exaggerated respect for celibacy , gives to the widow , and especially to her who has been a child-widow , a unique position of influ - ence in the household .

		This feeling of reverence per - sists long after the sentiments of orthodoxy admira - tion for long hours spent in worship and for severe asceticism have disappeared .

		Hence it was a modern Hindu , of the school calling itself Reformed , who said to me , ' The most stately garment in
India	LOCATION	is the white sari of the widow . ' ''

		SISTER NIVEDITA . ''

		The baby is married , often to a man of middle age , and long before her half-grown body is prepared , she is brutally compelled to begin her marital duties , and , when yet in her own childhood , she becomes , at the peril of her fragile life , the mother of a necessarily fragile child . ''

		If , through overwhelming misfortune , the girl 's husband die , her sins in some former existence are sup - posed to be the cause of his death , and because of this she is an accursed thing .

		Even though but a babe , and knowing nothing of the dead husband , she is at an early age stripped of all ornament , and put in the coarsest raiment , while her head is shaved close and kept that way .

		Despised , spat upon , cruelly overworked , starved , beaten , neglected in illness , forsaken even by those nearest of kin to her , the child passes her days in abject terror and despair , until death , usually not long delayed , blessedly releases her . ''

		DR.
MUNSON	PERSON	.

		Nor is the foregoing in any way an isolated or extreme example , although it occurs in the most quotable form .

		The antithesis runs through every topic .

		Thus , the converted Irish woman sees in the native pilgrimages and festivals a genuine groping through the material toward the supreme essence of Divinity , while Dr.
Munson	PERSON	sees in them the blind and degrading superstition of benighted ignorance .

		Sister Nivedita believes that devotional meditation is a form of mind cultivation by which
India	LOCATION	may come to stand once more in the forefront of the nations , and that there is in
Hinduism	LOCATION	full sanction for the difficult intellectual transition through which the present generations of both East and West are passing .

		In her devotion she even shares with the less militant
Nation	ORGANIZATION	- alists the confident hope of a to-morrow when the English will be gone , '' - leaving an old race to dream once more the sweet dreams of labour 526 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	and poetry and beauty , till the net of
Maya	ORGANIZATION	shall be broken and they be lost in the ocean of beatific vision . ''

		Dr.
Munson	PERSON	sees a better future for
India	LOCATION	only in the Christian religion and occidental guidance toward a slow and pain - ful betterment .

		The contrast is complete , and a reviewer may leave his readers to make their own decisions unburdened by his reflections .

		Turning for a moment to the '' Studies from an Eastern Home , '' one may report that it con - tains not only a number of pages such as would be indicated by the title , but also a concise account of the author 's life and several inter - esting tributes to her devotion and service .

		The essays are twenty-three in number and present a great diversity of themes , from '' The Festival of Ras '' to '' The Kashmir Shawl . ''

		In all of them things are seen , or at any rate depicted , couleur de rose , reflecting the moods of a thorough-going convert to a vivified
Hinduism	LOCATION	.

		The chapters are uniformly well written and the treatment unhackneyed .

		To prospective readers , however , it might be suggested that a better starting point for a comprehension of Sister Nivedita 's work would be found in '' The Web of Indian Life , '' published some ten years ago .

		But wherever one starts , one is brought into the presence of an interesting personality , which can be intimately comprehended by few western women and by still fewer western men .

		Moreover , one will get a glimpse of
India	LOCATION	through loving and glorifying eyes .

		Dr.
Munson	PERSON	's book is decidedly above the average '' missionary '' book in vividness and interest .

		The chapters on well-known places such as
Agra	LOCATION	and
Benares	LOCATION	are far from strong , and might have been omitted without loss ; but when the author is dealing with her own daily life and work and observation , the pages are genuinely instructive .

		For instance , there is a glimpse straight at the heart of
India	LOCATION	in the story of the mother who had been frightfully bitten by her boy in the final terrible throes of hydrophobia .

		Dr.
Munson	PERSON	begged the woman 's friends to let her treat the wound , but they steadfastly refused , saying : '' Why should she live ?

		Will there be aught in life for her when her only son is dead ? ''

		And there is some little revelation also in the writer 's conclusion , '' While my professional spirit urged me to save her life , my woman 's heart told me they had spoken well . ''

		At times one is startled by per - fectly obvious errors , such as the intimation that the Jains all show Mongolian descent ; but the defects of the book still leave it distinctly worth while .

		The third volume on our list represents yet another point of view .

		The writer is an eminent Hindu lawyer and thinker , who has resided re - cently in
England	LOCATION	, and prior to that had spent several years at the great Moslem centre of
Hyderabad	LOCATION	.

		His avowed aim is the interpreta - tion of Indian sentiment to the British public for the mutual advantage of
England	LOCATION	and
India	LOCATION	; and he impresses one as a clear and vigorous exponent of views honestly held .

		Naturally a cultured
Hindu	PERSON	is still a Hindu , and our author 's sympathies are obviously with the aristocracy of his own land rather than with the masses of the people or their rulers from overseas .

		But his observations and conclusions are none the less valuable when once his point of view has been noted .

		His large volume contains sixteen papers on such subjects as '' The Hindu Drama , '' `` British Statesmanship and Indian Psychology , '' '' Indian Princes , '' '' Industrial Development , '' and so forth .

		The least convincing chapters are perhaps those on '' Hindu Medicine '' and ' ' Christianity in
Hinduism	LOCATION	. ' '

		The 1 atter is simply an unsatisfying collection of parallels , more or less superficial , such as can be drawn between any two systems of religion .

		In the former , Mr.
Mitra	PERSON	seems to maintain the superiority of the
Hindu Kaviraj	PERSON	to the occidental specialist , and he claims a high level of hygiene at the basis of Hindu life .

		This chapter makes particularly interesting reading to one who has just risen from Dr.
Munson	PERSON	's account of what she found in her medical work from day to day .

		For many readers , the most attractive sections will probably be those on `` The Moslem - Hindu Entente Cordiale '' and `` The Indian Unrest . ''

		In the former Mr.
Mitra	PERSON	claims that the followers of these two religions could go on living peace - fully and sanely side by side even if British control were withdrawn .

		In support of his contention he adduces his own experience as a lawyer representing the moslem government of
Hyderabad	LOCATION	, and the historical situation under the Mogul emperors when Hindus often rose to political and military eminence .

		Such a belief of the probable cordiality between the two great faiths is certainly worth considering ; but with all deference to Mr.
Mitra	PERSON	's authority , the re - viewer is unable to accept it as valid .

		On the topic of Indian unrest , our author largely rejects the conclusions of Sir
Valentine Chirol	PERSON	, who holds the Brahmans responsible for most of the dis - content and practically all of its violent manifes - tations .

		Mr.
Mitra	PERSON	denies that the Brahmans are primarily responsible , and comes out point - blank with the charge that `` the arrogance of
1913	DATE	-RSB- 527 the low Europeans is the bed rock on which the citadel of sedition is built . '' ''

		The so-called ad - ministrative ' reforms ' do not touch the masses , but the low European 's kick touches the backs of the masses more than the English higher official classes can conceive . ''

		Again , he states : `` Unrest is the consequence of racial hatred , arising from the conduct of some members of the dominant race . ''

		Obviously this is not an adequate explanation .

		But it does touch a real grievance , deserving more attention than it has received ; and it may be said with confidence that ordinary politeness on the part of all Europeans , not merely on the part of the better Europeans , would go a long way toward lessen - ing the constant irritation .

		Unfortunately , recent letters from
Calcutta	LOCATION	make it clear that the evil is not on the wane ; and it is high time that the well-meaning British government took more vigorous steps to promote decency of de - portment , even in the lowest ranks of incoming Europeans .

		In any event , Mr.
Mitra	PERSON	's com - plaint is timely , and may do good in this partic - ular connection , just as on the whole the essays that make up these `` Anglo-Indian Studies '' ought to serve a very useful purpose .

		It is difficult to close this notice without including a few paragraphs of a general nature dealing with the larger problems raised by these three divergent volumes ; but it has seemed pref - erable to use our limited space to indicate the more clearly the nature of the books themselves .

		And after all , it may easily turn out that the contrasts and contradictions we have suggested are in themselves the most significant comment on a number of the important questions that constantly thrust themselves at every intelligent reader who has once turned his eyes toward the most picturesque land in the world .

B. R. HELLEMS	PERSON	.

		THE POETRY OF ANCIENT
IRELAND	LOCATION	.

		* Whatever may be thought a generation hence of the plays and poems of the
Dublin	LOCATION	school of to-day , there will be no doubt as to the perma - nent value of its scholarly accomplishments .

		The Celtic revivalists have introduced the English-speaking public to the great mass of their beautiful national legend and poetry which for centuries lay buried in Gaelic manuscripts scattered over
Ireland	LOCATION	.

		With an admirable * THE POEM-BOOK OF THE GAEL .

		Translations from Irish Gaelic Poetry into
English Prose and Verse	ORGANIZATION	.

		Selected and edited by
Eleanor Hull	PERSON	.


Chicago	LOCATION	:
Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		combination of exact method in dealing with their difficult material and of reverential zeal for the traditions of their ancestors , they have enthusiastically hunted out , edited , and trans - lated all the important relics of early Irish glory , and by so doing they have enriched the univer - sal store of beauty as well as added pride to an already noble history .

		The collection of poems made by Miss
Eleanor Hull	PERSON	from the many volumes of work by these student patriots is in one respect the most satis - factory of the numerous similar anthologies published within the
last decade	DATE	, the range of material represented here is unusually wide and characteristic .

		There are some fine ex - amples of ancient pagan poetry , and there are a few nearly as lovely old Christian lyrics ; there are the nature songs of Ossian and his fellow minstrels , and the historic ballads `` of the dark days '' in
Ireland	LOCATION	; there are folk songs , religious and secular , some from the twelfth century and some by our own contemporaries .

		The volume , in short , deserves its title , it is really a poem-book expressing from every facet the experiences of the Gael , and his moods .

		In an interesting Introduction , the editor tries to define the Irish temper and its varieties .

		She agrees with nearly all students in the field that as we read ancient Celtic literature we have a feeling of being `` hung between two worlds , the seen and the unseen , '' and that the vivid - ness of the
Gael	PERSON	's vision of the unseen always conditions his reading of the actualities about him .

		All of the best modern work shows this quality quite as clearly as the legends of
Deirdre	PERSON	and
Fionn	ORGANIZATION	and the race of semi-mythical heroes in the older world .

		Yeats and
Synge	PERSON	, the first at times so involved in his own perceptions that he can scarcely distinguish a color from a thought , the second so sympathetic with the tem - perament that he is able to represent it in action with its results crowding upon it embarrassingly in a concrete modern environment , both these poets show all the marks of direct descent from the prehistoric bards .

		In the anthology before us there is every sign that in the long history outlined here , the continuity of this racial mood has been so complete as to unify ne of the most troubled experiences it has ever been a people 's fortune to live through .

		From the poems in the volume it is difficult to select for quotation , the several examples are all so interesting .

		It is difficult to decide , for instance , whether the purely pagan poetry of the fairies , the magic charms easing the pains 528 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	of birth and death , the riddling invocations to the great nature powers , or the thinly
Chris	PERSON	- tianized Psalter of Verses and Blessings and Hymns of the Saints , are the more significant of the most primitive phases of Irish belief .

		Perhaps pagan and Christian suggest after all a false antithesis , representing merely a differ - ence in the vocabulary which deals with the less understood elements in a puzzling universe .

		A better analysis would divide the poems accord - ing to the occasion for their conception , nature songs , life songs , etc. .

		Of them all , the nature songs are the loveliest and the truest to the race 's feeling for the world about it .

		Here is an example : `` Take my tidings !

		Stags contend ; Snows descend
Summer	DATE	's end !

		`` A chill wind raging ; The sun low keeping , Swift to set O'er high seas weeping . ''

		Dull red the fern ; Shapes are shadows ; Wild geese mourn O'er misty meadows . ''

		Keen cold limes Each weaker wing .

		Icy times Such I sing !

		Take my tidings ! ''

		The picture here is as objectively defined as that in the middle-English `` Sumer is icumen in , '' except for the one subtle touch of `` shapes are shadows , '' and the interpretation of the wild birds ' cries , the distinguishing marks of the Celtic spirit .

		One more fine example of the pagan poetry , from the Poem - Book of
Fionn	ORGANIZATION	, gives the inevi - table Stoicism of the hero in every age , with , again , just the slight difference in accent that is characteristic of the Irish voice . ''

		Once I was yellow-haired , and ringlets fell In clusters round my brow ; Grizzled and sparse to-night my short grey crop , No lustre in it now . ''

		Better to me the shining locks of youth , Or raven 's dusky hue , Than drear old age , which chilly wisdom brings , If what they say be true . ''

		HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		II .

		BOOKS OF TKAVEI * AND DESCRIPTION .


New Zealand	LOCATION	's wonders , in scenery , flora , fauna , human inhabitants , political arid social methods , industrial and commercial development , and general manners and customs , are treated with understand - ing and with a zealous enthusiasm for his theme by Mr.
Paul Gooding	PERSON	in a lavishly illustrated volume entitled `` Picturesque New Zealand '' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		With many of the desirable characteristics of sunny
Italy	LOCATION	and beautiful
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and also of Utopia and
El Dorado	LOCATION	, the land depicted in Mr.
Gooding	PERSON	's pages is certainly inviting in aspect .

		Its rainfall is mostly at night , so that the days are sunny , with some exceptions ; its climate is salubrious , the annual death rate being less than ten for each thousand inhabitants ; and man 's traditional inhumanity to man here loses its negative prefix .

		Wise law-givers have safeguarded the interests of both capital and labor , admirable land-tax and land-settlement regu - lations are in force , public utilities are owned by the people , old-age insurance makes comfortable the declining years of the poor , and , in short , if the
New Zealander	LOCATION	has anything to complain of , it must be the very monotony of well-being that it is his lot to enjoy .

		Such , at any rate , is the impression gained from reading about that favored land , which could hardly be more attractively and interestingly pic - tured than in Mr.
Gooding	PERSON	's notable volume .

		Legend and ballad , history and description , anec - dote and literary allusion , with a wealth of graceful drawings by Mr.
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	, go to make up the half - posthumous volume , `` Highways and Byways in the Border '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , begun by the late
Andrew Lang	PERSON	in collaboration with his brother
John	PERSON	, and completed by the latter .

		In fact , the part attribut - able to the deceased collaborator is doubtless very much less than half , as one gathers from the preface ; but his was probably the inspiration that set the work on foot , and we like to see touches of his genius in at least the earlier pages .

		Whatever the proportion of credit due to each , however , the book is a notable contribution to the lore of the ever-interesting Border which no one in our time has better known and loved than
Andrew Lang	PERSON	.

		One reads with relish , detect - ing or suspecting the hand of the master -LRB- for cer - tainty is of course impossible -RRB- , such stories as that of the dishonest butler of
Billy Castle	ORGANIZATION	who `` might , indeed , plume himself on his honesty , and say with Verges : ' I thank God I am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I. ' '' The abundant drawings , printed with the text , are excellent .

		The season 's addition to Messrs.
Winston	PERSON	's `` Photogravure Series '' is `` French
Canada	LOCATION	and the
St. Lawrence	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
J. Castell Hopkins	PERSON	, an inter - esting historical and descriptive account of one phase of life in the
Dominion	ORGANIZATION	.


Quebec	LOCATION	, with its surrounding territory , still remains the stronghold
1913	DATE	-RSB- 529 of all that is typically French-Canadian , and its highly individualized life , wholesome in its rugged simplicity , must be considered , the author maintains , even now under British rule , an enriching element rather than a national problem for the
Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		Following the introductory topographical description and historical data are interpretive chapters on the customs , myths , religion , education , folk-lore , and literature of the French race in
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The life of the French Seigneur , now a passing type , is con - trasted with the equally picturesque existence of the habitant , dweller of the woodlands , described as an `` industrious , contented , temperate , cheerful , devout , and patriotic man , sure of his Church , sure of Can - ada , sure of himself , but quite confidently doubtful of matters outside of these lines of thought . ''

		French
Canada	LOCATION	has remained a `` country within a country '' ; its history has been eventful ; its scenery is un - equalled ; and its traditions are being zealously pre - served .

		The numerous illustrations in photogravure add charm and richness to the volume .

		The Rhine , the
Danube	LOCATION	, the Thames , the
St. Lawrence	LOCATION	, and other rivers have been made the subjects of travel-books pleasing to the reader and useful to the traveller ; and now the chief river of
France	LOCATION	, the
Loire	LOCATION	, ^ le fleuve national '' furnishes Mr.
Douglas Goldring	PERSON	with a subject for his hand - some volume , ' -
Along France	LOCATION	's River of Romance '' -LRB- McBride -RRB- , in which personal narrative mingles entertainingly with descriptive and historical notes , all set off by an abundance of excellent drawings and water-color sketches .

		The artist modestly with - holds his name , nor does the title-page even hint that the book is illustrated a self-restraint that inclines a reviewer to give additional emphasis to his com - mendation of the well-executed pictures .

		The Loire 's present comparative desolation and unnavigability , its devastating floods and frequent shoals , must be largely due to the deforestation of its water-shed , as might well have been pointed out in the author 's descriptive and historical introduction .

		The course of the river takes one through many interesting places , even though the once numerous paquebots on its surface are now sadly dwindled , and the journey is accomplished less pleasantly than of old .

		` Mr.
Charles Tower	PERSON	.

		considers the romance of the Rhine worn rather threadbare by excessive tourist traffic , and accordingly it is not that river of renown that figures in his book , `` Along
Germany	LOCATION	's River of Romance '' -LRB- McBride -RRB- , but its less famous tributary , the
Moselle	LOCATION	.

		From
Metz	PERSON	, near the French frontier , to
Coblenz	LOCATION	, at the confluence of the Moselle and the
Rhine	LOCATION	, he journeys down the picturesque stream , by boat on its waters or by bicycle along its banks , with occasional resort to that earliest and best mode of travel , walking .

		`` The descent to the Rhine , '' he says , `` is of the nature of an anticlimax ; or , since it is scarcely sudden enough for that , it may perhaps better be called a heart-breaking staircase from the fairyland of dreams to the prosaic Alltag of the counting-house and the universal emporium . ''

		Never - theless the
Rhine	LOCATION	is the river of poetry and romance , of story and tradition , even though the lesser stream , as presented in Mr. Tower 's pages , does offer much to excite interest and curiosity .

		Colored plates , half-tones , line drawings , and maps , with brief bibliography and a four-page index , go to make up the book 's equipment .

		Mr.
Horace Kephart	PERSON	, formerly in charge of the
Mercantile Library	ORGANIZATION	,
St. Louis	LOCATION	, is the author of a book of mountaineering and exploration , '' Our Southern Highlanders , '' which is very attractively issued by the
Outing Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Comparatively little is known and still less has been written about the scattered dwellers in the vast mountain region extending nearly seven hundred miles in a south - western direction from
Virginia	LOCATION	to
Alabama	LOCATION	.

		Miss
Morley	PERSON	's recent book , '' The
Carolina Mountains	LOCATION	, '' calls attention to the beauties and the wonders of a part of that region ; and Mr.
Kephart	PERSON	ably adds to the knowledge thus conveyed by describing in detail his adventures among the hardy mountaineers , their peculiar customs , native dialect , strange diseases , odd humors , family feuds , sturdy independence , and their manner of receiving `` furriners , '' as all outsiders are called by them .

		Many illustrations , often from photo - graphs taken by the author , accompany the reading matter .

		A seven-months ' voyage around the Horn in 1845-6 is the subject of a book sure to find favor with those who like to read about old sailing days and old sailing ways .

		Mrs.
Elizabeth Douglas Van Denburgh	PERSON	recounts her girlhood experit nue in accom - panying her father and mother , sister aiid brother , from
Oswego	LOCATION	,
N. Y.	PERSON	, to
Honolulu	LOCATION	on the occasion of the appointment of her father ,
Joel Turrill	PERSON	, as
Consul General	ORGANIZATION	to the
Sandwich Islands	LOCATION	.

		`` My Voyage in the U. S. Frigate `
Congress	ORGANIZATION	' '' is the book 's title , and the narrative is in diary form , with the touch of vividness and reality that such a method of writing , while the events are still fresh in the mind , is likely to impart .

		The long voyage was broken at
Rio Janeiro	LOCATION	,
Valparaiso	LOCATION	, and
Lima	LOCATION	, places that the reader is permitted to see through the diarist 's eyes ; and the rigors of the passage around the Horn are well described .

		The writer would have done wisely to break up her chronicle into chapters ; a certain monotony results from its present arrangement , with no variation even of page - heading , and no sign-posts anywhere to catch the eye .

		Interesting illustrations are fortunately not lacking , and a cut of the `` Congress '' herself adorns the cover .

		-LRB-
Desmond FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	, Lie -RRB- To find anything new to say about
Japan	LOCATION	in these days is difficult if not impossible ; but it is always admissible to assume in one 's readers a measure of ignorance as to things Japanese .

		At any rate , to tell of the country and the people as they appeared to the writer is not unlikely to convey some new impressions ; and therefore ``
Japan	LOCATION	as I Saw It '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
A. H. Exner	PERSON	, has a certain fresh - ness that will secure it a reading , while its illustra - tions and other material details are such as to predispose one in its favor .

		A short preliminary 530 THE DIAI , -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	`` History of Nippon , '' useful but not indispensable in this age of abundant encyclopaedias and other reference books , opens the book , and is followed by chapters on
Nagasaki	LOCATION	,
Kioto	LOCATION	,
Yokohama	LOCATION	, Tokio , and other places and subjects of interest , with con - siderable description of Japanese customs , religion , industries , amusements , and so on .

		Of the numerous illustrations accompanying the reading matter , some are `` collotype plates , '' others are `` engraving illus - trations after
G. Bigot	PERSON	, '' and still others , being the majority of all .

		are `` duo-tone illustrations . ''

		Beau - tifully-designed end-leaves and a pleasing cover are also among the book 's attractions .

		Seeking to describe some of '' those places that give
England	LOCATION	her individuality , '' Mr.
Albert B. Osborne	PERSON	has prepared a volume of promising appearance under the title , `` As It Is in
England	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McBride -RRB- , in which he wisely omits
London	LOCATION	as being '' too vast and varied a subject to be combined with any other , '' and confines himself chiefly to such outlying parts as
Cornwall	LOCATION	and the
Scilly Islands	LOCATION	,
Sherwood Forest	ORGANIZATION	, the
Lake district	LOCATION	, the Channel Islands , certain cathe - dral and other towns , and , very briefly ,
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	and
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		His fifteen chapters are accompanied by fine views from photographs .

		His manner may be illustrated in the following brief excerpt from the chapter on Sherwood Forest : ' - There was Alan-a -
Dale	PERSON	and Friar Tuck and Will Scarlet , and they were brave , and not of a bad sort at heart , but different than you and I will ever know , for while human nature is still the same , yet the laws and customs we call our civilization have wrought upon us a necessary work of suppression and restraint so that we do not mani - fest our nature in just the same way . ''

		The British lion and unicorn fittingly adorn the handsome cover , and a box encloses the book .

		The sights of
London	LOCATION	are many and varied , and are every year increasing in multitude and variety .

		Consequently an author should have little difficulty in filling a moderate-sized volume on the great me - tropolis with chapters of a readable and generally informing character .

		Mr.
Henry James Forman	PERSON	's ``
London	LOCATION	: An Intimate Picture '' -LRB-
McBride	PERSON	-RRB- is the work of a well-informed and observant sojourner in the city which he calls `` the most romantic spot on earth . ''

		The lure of
London	LOCATION	, its atmosphere , its fam - ous Tower , ita historic streets , its churches , picture - galleries , and other public buildings , are among the subjects intelligently discussed in successive chap - ters ; and occasional views from photographs help the reader to follow his guide .

		Incidentally , a perilous state of affairs is thought by the author to be indi - cated in a national legislature `` mildly debating upon Welsh Disestablishment '' while `` in every street there is poverty and misery stabbing at your heart . ''

		Something out of the ordinary in hunting narra - tives is offered by Mr.
Thomas Martindale	PERSON	, a Nim - rod of experience and a writer of interesting books of sport . ''

		Hunting in the Upper Yukon '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- describes a trip in quest of big game to the far North of our continent in the autumn of
1912	DATE	, and the author 's varied and sometimes perilous experiences are set forth in ample detail , but not wearisomely to the reader with a taste for such things .

		Human beings as well as animals attracted Mr.
Martindale	PERSON	's attention throughout his expedition , and therefore the human interest so craved by us all is not lack - ing in his book .

		A mountain and a glacier bearing each the name of this intrepid huntsman and ex - plorer are among the scenes pictured in the many illustrations to the volume .

		One chapter is deserv - edly devoted to that intrepid mountain-climber ,
Miss Dora Keen	PERSON	, `` the conqueror of Mount Blackburn . ''

		Mr.
Martindale	PERSON	's style as a narrator is intimate and pleasing , and his book has a very inviting ap - pearance .

		History , antiquities , topography , botany , scenery , legends , literary associations , things ancient and things modern , all have a place in Mr.
Frederic Lees	PERSON	's `` Wanderings on the Italian Riviera '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a handsomely-made volume , with the clearest of type and most generous supply of photo-engravings , also a colored frontispiece .

		Few of the
Riviera	LOCATION	's winter sojourners have more than a faint knowledge of '' the splendid story of the prov - ince which gave birth to
Columbus	LOCATION	, and where the immortal Dante wandered , '' as Mr.
Lees	PERSON	remarks .

		Accordingly he has given much attention to the history of the region , especially to the valleys of
Liguria	LOCATION	and the picturesque hill-towns tucked away in the folds of the mountains .

		Appended notes on the botany of
Liguria	LOCATION	add to the book 's value for naturalists ; and it also has a map and a full index .

		Mr.
George Hamilton Fitch	PERSON	's twin volumes , `` The Critic in the Orient '' and `` The Critic in the
Occi	PERSON	- dent '' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , take their titles from the fact that their author brings to the observation of things in the
Far East	LOCATION	and the Near West the keen - ness of scrutiny developed by thirty years of book - reviewing for the
San Francisco	LOCATION	'' Chronicle . ''

		Hav - ing learned how to tear the heart out of a new book and display it for the benefit of hurried newspaper - readers , he is not ill qualified for the task of seizing quickly upon the significant and the striking in scenes of foreign travel .


Japan	LOCATION	,
Hongkong	ORGANIZATION	,
Canton	LOCATION	,
Singapore	LOCATION	,
Manila	LOCATION	, cities of
India	LOCATION	and monuments of
Egypt	LOCATION	, furnish matter for the first-named of his travel-books ; and
Europe	LOCATION	, from the isles of
Greece	LOCATION	westward , especially the cities of
Rome	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and
London	LOCATION	, with a brief glance at
New York	LOCATION	on the homeward journey , provides topics of general inter - est for the second .

		Tinted illustrations from photo - graphs abound .

		Indebtedness is acknowledged to the `` Chronicle '' for permission to republish these chapters of travel .

		Like other works from the same publishers , these volumes are distinctive in appear - ance and artistic in design .

		To the literature of the Alps is added Mr.
Archi	PERSON	- bald
Campbell Knowles	ORGANIZATION	's anecdotal and descriptive volume entitled `` Adventures in the Alps '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Though it has not on every page the personal quality
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL 531 that renders so enjoyable Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's `` My Alpine Jubilee , '' Sir
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's `` The Playground of
Europe	LOCATION	, '' and Mr.
Whymper	PERSON	's `` Scrambles Amongst the Alps , '' it is full of things seen , dangers escaped , and adventures met with , by actual mountain-climbers , including the author him - self .

		Reflections of a serious and often of a relig - ious nature find natural expression in this book dealing with the sublimities of Alpine scenery .

		Its twelve chapters are furnished with as many half - tone views from photographs , and the whole is in - stinct with the lure of the mountains .

		Travel sketches from the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	shores of
Africa	LOCATION	, written at various times in the last half - dozen years , and already , with three exceptions , offered to appreciative readers in a leading period - ical , form the contents of Mr.
Albert Edwards	PERSON	's anecdotal and descriptive volume on '' The Barbary Coast '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which it is the people them - selves , the turbaned and veiled followers of the Prophet , that claim our attention , and usually suc - ceed in winning it .

		Algiers , the sirocco , the Bedouins , the Arabs , the beggars , the graces and charms of the women these and like themes suc - cessively entertain the reader , and numerous illus - trations from the trustworthy camera fail not to do their part .

		One of the strangest characters of all the strange company is Hadje Mohmed of
Luna Park	LOCATION	, of whom there is no room here to speak further .

		The book 's inviting appearance does not belie its character .

		Mr.
Earle Harrison	PERSON	's noteworthy autochrome photographs of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal which were last
summer	DATE	reproduced in `` Scribner 's Magazine '' are now shown in book form under the title , `` The
Panama	LOCATION	Canal '' -LRB-
Moffat	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Seventeen in number , the views convey an adequate impression of the wonders of this greatest of engineering achieve - ments , and give also glimpses of the adjacent country ,
Gatun Lake	PERSON	, the
Chagres River	LOCATION	, and the vastness of the
Culebra	LOCATION	Cut .

		The book will gain rather than lose in interest and value when many of the scenes it shows shall have been forever shut out from view by the inrushing waters .

		Few better examples of color-photography have been published .

		Ten years have passed since the appearance of the first edition of Mr.
Douglas Sladen	PERSON	's '' Queer Things about
Japan	LOCATION	, '' and the book has since been twice re-issued .

		Now a fourth edition comes out , with an added chapter on the life of the late
Japan	LOCATION	- ese Emperor .

		Native artists illustrate the volume with pictures as charactistic and as guiltless of per - spective as could be desired .

		The frontispiece is in color and gives a glimpse of rural
Japan	LOCATION	in cherry - blossom time .

		As a sketch-book of the humors and oddities of the people of
Nippon	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	's volume is entertaining and apparently at the same time heed - ful of the truth .

		He has collected in his five hundred pages a goodly store of anecdote and observation , comment and description .

		HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE .

		Mr.
Keith Henderson	PERSON	's ten colored illustrations to the new holiday edition of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's `` Under the Greenwood Tree '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- have a vividness in their rural hues that emphasizes the fact that this is a picture of primitive country life , '' a rural painting of the Dutch school '' the author styled it in his sub - title .

		It is nearly forty - two years since this earliest pronounced success of Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	's or , more accurately , one of his earliest successes made its appearance , and it has lost none of its excellence with time .

		Miss Fancy Day , the heroine , `` as nate a little figure of fun as ever I see , and just husband-high , '' is as charming as ever , and the bucolic humor of the tale is still unsur - passed .

		The book 's wide-margined and clearly - printed pages are irresistibly inviting .

		Nothing short of splendid is the form in which `` Poems from Leaves of Grass '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , illus - trated in color by Miss
Margaret C. Cook	PERSON	, is pre - sented to the reader .

		The book is a quarto of two hundred and sixty pages , its typography and paper beyond criticism , its cover design an appropriate representation of grass blades and heads in gilt on a green background , and its two dozen large colored plates catching the mood of the poet without becom - ing so realistic as to offend .

		Whitman 's poems must be reproduced here in greater part a brief com - parison will easily determine the omissions and a more elaborate reproduction could not reasonably be desired .

		An ornate and serviceable box , with hinged cover , encloses the book .

		`` The Gathering of Brother Hilarius , '' by the late author of `` The Roadmender , '' best known by her pen name of ``
Michael Fairless	PERSON	, '' reappears this sea - son in a handsome holiday edition , with eight sym - pathetic illustrations by Miss
Eleanor F. Bric.kdale	PERSON	.

		The book teaches the lesson that one must suffer and be tempted and overcome temptation before one can attain fulness of life and spiritual peace .

		Hilarius , a young novice , yielding suddenly one day to the promptings of youth and the lure of the road passing the monastery gate , ventures forth a little way and meets a dancing girl who laughs at him for never having known either hunger or love .

		But the mean - ing of these words he learns full well somewhat later when , after confessing his escapade , he is sent forth into the world by the prior and meets with sundry adventures that serve to test the stuff he is made of .

		His final return to the monastery , his rare skill as a limner , his good works as prior , his death , and his '' gathering '' to his last long rest , are beautifully told .

Dutton	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		A new edition of Mrs.
Helen Hunt Jackson	PERSON	's `` Ramona '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with an intro - duction by Mr.
A. C. Vrornan	PERSON	, who gives the his - tory of the writing of the story and correctly places its scene , is among the more important reprints of the season .

		Conflicting reports as to the scene of the famous incidents of the romance have long been current , to the confusion of tourists , and Mr.
Vro	PERSON	- 532 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	man 's carefully-studied paper on the subject is far from superfluous .

		He has also provided the book with twenty-four views from his own photographs , and Mr.
Henry Sandham	PERSON	supplies appropriate drawings for the chapter-headings .

		The work is issued as two volumes in one , artistically bound and neatly boxed .

		The handy form , the good paper , the clear though not large type , and especially the sixteen colored illustrations by Mr.
Christopher Clark	PERSON	, make the
Crowell Company	ORGANIZATION	's new edition of
Blackmore	PERSON	's ``
Lorna Doone	PERSON	'' a desirable one to possess .

		.

		The author 's preface to the first and that to the sixth edition are reprinted .

		A pleasing scene , showing the hero and heroine literally tete-h-tete , adorns the cover ; a similarly ornamented wrapper is provided , and the whole is neatly boxed .

		HOLIDAY ART BOOKS .

		One of the most sumptuous of the season 's art books is a thin quarto devoted to the life and work of
Charles Conder	PERSON	, a young English artist who died some four years ago .

		Although he worked con - stantly in oils , and attempted lithography and etch - ing ,
Conder	PERSON	's forte lay in water-color drawing on silk .

		In this field , more especially in his designs for fans , he achieved a very high reputation .

		His fans , as Mr.
Charles Ricketts	PERSON	has said , will some day be considered classics .

		Here his poetic imagination and exquisite sense of color reached their fullest expression , with results that are often strongly remi - niscent of Wattean .

		Mr.
Frank Gibson	PERSON	contributes an account of
Conner	ORGANIZATION	's li e and work , and a descriptive catalogue of his lithographs and etchings is supplied by Mr.
Campbell Dodgson	PERSON	.

		The greater part of the volume , however , is given over to illustrative fea - tures .

		Besides a photogravure portrait of the artist , there are considerably more than a hundred full - page reproductions of his work , including eleven fine color-plates .

		In all matters of external appear - ance , the publishers -LRB- Lane -RRB- have given the volume an irreproachable setting .

		Conder himself would have rejoiced in the beautiful cover and end-leaves .

		A splendid souvenir of the art of those Russian dancers who have lately performed so acceptably in
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	, is presented in Mr.
A. E. Johnson	PERSON	's finely-illustrated quarto on `` The Russian Ballet '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		An introductory historical sketch of the ballet opens the book , seventeen pantomimes , tableaux , reveries , and similar pieces performed by Russian dancers are described and illustrated , and the final chapter is devoted to that queen of the ballet , Mile .


Anna Pavlova	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Rene	PERSON	'' Bull admirably catches the spirit of Russian stage dancing in his vivid illustra - tions in color and his equally pleasing line drawings .

		Bound in white and gold , and artistically boxed , the book takes an important place among recent works of like character .

		No English celebrity , not of the royal family , can count on being spared by Mr.
Max Beerbohm	PERSON	in his quest of subjects for the exercise of his talent as the cleverest of present-day caricaturists ; and even foreign notables find themselves included in his album of laughable portraits and made the invol - untary promoters of international gayety . ''

		Fifty Caricatures by
Max Beerbohm	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- is a book to dispel the blues , being a collection of half a hun - dred of the artist 's most characteristic extravaganzas in portraiture .

		Politics , literature , society , high fi - nance , reformed spelling , with much else beside -LRB- but not including woman suffrage , for some unknown reason -RRB- , are represented in the mirth-provoking figures that enliven the book .

		One notable drawing shows us
Hilda Lessways	PERSON	upbraiding the author of her being for compelling her and Clayhanger to remain on public exhibition for so protracted and indefinite a period .

		Clayhanger , with an injured look , stands in the background .

		The cover-design pictures
John Bull	ORGANIZATION	in amusing guise .


Eugene Fromentin	PERSON	's book of art criticism , `` Les Maitres d'Autrefois , '' produced near the end of his life , almost forty years ago , comes out in a good English translation entitled `` The Masters of Past Time '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , with four reproductions in color , and twice as many in half-tone , from those masters .

		It is with the Dutch and the Flemish schools that the book deals , and its method is thus explained by the author : '' I shall merely describe , in the presence of certain pictures , the effects of surprise , pleasure , astonishment , and no less exactly of disappointment , which they happened to cause me . ''

		Rubens , Rem - brandt ,
Frans Hals	PERSON	,
Van Dyck	LOCATION	,
Paul Potter	PERSON	, Ter - burg ,
Ruysdael	LOCATION	, Cuyp these are naturally treated at some length by the artist-author , through whose eyes it is pleasant and instructive to view the mas - terpieces of Dutch and Flemish art .

		The translator modestly withholds his name .

		The art of the Cubists , `` the joy of the mad , the despair of the sane , '' is amusingly and very cleverly satirized in verse and drawing by Mr. and Mrs.
Earl Harvey Lyall	PERSON	in the oddest little color book of the season , < The Cubies ' ABC '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Mrs.
Lyall	PERSON	writes the verses , Mr.
Lyall	PERSON	cubically illustrates them .

		The book must be seen and read to be appreciated , but here is a sample of its literary style -LRB- its artistic quality defies description -RRB- : `` A is for Art in the Cubies ' domain -LRB- Not the Art of the Ancients , brand-new are the Cubies . -RRB-

		Archipenko 's their guide , Anatomies their bane ; They 're the joy of the mad , the despair of the sane , -LRB- With their emerald hair and their eyes red as rubies . -RRB-

		A is for Art in the Cubies ' domain . ''

		A little book designed to awaken a primary inter - est in some of the great artists and their paintings is Miss
Effie Seachrest	PERSON	's `` Legendary Lore and Peeps at Pictures , '' in which
Raphael	PERSON	,
Reynolds	PERSON	,
Nicholaas Maes	ORGANIZATION	, Puvis de Chavannes ,
Boutet de Morivel	PERSON	, and a few others , are briefly and simply treated , with accompanying prints , in miniature , of some of their more celebrated paintings .

		The story element is made prominent , and the book ought to interest young readers -LRB- though one never can tell before - hand -RRB- , who will at least enjoy its pictures .

		`` The
1913	DATE	-RSB- THE DIAL , 533 Grafters '' of
Kansas City	LOCATION	publish the little volume in unusual and attractive form .

		MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS .

		The recent death of that industrious and enthu - siastic antiquary and historian ,
Stephen Jenkins	PERSON	, adds a melancholy interest to his last work , `` The Old Boston Post Road '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , which traces with an ample accompaniment of historical comment the oldest and most northerly of the mail routes connecting
New York	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	in colonial times .

		By this route , via
New Haven	LOCATION	,
Hartford	LOCATION	,
Springfield	LOCATION	, and
Worcester	LOCATION	, a monthly mail was established in
1673	DATE	, '' the first mail upon the continent of
America	LOCATION	, '' as the author declares .

		The plan of the book is similar to that of `` The Greatest Street in the World , '' from the same pen , the notes and comments and pictorial illustrations being of the most copious and variously interesting sort .

		About a third of the volume is devoted to the route from
New York	LOCATION	to the
Connecticut	LOCATION	line , in the region of the author 's home and most painstaking researches ; but no part of the road is slighted , and the account runs to nearly four hundred and fifty octavo pages .

		Pictures , maps , bibliography , and index are all fittingly supplied .

		Especially noteworthy are the two hundred well - chosen illustrations from both early and later sources .

		``
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	as an Architect and a De - signer of Landscapes '' is the arresting title of a handsome and otherwise remarkable volume , the joint work of Professor
William Alexander Lambeth	PERSON	, of the
University of Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, and Mr.
Warren H. Manning	PERSON	, landscape-designer , of
Boston	LOCATION	.

		Monticello and the university that
Jefferson	PERSON	helped to found are made the objects of expert scrutiny in determining , so far as may be , how much the allied arts of archi - tecture and landscape-design owe to the versatile third president of our country .

		Letters and other documents from his hand , some of them reproduced in facsimile , help to establish his claim to our admiration for his skill in the arts here referred to .

		Palladio , who gave inspiration to
Inigo Jones	PERSON	, was also , it seems , a stimulus to
Jefferson	LOCATION	; but the distinguishing blemishes of
Palladio	ORGANIZATION	's style were avoided by his Virginian disciple , whose conceptions , we are assured , `` became increasingly refined and classical . ''

		The authors of the book have pursued their researches with enthusiasm , and what they have to say is presented in convincing form .

		The work is handsomely issued in a limited edition , with many plates and other illustrative accessories , and with a beautiful cover-design showing the front elevation of
Monticello	LOCATION	.

		-LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Appropriately supplementary to Mr.
Stanton Davis Kirkham	PERSON	's `` East and West , '' of recent date , is his similar volume entitled `` North and South '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- an intensive rather than extensive study of nature in a few chosen places of the higher and the lower latitudes of our broad country , all enlivened with a genial humor and embellished with innumerable views of field and forest and rippling stream .

		No small part of the joy of such outings as Mr.
Kirkham	PERSON	delights in is depicted in these words of his : '' But at Pine Bank I throw off this yoke of tyranny and am not concerned about the dinner or the vagaries of the cook , or even the style of my coat , since bacon and potatoes and beans are as constant and as dependable as day and night , and a flannel shirt is always the fashion . ''

		Mr.
Kirkham	PERSON	is a close and loving student of nature .

		An album of fine views and plans of `` The Old Halls and Manor Houses of
Yorkshire	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , with a sufficiency of descriptive text , is presented by Mr.
Louis Ambler	PERSON	, who confesses himself embar - rassed with an excess of riches in choosing examples for his book .

		Only houses built before
1700	DATE	have been selected , and those built for defense , and there - fore having the nature of castles , are excluded .

		Ninety-one plates from photographs taken especially for this work by Mr.
Horace Dan	PERSON	, architect , and others , with twenty plates of measured drawings and numerous illustrations in the text , adorn the royal octavo , which is sumptuously bound in green and gilt .

		Mr.
Ambler	PERSON	is himself an architect , and his book will appeal especially to those of his profession .

		The illustrations are remarkably good , often strikingly beautiful .

		Miss
Helene A. Guerber	PERSON	, a practiced hand at such work , has gathered into one compact volume brief outlines of the world 's great epics , including those of
Asia	LOCATION	as well as of
Europe	LOCATION	, and closing with a short chapter on American productions of an epic quality .

		`` The Book of the Epic '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- has an introduction by Dr.
J. Berg Esenwein	PERSON	, sixteen reproductions of famous paintings and old prints , aud a full index of names .

		In the right hands it will serve as a powerful promoter of a love of what is best in the great department of literature that it discusses .

		A simple , straightforward , narrative style has been adopted by the author , whose success in packing so much excellent matter into so small space is to be commended .

		Descriptive of the French capital from
Caesar	LOCATION	's time to the present , Mrs.
Mabel S. C. Smith	PERSON	's `` Twenty Centuries of
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is a conven - ient and readable handbook for those who wish to know the wonderful city in a topographical-historical way .

		Old prints and modern photographs contribute to the illustration of the book , a folding map of the city is inserted , and genealogical tables of the kings of
France	LOCATION	down to the Revolution , with a chrono - logical list of the subsequent heads of the nation , are appended .

		It is a fascinating theme that the author has chosen , and she draws occasionally on the poets to heighten the charm .

		Her closing chapter on ``
Paris	LOCATION	of To-day '' has a self-denying brevity that speaks well for the writer 's ability to hold her super - abundance of material well in hand from the begin - ning .

		The book is handsomely bound , and its large type refreshes the eye .

		The fifth of the so-called '' Sayings of Jesus '' that were discovered six years ago written on a fragment of papyrus is the theme of Dr.
Henry van Dyke	PERSON	's 534 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	poetic apologue , `` The Toiling of Felix '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		After long and devout search the saintly Felix found Jesus in the humble toil of a quarry-man , thus prov - ing the truth of the saying , `` Raise the stone and thou shalt find me ; cleave the wood and there am I. '' Colored plates by Mr.
Herbert Moore	PERSON	illustrate the poem , and decorative designs by Mr.
Edward B. Edwards	PERSON	border the pages and illuminate the cover .

		It is a beautiful legend , beautifully told , and finely suited to the
Christmas	LOCATION	season .

		Designed in the style made familiar by its pub - lishers ,
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, a stout volume with numerous pictures from photographs , and bearing the title , '' The Old Spanish Missions of
California	LOCATION	, '' conducts the reader through the more or less ruinous remains of the twenty-one religious establishments that testify to the zeal of
Spain	LOCATION	in carrying the Christian faith to our southwestern aborigines .

		The mission of
San Diego	LOCATION	de Alcala '' was founded in
1769	DATE	, that of
San Francisco Solano	LOCATION	in
1823	DATE	; and between these years the starting of the other missions took place at short intervals .

		Mr.
Paul Elder	PERSON	sup - plies brief historical and descriptive sketches to accompany the many fine illustrations , and quotes freely from other writers , both in prose and verse .

		The book is artistic in design , and a pleasing con - tribution to the literature that has grown up about these picturesque old mission houses .

		The identity of ``
George A. Birmingham	PERSON	'' being now revealed , he is to be spoken of by reviewers as Rev.
James Owen Hannay	PERSON	, though his delightful pictures of Irish life will always be associated with the more familiar pen-name in his readers ' minds . ''

		Irishmen All '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- is much after the manner of last year 's book by the same author , '' The Lighter Side of Irish Life , '' being a collection of twelve character sketches of officials , country gentlemen , farmers , squires , priests , the exile from
Erin	PERSON	, the `` minister , '' and , lastly , the young lady and the young gentleman in business .

		Each of the twelve selected types is graphically and chromatically exhibited by Mr.
Jack B. Yeats	PERSON	, R.H.A. , as well as painted in words by the author .

		The appropri - ate green binding is protected by a wrapper on which is pictured the priest going the rounds of his parish .

		`` The Changing Year '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is an excellent anthology of nature verse compiled by Mr.
John R. Howard	PERSON	.

		It departs from the usual and the expected method of such compilations in not following the order of the seasons , but in grouping its selections under headings denoting aspects and moods .

		Thus , `` Light and Shadow , '' `` Sky and
Air	ORGANIZATION	, `` Man 's Fellow Creatures , '' `` The Mighty Heart , '' are some of its section-titles .

		The realm of English and American poetry has been searched for suitable selections , and an occasional poet of alien tongue is represented in translation .

		An index of authors and titles , and one of first lines , with a brief intro - duction and a hauntingly beautiful winter scene as frontispiece , complete the equipment of the little book , which is tastefully bound and boxed .

		Mr.
Walt Mason	PERSON	, favorably known to magazine - readers as a writer of prose - verse , or jingles in the form of prose , is the author of a lively and amusing book entitled , `` Rippling Rhymes '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , wherein are collected about a hundred pieces , new compositions and reprints , on all sorts of timely themes , and enjoying the distinguished sponsorship of our
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	, who writes a heartily commendatory introduction .

		Mr.
D. S. Groesbeck	PERSON	contributes half a dozen clever drawings in har - mony with the spirit of the volume , which bears a medallion portrait of the author on its cover , and is otherwise embellished .

		As a sample of Mr.
Mason	PERSON	's style , we quote : `` Be kind to the umpire who bosses the game , whose doom is too frequently sealed ; it serves no good purpose to camp on his frame , and strew him all over the field . ''

		One might do worse than read good verse set up in the form of prose ; ' t is not its look makes the poetry - book , nor its name that makes the rose .

		Mr.
Berton Braley	PERSON	's `` Sonnets of a Suffragette '' -LRB-
Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is timely in its theme and tuneful in its smoothly-flowing verse . ''

		Rollicking '' is perhaps a better adjective to apply to the lively bits of rhyme gathered together in the little volume , which contains , beside the pieces indicated in the title , sundry love sonnets of a manicure , love lyrics of a shop girl , and love lyrics of a chauffeur .

		An almost enviable command of colloquialisms , great dexterity in their manipulation in verse , and a fertile invention , are evident on every page of the lively little book .

		It is certainly calculated to dis - pel care , smooth the ruffled brow , and induce a mirthful state of mind befitting the season .

		The gently satirical , pleasingly whimsical , not too boisterously comical muse of Mr.
Bert Leston Taylor	PERSON	, the `` B. L. T. '' of the
Chicago	LOCATION	`` Tribune , '' will be enjoyed by readers of his `` Motley Measures , '' a vol - ume of modest proportions and not making promise of more than it can carry out .

		Most of the verses have already seen the light in the `` Tribune , '' but will stand the strain of reprinting .

		We especially welcome the neat little skit entitled `` Bygones : Lines Inspired by a View of the Cubist Paintings , Followed by a Late Supper . ''

		But the whole book is a capital smile-generator .

		The author 's portrait appears as frontispiece .

		The Laurentian Publish - ers , of
Chicago	LOCATION	, issue the book .

		That an excellent anthology of poetry and prose on the pleasures of open-air life can be made even with the omission of more than one eminent writer in that domain , is proved by Mr.
John Richardson	PERSON	, the compiler of a handy and attractive volume entitled `` In the Garden of Delight '' -LRB-
Caldwell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		In all the wealth of its well-chosen contents we find nothing from
Thoreau	LOCATION	, nothing from
Bryant	PERSON	but a line printed under the frontispiece , nothing from Whitman or
Gilbert White	PERSON	or
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	.

		But we do find enough , and more than enough , to warrant commendation of the book , which is taste - fully made , with a delicately beautiful colored plate facing the title-page , and a pleasing cover design .

		1913 -RSB- THE DIAL , 535 A wholesome Christmas story , with an obvious but not too obtrusive moral , comes from the pen of Mrs.
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	.

		`` The Stranger at the Gate '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- relates sundry interesting experiences of the
Vance	PERSON	family and of a rather mysterious Dr.
Amunde	PERSON	who is engaged in a study of `` the modern spirit of Christmas as it is lived in the homes of our best eastern civilization . ''

		Inter - woven with the narrative is the moving account of old
Ira Vance	ORGANIZATION	's long-delayed success as an inventor , and the founding of the firm of
`` Ira & Elizabeth Vance & Son	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		A happy ending suitably and sat - isfyingly closes the pleasant story .

		A colored front - ispiece arid occasional decorative designs in green contribute to the book 's attractive appearance .

		A pleasing and useful desk accessory takes the shape of a neatly encased `` Hourly Reminder , '' in which each day of the year has a leaf to itself with blank lines for every hour from nine in the morning to ten at night .

		Engagements are to be written on these lines and each leaf detached when it has per - formed its office .

		Apt quotations and notes of historic events are supplied , as is also an appendix of useful information .

		Two styles of case are offered , in '' leatherette '' and in Spanish morocco .

		-LRB-
W. N. Sharpe Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Nine Christmas tales for the young in heart call for commendatory mention , but must receive less than their due of critically appreciative comment .

		`` The Lady of the Lighthouse '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Lewis B. Woodruff	PERSON	, justifies its pleasingly allitera - tive title by showing , in the form of a bright and sunshiny story , how light may be brought into the lives of the blind .

		At the same time it is a Christ - mas story of unusual quality .

		`` The Three God - fathers '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- carries the reader to a very different environment , the plains of
Arizona	LOCATION	.

		The author is Mr.
Peter B. Kyne	PERSON	, and he tells the story of a Christmas baby in such a manner as to hold the attention at the same time that it teaches a les - son .

		`` Finding His Soul '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Nor	PERSON	- man
Duncan	PERSON	, tells how
James Falcontent	PERSON	, of the business house of
Groat & McCarthy	ORGANIZATION	, beheld a vision in the hills of
Bethlehem	LOCATION	, and found his soul and was at peace .

		Illustrations help to make vivid the moving tale .

		In `` Next Christmas '' -LRB-
Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Byron E. Veatch	PERSON	relates briefly and effectively how a hardened business man is at last led to return from the West to his boyhood home in
New Hampshire	LOCATION	, where he finds his old - time sweetheart still waiting for him , and the two are married .

		Mrs.
Josephine Daskam Bacon	PERSON	chronicles in her own bright way `` The Luck o ' Lady Joan '' -LRB-
Browne & Howell Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which a poor tinker 's daughter is adopted by an old miser , marries his grandson , and so , all in good time , attains prosperity and also happiness .

		A frontis - piece depicts the marriage scene , and the cover shows
Joan	PERSON	at her spinning-wheel .

		`` A Christmas When the West Was Young '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , by Dr.
Cyrus Townsend Brady	PERSON	, is the story of a young couple who remove from
New England	LOCATION	to the far West , build themselves a log cabin forty miles from the nearest settlement , have a child born to them , and see it taken from them by death two days before
Christmas	DATE	.

		But on
Christmas	DATE	day , through a stirring and rather fearful series of events , another child finds itself under their care and claim - ing their love , which is given , after some hesitation ; and so the peace and joy of the season are still in a measure theirs .

		Drawings and decorations enrich the little book , which is ornamentally bound and boxed .

		`` Under the Christmas Stars '' -LRB- Double - day -RRB- depicts an old-fashioned family gathering at
Christmas	LOCATION	time under the family roof at
North Estabrook	LOCATION	, where
John Fernald	PERSON	and his wife wel - come their numerous progeny , including sons-in-law , daughters-in-law , and grand-children , and Christmas merry-making rises to high-water mark .

		The latest addition to the family , through marriage , is somewhat snubbed as being `` a wild and woolly Westerner , `` but she proves herself the heroine of the occasion .

		How she does it should be read in the very words of the author ,
Miss Grace S. Richmond	LOCATION	.

		It is an unusual plot .


Alice Barber Stephens	PERSON	illustrates the book , which also has marginal decorations and other artistic embellishments .

		An amusing and pathetic tale of the reunion of an aged husband and wife , who had been settled in different homes of the family circle , but at last determined to elope back to the little old house where they had formerly been happy , is told in Mrs.
Caroline Abbot Stanley	PERSON	's Yuletide romance , `` Their Christmas Golden Wed - ding '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , which is illustrated in color .

		`` The Christmas Bishop '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Winifred Kirkland	PERSON	, shows us a generous - hearted dignitary of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	endeavoring on the last day of his life , which happens to be Christmas , to reconcile an unforgiving woman to her daughter - in-law , to make a fashionable clergyman adopt a simple and sincere life amongst the poor , and a lonely rich woman win happiness by helping the clergyman in the proposed good work .

		How far he succeeded the book will tell .

		It is illustrated by Miss
Louise G. Morrison	PERSON	.

		NOTES .

		Mr.
Dean C.Worcester	PERSON	has in preparation an extended work on the
Philippines	LOCATION	, which the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	will publish during the winter .

		A new volume of verse by Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	, entitled '' The Lonely Dancer , and Other Poems , '' will be published immediately by the
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		An addition to the list of
Houghton Mifflin	LOCATION	books , to be published at once , is Mr.
Arthur Grant	PERSON	's '' In the Old Paths , '' a series of essays recreating some of the great scenes of literature .

		One of the earliest novels of the new year will be `` Idonia : A Romance of Old
London	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Arthur F. Wallis	PERSON	, a new English writer .

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the publishers .

		This is the last holiday season in which we shall have one of the late
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's famous fairy books .

		This 536 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16 year	DATE	's volume , the twenty-fifth of the series , is entitled `` The Strange Fairy Book . ''

		Like most of its prede - cessors , it is illustrated in color , etc. , by Mr.
H. J. Ford	PERSON	.

		Mr.
George Middleton	PERSON	has written a new three-act play entitled '' Nowadays , '' which Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	will pub - lish early in the new year .

		It is described as a comedy of family life and feminism .

		Mr.
Charles Welsh	PERSON	, who has for many years made a special study of literature for the young , is engaged on a volume of '' Studies in the History of Children 's Lit - erature , '' which will be published early next year . ''

		The Poetical Works of
William Blake	PERSON	, '' edited , with introduction and textual notes , by Mr.
John Sampson	PERSON	, is soon to be added to the '' Oxford Poets . ''

		The vol - ume includes the unpublished '' French Revolution . ''

		Professor
Frederic A. Ogg	PERSON	, whose Life of
Daniel Webster	PERSON	is promised for publication early in
January	DATE	by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, has recently been selected to deliver a course of lectures on
Contemporary Government	ORGANIZATION	and Politics under the auspices of the
Inter	ORGANIZATION	- collegiate
Commission on Extension Courses	ORGANIZATION	, in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		The
December	DATE	number of `` Poetry '' contains six narrative poems by the
Bengal	LOCATION	poet ,
Rabindranath Tagore	PERSON	, who has recently been awarded the Nobel Prize in literature .

		Mr.
Tagore	PERSON	's work was introduced to American audiences by '' Poetry '' in the
December	DATE	num - ber of last year .

		These new poems have been translated from the Bengali by the author expressly for this pub - lication , and they are said to represent a new phase of his work .

		According to the
London	LOCATION	'' Nation , '' we are to have a book upon art by
Rodin	PERSON	.

		It seems that for a long time past the famous sculptor has been in the habit of jotting down notes about his own art , the art of the past , and his general views of -LCB- esthetics .

		These are now to be edited for publication by
Rodin	ORGANIZATION	in collaboration with Mr.
Warrington Dawson	PERSON	, an American writer whom he has known for several years .

		The book is to appear in French early next year , and will be promptly followed by an English translation .

		A collection of three plays by the Viennese dramatist ,
Arthur Schnitzler	PERSON	, in an English translation by Mr.
Horace B. Samuel	PERSON	, is announced by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		So far
Schnitzler	PERSON	is known to English - speaking readers and playgoers chiefly through Mr.
Granville Barker	PERSON	's adaptation of his series of episodes entitled ''
Anatol	PERSON	. ''

		The three plays to be issued in this volume , `` The Green Cockatoo , '' `` The Mate , '' and `` Paracelsus , `` however , give the English reader excellent opportunity to estimate Sehnitzler at his true value .

		High on the list of the really important American magazines of a serious character stand the quarterlies which appear under the auspices of certain of our uni - versities .

		They come nearer than any other periodicals to satisfying the wants of the educated reader , just as those wants are satisfied in
England	LOCATION	by the great monthlies and quarterlies .

		We have no magazines worthier of support , or better repaying their modest subscription price , than '' The Sewanee Review , '' '' The South Atlantic Quarterly , '' and '' The
Yale Review	ORGANIZATION	, '' to which list must now be added '' The Mid - West Quarterly , '' which comes from the
University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
P. H. Frye	PERSON	is the editor , and the con - tents of the initial -LRB-
October	DATE	-RRB- number are of rich and varied interest .

		The magazine offers its hospitality to writers from all sections of the country .

		The Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	give it their imprint .
