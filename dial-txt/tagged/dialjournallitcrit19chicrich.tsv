KovaleVsky	PERSON	reached her womanhood at a time when the young Russian women began to long for education .

		She became one of the most ardent in the new path , and , in order to be free to study in
Berlin	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	, she went so far as to ally herself to a young student in a fictitious marriage .

		This means a marriage in form only , recognized by every one ex - cept the contracting parties .

		Her husband did not understand her , and , to add to her miseries , S6nya fell in love with him ; after a time they became man and wife in earnest , but even the birth of a child could not straighten out the tangle into which they had got themselves by living a false life .

		The book is divided into two parts : Mme.
KovaleVsky	PERSON	writes the story of her own childhood -LRB- a most delightful account of Russian family life -RRB- , and to this is added a biography by her friend , the Duchess of Cajanello , who was also a striking ex - ample of the `` new womanhood . ''

		.

		28 S UMMER READING .

		There are many , doubtless , to whom the sug - gestion of a summer vacation largely devoted to reading , particularly if undertaken with profitable intent , will seem little better than a counsel of perfection .

		The strained nerves and the weary brain demand , they will urge , that whatever weeks or months may be annually snatched from the grasp of toil should be given up to recreation in its primitive sense , to the renewing of the exhausted vitality , to the re - building of the wasted tissue .

		At such times , the only books of which they will hear are those which the best authority tells us are to be found in running brooks , and the only sermons to which they are disposed to listen are the mute discourses of the stones upon sea-cliff or mountain-side .

		And there is undoubtedly a degree of tension , reached by many in our fever - ish latter-age life , from which relief is only possible upon condition of a complete , if tem - porary , abondonment of civilization with all its devices .

		We are impelled for a brief space to relapse into barbarism , and , seeking new strength by contact with the bare earth , to real - ize in our own experience the myth of
Antaeus	ORGANIZATION	.

		But such relapses are not for long , and , the first joy of freedom and relaxation being at an end , the mental activities quickly reassert their need of occupation .

		The pendulum of life has soon swung all the way from the unendurable strain of daily recurrent labor to the equally unendurable ennui of prolonged idleness .

		The pure joy of existence may suffice for the mo - ment , but the sense of vacuity sets in after a while , and imperatively calls for some form of diversion that shall not leave Nature to do all the recreative work .

		At such times , more forci - bly perhaps than at any others , books offer us their serviceable solace , and we congratulate ourselves upon the instinctive foresight that led us to provide ourselves with such compan - ions .

		Then , reclining upon shaded lawn or veranda , upon deck or seashore , or pine-clad mountain slope , fortified against the intrusions of care , and at peace with all the world , we enjoy in equal measure the ministries of Na - ture and of Art , as far removed from ennui as from toil , and the discords of life are resolved into the richest of harmonies .

		8 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, What books are best suited to the needs of the long
summer	DATE	days ?

		We have known a young man , in contemplation of an ocean voy - age , to take with him the ''
Kritik	PERSON	der Keinen Vernunft . ''

		Luckily there was a library on the ship , and
Kant	PERSON	remained undisturbed at the bottom of the traveller 's trunk .

		On the other hand , there are too many people whose idea of a
summer	DATE	's literary provision becomes em - bodied in a package of ephemeral novels of varying degrees of unreality or imbecility , and an armful of illustrated periodicals .

		We hardly know which of the two extremes thus illustrated deserves the severer censure , but if either case is to have our sympathies it must be that of the Kantian student rather than that of the `` Dodo '' - laden excursionist .

		The former , at least , has a rational motive , if his judgment be woefully at fault ; the latter is , however unconsciously , doing his best to waste a golden opportunity .

		The rational person will take neither Kant nor '' Dodo '' to his place of
summer	DATE	resort , for he will know that there is a grateful mean be - tween the substantial but not easily digestible quality of the one and the mere frothiness of the other .

		He will know , for one thing , that there is an abundance of literature which is of the very best , yet which makes no strenuous demand upon the faculties , which can hold the attention without conscious effort , so smooth is the flow and so harmonious the form .

		What reading , for example , could be more ideally fit for the long
summer	DATE	afternoons than the poetry of the '' Faery Queene '' or the '' Earthly Paradise , '' the prose of the '' Pentameron '' or ''
Marius	PERSON	the Epicurean '' ?

		Such reading as this becomes a permanent intellectual posses - sion , an influence moulding imagination and character , and the retrospective charm natu - rally attaching to the memory of a
summer	DATE	out - ing will be not a little enhanced by association with the imperishable beauty of such works of literary art .

		There is a passage in one of
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	's letters which embodies the whole gos - pel of
summer	DATE	reading . ''

		I am now a good deal about , '' he says , '' in a new Boat I have built , and thought -LRB- as
Johnson	PERSON	took
Cocker	ORGANIZATION	's Arithmetic with him on travel , because he should n't exhaust it -RRB- so I would take
Dante	PERSON	and Homer with me , instead of
Mudie	PERSON	's Books , which I read through directly .

		I took
Dante	ORGANIZATION	by way of slow Digestion : not having looked at him for some years : but I am glad to find I relish him as much as ever : he atones with the Sea ; as you know does the Odyssey these are the Men ! ''

		What shall we do , then , with what Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- kin calls the good books of the hour telling us that '' we ought to be entirely thankful for them , and entirely ashamed of ourselves if we make no good use of them '' if we are not to put them in our trunk when we start upon our vacation ?

		We have no disposition to under - rate the usefulness of '' these bright accounts of travels , good-humored and witty discussions of questions , lively or pathetic story-telling in the form of novel , firm fact-telling by the real agents concerned in the events of passing his - tory . ''

		But we think that the time for them is the hour left us after a hard day 's work , or the occasional holiday , rather than the sum - mer 's weeks or months of continuous rest .

		When that happy season comes round , we can put it to better uses , and , if we are going to do any reading at all , it surely offers the occa - sion of occasions for that close acquaintance with '' the authors '' that we can never hope to make during the ordinary routine of active life .

		If we are well-advised , we will leave the ephem - eral and scrappy literature of the day for the day which brings it forth , and not allow it to usurp our attention during the only part of the year when we are really free to enter upon enjoyment of our great heritage of Books in the higher and better sense . ''

		Who would think of taking up the '
Faery Queene	PERSON	' for a stopgap ? ''

		while waiting for the sound of the dinner-bell , Lamb asks us .

		And , to point the obverse of the moral , let us in turn ask : Who would think , or who ought to think , of devot - ing the long
summer	DATE	days to books whose final cause is to supply us with stopgaps , and which , when put to other uses , are as much out of place as Spenser would be in the hungry half - hour preceding the evening repast ?

		THE HISTORICAL NOVEL .

		Dunlop 's definition of fiction as '' select and highly-colored history '' contained within itself the germs of all the discussions that have arisen on the historical novel and the limits of history and fiction .

		While
Huet	PERSON	, the first to write a treatise on the novel , described it as '' a fiction of love adventures , written in prose , with artistic method , for the pleasure and instruction of the reader , '' thus ignoring the element of realism , a consensus of opinion on the modern novel would surely base its structure upon life .

		Fiction includes every narrative prose description of human life into which enters consciously the ele - ment of the imagination , narrative , as opposed to annalistic or dramatic ; prose , as a quite arbitrary
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL but very convenient exclusion of an exceptional spe - cies with which are associated a troublesome kinship of varieties .

		But history , too , treats life ; and , in the shape of biography , more or less in narrative form .

		And much of what passes for the standard history of the world contains a very large element of imagination .

		The once universal conception of history as properly confined to the rise and fall of governments and the deeds of rulers , gaye , to be sure , a ground of distinction in the nature of the events and char - acters treated ; the novel introducing personages not known to history , and treating war and pol - itics only incidentally .

		But ideas of history have changed since
Huet	PERSON	's day , and we recognize that the records of the common people and their daily lives are as important for the guidance of posterity as the chronicles of kings .

		So that any record of human life , or of any product or activity of men , may fairly be said , in so far as it is true , to be his - tory .

		We can not escape the entangling alliance by try - ing to draw a line between the present and the past .

		We now write contemporary history ; and the novel would be classified as historical , no matter how re - cently past were its data , if its subject-matter were on other grounds recognized as historical . ''

		Wav - erley , '' the type and pioneer of the species , treated events only sixty years gone by .

		Antiquity is not a mark of the historical in fiction or elsewhere .

		It may be thought feasible to establish a distinc - tion on the basis of the intention of the writer .

		As Mr.
Marion Crawford	PERSON	says : '' It is doubtful whether any genuine historical novel has ever yet been written for the sake of the history it contains ; and a parallel proposition might be set up that no genuine history has been written for the sake of the romance or imagination it contains .

		But the latter proposition will directly be met with doubt , and in the former will be detected the assumed dif - ference between the theme of history and that of the novel .

		Possibly a distinction may be made by viewing the writer 's intent upon the reader ; his aim in the case of the novel being to amuse and enter - tain -LRB- not excluding a suppressed but controlling willingness to elevate -RRB- , and in the case of the his - tory , to impress and instruct , or , in the language of Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	, to furnish in the first case '' an intellectual artistic luxury , '' in the second '' an in - tellectual lesson . ''

		In general , this distinction , though elusive and not profound , may prove ser - viceable .

		In the line of biography the two branches of lit - erature approach most closely , and it is difficult here to find any other distinguishing mark for the novel than that of the conscious introduction of the imag - ination .

		But as to the proportion of this element , I doubt whether anything definite can be said .

		However fantastic and improbable a narrative and descriptions may be , the original materials are all from life and nature : it is not possible to invent something out of nothing .

		On the other hand , the amount of fiction may be almost imponderable .

		More than one successful novel has been a faithful narrative of real events , with merely the names of persons and localities altered enough to escape a libel suit .

		Usually , of course , the author wanders over the broad intervening territory , combining pieces of real persons into a new individual , re - grouping real events , revising the decision of fate , substituting what he conceives to be more interest - ing motives for actual ones , most commonly , per - haps , imagining what he himself would have felt and done , or would have wished to feel and do , under circumstances in which he had observed others .

		But ever the tendency has been to restrain the vagaries of the imagination , and make the product more true to life more like biography .

		Whence , then , is the disposition to decry the his - torical novel ?

		Quite evidently , it seems to me , from a false conception of the function , or discourage - ment over the possible achievements , of history .

		It is due chiefly to this false conception that we were so long in learning that '' the bygone ages of the world were actually filled with living men , not by protocols , state papers , and abstractions of men . ''

		It was discouragement over the possibility of any other result that led Goethe to say : '' The times of the past are a book with seven seals ; and what we call the spirit of the times is at bottom the spirit of the writers , in which the times are reflected . ''

		But with the new conception of history which says , '' I consider nothing human out of my sphere , '' every novel becomes a human document , in a measure historical .

		It is not true that '' the historical novel occupies a position apart and separate from others . ''

		On the contrary , it merges by such imperceptible de - grees with other fields of the novel that in many cases no critical surveyor can stake it off .

		Some - tftnes , as in '' A Tale of Two Cities , '' there are neither personages nor events which are to be met in or - dinary narrative history ; only the background , the atmosphere , the spirit of the time , are historical .

		Again , as in
Erckmann-Chatrian	ORGANIZATION	's `` Conscript of
1813	DATE	'' and ''
Waterloo	LOCATION	, '' the events , many of them , are of world-wide importance , while the characters ae all to fame unknown .

		More commonly as in '' Waverley , ''
Hauff	PERSON	's ''
Lichtenstein	PERSON	, ''
Freytag	PERSON	's ''
Marcus Konig	PERSON	, '' '' Romola , '' or ''
Ben Hur	PERSON	, '' the time is partly fixed by events and surroundings , but more by some historical personage who towers like a mountain in the more or less remote background , while the actors who fill the foreground are as in the previous case obscure .

		Yet again , some or all of the leading characters , as well as some of the ele - ments of the plot , may be the property of familiar history ; such are ''
Kenilworth	LOCATION	, '' '' Hypatia , '' Ham - merling 's ''
Aspasia	PERSON	, ''
Dahn	PERSON	's ''
Ein Kampf	PERSON	urn Rom . ''

		It is with historical novels of this last type that critics are most apt to lose patience .

		If the ficti - tious events and persons introduced in connection with the familiar ones are of any significance we 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, are sure to get an impression of improbability .

		We ask , How does it come that we have never heard of these events and persons before ?

		Then the critical scent for anachronisms is aroused : we discover printed books in the tenth century , and lightning - rods in the seventeenth ; we find the furniture of classic
Greece	LOCATION	introduced into
Christian Rome	PERSON	, and the instruments of
Judea	LOCATION	jangling in the halls of mediaeval
Germany	LOCATION	.

		As Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	says : '' So soon as a man deals with events that have actually taken place , he is bounded on all sides by a multi - tude of details with which he must be acquainted and from which he can not escape . ''

		Plainly , the wisdom to be derived from this is that known per - sons and events are to be avoided by the novelist , or to be used only as background .

		But it does not at all follow that the historical novel is thereby con - demned .

		What is the harm in laying a story in proximity to some place , event , or person , whose presence gives a sense of assurance and confidence ?

		The principle is the reverse of that of a cyclorama , where a few logs and stones , an overturned cannon , and a stuffed and blood-stained uniform in the fore - ground , help out the perspective of the painting on the wall .

		Only , here the realistic touches make tol - erable some very indifferent fresco-painting ; while with the author the historical background enables him to concentrate his powers on other points .

		Everyone knows how much more interest a lis - tener takes in a story that is laid in a scene famil - ' iar to him .

		For this reason , professional story - tellers whose consciences permit always represent the events of their narratives as having happened in their presence , or at least as having been told them by one of the actual participants .

		Not wide - eyed childhood alone exclaims to Dame Saga : '' Tu I ` as vit , grand ' mere ? ''

		Finally , an especial challenge to the creative fac - ulty comes from the tomb .

		By as much as it is more * difficult to bring the dead back to life than to plant or beget for the coming race , by so much is the temp - tation greater to try to make , even in the imagina - tion , '' dead things relive of long ago . ''

		But the task of making men of the past seem real is not by any means so difficult as that of making dead men live .

		In this respect the historical novel is subject to the same difficulties and limitations as the novel in general .

		The truth is that all of the antipodal differences of opinion in regard to the field , function , and pos - sibility of the historical novel are based upon two impressions or prejudices which underlie the critic 's views of human nature .

		One of these assumptions is that men in all times and all climes are essen - tially alike ; the other , that each country as well as each age produces its distinct variety of man .

		It is this latter assumption which leads Mr.
Howells	PERSON	to object to characters in an historical novel , be - cause `` the people affect me like persons of our generation made up for the parts , '' and to assign the region of historical romance to '' readers and writers who can not bear to be brought face to face with human nature . ''

		Yet there is no more arguing over the matter than over optimism and pessimism .

		These tinctures are the result of a man 's food , like the proportion of red corpuscles in his blood .

		As a rule , the cosmopolitan learns that men are about alike the world over ; while the provincial on his first visit to the metropolis of his own state fancies all men he sees to be selfish and cold , and feels him - self an alien among his countrymen .

		If we regard the men of the past as of like parts and passions with ourselves , we shall not take of - fense if we find in a picture of the past the '' univer - sal human elements which are found in every time , the permanent in the transitory . ''

		If it is true , as
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	declares , that
Scott	PERSON	's novels are '' rapidly converting themselves into mere debris of plaster of
Paris	LOCATION	, '' it must be that he put his '' me - diaeval upholstery '' too much in the foreground and drew too little from the human nature that he knew .

		The novel is a kind of history , as the common origin of '' story '' and `` history '' in itself hints ; and such dicta as that of
Palgrave	LOCATION	, that historical novels are '' the most harmful of all semi-poetic hy - brids , without profit for the artistic sense and ruin - ous to the historic sense , '' are based on obsolete pre - sumptions regarding history or inadequate estimates of the importance of the novel .

		There is no con - flict between the two forms of literature .

		In some respects they seek the same ends .

		If it be under - stood that the novel makes no pretension to accu - racy of date , document , details of diplomacy or events , but confines itself to life in general , to mak - ing the past seem real and the men of the past mem - bers of our common family , then it will fulfil one of the functions of history in which history most easily fails , while at the same time insisting upon all life , and not simply the life of the present , as its '' **
WILLIAM HERBERT CARRUTH	PERSON	.

		FICTION - READING IN THE COUNTRY .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	says that any reading fit to be called reading should be an absorbing and voluptuous process ; and he bemoans the fact that this engrossing interest passes away with the youth of the individual .

		Miss Repplier joins the wail , and extends the loss of ardor in reading from the individual to the age .

		She finds that even the children now fail to be carried out of themselves by romance and fairy tales .

		This satiety she attributes to the flooding of their minds with weak and supposedly harmless children 's books , and she strongly advocates giving them such meat of literature as
Marjorie Fleming	PERSON	fed upon .

		This change in the power of fiction may be true in regard to the people of the cities , whose lives are crowded with a variety of interests , and whose desire for change and new experience is constantly gratified .

		They live more in realities than in imagination , and ideal heroes seldom wield the mighty influence of a vital character whom the reader loves or hates .

		The case is far different in the country , however , where books are few , time is long , and distracting events
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL ll are rare .

		When a new book comes to a household the highest evidence of noble generosity consists in letting others have it first .

		Among the children , when this un - selfish spirit does not exist , the new story will cause un - limited dissension .


Walter Scott	PERSON	was not the only boy whom the dinner-bell could not draw from his unfin - ished story .

		I know a set of volumes of
Scott	PERSON	's own , calf-bound but tattered through much use , which have rendered a number of boys and girls , for the time of reading , unconscious of hunger , heat , or cold .

		Neither pangs of conscience for work neglected , nor anticipa - tions of coming reproof , could break or even mar the charm of the romance .

		It was a country girl who , having exhausted the oil in her lamp , and fearing she would be sent to bed if she sought another , finished her book by the flickering and interrupted light of a box of matches , lit one by one .

		Nor is it only boys and girls of whom this state of affairs is true ; hard-working , white-haired men and women , if they read at all , do it with an intensity of in - terest amounting to intemperance .

		I once heard a prac - tical busy mother decline a book offered her by a neigh - bor , saying , '' No , I must ` nt take it ; I am as fond of my children as the next one , but novels almost make me hate them when they wont give me a chance to read . ''

		To lend one 's books is held to be the most neighborly act of kindness , and not to do so an evidence of the most unforgivable meanness .

		The same books are usu - ally read by all the families of the community , and the characters and incidents in the story become a general conversational fund .

		They are not valued as a means for keeping the social ball rolling , but are of vital in - terest in themselves .

		The men and women of real life are measured by the characters in fiction ; and , indeed , theories of life are largely influenced by the fiction read in the neighborhood .

		Two young men in the neighborhood that I have in mind were ploughing in adjacent fields , and chanced to reach the end of their furrows at the same time , with only the fence between them .

		After the exchange of greetings , the hero of the novel last read became the subject of remark as naturally as the last man talked with would have been to men of the city stopping for a chat .

		Not minutes , but hours , these two young ploughmen sat on a rail fence talking over the good and the bad , the sad and the humorous elements of the book .

		The characters and episodes existed in their imagination with all the reality of actual life .

		When they returned to their work they made up for their neglect by trudging many a weary mile after the usual hour for stopping came , but they did not consider that time lost which was spent in fellowship with their ficti - tious friends .

		A writer may be read by city people because it is the thing to do , or for critical purposes ; but country read - ers are his real test of power to move the human heart .

		They have no motive for reading other than interest , and no standard of criticism besides individual taste .

		They are generous in their liking , and frank in declar - ing a book worthless or vicious , regardless as to whether the author 's name is well known or not .

		Undoubtedly , the indebtedness of country people to fiction for supplying needed variety and excitement to minds otherwise satiated with uneventful monotony , is very great ; but that of the author is fully as great to the people who give his creations the most ardent re - ception .

		It is in the country that
Dickens	PERSON	calls forth the most spontaneous laughter and tears , that
Scott	PERSON	arouses thrills of enthusiasm for chivalry and adven - ture , that
George Eliot	PERSON	's most earnest teaching finds its deepest influence , that Kipling and
Stevenson	PERSON	meet the most genuine wonder , and that
Howells	PERSON	's portraits of human nature are the most absorbing studies .

		JAMES
DYKES CAMPBELL	PERSON	.


James Dykes Campbell	PERSON	, born
November 2 , 1838	DATE	, died at
Tunbridge Wells	PERSON	on the first of
June , 1895	DATE	.

		To the general reader , his name means little ; but to the student of English literature he was known as the first of authorities on
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, as well as on the whole period of which that poet was a chief ornament .

		His '' Life of Coleridge '' is so much the best biography of its subject that all others count for nothing in the com - parison .

		The same high praise must be given to his annotated edition of the '' Poems . ''

		We select a few passages from the tributes evoked by his death .

		Mr.
Arthur Symons	PERSON	writes : '' Few men so widely and so profoundly gifted have ever subordinated themselves so completely to the most thankless of literary duties , and to the helpfulness of a disinterested literary conscience .

		Never professing to be a scholar , he gave his life to the drudgery of a minute , and for the most part unrecog - nized , literary scholarship .

		He desired no fame , sought for no rewards , allowed himself no privileges but the passionate satisfaction of an absolute exactitude .

		Peo - ple who wrote books on any of the subjects in which he took especial interest came to him with their proof - sheets , and he re-wrote their books for them .

		No name is so frequently referred to with gratitude at the end of prefaces , but few are aware how much is meant by these acknowledgements of help received .

		He was Quixotic in his disinterestedness ; and as truly as it may be said that he devoted his life to an ideal of scholar - ship , so truly may it be said that he devoted his life to an ideal of friendship . ''


Canon Ainger	ORGANIZATION	has this to say of the `` Life '' : `` It is but little to say that it is t `` he best life of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	yet written .

		It is far more than this .

		It aimed for the first time at estimating a character of extraordinary complexity , of exceptional strength and exceptional weakness , with its high ambitions and its piteous fail - ures a task that might well baffle the profoundest stu - dent of hnman nature .

		His treatment of his subject formed no doubtful clue to the native goodness of heart and generosity of
Dykes Campbell	ORGANIZATION	.

		The plea for a kindly judgment of the character of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	, as summed up in the final words of the biography , is not only one of the most eloquent and pathetic pieces of criticism given to the world in our generation , but will live in the hearts of all who knew the writer as a sure * index of the gentle and truth-loving nature that has been so early removed from among them . ''

		And Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	makes these observations about the quality of his work : '' Never was a book writ - ten which afforded the writer greater pleasure .

		For the production of such books we want more such men .

		There is no money to be got from them .

		Their com - mercial value is little indeed compared with the time , and the labor , and the cost of producing them .

		Few men , therefore , can afford to engage upon such books .

		But the reward is great to those who can and will afford the unpaid labor . ''

THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 1	DATE	, A CONGRESSMAN 'S RECOLLECTIONS OF WAR TIMES .

		* The close of our Civil War has been fol - lowed by a dispensation of political and mili - tary reminiscences .

		These have been abun - dantly served up in biographies and autobiog - raphies , in magazines and newspapers , and in popular lectures .

		Ex-Congressman Riddle , in the preface to his volume of '' Recollections of War Times , '' says : '' The war its policies , incidents , and men its struggles , sufferings , and losses its horrors , adventures , and tri - umphs has been written up , dwelt upon , dis - cussed , and talked over , in public and private , till he is a brave or a reckless man who ven - tures now to challenge public attention to any - thing further he may have to offer on that topic . ''

		He thinks , however , that a history of the Thirty - seventh and Thirty - -LSB- eighth Con - gresses and their legislation , especially of the Thirty-seventh , is called for ; and says '' he has long meditated something like a memoir , which he finally submits , not without misgiving . ''

		Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	has not overstated the difficul - ties of his task , and his complete success in performing it would evidently have been a sur - prise to himself .

		As a history , his work lacks unity and coherence .

		It is too scrappy and miscellaneous .

		Of the forty - seven chapters into which his three hundred and forty-three pages are divided , several might properly have been omitted as trivial or unimportant .

		Others deal with matters which scarcely belong to the story of the war , such as the detailed account , given in Chapter Fifteen , of two contested elec - tion cases , including copious extracts from the speeches of members upon legal points of no present interest ; and Chapter Twenty-nine , in which the subject of ship canals is introduced , and a clever speech of Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	on the sub - ject , which he had leave to print , is given in full .

		In dealing with military affairs he correctly states the strength and disposition of our forces at different times during the war , and shows himself to have been an interested student of army movements .

		He deals with the financial policy of the government more fully , giving liberal extracts from the debates in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	on the subject , including a speech of his own , * RECOLLECTIONS OF WAR TIMES .

		Reminiscences of Men and Events in
Washington	LOCATION	, 1860-1865 .

		By
Albert Gallatin Riddle	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	' e Sons .

		which does him credit , at a time when so many of his Congressional associates were lost in the fog .

		This subject , however , has been far more fully dealt with in other publications , and no new views are given .

		Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	quotes from the debates in the
House	ORGANIZATION	in
January	DATE	and Feb - ruary ,
1862	DATE	, on the slavery question , and a very radical speech of his own is given , on a propo - sition offered by Mr.
Lovejoy	PERSON	for the prohibi - tion of slavery in all places within the juris - diction of the national government .

		A little later , the bill for the abolition of slavery in the
District of Columbia	LOCATION	gave rise to a more gen - eral and thorough discussion of the question in both houses , and Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	gives copious extracts from the debates in the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	and his own speech on the question when the bill reached the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the whole subject has received such manifold treatment in our anti- slavery literature since the war that his frag - mentary chapters relating to it can scarcely be regarded as responsive to any popular demand .

		The real interest of the book will be found in its personal reminiscences .

		It abounds in incidents , and these are set forth with anima - tion .

		Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	sees vividly , and he knows how to depict what he sees .

		His description of
Washington	LOCATION	before the war is singularly graphic , and will be especially entertaining to those who are familiar with the beautiful and queenly city of to-day . ''

		It was then as unattractive , straggling , sodden a town , wandering iip and down the left bank of the yellow
Potomac	LOCATION	, as the fancy can sketch .


Pennsylvania	LOCATION	avenue , twelve rods wide , stretched drearily over the mile between the unfinished Capitol and the unfinished
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	building on Fifteenth street , west , where it turned north for a square , and took its melancholy way to
Georgetown	LOCATION	, across the really once very beautiful
Rock Creek	ORGANIZATION	.

		Illy paved with cobblestones , it was the only paved street of the town .

		The other streets , which were long stretches of mud or deserts of dust and sand , with here and there clumps of poorly built residences with long gaps between them , passing little deserts of open lands , where their lines were lost , wandered from the highlands north towards the
Potomac	LOCATION	, and from the eastern branch -LRB-
Anacosta	LOCATION	-RRB- to
Rock Creek	ORGANIZATION	.

		Not a sewer blessed the town , nor off of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	avenue was there a paved gutter .

		Each house had an open drain from its rear out across the sidewalk .

		As may be sup - posed , the capital of the Republic had more mal-odors than the poet
Coleridge	PERSON	ascribed to ancient
Cologne	LOCATION	.

		There was then the open canal , or branch of the
Chesa	PERSON	- peake and
Ohio	LOCATION	, from
Rock Creek	ORGANIZATION	to
Anacosta	LOCATION	, breed - ing malaria , tadpoles , and mosquitoes .

		The Tiber of to-day , ancient '
Goose Creek	PERSON	, ' stagnated from the high - lauds , through the Botanic Gardens , and Slush Run overflowed the northwest wastes of the swampy city plat . ''

		Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	gives a vivid account of his ex -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 13 perience at the first battle of Bull Run , which he visited with several other civilians , and of the panic which took complete possession of our troops .

		In a letter to his wife he gave a free off-hand sketch of the affair as it came within his personal observation ; and this let - ter , falling into the hands of his political ene - mies , had the effect of suddenly bringing to an end his Congressional career .

		It was badly garbled and misrepresented , and afterwards became so complicated with the patronage of the district and the malignity of his foes that his friends thought his life was in danger .

		He was burned in effigy , and the popular madness became quite irresistible .

		He quietly accepted the inevitable , but kept up his active interest in public affairs during the war , while resum - ing his professional labors .

		Referring to his retirement , in the thirty-first chapter , Mr.
Rid	PERSON	- dle gives this estimate of Congressional life : '' I had at least escaped the personal injury of long service in the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		No man has ever served through three Congresses and returned healthfully to take up his old life and pursuits .

		No matter how innocent and regular may be a man 's life and habits in
Washington	LOCATION	, his mind does not escape the kind of dissipation that in a way unfits it for the ordinary pursuits of life .

		If his career has been passably successful , he has a scrap - book filled with newspaper laudations and criticism , twenty or forty volumes of the
Globe	ORGANIZATION	, innumerable pub - lic documents , and a general disgust and unfitness for ordinary useful avocation .

		His profession is gone , his wife is dwarfed by years of neglect , his children are strangers , and he comes to loathe the '' Honorable '' that men prefix to his name , the only emolument he has acquired save personal and political animosities and alienated friends . ''

		This is one side only , and the dark side , of the picture .

		Legislative experience can only be had by a continuous service , and the exam - ple of such men as
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	and
Joshua R. Giddings	PERSON	shows that political fame and great public usefulness are sometimes its ripe fruit .

		It also sometimes happens that a man 's professional life is successfully resumed after an honorable service in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		This must depend upon the man himself ; nor is there any necessity for neglecting his wife or making strangers of his children .

		If these things hap - pen it is not the long service but the moral qualities of the official which account for them .

		Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	's view is too doleful .

		Our national legislation affords opportunities for great use - fulness and honor , and the patriotic ardor of our young men should be animated by courage and faith rather than chilled by despair .

		Even the interests of home and family are sometimes to be subordinated to the paramount claims of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the best things in Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	's book is his picture of
McClellan	PERSON	on his first arrival in
Washington	LOCATION	and in the day of his glory . ''


McClellan	PERSON	's coming to the capital was like the ad - vent of a beneficent prince .

		We awoke one morning to find the streets , the city , serenely free of the wander - ing gangs of brass and blue .

		They had all disappeared in a night .

		In his presence order and quietude at once found themselves everywhere established .

		As by a potent magic , obedience , discipline , neatness , and the air military , ruled the camps to which the soldiers were confined ; the awkward citizen began to assume the bearing of a soldier , preparing to take his place in the finely wrought mechanism of the company , regiment , brigade , division , and army corps .

		Never had we a superior organizer , with the skill to turn out the com - pleted regiment .

		Had his enterprise , his dash , his elan , and his tactics in the field , equalled his art as a con - structor and artificer of soldiers , his genius would have approached some of the renowned commanders of his - tory .

		Coming as he did to the President 's aid to relieve him of the chaos of his capital , no wonder he won his heart and confidence .

		Simple and modest then , he adopted no style , no full dress , plumes , and bullion , no glittering staff and parade at the first not even a shoulder-strap .

		We saw him on the avenue , a simple soldier , without any mark or insignia alone , hurrying on , few knowing his person . ''

		Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	is not less graphic in other per - sonal descriptions .

		In referring to
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	, he says : ''
Stevens	PERSON	was not an economist , and by temper not a leader , but a driver bitter , quick as electricity , with a sarcastic , blasting wit .

		He most frequently answered an honest inquirer for information with a dash of vit - riol in the face .

		Short as he stood , with his large head covered with a long-haired wig ; broad-shouldered , he usually was standing when he discharged his burning , gall-tipped shafts , which he jerked out in an unpleasant voice , and immediately limped off on his short , club - footed leg . ''

		Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	was warmly attached to
Lincoln	LOCATION	, though he sometimes criticised his policy , as did a large majority of members of both Houses .

		In speaking of his first inaugural address , he says : '' Never was there a more persuasive speaker .

		His quaint logic , and taking , unaccustomed ways , were ab - solutely irresistible .

		His vocabulary was limited ; he used mainly the simple words one learns in childhood , which are always the most serviceable , and which ar - range themselves easily , delivering their burden of thought with certainty and force to the minds to which they are addressed .

		Perhaps there was never a more immediately effective address delivered to men than this quaint , masterly performance , an impression only deep - ened by after-study and reflection .

		It was in many respects the greatest service to his country of any single labor of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's .

		As a forensic effort it was as effective as that delivered at the
Gettysburg	LOCATION	that was to be . ''

		In referring to the question of Reconstruc - tion , our author says : '' So entirely had Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	won the heart and soul 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, of the masses , that the common mind accepted his de - cision as right in all cases , beyond criticism or cavil .

		One of the gravest of all the problems springing from secession was the reconstruction of the Republic .

		Un - questionably the President was wrong both as to the depository of the power and the best method of recon - struction .

		Yet we have seen that the people stood as one with him , and denounced the before-ever-trusted Wade ;
Ohio	LOCATION	repudiated him , and the brilliant Winter
Davis	PERSON	had to leave
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		What would have been the result had Lincoln lived ? ''

		Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	speaks kindly of the old anti- slavery leaders , with the single exception of
Charles Sumner	PERSON	; and his inexcusable fling at him can harm nobody but Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	himself .

		He also does injustice to Sumner in according to Seward the great honor of averting the peril of a war with
England	LOCATION	in the Trent affair , when the fact is that
Seward	PERSON	blundered , and
Sumner	PERSON	came to the rescue by placing the sur - render of
Mason	ORGANIZATION	and
Slidell	LOCATION	on the only ground which could have pacified
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Riddle	PERSON	's admiration for Secretary
Stan	PERSON	- ton was absolutely unbounded , and perhaps the finest thing in the book is his address before the
Washington	LOCATION	Bar , on the 3d of
January , 1870	DATE	, in commemoration of
Stanton	PERSON	's death , which is printed in the Appendix .

		The tribute is as beautiful as it is just .

		with
Piazzi Smyth	PERSON	's mysticism about the Great Pyramid , or Mr.
Donnelly	PERSON	's cryptogramic ex - posure of the impostor Shakespeare .

		In
1869	DATE	, the recent discovery of six letters of
Defoe	PERSON	in the
State Paper Office	ORGANIZATION	was the occasion of Wil -
liam Lee	PERSON	's elaborate three-volume work , '' The Life and Newly Discovered Writings of
Daniel Defoe	PERSON	. ''

		In
1879	DATE	, Mr.
William Minto	PERSON	con - tributed to the '' English Men of Letters '' series a compact and well-proportioned memoir of
Defoe	PERSON	.

		And now comes Mr.
Thomas Wrisrht	PERSON	, O * the principal of the
Cowper School	ORGANIZATION	at
Olney	LOCATION	, and offers , in the substantial octavo before us , a new '' Life of
Daniel Defoe	PERSON	. ''

		The raison c ? '

		etre of the book may be found , first , in the author 's belief that `` with the person - ality of no eminent man of letters of the seven - teenth and eighteenth centuries is the public less familiar than with that of
Daniel Defoe	PERSON	'' ; second , in his desire '' to paint the man
Daniel Defoe	PERSON	'' ; third , in his theory that ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' was in all respects a carefully-worked - out allegory of
Defoe	ORGANIZATION	's own life ; fourth , in his wish to bring out the fact that ''
Defoe	PERSON	was above all things that it was his endeavor to be above all things the man of God . ''

		To establish these theses , and at the same time to write an unwarped and straightforward biog - raphy of his hero , was certainly a task which made complex demands on the controversial and narrative powers of the writer .

		We can not say that Mr.
Wright	PERSON	has alto - gether happily discharged what has evidently been to him a labor of love .

		The mystery which
Daniel Defoe	PERSON	liked to throw around his private life has baffled the acutest and most patient of his biographers ; and will not yield to persistence at
this late day	TIME	.

		The parallel - ism between
Defoe	PERSON	and Crusoe may be conceded to this extent : that
Defoe	PERSON	, like his hero , lived for many years alone in his island , led '' a life of wonders , in continual storms , fought with the worst kind of savages and man-eaters , by unaccountable surprizing incidents ; fed by miracles greater than that of ravens ; suffered all manner of violences and oppressions , in - jurious reproaches , contempt by men , attacks of devils , corrections from heaven , and opposi - tions on earth . ''

		His long life of more than seventy years was passed in a whirl of contro - versy , denunciation of abuses , advocacy of re - forms far in advance of his generation , social and religious advice to parents , children , and servants ; and all the time , like a true journal - ist , he kept his private life perdu .

		He had no
Boswell	PERSON	, nor even a
Friday	DATE	, to share his hopes
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 and opinions .

		From his own family he seems to have held himself often aloof : in all his volumi - nous writings there is scarce a reference to his brothers or his wife .

		It was not to be expected that much new light could be thrown on such a life as this ; and Mr.
Wright	PERSON	has hardly ful - filled the large promise of his preface .

		The business failures of
Defoe	PERSON	, his frequent disap - pearances and reappearances , the publicity of the pillory , and the seclusion of
Newgate	ORGANIZATION	, are all scrutinized with eager care ; but the net result is disappointing .

		Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's style leaves much to be de - sired .

		In his preface , he airily characterizes the works of his predecessors
Chalmers	PERSON	,
Wil	PERSON	- son ,
Chadwick	PERSON	, and Lee as '' valuable works , all of them , but as dry as the very Sahara . ''

		With a laudable desire to avoid this aridity for his book , he has plentifully ornamented his pages with strange and uncanny flowers of speech , and evinces an almost nervous fear of seeming dignified or serious , which is very vex - atious to judicious readers .

		De Quincey loved to masquerade in slang , and defaced with it his best critical work ; and Mr.
Wright	PERSON	should have taken warning from so conspicuous an example .

		Much was forgiven to the Opium - eater , for various reasons , a lenity which other writers can hardly claim .

		Nobody but a pro- fessed humorist could expect indulgence for such colloquialisms as '' the inquirer finds him - self in clover '' -LRB- p. 3 -RRB- , '' a rare tussle '' -LRB- p. 12 -RRB- , u would puzzle a Dutchman '' -LRB- p. 38 -RRB- , '' what on earth use '' -LRB- p. 85 -RRB- , '' that in all conscience was delicious enough , but now comes the coat - ing of almonds '' -LRB- p. 133 -RRB- , `` while they were swearing blue murder , he was either as cool as a cucumber or as merry as a grig '' -LRB- p. 226 -RRB- , '' riled them '' -LRB- ibid . -RRB-

		.

		It is not thus that per - manent literature is made .

		The types have gone wrong on pages 42 , 79 , 149 , 188 , 254 ; and there are one or two oddities like '' vitu - perised '' -LRB- p. 227 -RRB- .

		The book is handsomely printed and fully illustrated .

		All the famous portraits of
Defoe	PERSON	are reproduced ; and the im - agination is stirred by f ac-simile reprints of the frontispiece and title-page of the first editions of ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	, '' ''
Roxana	PERSON	, '' and ''
Jack Sheppard	PERSON	. ''

		There is an appropriate dedica - tion to Mr.
Aitken	PERSON	, a series of four appendices , a complete chronological list of the 254 writ - ings of Defoe given by Mr.
Lee	PERSON	-LRB- with two alter - ations -RRB- , and a good index .

		On the whole , Mr.
Wright	PERSON	has given us an entertaining narrative , and established one or two new facts ; but his book , with its hobbies and its strained air of vivacity , will scarcely displace the more digni - fied work of Mr.
Lee	PERSON	or the memoir by Mr.
Minto	PERSON	.

		Defoe , to our mind , remains very much of a riddle .

		The estimates of his character have ranged all the way from calling him an arch-liar and the prince of spies and turn-coats , to Mr.
Wright	PERSON	's '' the man of God . ''

		We turn away perplexed , and can only be sure that in him the elements were mixed .

		Yet , like that other noble nature , he was , we believe , '' a man more sinn 'd against than sinning '' ; and if we must formulate a sentence , we will fall back on
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's summing-up of the great Tory Doctor , who was , like
Defoe	PERSON	, buffeted by for - tune for many busy , weary years ; and will pro- nounce him '' both a great and a good man . ''

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	probably considered
Defoe	PERSON	the man a '' sad dog of a Whig '' ; but for the author of '' The Life and Strange Surprizing Adven - tures of Robinson Crusoe '' he reserved his choicest praise , bracketing that classic with '' The Pilgrim 's Progress '' and ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	'' as the only three books which their readers would wish longer .

		Generations of children of all ages have confessed its unique charm , have struggled through the surf with the hero , have peered horror-stricken over his shoulders at the gleaming eyes in the cave , and have shared that thrill which ran up and down his spine when '' it happened one day , about noon , going towards my boat , I was exceedingly sur - prized with the print of a man 's naked foot on the shore , which was very plain to be seen in the sand . ''

		Mr.
George A. Aitken	PERSON	has long been known as a close and sympathetic student of
Defoe	LOCATION	; and his name as the editor of a new edition of the '' Romances and Narratives '' will command popular interest in advance .

		Of the sixteen volumes that will comprise the series , the first three are given to the Crusoe tales , '' Adventures , '' '' Farther Adventures , '' and '' Serious Reflections . ''

		Of these it may be said that the '' Farther Adventures '' and the ''
Seri	PERSON	- ous Reflections '' fairly deserve the neglect which they share with the later cantos of '' The Faerie Queene . ''

		When
Crusoe	ORGANIZATION	's island was peopled , the charm was broken ; and after drawing the inevitable long breath , we begin to yawn and turn the pages listlessly .

		We are fascinated by the isolation , the make-shifts , the homely de - tail , even the iteration and amorphous style of the autobiographic hermit ; but we are only bored when the curtain falls on his loneliness , and rises on commonplace dealings with other men and women .

		But Mr.
Aitken	PERSON	has , of course , felt the necessity of giving his author in com -
16	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, plete form ; and we must admire the dainty setting which he and his publishers have given to the classic .

		The little volumes are exquis - itely printed and bound , and chastely , though not lavishly , illustrated by Mr.
Yeats	PERSON	.

		The frontispiece of the first volume is an etched re - production of the '' looking-over-shoulder '' por - trait of
Defoe	PERSON	, prefixed to the first edition of `` The True-born Englishman . ''

		An attractive feature is the printing of
Defoe	ORGANIZATION	's coat-of-arms , with its motto `` Laudatur et alget '' on the sec - ond page of the cover , to serve as a book-plate for the purchaser .

		Mr.
Aitken	PERSON	contributes an admirable general introduction , which in our judgment is simply the most satisfactory short memoir of Defoe that we have seen : it neither shirks , excuses , nor abuses .

		The American Book Company is doing a good educational work in its '' Eclectic English Classics '' series ; and in selecting '' The His - tory of the Plague '' to represent
Defoe	PERSON	, it has made an excellent choice .

		Of all the prolific
Daniel	PERSON	's two hundred and fifty-odd works , none better exhibits his most striking features of style .

		The minute detail , the irresistible veri - similitude , the awful realism , are all there , and almost persuade us that he saw all that he de - scribes , in spite of our knowledge that he was a boy though a precocious one of five , when the pestilence was raging .

		The introductory sketch is so distinctly unfavorable in its esti - mate of
Defoe	ORGANIZATION	's character and literary merit , as to give pupils a very incorrect idea of his rank in literature .

		If he was only the shrewd , unscrupulous journalist that this editor makes him out , it is difficult to see how a place could be found for him in the '' Eclectic English Classics . ''

		The introduction is well written , but seriously prejudices the reception of the masterpiece which follows it .

		birds ?

		can at last be answered with entire satis - faction .

		Hitherto , no one work could be named which would furnish the inquirer adequate in - formation in just the form desired .

		The ornith - ologies extant were too costly and bulky , or too limited or local in scope , to suit the popular need .

		Now , in response , it would appear , to a general demand , several treatises are simul - taneously produced which answer every require - ment of the beginner , either one serving as a complete and convenient guide to an introduc - tory acquaintance with our native birds .

		At their head , the '' Handbook of the Birds of
Eastern North America	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Frank M. Chapman	PERSON	, must be placed without reserve .

		It is a model work of its kind .

		In size , cost , and contents , it gives equal satisfaction .

		A very large amount of matter is packed into the mi - nutest compass .

		Not a word is wasted ; and , we might add , not a fact is omitted not an essential fact , at least , so carefully selected and condensed is the information afforded .

		The work begins with a few preliminary chapters in which the student is instructed in the proper methods of out-door observation and of collect - ing and preserving birds and nests and eggs .

		In the course of these directions much impor - tant and fresh knowledge is conveyed concern - ing the general habits of birds , their migrations , their economic value in relation to agriculture , their special nesting time , and their
summer	DATE	and winter haunts in varied localities .

		An original system of classification is next pro- vided , by which the novice may readily identify any bird in the fauna east of the Rocky moun - tains .

		The body of the book is given to brief biographies of the birds , including over five hundred , arranged in their respective orders and families .

		Here , as elsewhere , there is the utmost condensation consistent with clear and comprehensive description .

		Often the resources of Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's own richly-stocked note - books are drawn upon , and often he takes from the stores of other competent observers the ma - terial for a vivid and authentic portrait .


Noth	PERSON	- ing has been neglected in the structure of the work , and one can but applaud the masterly manner in which its scheme has been carried out .

		The series of plates and of figures inter - spersed through the text are of the highest artistic excellence , adding that touch of grace , that gleam of intelligence , which good illustra - tions always afford .

		Mrs.
Mabel Osgood Wright	PERSON	merits much praise for her generous efforts to excite an in - terest in the charming creatures privileged to
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 spend their lives just under the skies .

		A sec - ond volume from her hand , under the pretty title of '' Birdcraft , '' follows quite in the line of Mr.
Chapman	PERSON	's '' Handbook , '' but with less claim in its contents to scientific method and fulness of accurate detail .

		Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	writes more as an amateur , yet with a winning en - thusiasm and an impressive knowledge resting properly upon personal observation .

		She makes the most of a residence in an extensive garden which offers enticing haunts for a great variety of birds .

		With these continually under her eye , she has special advantages for original and gratifying studies .

		Think of twenty pairs of house wrens making their home round about one 's dwelling in a single season ; and four pairs of red-eyed vireos with a corresponding multitude of delightful songsters to keep them company !

		What a chorus of bird-music must roll out from every green nook and canopy ; what flashing of bird wings of every tinge of color ; and what revelations of delightful bird - mysteries must continually appeal to the intel - ligent observer !

		It is well that in such a bird paradise a bird-lover has the good fortune to abide .

		In Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	's book there is a sim - ple key to the birds , based upon their color , which will afford excellent help to the begin - ner in the identification of any male specimen in
spring	DATE	plumage .

		There are also colored plates of one hundred and twenty-eight of our common species .

		It is not to be expected that these should be perfect in tint , but they give a fair idea of the distinctive markings of each bird , and serve a better purpose than figures in pure black and white .

		The author 's attempts at rendering the songs of birds in the English vernacular is necessarily a failure .

		The birds may speak to us in a language we can perfectly understand , but no one of us can act as an in - terpreter for another .

		To each sympathetic ear their voices address a distinctive word that harmonizes with the mood and temperament .

		It will mean the same to no two persons .

		To reduce any bird-song to human speech is piti - lessly to vulgarize it . ''

		Songs without Words '' appeal to the imagination , and suggest thoughts boundless as infinity .

		In the brief sketch given to each of two hundred separate species , Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	has often a pleasing anecdote or comment to insert , which conies directly from her experience , and adds a new and valuable item to our accumulations in birdcraft .

		A welcome accession to the library of the ornithologist is the volume entitled '' The Birds ' Calendar , '' by Mr.
H. E. Parkhurst	PERSON	.

		It is a detailed account of the author 's study of wild bird-life during a single year , that of
1893	DATE	.

		The field chosen for his investigations was lim - ited almost exclusively to '' The Ramble '' in Cen - tral Park ,
New York	LOCATION	, a space covering about one-sixteenth of a square mile only , and includ - ing , with its bit of water , very little variety in the surface of the bush and wooded land .

		But within this restricted area , in the fragments of leisure left from more serious occupations , the observer was able to catch glimpses , and in some cases to make a considerable examination of the habits and characteristics , of over ninety differ - ent species of birds , in the course of the twelve - month .

		Beginning with
January	DATE	, the sterner period of the winter , Mr.
Parkhurst	PERSON	made frequent visits to the woods and by-paths of '' The Ramble , '' searching with keen and cau - tious movement for any flitting thing in feathers that might come within range of sound or sight .

		It was apparently the pastime of an amateur , but pursued in the true naturalist 's spirit , with diligent and patient exactitude .

		His aim was to collect facts and facts only , as many and se - lect as possible , and , noting them down without embellishment , to connect and interpret them clearly and intelligently .

		His narrative is ex - panded by additional matter gleaned from au - thoritative sources , and the result is a really fresh and useful contribution to the literature of American ornithology .

		The book will sur - prise many a reader by showing how much in - terest and animation birds lend to nature in even the baldest and dreariest season of the year .

		By its chronological order it performs an equal service in helping one to associate the various phenomena of bird life , migration , song , nesting , molting , and so on , with the un - folding panorama of the seasons .

		Though most painstaking and careful in his work , Mr.
Park	PERSON	- hurst has left a few trifling errors for future correction .

		There are three warblers , he will find , instead of one , which are to be met with during
winter	DATE	in our
Northern States	LOCATION	.

		The house wren , contrary to his statement on page 158 , is fully entitled to its familiar name , be - ing strongly inclined to nest in the vicinity of human dwellings ; while the
winter	DATE	wren con - fines itself to secluded places .

		Lastly , it must have happened to him , ere this writing , to hear the robin , the wren , the meadow lark , and many another ecstatic bird , sing on the ground , disproving his too hasty deduction that contact with the earth throws a mute spell over these delicious musicians . ''

		The Birds ' Calendar '' is illustrated with twenty-four full-page photo -
18	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, graphs of stuffed specimens , which , mounted by expert taxidermatists , simulate life as per - fectly perhaps as they can be made to do .

		Yet , looking at them , we are forced to quote Mr.
Parkhurst	PERSON	's own remark , that '' There is some - thing depressing , almost melancholy , in these dead and withered specimens , ... when one has seen their living joyous confreres in their native haunts . ''

		It is interesting to note how the fascinations of nature will take hold of the strongest and most cultivated minds .

		It is the sensitive and enthusiastic temperament , of course , which yields most quickly and completely to the beauty and wonder pervading our universe ; yet few are so stolid as not to confess their pow - erful charm when once it has touched the inner vision .

		Such thoughts occur on opening the collection of '' Summer Studies of Birds and Books , '' by Mr.
W. Warde Fowler	PERSON	.

		Here is a grave and serious Oxford man frankly rank - ing himself among the passionate lovers of '' His best of harmless beings , the marvellous creatures endowed with flight and song . ''

		He will make nothing of going to the remotest point in
Europe	LOCATION	to make the acquaintance of some rare species , to hear its unaccustomed melody or discover the secrets of its domestic life ; and nothing will so thrill his soul with delight as some new experience that can add to his already intimate knowledge of the birds of his continent .

		Genuine interest and affec - tion are captivating traits , and make a pleasant companion of almost anyone ; and such we find Mr.
Fowler	PERSON	, especially in his long and sug - gestive talk about the songs of birds , their origin , variety , exquisite finish , and mode of delivery ; and also in his lecture on the great work of Aristotle in the province of natural history , and his astonishingly wide and close observation of the birds of
Greece	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Fow	PERSON	- ler 's book is composed of lectures and papers which have grown out of his open-air studies in
England	LOCATION	,
Wales	LOCATION	, and
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and have had in many cases previous publication .

		All save one relate to the same subject , and that one is a feeling memoir of an old friend , a fa - vorite fox-terrier whose noble traits earned the lasting regard of his master . ''

		The Pocket Guide to the Common Land Birds of
New England	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
M. A. Will	PERSON	- cox , has decided virtues to commend it .

		First , its portable proportions , exactly fitted to the pocket ; next , its agreeable style and simple con - struction ; and lastly , its trustworthiness .

		It does not pretend to do more than introduce the reader to our common birds , and this it hap - pily accomplishes with respect to eighty-seven species no inconsiderable number .

		After one has profited by all the little volume has to give , there will be a really large amount of knowl - edge acquired , and the best preparation made for more advanced treatises .

		It is an admir - able book to put in the hands of the young , being quite within their grasp , and replete with judicious and attractive information .

		An in - genious Key , founded upon color , as in Mrs.
Wright	PERSON	's volume , enables the student at the outset to name his bird .

		This is supplemented by a series of short and well - written biographies , to which are appended , in many cases , refer - ences to books and periodicals in which a more complete description of the bird may be found .

		During hi & service as professor of zoology at
Vassar College	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Willcox	PERSON	has gained a skill in teaching which enables him to present his subject in an unusually plain , succinct , and yet rounded manner .

		THE DIAL 19 to us to have been a fortunate one , for , after all , Arcopia and La Trinite '' are regions whereof anyone may write more or less intelligently ; whereas
Chi	PERSON	- cago has been heretofore the most virgin of literary soil .

		Moreover , in taking for his theme the tumult - uous and strident civilization of the great Lake - side
City	LOCATION	, Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	has planted himself upon the solid ground of reality .

		To every writer of fiction there comes the urgent appeal of '' the here and the now '' for artistic expression ; and to neglect this appeal for sake of the romantic charm attaching to the remote must be , for all the vagueness of outline and iridescent coloring of '' far-off things , '' rather a confession of weakness than a sign of strength .

		Besides , we can not escape the impression , warranted as it seems to be by `` The Cliff Dwellers '' and `` With the Procession , '' that their author has decided to reculer pour mieux sauter , which is nearly always a wise thing to do .

		That he will '' go far '' upon his new path is not an improbable prediction , in view of the distinct advance indicated by the second novel in comparison with the first . ''

		With the Procession '' exhibits , with what may fairly be called an extra - ordinary talent , the life of the city in which the ac - tion is placed not the external life as the painter would view it so much as the inner life , the ambi - tions and the ideals , the sympathies and the points of view , the crudities and the maladjustments , pro- ducing so bizarre an impression upon the objective spectator , who perceives dimly that some sort of a distinctive civic type is struggling to emerge from the chaotic mass , but who can not for the life of him prefigure the type .

		Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	, certainly , has not prefigured it , but he has viewed the seething pro- cess of development with a degree of insight that no other novelist has brought to the task , and felic - ities of acute observation confront us from every page of the book .

		There is certainly an over-insist - ence upon detail now and then , and it is equally certain that there exist other and more agreeable sorts of Chicagoans than those here delineated .

		But then , there were other sorts of Londoners than those to whom
Dickens	PERSON	and even Thackeray introduced us , which does not make our gratitude toward those novelists any the less .

		It is only a ludicrous hy - persensitiveness that could blame Mr.
Fuller	PERSON	for having made his own selection of characters .

		Those whom he has chosen to present to us offer enough variety to make interesting the story of their rela - tions , and every one of them is portrayed with truth - fulness and sincerity .

		The galled jade may wince at some of the episodes , but the withers of the thought - ful Chicagoan , who knows well enough that his city has the defects of its qualities , will remain unwrung . ''

		The Story of
Christine Rochefort	PERSON	'' is pleasing and in good taste , but it may hardly be called strong .

		In characterization it is very unsatisfactory , for none of the people who figure in its pages are in any real sense alive .

		It deals with French life in the provincial town of
Blois	LOCATION	; and labor troubles , as they present themselves to the French manufacturer , are its chief theme .

		Mrs. Prince 's envisagement of the problem of socialism is not open to serious criticism , and her standpoint is that of sobriety ; but she decidedly oversteps the line between fiction - writing and economic discussion when she repro - duces almost in full the speeches made at the labor - meeting which has so determining an influence upon the fortunes of her leading characters .

		The Treasure of the Incas has fired the imag - ination of many a romancer before now , and we are not surprised to find it once more pressed into service .

		But it is a little astonishing to discover in the latest poacher upon the preserves of Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	and the rest no less incongruous a person than Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	.

		In penning '' The Adventures of Captain Horn '' the author has indeed , as the adver - tisements say , written in '' a new vein . ''

		The essen - tial whimsicality of his work , whatever his theme , certainly gives piquancy to the tale , and goes far to justify the use of his extremely threadbare mate - rial .

		The Rackbirds alone are worth reading the book for , to say nothing of the estimable Mrs.
Cliff	PERSON	and her
California	LOCATION	!!

		blankets .

		The story of the finding of the treasure , and of its removal , would be more thrilling if we did not feel all the time that the narrator is laughing in his sleeve .

		But the in - genuity of invention displayed , and the frequent re - currence of the unexpected , keep the reader 's atten - tion alert , and carry him safely through a concatena - tion of episodes which , if taken too seriously , would probably be found merely dull .

		The unregenerate reader of adventure-crammed romance , however , does not enjoy the suspicion that sport is being made of him , and demands that his story-tellers should take their tales as seriously as he himself is disposed to take them while under their spell .

		We fancy that such unregenerates wSl prefer the naive imaginings of Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	to the obviously sophisticated imaginings of Mr.
Stock	PERSON	- ton .

		As for the regenerate , we need not consider their feelings at all in the matter , for such of their spokesmen as Mr.
Howells	PERSON	and Mr.
Boyesen	PERSON	have repeatedly informed us that their contempt and their scorn are catholic enough to embrace the whole range of imaginative romance , from Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	to
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	's '' Heart of the World , '' like Mr.
Stockton	PERSON	's tale of adven - ture , deals with a hidden treasure this time the treasure of the Montezumas , not of the Incas .

		There is also a mysterious Indian city in the heart of
Central America	LOCATION	, the home of an unknown race , and the storehouse of the treasure in question .

		The scenario of the tale is almost identical with that of ''
Montezuma	ORGANIZATION	's Daughter , '' or '' The Peo - ple of the Mist '' ; but the author 's fertility in the invention of new incident saves the book from be - ing dismissed as a mere repetition , and gives new interest to situations that would seem , from any out - line description , unbearably hackneyed .

		The style , of course , is as roughshod as ever , and the arrange - ment of material as glaringly theatrical .

		20 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, The romancer bent upon buried treasure , to whose imagination the hoards of Incas and Montezumas do not appeal , has always the resource of the pirate and the Spanish Main .

		To these themes Mr.
Owen Rhoscomyl	PERSON	has turned in '' The Jewel of
Ynys Galon	PERSON	, '' and the only novel feature of his treatment is provided by the fact that his pirates are
Welsh	PERSON	- men , and that the scene of their exploits is a rocky island off the coast of
Wales	LOCATION	.

		There are in this book a great many of what the writer loves to call '' bloody horrors , '' and the quality of his narrative may best be illustrated by a brief extract : '' Just as I was expecting sudden death I heard a roar of dry rage , and past me gleamed a weapon all horrible with grey brains and crimson with blood that dropped from it as it swung .

		It was the brass butt of the blun - derbuss in Will
Barry	PERSON	's hand , and , as it fell upon the nearest skull , smashed it to pulp . ''

		This book , for those who like this sort of thing , will undoubtedly prove the sort of thing they like .

		The illustrations are , in the present case , exceptionally spirited and happy in execution , offering a striking contrast to the slovenly and chaotic bits of impres - sionism that it would be a misnomer to call the illus - trations to Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	's Mexican romance .

		Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's '' The Master '' is an exasperat - ing book .

		More than half of it is padding , dis - guised barely if at all ; the remaining fraction em - bodies a strong conception of character , and contains the stuff whereof good fiction is made .

		As for the superfluous moiety of the work , it is difficult to have any patience with it .

		There is a great deal of ar - tistic '' shop '' of the cheapest sort ; there is even more of dilute and sentimental rhetoric .

		The style is nearly always unfinished , and often bad .

		Yet through this maze of scamped workmanship we fol - low the clue of the hero 's diversified career , and share something of the joy with which he conquers , Art , to begin with , and then , after a fashion , and not without a bitter spiritual struggle , Life .

		Re - duced to reasonable dimensions , pruned of its exu - berant offshoots , the sharpness of some of its con - trasts toned to a closer semblance of reality , and worked over with the file from first to last , this book might be transformed into a creation worthy of the lofty ideal that the writer has evidently set himself , but failed to embody in a satisfactory man - ner .

		Natural facility has been Mr.
Zangwill	PERSON	's bane , and overmuch journalism has wellnigh wrecked in him what might have been an admirable talent for description and characterization .

		Several translations of
Continental	ORGANIZATION	fiction , includ - ing works by some of the foremost of living novel - ists , are among the publications selected for review in the present article .

		First in importance of these books is Mr.
Curtin	PERSON	's translation of the latest work of
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, ''
Rodzina Polanieckich	PERSON	. ''

		This title , which means '' The Polanyetski Family , '' has been set aside for no adequate reason , and for it `` Children of the Soil '' has been substituted .

		Such a title is amply justified , however , by the tenor of the narrative , which deals for the most part with Poles of intensely national type , and which brings into frequent prominence that attachment to the country in the sense of pays rather than of patrie which is one of the best elements of national character , whether in
Poland	LOCATION	or elsewhere .

		This aspect of the work is well illustrated by the heroine when she says : '' More than once , when I went out to the fields in
spring	DATE	, and saw that all things were growing , I felt that my heart , too , was growing with them .

		And now I know why that is : In all other relations that a man holds there may be deceit , but the land is truth .

		It is impossible to deceive the land ; it either gives , or gives not , but it does not deceive .

		Therefore land is loved , as truth ; and because one loves it , it teaches one to love .

		And the dew falls not only on grain , and on meadows , but on the soul , as it were ; and a man becomes better , for he has to deal with truth , and he loves , that is , he is nearer God . ''

		The passage we have quoted is not alone illustra - tive of a special aspect of the story , but also of the simple and wholesome feeling that pervades it throughout .

		In point of fact , the
Polanyetski	LOCATION	's and their friends are city-dwellers during most of the period covered by the narrative , and only at the beginning and the end are they brought into inti - mate relations with '' the soil . ''

		They form a group of interesting men and women , differentiated into a sufficient variety of types , and delineated in a manner that is nothing less than masterly .

		The interest centres about
Stanislav Polanyetski	PERSON	and his wife
Marynia	PERSON	, whom we come to know and love as if we had lived with them for years .

		It is easy enough to love
Marynia	PERSON	, who is saintly without be - ing insipid , sweet without being tiresome , and whose purity of soul by imperceptible degrees raises
Stan	PERSON	- islav to something like her own level .

		The delinea - tion of the husband is an even greater triumph ; for he is , after all , the homme sensuel moyen whom we all know , and it requires something of a struggle for the novel-reader , accustomed to heroes of strik - ing personality , to admit the right of such a man to occupy the most conspicuous place in a great work of fiction .

		In fact , the triumph is not unlike that achieved by
Freytag	PERSON	in '' Soil und Haben . ''

		In the end ,
Stanislav	PERSON	wins our allegiance completely , and the story of his spiritual development , as the translator with justice remarks , `` is of interest to every person in civilized society . '' ''

		Children of the Soil '' occupies a middle position between the highly analytical and introspective `` Without Dogma '' and the magnificent historical trilogy , with its glowing scenes and its tremendous sweep , by which the au - thor is best known .

		It is strictly a modern novel , but it offers none of those aberrations of tendency to which many modern novelists weakly resort .

		The strength of the book is in its entire sanity , its freedom from exaggeration or sensationalism , and its psychological insight .

		It must be reckoned among the finer fictions of our time , and shows its author to be almost as great a master in the field
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 of the domestic novel as he had previously been shown to be in that of imaginative historical ro - mance .

		Yet we must , in conclusion , express a slight preference for the chronicler of the seventeenth - century
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	over the novelist of nine - teenth - century
Warsaw	LOCATION	.

		The '' fierce wars and faithful loves '' of the former represent an even higher reach than the delicate delineations and sober philosophies of the latter .

		But , viewed in either aspect , the work of
Henryk Sienkiewicz	PERSON	has already earned for him a place in the foremost rank of liv - ing novelists . ''

		Majesty '' seems to us the most important book that
Heer Couperus	PERSON	has yet produced .

		It is , like its predecessors , largely a work of psychological analysis , and the chief interest centres about a char - acter of distinctly degenerate type .

		But the out - come is not altogether gloomy , and the possibility of a regenerative process is dimly hinted at in the closing pages .

		All these things take on a height - ened significance from the fact that they concern , not an ordinary mortal , but the descendant of a great line of princes , himself the ruler of a great Empire .

		The problem seems to be something like this : Is the institution of monarchy a hopeless an - achronism in the present age of social discontent and aspiration , or is it possible that the institution may adapt itself to the new environment , and be - come once more the pillar of social order ?

		The author does not solve this problem , but he at least hints that the second of the alternatives may offer the solution .

		The Empire in which the action lies has no place on the political map of
Europe	LOCATION	it is an eclectic or composite sort of Empire , drawn from the observation of several States yet the dominion of the Hapsburgs has clearly served more frequently than any other for a model , and Austrian conditions are more closely than any others reproduced .

		The Shakespearian '' Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown '' might well have been taken as a motto for this pathetic study of a soul eager to do what is best for his people , yet oppressed almost to the point of death by his intolerable sense of the responsibility attendant upon his exalted rank .

		A suggestive com - parison might be made between this work and
Herr BjOrnson	PERSON	's treatment of a similar theme in his drama of `` The King . ''


Spain	LOCATION	and
the Netherlands	LOCATION	are farther apart in the nineteenth century than they were in the six - teenth , but the intellectual ferment of our time has reached both countries alike , and we can pass from a Dutch to a Castilian author without the sense of discontinuity that would have been awakened a few years ago . ''

		El Maestrante , '' the new novel of Seiior Vald ^ s , is not as modern a story as '' La Es - puma , '' but it is painfully modern in its realistic method .

		This story of `` The Grandee , '' as the trans - lator calls it , takes us to the provincial city of Oviedo -LRB- called
Lancia	ORGANIZATION	in the book -RRB- , where Seiior Vald ^ s spent his early youth , and the time is that of a gen - eration ago .

		As a document illustrative of bygone manners in a Spanish town the work has more value than it has considered as constructive art .

		It bears the impress of sincerity , and , in this respect , com - mands attentive interest , but its subject-matter of intrigue , cruelty , and horse-play is not engaging , and some of the scenes are quite beyond the pale of the artistically permissible .

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	writes an introduction , giving some interesting par - ticulars of the author 's life and earlier work .

		But even he , as sponsor for the translation , will not an - swer the question '' Whether these maladies of the soul are or are not fit subjects for the art of the novelist , '' but leaves each reader to answer it for himself .

		It is a strangely pathetic story that Miss Sy - monds has translated from the German of Prince
Schoenaich	PERSON	-
Carolath	LOCATION	.

		Steeped in sentiment and romantic color , it offers a striking enough contrast to the dull realism that still confronts us in the pages of most current novels , while it serves also to re - mind us that the feelings of those about whom the novelist writes for our entertainment or instruction are no less deserving of delineation than their activ - ities or their environment .

		This story of a poor stu - dent at a German university , into whose life the passion of love comes like the warm sun of
spring	DATE	- time , melting the snows of
winter	DATE	and flooding all his soul , is told with grace and eloquence ; its sin - cerity is so heartfelt that a certain vagueness of out - line and other amateurish characteristics may well be forgotten in the beauty of the total impression .

		Yet it seems to us that the tragic conclusion is a little forced , certainly not made quite inevitable by the temperament and the antecedents of the per - sons concerned .

		So harsh an ending is not quite consonant with the tenor of so sweet an idyl , and the last pages find us unprepared for their sorrow - ful burden .

		The tragic idyl of
Italy	LOCATION	which Mr.
Dole	PERSON	has ad - mirably translated from the German of
Herr Schulze-Smidt	ORGANIZATION	takes us to the
Lake of Garda	ORGANIZATION	, and does all that words can do to picture the scenery of that beautiful district .

		And against this lovely back-ground is sketched a story of human passion of sin , suffering , and atonement which for intensity of expression and sympathetic presenta - tion of some of the darker moods of the soul could not easily be matched .

		The story is simple enough in outline , and for that reason all the more impres - sive , since the attention is not often diverted from the central situation .

		The exquisite ending of the tale will linger in the memory long after the pages of the book are closed . ''


Frau Sorge	PERSON	'' is the only one of
Herr Suder	PERSON	- mann 's novels that we recollect to have seen in En - glish translation previous to the appearance of '' The Wish , '' the work now before us . ''

		Der
Wunsch	PERSON	'' is one of the tales published in the '' Geschwister '' col - lection about ten years ago .

		It has the dimensions of a novel , although not a lengthy one , and is one of the most finished productions of the author 's art .

		The 22 THE DIAL -LSB-
July	DATE	l , story hangs entirely upon a psychological experience familiar to almost everyone , but not taken seriously except by a morbidly developed mind here and there .

		There are probably few people who do not , in their musings , now and then picture to themselves the death of those nearest and dearest to them , and re - flect upon the possible consequences of such an oc - currence .

		Nor are there many who , if such a hap - pening were to bring in its train some personal grat - ification , or the realization of some ambition -LRB- such as rank , or fortune , or love -RRB- , do not catch them - selves at times abstracting the sad features of the death thus imagined , and contemplating it for an instant or two in what may be called its pleasant aspect .

		With the healthy mind , of course , this ab - straction is only momentary , being promptly in - vaded by the flood of sorrowful associations that can not long be kept at bay .

		Now the mind that has developed a morbid ethical consciousness may be so distressed at the thought that such an abstrac - tion although natural and even inevitable was at all possible as to feel a grievous sense of sin in consequence of the experience , although it knows perfectly well that the will , which alone determines sin in any real sense , could not by any possibility become enlisted in behalf of so evil an imagining , that such a wish could never become translated into act .

		It is such a consciousness that
Herr Suder	PERSON	- mann depicts in the present story a consciousness that can find expiation for its imagined sin only in suicide .

		Our criticism of the story is not that it should deal with so essentially morbid a psycholog - ical state , but that it should seem to countenance the notion that a wish thus formulated which is neither a real wish nor so much as a velleity is a serious ground for self-reproach , to say nothing of its being a ground for so heroic a measure as self - destruction .

		The ethical balance is not fairly held by the author , and his work suffers in consequence .

		For the rest , we can not but praise the art with which this difficult situation is developed , or the fidelity of the descriptive touches that gives such marked reality to the life reproduced in these pages .

		Readers of the later dramas of Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	can not fail to notice how typically Ibsenian is the problem above outlined , and with which the book is mainly concerned .

		The translation reads well in Miss
Lily Kenkel	PERSON	's English , and the information about the author and his writings , supplied by Miss
Elizabeth Lee	PERSON	, is both timely and interesting .

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Whatever may be the errors -LRB- and they are relatively few -RRB- of
M. Paul Bourget	PERSON	's widely read '' Outre Mer '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , they are at least errors of imperfect or hurried observation , and not of prejudice .

		The mir - ror that he holds up to us is an unclouded one , wherein we may see what manner of men and women we are in the eyes of a cultured Frenchman who is a stu - dent of manners and a master of expression .


M. Bourget	PERSON	did not come to our shores fettered with a ready-made theory of us into which the facts gath - ered must be made to fit .

		Facts first , conclusions afterwards , has been his rule .

		He does not cloy us with sugared words , like Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	; or '' blow us up , '' on the
Mark Tapley	PERSON	plan ; nor does he merely exploit our oddities , like his loquacious compatriot ''
Max O'Rell	PERSON	. ''

		If he handles us '' with - out gloves '' on the score of our failings , he is equally candid when it comes to our merits of which he credits us with a liberal share .

		He foresees for us a tolerably hopeful future , albeit one fraught with perils , noted chiefly in unchecked , or unsifted , im - migration .

		Premising that , after the Civil War , '' the
Atlantic	LOCATION	became the great conduit through which flowed all the malcontents of old
Europe	LOCATION	, especially of
Germany	LOCATION	, '' he concludes : '' The day when excessive immigration shall have truly created two Americas in
America	LOCATION	, the conflict between these two worlds will be as inevitable as that between
England	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	, and between
Germany	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	.

		Not against his employer will the Amer - ican workman of
New York	LOCATION	and
Philadelphia	LOCATION	be led to make war ; his employer and he will end by acting together against the foreign workman . ''


M. Bourget	PERSON	is happier in his treatment of lighter topics .

		The '' Impressions '' of our Society , our Business Men , Lower Orders , Education ,
Pleasures	LOCATION	, etc. , are strictly impressions rapid , though shrewd , glimpses and jottings , gathered at random , and put together in a rather haphazard though very entertaining way .

		An effective Among all the refinements of current piece of literary treatment , and all the deli - dramaiic writing .

		cacieg of current literary emotion , it is a great pleasure to come across anything so sim - ple and so effective as Dr.
Weir Mitchell	PERSON	's ''
Philip Vernon	PERSON	'' -LRB-
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is called `` a tale in prose and verse , '' but really it is rather a little drama than anything else , coming near indeed in its construction and handling to the possibilities of stage presentation .

		So many of the literary dramas of our time , though meant for the stage , are found to be effective only in book form .

		This work , though apparently written with no idea of representation , seems to have dramatic possibilities that would not be so very hard to realize .

		We have perhaps noth - ing more than a fifth act ; but at any rate it is a strong combination of real emotions wrought up to a situation powerfully , if simply , handled .

		charged with high feeling and great adventure .

		The local color , the old English inn , the chase , and the garden of the great manor , gives a touch of roman - tic beauty .

		The characters , a Roman priest , two young English gallants , and a beautiful gentle - woman , are brought together in a story which , if not extraordinarily novel or especially ingenious , has at least the merit of holding one 's interest .

		At the beginning , one reads a little suspiciously .

		`` Why should anyone bother to string together a lot of rhymes about the time of Queen Elizabeth ? ''

		But one reaches the end with an increased respect for the author , with the relieved calm that comes after emotional tension , and with the feeling that this slim little book may really be one of those things so hard to detect at first sight , so easy to recognize when detected , a gain to literature .

		Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	does not strive nor cry very much in this work , but there is something in it that is better than much that may be found in the more hysteric efforts of some who are much more conscious of their own import - ance .

		The new life of
William Laud	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
W. H. Hutton	PERSON	, in the '' Leaders of Religion '' series -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- , gives in popular form an account of the real man as judicial students of seventeenth-century history have agreed in estimating him .

		Probably no great man has suffered more or longer from the assaults of religious and political passion than the great arch - bishop , the greatest , our author thinks , who has sat in the chair of Augustine since the Reformation .

		We hope that this book will be read by many who will never look into the great works of
Ranke	PERSON	and
Gardiner	PERSON	, and will thus be led to see that Laud was a high-souled prelate and statesman , though he made one of the worst mistakes a statesman can make , that of misjudging the temper of the times and the forces at work among the people .

		Though his work seemed to go down in an awful crash , yet when the Church came back at the Restoration it was on the basis of his plans and ideals .

		The completeness of his immediate failure should not blind us to the great - ness of his aims .

		His misfortunes came not from his being a Papist at heart , as his Puritan foes charged , but from his not being a Puritan .

		This he could not be : he believed in order , reverence , forms ; and as head of the Church he endeavored to further what he believed would conduce to true worship , but he did not do this in the spirit of the bigot or the tyrant .

		The plays written by our great poets of the present century have , as a rule , enriched that department of literature known as the '' closet drama . '' ''

		The Borderers , '' '' Remorse , '' '' The Ayrshire Tragedy , '' ''
Manfred	PERSON	, '' `` The Cenci , '' ``
Harold	PERSON	, '' `` The Blot on the Scut - cheon , '' '' Chastelard '' -LRB- to mention no more -RRB- , have been , some not well suited to the stage , some frankly intended for the closet .

		study of the lover of letters , but rather that sort of dark up-stairs closet into which one puts such liter - ary rubbish as must be kept but can not be allowed to clutter up the library .

		This literary tendency -LRB- aided by present predictions of a new dramatic period -RRB- has now produced a stupendous , if not an unnatural , blossom in ''
Ernest England	LOCATION	: A Soul Laid Bare , '' by
J. A. Parker	PERSON	.

		This work is in the form of a drama in prose and verse , and its most ob - vious characteristic is its length , in which it exceeds '' Hamlet , '' the First Part of ''

		Besides being a long poem , ''
Ernest England	PERSON	'' re - sembles '' Endymion '' in being delightful reading for the reviewer of the old '' Quarterly '' type , and for such a reader the prodigy of its length is no drawback , since it offers only the richer store of ridiculous missiles to hurl at the unfortunate author , who has really offered more excuse for such treat - ment than a sane man should do .

Alexander Withers	ORGANIZATION	's `` Chronicles of Border Warfare '' -LRB-
Robert Clarke Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book was first published in the thirties , when the author , an enthusiastic antiquarian , was able to gather original material from some of those who participated in the events described .

		It was read in every pioneer home , sometimes literally read to pieces , so that copies of it became scarce long ago .

		Its value was at once recognized , and in its new form this value has been many times increased because of peculiar circumstances .

		The late
Lyman C. Draper	PERSON	visited the regions described by
Withers	ORGANIZATION	, very soon after the publication of the latter 's book .

		He verified the facts described ; he interviewed many old settlers ; he made copious notes from the standpoint of a historian .

		But he was not so much an editor as a collector ; and when his literary labors closed , perhaps with the writing of one of the foot - notes for this new volume , his literary executor , Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	, took up the work , and the revision comes to the reader rich with the notes of Withers the original author , of Dr.
Draper	PERSON	the enthusiastic in - vestigator , and of Mr.
Thwaites	PERSON	the painstaking editor .

		The old edition of
Withers	ORGANIZATION	was considered final authority ; the new one is better , because it has the advantage of modern ideas of bookmaking and scholarly notions of editing .

		The warfare of the border was savage , and many a scalp was taken , as the humble cabin of the pioneer went up in smoke ; but scenes like those described were absolutely neces - sary to the taming of the wilderness for the steady settler of later days .

		24 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, Troubadours and Courts of Love .

		The first volume of the '' Social En - gland Series '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is writ - ten by Mr.
I. F. Rowbotham	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, and devoted to `` The Troubadours and Courts of Love . ''

		A theme so romantic raises high expecta - tions of interest ; yet there are few literary subjects requiring more drudgery and delving on the part of an author .

		Most of the writings of the trouba - dours are still in manuscript , and must be studied chiefly in the
Bibliotheque Nationale	ORGANIZATION	at
Paris	LOCATION	, the Bodleian Library at
Oxford	LOCATION	, and the British Mus - eum at
London	LOCATION	.

		Moreover , the bulk of them are written in a tongue different not only from modern English , but different also from the English of Chaucer and the other early poets .

		But the reader 's expectations in the present work are not disap - pointed ; the history runs on , without appearance of labor , from the time of the first troubadours in
England	LOCATION	early in the twelfth century , to their de - cline and fall about one hundred and
fifty years later	DATE	.

		The general character of the poetry of the troubabours is described , with citations ; their quali - fications and characteristics as an aristocratic caste are set forth ; and their influences on society , partly refining and partly pernicious , is revealed .

		Wher - ever there was chivalry , there were troubadours and courts of love .

		But with the annihilation of the bright and glittering society which had been min - strelsy 's chief inspirer and genial patron , the chief stimulus to poetry and song vanished , and the gay reign of love and the troubadours was past forever .

		Thirteen pictures copied from old tapestries or mural decorations , and several old musical scores , furnish quaint illustrations of the text .

		Mr.
Francis Walker	PERSON	's '' Letters of a Baritone '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- are the record of a young man 's experiences while in
Italy	LOCATION	for purposes of voice-culture .

		Writing to his sister , he adopts a familiar and discursive style , in which personal adventures and practical affairs are mingled with discourse on nature , art , criticism , and as much information of a technical sort relating to his own studies as it is possible to communicate with - out illustrations viva voce .

		The book is not with - out interest to the general reader , but its special value is for the student of vocal art .

		Here he will learn the reasons why he should go to
Italy	LOCATION	, rather than to any other country , for instruction ; why he should not delay too long ; what are the effects of bad teaching ; who should and who should not study to become professional singers ; and how to achieve most comfort with least expense while dwelling abroad .

		In The Great War with
Russia	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Routledge	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
W. H. Russell	PERSON	, we have that veteran 's story of his pioneer work as war-correspondent , and of his per - sonal experiences in that long series of blunders and horrors , lighted up with some brilliant deeds , which we call the Crimean War .

		The world is no longer interested in that war and its controversies as to who was most responsible for the misfortunes of the British army .

		The chief interest of the book lies in the humble beginnings there shown of the expansion of the field of the modern newspaper .

		Mr.
Rus	PERSON	- sell was without military protection or standing , and only explicit orders from the government enabled him to secure bare tolerance .

		It was with good reason that the officers of the old school did all they could to drive him from the army , for his plain account of what he saw from day to day showed such mismanagement and official folly that a great cry of wrath went up from all
England	LOCATION	, and re - forms were instituted that put an end forever to the whole system .

		This was an honorable achievement , and the story of it is well told .

		The new English translation of

		There is an etched frontispiece and a sketch-map of '' The Wessex of the Novels . ''

		Of much interest is the prefatory note in which Mr.
Hardy	PERSON	tells how he came to naturalize the term ''
Wessex	ORGANIZATION	'' in modern English for purposes of descriptive topography .

		The term , somewhat to the author 's surprise , has since found general favor , and he now feels impelled to beg of his readers that they '' refuse steadfastly to believe that there are any inhabitants of a
Victorian Wessex	ORGANIZATION	outside the pages of this and the companion volumes in which they were first discovered . '' ''

		The White Tsar and Other Poems '' -LRB-
Tait	PERSON	-RRB- is the title of a volume by Mr.
Henry Bedlow	PERSON	.

		The other poems are two in number '' Dies Caniculares , '' a series of contemplative stanzas , and '' Beclaweeyeh , '' an
Ori	PERSON	- ental tale .

		As for the '' White Tsar , '' he is none other than the polar bear .

		Ordinarily these three sets of verses would hardly fill the thinnest of volumes , but by giving a full page to each eight-line stanza , by setting opposite each a full-page illustration , and by leaving the alter - nate pages blank , the work is made to assume imposing dimensions .

		The poetical quality of Mr.
Bedlow	PERSON	's verse is not conspicuous , and there are stanzas which it would be cruel to quote .

		The illustrations , which display some imaginative power , are the work of Mr.
J. Steeple Davis	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Bruce	PERSON	's treatment of the sub - ject is based upon extensive personal acquaintance with the country , and is strictly up to date .

		His journalistic training has enabled him to make a readable book , and both settlers and tourists will be likely to find it help - ful .

		To whom the gods a welcome blew , And lamps from far Parnassus shone ?

		... None dare the heights to which they flew , Since
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	is gone .

		The freshening gale strained spar and mast , The billows great and greater grew ; The vessel forward sped and fast , Nor port nor anchorage she knew ; Naught recked they of the circling view , Their only end was to sweep on ... Vanished are captain , ship , and crew , Since
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	is gone .

		Now lesser men their fortunes cast In lesser seas , and zephyrs woo ; Their lutes are thin , they can not last , We listen but to say adieu .

		The artificial gems they strew Of specious glitter fade anon ... Is there no granite left to hew , Since
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	is gone ?

		ENVOY .

		Fled are the mighty bards and few ; The ways of song are barren , wan ... Fled is the perfect manner , too , Since
Alfred Tennyson	PERSON	is gone .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		Dr.
W. L. Phelps	PERSON	is editing a volume of
Chapman	PERSON	for the '' Mermaid series . ''

		A civil list pension of 100 a year has been bestowed upon the widow of
Philip Gilbert Hamerton	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Bradlee Whidden	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, issues a priced cat - alogue of works upon natural history , so neat and well - arranged as to be worth filing for reference .

		The Chautauqua circles are to devote the coming year to an '' American '' course of reading , and special text-books on American history and literature are in course of preparation .

		Messrs.
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	announce '' The Modern Reader 's Bible , '' a series of books from the Scriptures presented in modern literary form .

		Four books of '' Wisdom Literature '' will be the first issued .

		Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	is to have a monument erected in his honor during his lifetime .

		It is to be by a well-known sculp - tor ,
Herr Stephan Sinding	PERSON	, and will stand in front of the Royal Theatre at
Christiania	LOCATION	.

		Two fellowships , of
six hundred dollars	MONEY	each , in the
American School	ORGANIZATION	at
Athens	LOCATION	, are offered for the year 1895-6 .

		Professor
J. W. White	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	will fur - nish application blanks to those desirous of submitting their names .

		The fourth performance in
Paris	LOCATION	of
Wagner	PERSON	's ''
Tann	PERSON	- hauser '' was given this year .

		M. Van Dyck sang the title-role , and it is a curious coincidence that he was born on the very day of the third performance , in
1861	DATE	, when the opera was hissed off the Parisian stage , not to be produced again until an entire generation should have elapsed .

		Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are preparing a series of '' English Classics , '' edited by competent men , and having particular reference to the existing entrance re - quirements of the colleges .

		Professor
G. R. Carpenter	PERSON	is the general editor of the series .

		Mr.
Frederick Locker	PERSON	-
Lampson	PERSON	, author of ''
London	LOCATION	Lyrics , '' and one of the most graceful writers of society verse , died on the
28th of May	DATE	, at the age of seventy - four .

		He was perhaps even better known as a collector of books , drawings , and autographs than as a poet . ''


Friedrich Eduard Beneke	PERSON	: The Man and His
Phil	PERSON	- osophy '' is the title of a monograph by Dr.
Francis Burke Brandt	PERSON	, published by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, under the auspices of
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	, as the fourth volume of its series of '' Contributions to Philosophy , Psychology , and Education . ''

		The main thesis of the work is that
Beneke	PERSON	, rather than Fichte or
Hegel	PERSON	, was the true continuator of the Kantian philosophy , and that in his work we have '' the prbfoundest metaphysical insight of our century . ''

		Provost
Charles C. Harrison	PERSON	of
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	has made to that institution a gift of half
a million dollars	MONEY	, to constitute a Foundation in memory of his father , thus following the noteworthy example of President Low of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		The following suggestions as to the use of the resulting income were made by the donor : 1 .

		The establishment of scholarships and fel - lowships .

		2 .

		An increase of
the University Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		3 .

		The temporary relief of professors from their reg - ular work , permitting them to engage in research .

		4 .

		The engagement of non-residents to lecture for a term at
the University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Funk & Wagnalls	ORGANIZATION	announce it as their inten - tion to introduce into all of their publications a lengthy series of '' reform spellings '' -LRB- such as beutif ul , glimps , oger , skul , and yern -RRB- , '' provided a reasonable number of other periodicals , and writers , and business men will adopt the same so as to help break the force of the criticism that may oppose . ''

		It is hardly necessary for THE DIAL to say that it must decline the invitation to participate in any such phonetic vandalism , and that it will continue , as heretofore , to stand for good spelling no less than for good literature , opposing all attempts to vulgarize either the one or the other .

		The following verses , by Miss
Mathilde Blind	PERSON	, are taken from an English paper , and were inspired by reading the `` Rubaiyat '' in a
Kentish	LOCATION	rose-garden : '' Beside a Dial in the leafy close , Where every bush was burning with the Rose , With million roses falling flake by flake Upon the lawn in fading
summer	DATE	snows : `` I read the Persian Poet 's rhyme of old , Each thought a ruby in a ring of gold Old thoughts so young , that , after all these years , They 're writ on every rose-leaf yet unrolled . ''

		You may not know the secret tongue aright The Sunbeams on their rosy tablets write ; Only a poet may perchance translate Those ruby-tinted hieroglyphs of light . ''

		We are glad to note that the poet had a DIAL by her side .

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	, in '' The Author , '' thus discourses upon his new dignity : `` I think that I may very prop - erly make this the place for a brief note concerning the 26 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, distinction lately conferred upon me .

		It is , in fact , a national recognition of this Society and of its work in ad - vancing the dignity and the independence of literature .

		The
Earl of Rosebery	PERSON	iu his letter to me expressly pointed out that this distinction was offered in recog - nition of services which , he kindly says , have been ren - dered by me to the dignity of literature .

		These hum - ble services could only be effective through such an organization as our own .

		It is , therefore , the Society itself which has , for the first time , received recogni - tion . ''

		We shall , however , continue to think that Sir
Walter	PERSON	's deserts are not wholly conditioned upon his management of the
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE CENTRAL LANGUAGE CONFERENCE .

		As the result of a circular letter which has been dis - cussed for several months , representatives of nine col - leges in the
Mississippi Valley	LOCATION	met in
Chicago	LOCATION	,
June 21	DATE	, to organize a conference of the teachers of modern lan - guages in the district which the railroads call Central .

		The proposal for such an organization seemed to come spontaneously from many sources at once , and as a natural result of the comparative isolation to which college men of the
Middle West	LOCATION	have been condemned .

		The conditions are in most respects the same as those which led to the recent conference of teachers of clas - sical languages in
Ann Arbor	PERSON	, to the conference of En - glish teachers , and the association of teachers of his - tory and sociology , both formed last year .

		The need of personal contact with colleagues has been deeply felt .

		At the same time , the danger of detracting from the none too strong forces of the American Philological So - ciety and the
Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	was duly weighed .

		AH of those engaged in the prelim - inary steps toward the new society are members of one or both of the old bodies , and expect to continue such .

		But it is believed that a society meeting at various points in the
Middle West	LOCATION	can enlist a great number of teachers who would not or who could not join the societies which meet so seldom within reach , and yet work together harmoniously with the older societies .

		In the matter of publication , it is hoped that the new society can support the older ones .

		In the course of a full discussion , lasting through two sessions , it was agreed to call the new society The Central Modern Language Conference ; a constitution was adopted , subject to revision by the members pres - ent at the first regular meeting ; the first regular meet - ing , with programme , is to be held in
Chicago	LOCATION	, during the Christmas recess , but not in the same week with the
Modern Language Association	ORGANIZATION	; the membership fee was fixed at
two dollars	MONEY	, and all persons interested in '' the scientific study and teaching of English , French , Ger - man , or other living European languages '' are invited to apply for membership through the Secretary .

		Provisional officers were chosen as follows : President , Professor
W. H. Carruth	PERSON	,
University of Kansas ; Sec	ORGANIZATION	- retary and Treasurer , Professor
H. Schmidt	PERSON	-
Warten	PERSON	- berg ,
University of Chicago ; Committee on Programme	ORGANIZATION	: Professors
Karsten	PERSON	,
Indiana State University	ORGANIZATION	,
Edgren	PERSON	,
University of Nebraska	ORGANIZATION	, Cutting ,
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and
Baskervill	ORGANIZATION	,
Vanderbilt University	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is understood that the territory of the new society extends from the Alleghauies to the
Rockies	ORGANIZATION	, and from the lakes to the gulf .

		There is also a general feeling that the regular annual meetings should be held in the
summer	DATE	, or at least at some other time than the
Christ	LOCATION	- mas holidays .

THOMAS HENRY HUXLEY	PERSON	.

		Professor Huxley died on the twenty-ninth of
June	DATE	, not without warning , and having to his account the exact scriptural tale of a man 's years .

		A worker and a fighter all his life , the pen was in his hand when overtaken by the ill - ness that was to prove fatal in the end , and he was replying , with unabated vigor of expres - sion and force of logic , to the latest attack made by mysticism upon that stronghold of reasoned and ordered knowledge which we call science , and of which he had for nearly half a century been one of the doughtiest of defenders .

		In the popular consciousness , indeed ,
Hux	PERSON	- ley ranked among the leading representatives of English science , probably as the foremost among them after the death of his old-time col - league ,
John Tyndall	PERSON	.

		It may be worth while to consider for a moment what this estimate means .

		There is practically no such thing , in the present age of the world , as the represent - ation of science by any one man .

		Aristotle was perhaps the only man for whom , in any age , that distinction may be claimed .

		Nowadays , a man can represent science only by represent - ing biology , or physics , or geology , or something even narrower than these .

		Huxley represented English science in the sense that he gave a large part of his life to the subject of compar - ative anatomy , and made some fairly important contributions to our knowledge of that subject .

		But his work was not comparable to that , in their respective subjects , of such men as Far - aday , or
Lyell	LOCATION	, or
Maxwell	PERSON	, to say nothing of
Darwin	LOCATION	.

		It was good work , without doubt , but it was equalled by a score of Englishmen of his own generation , and surpassed by a re - spectable number .

		But the average person , when he thinks of Huxley as a scientific leader , recks little of his comparative anatomy , and has probably never heard of the great work on '' Oceanic
Hydro	PERSON	- zoa , '' the manuals of vertebrate and inverte - brate anatomy , or even the monograph on '' The Cray-Fish . ''

		It is a very different sort of work that has given Huxley his immense reputation , the work which , for the most part , may be found in the nine volumes of his '' Col - lected Essays , '' and which is , of its kind , almost unparallelled in our literature .

		These volumes , 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, it is true , have a great deal to say about science biological science in particular but they an - nounce no original investigations worth speak - ing of , and they are not contributions to scien - tific knowledge in any strict sense .

		Some will dismiss them with a sneer , as mere populariza - tions , as a sort of juggling with other men 's ideas .

		This contemptuous procedure , it need hardly be said , gets no sympathy from us , and is as distinctly wrongheaded as the attempt , already discussed , to classify such books as '' Man 's Place in Nature '' and '' The Physical Basis of Life '' among important scientific works .

		Wherein , then , lies the value of these nine volumes of essays , if it is inadequate to consider them as mere popularizations , however skilful , and quite wrong to call them contributions to science ?

		We should say that the first and most important claim to be made for them is that they reveal a strong philosophical thinker ; that beneath their graceful rhetoric and acute dia - lectic there is a Method of fundamental import - ance , clearly conceived , and rigorously applied to the special subject , whatever it may be , un - der consideration .

		What that method is may be seen plainly enough in any one among half a dozen of the more formal discussions ; most plainly , perhaps , in the noble essay , dated
1870	DATE	, upon the '' Discours de la Methode '' of Des - cartes .

		Indeed , the author recognized the prin - ciple above stated as constituting the unifying element in his seemingly so diversified work when he gave to the initial volume of the re - vised edition of the '' Essays '' the significant title '' Method and Results . ''

		And this title might have been made to cover the whole collec - tion , for we find , whether the subject of an essay be '' Man 's Place in Nature '' or '' Evolution and Ethics , '' the story of the Gadarene swine or the organization of the
State	ORGANIZATION	, that the dis - cussion always proceeds upon well-defined lines , and with close reference to a controlling or - ganon .

		It was no vagary , as some of his read - ers thought , when he turned from his anatom - ical studies to write for the '' English Men of Letters '' a philosophical analysis of the work * > f
Hume	PERSON	; it was rather an indication of the xeal bent of his mind , which always looked be - jrond the half-unified knowledge of science to ithe fully-unified knowledge that we call phil - osophy .

		The healthy English mind is not distin - guished by an aptitude for metaphysics , and
Huxley	ORGANIZATION	's mind was distinctly of the healthy English type .

		He was content with a method , when a Frenchman or a German would have been satisfied with nothing short of a system .

		Hence , he was willing to leave many of the questions of philosophy unanswered , content to carry his method as far as it would go , and to admit ignorance of the regions beyond .

		He even coined a word with which to name this philosophical attitude , and the immediate adop - tion and currency of that word showed that it met a long-felt want .

		Since it came into our circulation , agnosticism , like many other words , has been used as a counter by wise men and as a full-weight coin by fools , but it has justified itself , on the whole , as a useful addition to our philosophical terminology .

		The lectures and writings of our arch-agnostic have , during the past forty years , aroused a good many religious antagonisms ; some of these have become allayed by time , and some are still active .

		It took a bold Englishman in the six - ties to champion the Darwinian doctrine of de - scent and to combat the grotesque Miltonic theory of creation ; but
Huxley	LOCATION	was never lack - ing in courage , and he bore without flinching the brunt of theological attack and vilification .

		The world that is , all the world worth con - sidering came round to his side sooner than could have been anticipated by a student of the history of new and fruitful ideas of their long hard struggle with ignorance , and blind - ness , and all the banded legions of the old or - der of thought and the last score of years left to the stout-hearted philosopher were serene with the satisfaction of complete achievement in at least one important field of his endeavor .

		But the theory of creation was not the only stronghold occupied by the popular theology of his fellow-countrymen , and , when that was bat - tered down , there were others to be attacked .

		All these assaults were not , of course , directed against religion at all , any more than were the Voltairean assaults of a century previous , and the infame that Huxley sought to crush in the world of thought was as little deserving of con - sideration as was the engine of political and so - cial despotism which
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	's memorable and magnificent crusade did so much to demolish .

		We should say that
Huxley	LOCATION	, far from being an enemy of religion , was one of the best friends it has ever found , and we have no doubt that , from the more enlightened twentieth-century religious point of view , he will be remembered as such .

		For our part , the aspect of
Huxley	LOCATION	's life and work that compels the deepest gratitude is the absolute honesty by which that life and that
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 37 work were characterized throughout .

		One does not need to accept all of his conclusions to ad - mire the intellectual process by which they were reached .

		His logic may now and then have been at fault , but it scorned every species of sophistical subterfuge .

		To get at the truth , not merely to make a better-sounding argument than his opponent , was always his aim .

		He hated shams as
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	hated them , but , instead of inveighing at them with stormy prophecy -LRB- '' I am not equal to the prophetical busi - ness '' -RRB- , he employed the better weapon of com - pactly-wrought argumentation .

		Very recently , taking a retrospective view of his life , he made this statement of what had been its aims and its guiding principles : `` Men are said to be partial judges of themselves .

		Young men may be , I doubt if old men are .

		Life seems terribly foreshortened as they look back , and the moun - tain they set themselves to climb in youth turns out to be a mere spur of immeasurably higher ranges when , with failing breath , they reach the top .

		But if I may speak of the objects I have had more or less definitely in view since I began the ascent of my hillock , they are briefly these : To promote the increase of natural knowl - edge , and to forward the application of scientific meth - ods of investigation to all the problems of life , to the best of my ability , in the conviction , which has grown with my growth and strengthened with my strength , that there is no alleviation for the sufferings of man - kind except veracity of thought and action , and the resolute facing of the world as it is , when the garment of make-believe by which pious hands have hidden its uglier features is stripped off .

		It is with this intent that I have subordinated any reasonable , or unreason - able , ambition for scientific fame which I may have permitted myself to entertain , to other ends ; to the popularization of science ; to the development and organ - ization of scientific education ; to the endless series of battles and skirmishes over evolution ; and to untiring opposition to that ecclesiastical spirit , that clericalism , which in
England	LOCATION	, as everywhere else , and to whatever denomination it may belong , is the deadly enemy of science . ''

		It is a noble apologia pro vita sua , and the world will not readily forget what it owes to this man 's single-hearted devotion to truth .

		His tombstone should bear the inscription , Ver - itatem dilexi , that Renan asked to be cut upon his own , and the measure of his delight in the truth should be the measure of posterity 's de - light in cherishing his memory .

EDWARD A. FREEMAN	PERSON	.

		* In bringing out '' The Life and Letters of
Edward A. Freeman	PERSON	, '' Dean
Stephens	PERSON	has con - ferred a lasting obligation upon the student of history .

		It is not only of prime value to be able to see the great historian in his workshop and to breath the atmosphere of enthusiasm that always pervaded that sacred place , but , more and most , to come into close contact with a spirit singularly pure and noble , whose love of truth and violent hatred of sham breathes in every written line , this is high privilege indeed .

		The author has had the good sense to re - main silent himself for the most part , and let Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	talk through his correspondence , a conversation all the more charming because he speaks altogether unconscious of the larger audience .

		The author is content , therefore , to play the part of gentleman usher , by whose kind offices the reader is introduced into that charmed circle which the years drew about this patriarch of the historical clan .

		Here
Freeman	PERSON	held converse with
Finlay	PERSON	and
Stubbs	PERSON	,
Bryce	PERSON	, Cox ,
Dawkins	PERSON	, and
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	,
Hodgkin	ORGANIZATION	,
Kate Norgate	PERSON	, and the gifted granddaughter of
Thomas Arnold	PERSON	, f whose departure into story - writing was always a grave disappointment to
Freeman	PERSON	.

		This is the acme of good biography - making .

		Strange to say , however ,
Green	ORGANIZATION	, the
John	PERSON	of this apostolic group , has been omitted .

		The Preface prepares us somewhat for this disap - pointment ; but the proposal to reserve the cor - respondence of Green for a third volume is not reassuring .

		It is because this part of Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	's correspondence is so important , that Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	says he has not presented it here .

		It is because it is so important that the reader has a right to expect it here .

		There are many minor letters to unimportant persons which contain only echoes of things elsewhere said .

		These could have been omitted .

		The whole discussion with
Anthony Trollope	PERSON	on fox-hunt - ing , and all that is really important in the cor - respondence elicited , might have been given in a tithe of the space .

		Thus there is really no satisfactory reason why the correspondence with
Green	ORGANIZATION	, the thing which the student of history * THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF

		38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, would prize most , the thing which he has a right to expect when he pays his seven dollars for these two volumes , should be omitted .

		Externally , the
Life of Freeman	ORGANIZATION	offers little for the biographer .

		A life could hardly be more devoid of dramatic interest .

		Born in
1823	DATE	, at eighteen months left an orphan , brought up in a most exemplary way by an im - perious old grandmother , given the best educa - tion that
England	LOCATION	could offer , from childhood extremely sensitive to the religious and moral atmosphere that surrounded him , he passed safely over the period when most young men are supposed to be sowing wild oats , and ar - rived at manhood , a severe moralist , a devout religionist , and withal , possessed of a disposition unusually pure , strong , and wholesome .

		At this time the leaning of Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	was strongly toward the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		And yet his sym - pathies were with the devotional and ascetic side of the ministerial office , rather than its in - tellectual , or practical side .

		His plain and sim - ple mind found little satisfaction in the vague speculations of systematic theology ; while upon the humbler duties of the parish priest , he was too much of an aristocrat by nature ever to look with much satisfaction .

		Strange to say , however , the final decision against ordination turned upon his conviction that celibacy was the proper state for the clergy .

		Writing , Jan - uary 25 ,
1846	DATE	, he says : '' I have almost entirely given up the idea of ordina - tion , as I am getting every day more fully convinced of the necessity for the clergy to observe celibacy for every reason , both as in itself the holier estate , and therefore especially incumbent upon them , and also for the avoidance of secularity and sacrilege . ''

		-LRB- Vol .

		I. , p. 62 . -RRB-

		Freeman had already for some time back been engaged to a most estimable young lady , a Miss
Eleanor Gutch	PERSON	.

		The question of ordi - nation was to be settled for him , and for her too .

		No mawkish sentimentalism clouded his purpose for the moment .

		The idea of separa - tion seems not for a moment to have been thought of .

		If he could not conscientiously take with him into the clerical profession the wife-to-be , he would himself keep out of orders .

		Moreover , at this time other ambitions were already stirring in his mind .

		On
March 22	DATE	, writing from
Oxford	LOCATION	, after stating that his con - victions on the question of clerical celibacy are now so strong that he has finally determined to remain a layman , he continues : '' If I take up any profession , it would be architec - ture ; but I would much rather , if I find myself suffi - ciently well off , have none .

		I have begun a course of reading which , if I carry it on , would go a good way through a tolerably long life .

		Besides philosophy , I work chiefly at history , of which I should much like to be master .

		My great ambition would be to get one of the History Professorships here . ''

		-LRB- I. , p. 63 . -RRB-

		The competence to which Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	here refers was an income of 600 , which fell to him from his father 's estate ; and this was after - ward increased by what he inherited from his grandmother , who died in
1848	DATE	.

		He was thus from the first placed beyond the need of follow - ing any profession at all ; and soon after his mar - riage with
Miss Gutch	PERSON	, in
1847	DATE	, he settled in a delightful little country-house in the valley of the Cam , and not far from the small town of
Dursley	LOCATION	.

		Here at
Oaklands	LOCATION	he began , for the man with literary tastes , an ideal life , '' the most favorable of all conditions for steady literary work and study . ''

		In seven years he , or rather his library and his family , had outgrown Oak - lands .

		After some searching he found a home in southern
England	LOCATION	, near
Cardiff	LOCATION	, that suited him .

		Thither he moved in
1855	DATE	.

		Of his new home ,
Lanrumney Hall	PERSON	, he thus wrote , in Sep - tember , to his old friend the Reverend
Henry Thompson	PERSON	: '' This is certainly a jolly place .

		From our church - yard and other elevated points we see all Zummerzet coast ; and it is said that from some of the mountains more inland one can see right across to the English Channel ... Without deserting my books , I have turned farmer , and own 2 Horses 1 Coon 1 Pony 1 Dog 4 Pigs 2 Goats 29 Sheep 4 Cows 1 Calf Rabbits Ducks Cocks and hens .

		2 Cats Of these , two pigs and all the sheep and kine and ducks have been bought since I came here .

		We slay and eat patriarchally of our own , yet we do not eat so soon after death as
Abraham	PERSON	did . ''

		-LRB- I. , p. 177 . -RRB-

		After five years he had again outgrown his quarters , and for a third and last time he moved , this time to Somerleaze , a comfortable and commodious house about two miles from
Wells	LOCATION	.

		Here he was still immured in the quiet isolation of English country life , keeping as far away from
London	LOCATION	, which he always abom - inated , as it was possible and still remain in
England	LOCATION	.

		And here he began the real work of his life .

		At
Oaklands	LOCATION	and at Lanrumney he had been by no means idle , but he had been as yet content to gather and lay the founda - tions for the greater work to come .

		He had produced much , but mostly in the way of re - view and criticism of the work of others .

		At Lanrumney he had devoted himself to the study
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 of Greek and Roman history .

		The series of reviews put forth at this time '' exhibits a knowl - edge of Greek and Roman history marvellous in its extent , clearness and firmness of grasp , ranging as it does from the earliest ages down to his own day . ''

		Yet fame had come to him slowly .

		He was one of those luckless bodies whose fortune it was always to be just beaten by some more fortunate competitor .

		At the university he had tried for prizes and fellow - ships , and had generally succeeded in securing an honorable mention .

		He had tried twice or thrice for Parliament ; but he was too honest for the politicians , and too impatient in the presence of mediocrity or stupidity , ever to se - cure the favor of the common people .

		His ambition some day to return to his be - loved Oxford as a professor of history had never forsaken him , but neither had his ill-luck .

		In
1861	DATE	he had failed to secure the
Camden Professorship of Ancient History	ORGANIZATION	, and in
1862	DATE	he had likewise failed to secure the
Chichele Professorship of Modern History	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the lat - ter case , thirty-five testimonials in his favor had been forwarded to the electors .

		Amongst them was one from
Thirlwall	PERSON	, the learned Bishop of St.
David	PERSON	's , who said : '' I have much pleasure in stating that I not only con - sider him eminently fitted for the office , but that I should not be able to name any living scholar who ap - pears to me more highly qualified for it . ''

		-LRB- I. , p. 308 . -RRB-

		These various rebuffs to his ambition were , however , not without their beneficial results .


Freeman	PERSON	had made a reputation as a reviewer .

		He had published a volume on
Church Archi	LOCATION	- tecture , and had also put out Volume I. of his '' Federal Government '' ; but his name was not as yet , in the public mind , attached to any great work on modern history .

		It was time that he concentrated his splendid powers upon some one definite period of world history that should henceforth be recognized as peculiarly his own field .

		In
1865	DATE	he wrote to Dean Hook : ''
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	will most likely give up his profes - sorship next year , and I want to succeed him .

		It seems to be thought good that I should put out something more directly bearing on what they call Modern History than
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	, Vol .

		I. So , as Federal Govern - ment , Vol .

		II. , could ` not be done in time , and as no bookseller -LRB- at least neither Longmans nor
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- would take a volume of collected essays at his own risk , I have actually sat down to make a distinct History of the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	, which I can do easier than any - body else , as I have worked so much at the subject for twenty years past , that is , a great part of the story ; there will be little more to do than to write down what is already in my head . ''

		-LRB- I. , 335 . -RRB-

		The
Norman Conquest	PERSON	was thus by no means a new subject .

		He had long been delving and gathering .

		In
1892	DATE	he said of a former un - successful effort to win a prize upon this sub - ject : '' The
Norman Conquest	PERSON	was a subject that I had been thinking about ever since I could think at all .

		I wrote for the Prize ; I had the good luck not to get it .

		Had I got it I might have been tempted to think that I knew all about the matter .

		As it was , I went on and learned something about it . ''

		-LRB- P. 75 . -RRB-

		This was , in
1846	DATE	, one of the several unsuc - cessful attempts of Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	to secure honors during his university career .

		But dis - appointment only stimulated him to deeper and more diligent study .

		Thus in a double sense , we are indebted to the disappointments of Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	for his greatest work , '' The
Norman Conquest	PERSON	. ''

		Nor was he destined to succeed any better in
1866	DATE	.

		When
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	resigned , the coveted prize again eluded the ambitious recluse of Somerleaze and was given to his friend
William Stubbs	PERSON	.

		The appoint - ment of
Stubbs	PERSON	did much to rob
Freeman	PERSON	's third disappointment of its edge .

		It was an honor to be beaten by such a competitor .

		In the mean time
Freeman	PERSON	remained at Som - erleaze , quietly working away at the `` Con - quest '' and making himself generally useful , like the typical country gentleman that he was . ''

		Gaols , lunatics , and meetings about cattle plague '' claimed a due share of his time .

		The work on the '' Conquest '' also greatly broadened his scholarship by bringing him more into sympathy with German writers , and greatly strengthened that new taste for travel and local research which became so marked in his later years .

		In a letter written from
Oaklands	LOCATION	, in
1854	DATE	, he frankly confesses that he is not a German scholar , and in citing a list of author - ities upon mediaeval constitutional history he has apparently exhausted himself with ''
Hal	PERSON	- lam ,
Guizot	PERSON	,
Palgrave	PERSON	,
Kemble	PERSON	, and the like '' -LRB- 76V ?

		, p. 171 -RRB- .

		In
1877	DATE	he could address the Greeks at
Corfu	LOCATION	in their native tongue ; he could write and talk Latin like a medieval chorister ; French also was as familiar to him as his native English ; but as late as
1871	DATE	he complains from
Strasburg	PERSON	: '' The folk at this inn be so Dutch that it was only with great pains that I could find out the time of the trains for
Paris	LOCATION	.

		You 're in
Germany	LOCATION	now ' says the waiter , in English . ''

		-LRB- II. , p. 20 . -RRB-

		In
December , 1872	DATE	, we find him patiently laboring through
Waitz	PERSON	, whom he treats with great respect .

		Possibly this interest in
Waitz	LOCATION	had some connection with a visit to central
Germany	LOCATION	in the preceding
summer	DATE	when he 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, was the honored guest of Ihne at
Heidelberg	LOCATION	and of
Pauli	LOCATION	at
Gottingen	LOCATION	.


Freeman	PERSON	's method of work at this time was first to gather and read all that he could find upon the topic in hand , and then to visit the region in question and study it on the spot .

		It was at such times that he laid his friends under tribute .

		Green , whose powers of observa - tion were far keener than
Freeman	PERSON	's , was his frequent companion , especially in
Normandy	LOCATION	.

		A jolly pair they must have been , too , as they ' footed it '' about among the Norman hills , '' stalking castles , '' making the best of the in - conveniences of such travel , finding no end of amusement and entertainment in the people , but always deprecating the '' Gal - Welsh jabber that must come out of such fine Dutch car - cases . ''

		What would one not give to have their eyes and see what they saw and as they saw !


Switzerland	LOCATION	,
Freeman	PERSON	had already visited .


Italy	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	received his attention later .

		His '' History of
Sicily	LOCATION	'' led him to study its local topography as earnestly and faithfully as he had once studied
Normandy	LOCATION	.

		In
1881	DATE	a long-talked-of trip to
America	LOCATION	was undertaken .

		His ostensible object was to re - spond to the joint invitation of the
Lowell Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tute of
Boston	LOCATION	and the
Peabody Institute of Baltimore	ORGANIZATION	.

		But
Freeman	PERSON	's historical studies had long since interested him in the Americans as the people who had most realized the prin - ciples of
Federal Government	ORGANIZATION	.

		He came , there - fore , with eyes opened with kindly interest for the people and their institutions .

		He saw in them his kindred , and he loved and respected them as he did all that was English .

		His habit of constantly studying and comparing the history of
England	LOCATION	with the history of old
Greece	LOCATION	made it easy for him to grasp the idea of a people politically and geographically divided , but still remaining in the higher sense one people .

		It was in his large thought that the Englishmen of
Britain	LOCATION	, of
America	LOCATION	, of
Africa	LOCATION	, of
Australia	LOCATION	, should be each to his dis - tant brother as were the
Greek of Kyrene	ORGANIZATION	and the
Greek of Cherson	ORGANIZATION	.

		He regretted that there was no common name to embrace them all , such as the Greeks had in their term Hellene .

		The British Empire meant nothing to him com - pared with that truer and larger unity of the scattered English folk , the great family of the Angle-Kyn , who , in spite of geographical dis - tance , political separation , cruel warfare , and even more cruel commercial rivalry , were still one people in history , in language , in the possession of common political traditions , in religion , and in the consciousness of common destiny .

		Said he : `` This great land is essentially an English land ; it is no small witness to the toughness of fibre in the En - glish folk wherever it settles that it is so ; a land must be reckoned as English where the English kernel is so strong as to draw to itself every foreign element , where the foreign settler is adopted into the English home of an English people , where he or his children exchange the speech of their elder dwellings for the English speech of the laud .

		Men of various nationalities are on American ground easily changed into good
Ameri	PERSON	- cans , and the good American must be , in every sense that is not strictly geographical , a good Englishman ... Truly we may rejoice that with so much to draw them in other ways , this great people still remains in all essen - tial points an English people , more English very often than they themselves know , more English it may be sometimes than the kinsfolk whom they left behind in their older home .

		At last , in the year
1884	DATE	, the honor for which Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	had so long hoped in vain sought him .

		On the resignation of Mr.
Stubbs	PERSON	to be - come bishop of Chester ,
Freeman	PERSON	was chosen to fill his place .

		One of the great objects of his ambition , in which he had been so often disappointed , was now at last within his grasp .

		But the prize had now lost its charm .

		He felt that the appointment was his due , and that he ought to accept it , but he shrank from the change in all his habits of life which must fol - low .

		There is a real pathos in the reply which he at the time makes to the congratulations of Mr.
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	: '' It is something to succeed Arnold , you , and
Stubbs	PERSON	but I gnash my teeth that I have not had you and
Stubbs	PERSON	to my colleagues and not to predecessors .

		Years ago to fill one of the historical chairs at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	was my alternative ambition with a seat in
Parliament	LOCATION	.

		It seemed for years as if neither would ever come to me ; and now at least one has come when I am rather too old for the change .

		Leaving one 's home for half the year to be in the midst of the whirl of
Oxford	LOCATION	, as
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	is now , is a frightful prospect , besides the bondage of new and absurd rules which Arnold never was under , nor you either ... Still , I should have been disappointed if I had not had the offer of the post , as I certainly thought it was my due ; and I thought it right to take it . ''

		-LRB- II. , 279 . -RRB-

		No one more than he knew his limitations .

		His health was failing rapidly .

		It was too late for the old dog to take kindly to new tricks .

		He clung fondly , pathetically , to the old hab - itat .

		He continues to
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	: '' I do n't mean to leave Somerleaze ; at least I shall try the experiment of keeping two houses , though I fancy it will be both grievous and costly ; but I have got so fond of my own place that it would be a frightful wrench to leave it altogether . ''

		The results proved that
Freeman	PERSON	had not misjudged himself , or his condition .

		He be -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 41 longed to the generation past .

		He had little sympathy with the innovations that had dese - crated the Oxford that he had known and loved forty years before .

		He was out of place and he knew it and felt it .

		He who could have been so much to the university , saw himself now deserted for younger men .

		He lectured to empty benches , neither his style nor his methods were adapted to the ideals of the time .

		His studies in the mean time were not for one moment forsaken ; the first and second vol - umes of his `` History of Sicily '' were published in
1891	DATE	, and by the end of the year nearly the whole of the third volume was ready for the press .

		In this great work , destined to be left unfinished , he found relief and consolation in the midst of the discouragement arid humilia - tion that clouded his professorial career . ''

		I am a-weary , '' he writes in
February	DATE	, '' of all this professing , and I shall be glad to give it up at the first moment I can . ''

		In
March	DATE	again he writes : '' I am thoroughly tired of this place and everything in it .

		It is all so disappointing and disheartening .

		I have tried every kind of lecture I can think of , and put my best strength into all , but nobody comes , and all the petty things that turn up are just enough to dis - turb one 's own steady work without awakening any in - terest . ''

		Freeman 's failing health undoubtedly had much to do with the despondence that pervades all his letters of this period .

		Occasionally he writes in a tone of sadness and vexation of spirit , never manifested before in any for - mer period of his life .

		From Somerleaze he complains that few of his friends wrote to him , and that no one came to visit him ; and declares that if his friends did not go to see him , he certainly would not go to that hateful
London	LOCATION	, in which so many of them had buried themselves `` that horrid wilderness of houses , '' more dreary to him than any other place in the world .

		At this time , also , he seems to be spe - cially annoyed by the critics .

		He complains that for some reason , which he can not under - stand , he seems to be more jeered and sneered at than any other writer , by those who set them - selves up to be critics . ''

		They are always at - tacking me about peculiar spelling of names , as if I had any spelling of my own different from
Lappenberg	LOCATION	and
Kemble	PERSON	before me , and
Johnny	PERSON	* after me . ''

		The critics also were ever grumbling at his `` horrible repetition '' ; and he asks , '' Why should one not say the same thing twenty times if people forget it twenty *

		times ? ''

		To
Bryce	PERSON	, in
March , 1884	DATE	, he says , referring to the critics : '' These things would annoy me less if I saw more of other men and could talk and laugh them off , but I ca n't change my way of life now . ''

		Freeman had in fact for years been carrying on a losing fight with his grim foe .

		His mind , however , remained clear and powerful .

		His memory had lost the tenacious grasp of youth , but his hunger for work was as eager as ever .

		He went on planning and breaking new ground , as if he really expected to live as long as
Greg	PERSON	- ory IX. , the man who began his lifework at seventy and completed it at ninety .

		But not so with
Freeman	PERSON	.

		NEW ENGLAND 'S FAST DAYS .

		* The painful preparers and purveyors of per - ennial papers , to be printed throughout the press of this great
United States	LOCATION	, upon Thanks - giving Days , with historical reference to the day and to Fast Days , will hail with deep grat - itude the intelligent , comprehensive , exhaust - ive , and interesting book entitled '' The Fast and Thanksgiving Days of
New England	LOCATION	. ''

		In it is fresh and varied material sufficient to fur - nish suggestions for scores of such papers , an excellent calendar of Fast and Thanksgiving Days , from the year
1620	DATE	to
1815	DATE	, and a Bib - liography of Thanksgiving and Fast Sermons .

		In the book are set forth in a series of in - teresting and well laid out chapters , the condi - tions leading to the adoption in
New England	LOCATION	of the Fast Day and Thanksgiving Day system -LRB- if it may be so termed -RRB- in place of the holy days of the Church of
England	LOCATION	.

		The devel - opment of this system , and the reason of its decline , are also fully given .

		In various pe - riods , the system is shown in operation , in a series of pictures all in proper historical setting .

		As it would be impossible , within any rea - sonable space , to give any adequate review of the thirty long chapters that constitute this book , I will chiefly dwell on the chapter en - titled '' The Conquest of
Canada	LOCATION	, '' since the subject chances to be of special prominence and interest to-day in the pleasant recognition and commemoration of this conquest through the * THE PAST AND THANKSGIVING DAYS OF NKW ENGLAND .

		42 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, erection and dedication , by the Society of Col - onial Wars , of a monument in memory of the Battle of
Louisburg	LOCATION	.

		In the middle of the eighteenth century the conclusion was forced on
New Englanders	LOCATION	, through the Indian wars , that the conquest of
Canada	LOCATION	was essential to the continued peace of
New England	LOCATION	.

		It took two wars to obtain this conquest , '' Governor
Shirley	PERSON	's War , ''
1744	DATE	to
1749	DATE	, and the `` French and Indian War , ''
1755	DATE	to
1760	DATE	.

		An attack was made on the English post of Canso in
May , 1744	DATE	, and when the news reached
Boston	LOCATION	, preparations were at once made both for fighting and praying .

		A Fast was held in
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and
New Hampshire	LOCATION	four days before the troops sailed for
Annapolis Royal	ORGANIZATION	.

		Additional cause for humiliation was found in the warning voice of an earthquake , by which
Boston	LOCATION	was shaken the day after war was declared .

		The
summer	DATE	months were spent in endeavoring to secure the neutrality of the Indians , and the autumn Thanksgiving was given for the exceptionally bountiful harvest , upon which the ministers dilated as God 's provision for war .

		The win - ter witnessed preparations for the expedition , and on the
last day of February	DATE	another Fast was held , and
Samuel Checkley	PERSON	preached a ser - mon on '' Prayer a Duty when God 's People Go Forth to War . ''

		Bostonians had never neglected that duty ; they had prayed often and with '' extraordinary fervency , faith , and wrest - lings , '' both in private and `` solemn days of publick prayer . ''

		Praying-meetings were held even of women , a thing which had not been tolerated in
Boston	LOCATION	since the dangerous and '' bussie-headed '' meetings of
Anne Hutchinson	PERSON	and her gossips a century previous .

		All this later agitation was in
Whitefield	LOCATION	's time , when prayer and praise filled every hour of the day .

		A fast was kept on
May 2	DATE	, after Sir
William Pepperell	PERSON	and the '' forces thro Favour of Di - vine
Providence	LOCATION	Were Embarked and De - parted . ''

		And it was learned afterward that while these good pious Bostonians were thus solemnly fasting and earnestly praying at home , that very hour the grand Battery of
Cape Bre	ORGANIZATION	- ton was delivered up .

		On
July 3	DATE	the good news of the fall of
Louisburg	LOCATION	arrived , and was greeted with fireworks and thanksgiving .

		The ministers and prayers had a large share in this
Louisburg	LOCATION	expedition .

		Rev.
Samuel Moody	PERSON	, who accompanied the troops , cut down with his own hands the papal images in the
Louisburg	LOCATION	churches , and preached a Puritan sermon in the Romish church ; and it should be noted that prayer came nigh also to wreck - ing the expedition , for it was desired to be kept secret as long as possible , but a loud-voiced and fervent petition for guidance from God in the matter made the whole thing public .

		The following
summer of 1746	DATE	was passed in alternate hopes and fears .

		A French fleet was said to be hovering off the coast near Bos - ton .

		The town was in consternation , a fast was set , and possibly in answer a tempest wrecked the French ships .

		In alternate fasting and thanksgiving passed the six years of the treaty of peace ; and then the second war arose , the war of
Braddock	ORGANIZATION	's campaign .

		Well should
New England	LOCATION	now fast and pray ; burdened with debt , shocked by another earthquake , dis - couraged by
Braddock	PERSON	's defeat , fasts followed rapidly and prayers filled the land .

		They were finally answered by the victory of
Wolfe	PERSON	on the
Heights of Abraham	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- a fireside tale in
New England	LOCATION	-RRB- , and an English chaplain preached a Protestant sermon in the Ursuline convent in
Quebec	LOCATION	on the
27th of September	DATE	.

		How
England	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	rejoiced !

		The autumn was a round of thanksgiving , of war-sermons , which now constitute an import - ant contribution to the history of the war .

		Some deemed the
Conquest of Canada	ORGANIZATION	the final overthrow of
Babylon	LOCATION	.

		They cared little for Canadian territory , but were eager for the ban - ishment of the Roman Catholic religion from the continent .

		To me , these wars are deeply significant , for a reason which at that day would have seemed basely traitorous to the loyal hearts of both soldiers and ministers ; the struggle taught the sturdy Americans modes of war - fare , of fortifications , of endurance , and it pre - pared them for the struggle for Independence .

		But it was a bitter experience ; the hopeless campaigns in the fierce Canadian winters ; the sacrifices of wealth , of human life ; the hor - rors of Indian atrocities ; the tedious uncer - tainty of the issue .

		Well might they pray at the end and sing their '' New Thanksgiving Song , '' printed in
1759	DATE	. ''

		With feasting and Thanksgiving Oar grateful hearts are fed , Which gratifies the Living And can ' t offend the Dead . ''

		The story of all this has been well told by Mr.
Love	PERSON	, and is of deep interest .

		Of scarcely less interest is the fantastic chapter on '' Pests , Plagues , and Prodigies '' ; the one on '' The Witch Craft Fasts '' ; and the amusing one on '' Spells of Weather . ''

		For this book has much that is amusing in its pages .

		It shows many
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 aspects of the subject that are decidedly hu - morous , though always full of affectionate re - spect ; for the modes of thought which may appear whimsical to-day , two centuries ago were passionately religious and deeply significant .

		Mr.
Layard	PERSON	tells us that when in pursuit of some antiquarian researches in the
Orient	LOCATION	, he asked a certain
Eastern Cadi	ORGANIZATION	for assistance and information .

		He received this answer : '' The things you search and ask , O most Illustrious Stranger and Joy of my Liver , are both im - possible and useless to accomplish . ''

		It would appear that it must be impossible to make a list of all the various fast and thanksgiving days observed in all the
New England	LOCATION	towns since colonial days , to recount their exact dates , their commemorative sermons ; yet I think it has not proved so .

		At any rate , the author gives in this book a table of about two thou - sand of these days , and I can not believe there were many more .

		I personally know of some very out-of-the-way if I may so term them , some very recondite Fast Days , some appar - ently hidden and secreted instances .

		I have conferred with Mr.
Love	PERSON	's list .

		They all are there , in proper place , properly dated , properly labelled .

		Whether this work is useless or not , is another matter .

		It would seem to be a mat - ter of individual decision .

		Certainly from the point of view of an antiquary or oniomaniac it would not appear that it was Love 's Labor Lost .

		CORRESPONDENCE OF A BRITISH CONSUL-GENERAL , .

		* The student of American history will find much of interest and value in a handsome vol - ume recently issued under the title of ''
Selec	PERSON	- tions from the Correspondence of Thomas Bar - clay . ''


Thomas Barclay	PERSON	came of old colonial stock .

		His great-grandfather ,
John	PERSON	, was sur - veyor-general of
East Jersey	LOCATION	, and agent of his brother
Robert	PERSON	, the non-resident governor ;
Thomas	PERSON	, the son of
John	PERSON	, was Church of En - gland missionary at the then -LRB- 1707-22 -RRB- out - post of
Albany	LOCATION	; his son
Henry	PERSON	was long rec - tor of
Trinity Church	ORGANIZATION	, in
New York	LOCATION	, and to him , in
1753	DATE	, was born the hero of the present book .

		The original Barclays were upper-class Scotchmen ; but the American branch , in its * SELECTIONS FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE OF
THOMAS BARCLAY	PERSON	, formerly British Consul-General at
New York	LOCATION	.

		Edited by
George Lockhart Rives	PERSON	.

		four generations , married into Dutch families of the patroon order .

		Thus
Thomas Barclay	PERSON	was a thorough - going Knickerbocker of the olden type , reared in an unyielding Church of
England	LOCATION	atmosphere , intensely loyal to his king , and of course an uncompromising Tory when the Ee volution broke out .

		In
1775	DATE	he married , and opened a law office in
New York	LOCATION	, but soon fled to rural Ulster ; but here he found life intolerable , amid suspicious neighbors to whom a loyalist was akin to a mad dog , and in
1776	DATE	he joined the British army , fighting gal - lantly until the close of the war , from which he emerged as a major , on half-pay .

		The prop - erty of the
Barclays	LOCATION	, like that of hundreds of other loyalist estates , was sequestered to the
Commonwealth of New York	ORGANIZATION	, and , exiled , the young lawyer-soldier went forth to drag out a few barren years in
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, upon the shores of the
Bay of Fundy	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1796	DATE	, it became essential to establish which of two streams emptying into the Bay was the true
River St. Croix	ORGANIZATION	mentioned in
Jay	PERSON	's boundary treaty of
1794	DATE	.

		Barclay 's local knowledge , added to the credit he had estab - lished at court , caused him to be selected as the king 's commissioner , and his views appear to have prevailed in the council .

		In
1799	DATE	he returned to
New York	LOCATION	as British consul-gen - eral , a position he held until the outbreak of war in
1812	DATE	necessitated his retirement to
England	LOCATION	.

		He was soon back again , however , as agent for the relief and exchange of British prisoners in
America	LOCATION	, and in this often dis - agreeable position served until peace was de - clared , when he once more retired to
London	LOCATION	, only to be again despatched to
New York	LOCATION	as one of the British commissioners to settle the vexed question of the
Northeast Boundary	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- 1815-22 -RRB- .

		Barclay 's position was now a peculiarly del - icate one .

		His editor well says : '' He was a native of
New York	LOCATION	, he had married his wife in
New York	LOCATION	; his family had their home there , his sons were
New York	LOCATION	merchants , his daugh - ters had married Livingstons and Stuyvesants , and he was a cousin of half the people in the place .

		Nova
Scotia	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	were sensitive on the subject , and if
Lord Ashburton	LOCATION	was attacked and discredited because he had mar - ried an American wife , we may guess what sort of a storm would have been raised if
Barclay	LOCATION	had yielded to American demands .

		Far more stubbornly , probably , than any native English - man ,
Barclay	PERSON	stood firm for the extremest Brit - ish claims . ''

		As a matter of fact , these pro- 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, tracted negotiations availed nothing ; it was not until the
Webster	PERSON	- Ashburton treaty in
1842	DATE	that the matter was finally settled , by the es - tablishment of the present boundary .

		As for
Barclay	LOCATION	, he retired in
1822	DATE	, after nearly fifty years of important public service for
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and spent his last years quietly and prosperously , in the care of a country place on
Manhattan Island	LOCATION	, where he passed away in
1830	DATE	.

		Barclay appears to have preserved but a rela - tively small portion of his correspondence , which must have been voluminous ; such papers as are here given us , however , are sufficient to throw many a strong ray of light upon the troublous affairs of the Republic in its years of childhood .

		Their author probably never quite forgave his fellow-countrymen for breaking with the mother country , and was to the last faithful , perhaps over-zealous , in his service for the
King	LOCATION	.

		But he thoroughly knew
America	LOCATION	and Americans , and his letters reveal none of those singular misconceptions of our national characteristics which were wont in his day to abound in the memoirs of English travellers and diplomats whose paths led hither .

		He drove hard bargains for his sovereign ; nevertheless he had a whole - some respect for the land of his birth , its peo - ple , and most of its institutions .

		The editor of the present volume , Mr.
George Lockhart Rives	PERSON	, is not only a descendant of
Thomas Barclay	PERSON	, but was formerly assistant sec - retary of state of the
United States	LOCATION	, and betrays an intimate knowledge of early American diplo - macy .

		His introductions to the several chap - ters into which he has arranged the papers are in their way models of judicious and concise statement ; his own account of the northeast boundary question , reinforced by two original maps , is in itself a valuable contribution to the literature of the subject .

		The publishers have cooperated with the editor in the production of a highly creditable piece of book-making .

		The excellent index deserves special commendation from historical students .

		THE LIFE OF A PHILANTHROPIC ENGLISHWOMAN .

		* Viewed from the standing-point of thrilling adventure or varied experiences , the
Life of Miss Frances Power Cobbe	ORGANIZATION	would seem unevent - ful enough ; but as a record of the evolution of a strong personality , and of changes in English life and society during the past seven decades all of which she saw , and part of which she was , it holds the reader 's attention from the first page to the last of its two large volumes .

		It is impossible to conceive a more dispas - sionate or franker narrative ; and this is per - haps the greatest charm of the book .

		Nothing either good or bad in the way of self - revelation appears to have been shirked ; and many of those things which most persons , especially most women , prefer to keep to themselves are stated here in a matter-of-course fashion that is a sure warrant of that perfect candor in self - judgment which is usually so difficult of attain - ment .

		For example , speaking gratefully of her own vigorous physique ,
Miss Cobbe	LOCATION	admits its defects , '' even to the verge of grotesqueness from the aesthetic point of view '' ; in describ - ing a childish temptation whereby she ate , one by one , certain sweetcakes placed in her care for a boy cousin , she adds : '' Greediness , alas !

		has been a besetting sin of mine all my life . ''

		But the most astonishing bit of confidential disclosure to the reader is where she speaks of having gone through life without any experi - ence of what has been styled '' woman 's whole existence , '' confessing that no man has ever desired to share her life , nor has she seen the man she would have wished to ask her to do so .

		This revelation makes it seem all the more astonishing that she could have entered into the understanding of the sentiments of love and maternity as she has done in '' The Duties of Women . ''

		It denotes an intuitive imagina - tion of a high order to supply the sympathy that is commonly derived only by actual experi - ence in one 's own fibres .

		By any of the recognized laws of heredity ,
Miss Cobbe	LOCATION	is puzzled to account for herself .

		Not one of her ancestors or relatives , so far as she can learn , ever dabbled in printer 's ink ; and so little sympathy had she at home that she was obliged to write and publish secretly , in order to spare her father the mortifying con - sciousness of having a scribbling daughter .

		THE DIAL 45 His own abilities , though not small , were exclu - sively of an administrative order .

		The mother was a gracious and beautiful woman , notable chiefly as a charming hostess and cultivated member of society .

		With a great admiration for both parents , and a passionate love for the mother ,
Frances Power Cobbe	ORGANIZATION	recognizes that her own faculties , her own lifework , are of a kind that would have been regarded as un - seemly by all her ancestry , and unbecoming as a daughter of their house , especially as she lacked the inheritance of all their peculiar gifts and graces .

		Of her four brothers , all her elders , none showed any marked fondness for literary pursuits .

		Destiny conferred upon Miss Cobbe a for - tunate environment .

		Being granted the proph - et 's prayer of '' neither poverty nor riches , '' she was freed from all the money cares that beset the pathway of most persons .

		Neither of those difficult problems , the making of both ends meet or the just and conscientious expenditure of a large income , were pressed upon her for solution .

		Thus in early womanhood and mid - dle life she enjoyed a degree of real leisure of mind possessed by few .

		This gift of the gods to the literary worker is so priceless that it is a pleasure to find Miss Cobbe recognizing its full value , even to the extent of somewhat de - preciating her real gifts and creative energy .

		She says : '' I had good , sound working brains to start with , and much fewer hindrances than the majority of women in improving and employing them .

		Voila tout . ''

		A woman thus fortunately born and fortu - nately placed would naturally receive the best education offered by her time , and accordingly , at the age of fourteen
Miss Cobbe	PERSON	left the care of governesses for a private '' Ladies ' School '' in
Brighton	LOCATION	.

		The description of her life there during the next two years is one of the most entertaining portions of the book , as showing the characteristics of the typical higher educa - tion of women at that period .

		It is
Miss Cobbe	LOCATION	's deliberate conviction that , for attain - ing the minimum of solid results with the max - imum of cost and labor , a better system could scarcely have been devised .

		These were some of its features : '' Not that which was good in itself or useful to the community , or even that which was delightful to our - selves , but that which would make us admired in so - ciety , was the raison d'etre of each requirement .

		Every - thing was taught us in the inverse ratio of its true importance .

		At the bottom of the scale were Morals and Religion , and at the top were Music and Dancing ; miserably poor music too , of the Italian school then in vogue , and generally performed in a showy and taste - less manner on harp or piano .

		I can recall an amusing instance in which the order of precedence above de - scribed was naively betrayed by one of our schoolmis - tresses when she was admonishing one of the girls who had been detected in a lie . '

		Do n't you know , you naughty girl , ' said Miss R. impressively , before the whole school , ` do n't you know we had almost rather find you have a P -LSB- the mark of Pretty Well -RSB- in your music , than tell such falsehoods ? '

		... They marched us to church every
Sunday	DATE	when it did not rain , and they made us on
Sunday	DATE	mornings repeat the Collect and Catechism ; but beyond these exercises of body and mind it was hard for them to see what to do for our spiritual welfare .

		One Ash
Wednesday	DATE	, I remember , they provided us with a dish of salt fish , and when this was removed to make room for the roast mutton , they addressed us in a short discourse , setting forth the merits of fasting , and ending by the remark that they left us free to take meat or not as we pleased , but that they hoped we should fast ; ` it would be good for our souls AND OUR FIGURES ! ' ''

		By far the most vital and momentous of
Miss Cobbe	LOCATION	's experiences were those in con - nection with religious thought and feeling .

		Nat - urally a very devout child , when she was about eighteen she found herself , in complete mental solitude and in great ignorance , facing all the dread problems of human existence .

		Her father was a typical Churchman as Churchmen were in
the first half of the century	DATE	.

		All her rela - tives , far and near , were the same .

		In those days no such thing was heard of as '' Broad '' interpretations of Scripture doctrines .

		It was sixty years before ''
Lux Mundi	PERSON	, '' and thirty before even '' Essays and Reviews . ''

		Evan - gelical Christianity in
1840	DATE	presented itself as a thing to be taken whole , or rejected wholly .

		The story of the alterations that for years went on in the poor young heart and brain , one week or month of rational and moral disbelief , and the next of vehement and remorseful return to the faith which she supposed could alone give her the joy of religion , is too pathetic and in - timate for condensation ; and the result of her final acceptance of the doctrines of Theism , with its family estrangement , is really tragic , but must not be dwelt upon here .

		In the
year 1857	DATE	, by the death of her father ,
Miss Cobbe	PERSON	was released from her pleasant du - ties as mistress of the family estate at New - bridge , and found herself free to enter upon an independent career of her own choosing .

		She was then thirty-five years old , had written one book , the '' Essay on the Theory of Intuitive Morals , '' but had seen little of any life beyond that of her own immediate neighborhood .

		After the English fashion , the interests of the eldest brother and his charge of keeping up the house and estate were considered as paramount , and 46 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, she was left with but a small patrimony .

		But accepting her comparative poverty with cheer - fulness , and interpolating a year 's pilgrimage abroad as a sort of conclusion to her self-edu - cation , the time seemed now ripe for realizing a long-cherished hope of leading an independ - ent life in some field of usefulness to her fel - low-creatures . ''

		Slumming , '' before either the word or the thing had become fashionable , was the first thing that presented itself , and the next four years were spent assisting Miss Car - penter in her Reformatory and
Ragged School	ORGANIZATION	work .

		Lameness , in consequence of a sprained ankle , terminated these labors ; and
Miss Cobbe	PERSON	's work henceforth , though not less phil - anthropic , was performed chiefly through the medium of the pen .

		Two classes of the op - pressed women and brutes appealed espe - cially to her justice-loving nature , and inspired her to vigorous efforts in their behalf .

		Wo - man Suffrage , the Married Woman 's Property Act , the granting of university degrees to wo - men , the protection of assaulted wives from brutal husbands , are all causes which have owed much to the voice and pen of
Miss Cobbe	LOCATION	.

		But it is in behalf of dumb animals , and as leader of the Anti- Vivisection movement , that her chief energies have been engaged during the last thirty years .

		Her article on '' The Rights of Man and the Claims of Brutes , '' published in ''
Fraser	PERSON	's Magazine '' of
November , 1863	DATE	, was probably the first effort ever made to deal with the moral question involved in the torture of animals , either for the sake of scientific or ther - apeutic research , or for the acquirement of man - ipulative skill .

		Now there are no less than fifty-seven
Anti- Vivisection Societies	ORGANIZATION	in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and the cause is recruiting new friends every day .

		Miss Cobbe gives it as her '' supreme hope '' that '' when , with God 's help , our Anti-Vivisection controversy ends in years to come , long after I have passed away , man - kind will have attained through it , a recogni - tion of our duties towards the lower animals , far in advance of that which we now commonly hold . ''

		Those who know
Miss Cobbe	PERSON	as the author of books so eloquent and ringing as '' The Du - ties of Women , '' so logical and scholarly as the '' Essay on Intuitive Morals , '' so devout and helpful as '' Religious Duty , '' so incisive and sprightly as Re-Echoes , '' will not delay long in seeking the acquaintance of an autobiogra - phy marked by all of these qualities .

		MAYAN HIEROGLYPHICS .

		* Of the native peoples of
North America	LOCATION	, the Mayas had certainly made the greatest ad - vancement in culture and have left the most enduring and interesting monuments .

		At the time of the Spanish Conquest , the Mayas oc - cupied the whole of Yucatan and parts or all of the present states and countries of
Chiapas	LOCATION	,
Tabasco	LOCATION	,
Guatemala	LOCATION	, and
Honduras	LOCATION	.

		Mayas pure in blood and speaking their old language still form the main population of much of that area .

		The Maya language possesses remark - able vitality , and has not only not given way before the Spanish , but has forced itself upon the half-breed and foreign population of Yu - catan .

		The Mayas are '' short , strong , dark , and brachycephalic . ''

		Not quite satisfied with na - ture 's gifts , they formerly shaped their heads into curious forms and perforated or filed their teeth .

		Agriculturists , they raised crops of maize , beans , and peppers for food ; they cul - tivated cotton for clothing ; they raised bees for their wax and honey .

		Fond of bright col - ors in dress , they made much use of gay feath - ers , and dyed their cotton cloths brilliantly .

		They lived in permanent towns , wherein some of the buildings were built of stone and elab - orately carved .

		Their religious ideas were nota - bly developed and deeply influenced the daily life .

		Students have given much attention to the interesting architecture and the written system of the Mayas .

		Yet for a long time , and until quite recently , American students made no further important explorations .

		Then the

		THE DIAL 47 lets bearing hieroglyphs , were among the spec - imens ; most of these are now in the
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	and supply an important material for study .

		In these carvings the in - scriptions are in characters which have been called '' calculif orm '' or pebble-shaped .

		Though much conventionalized in some cases , they are plainly pictorial in origin .

		The inscriptions on walls and monoliths are not the only speci - mens of Mayan writing .

		There are some brief inscriptions on small objects , on stone , and on vases of earthenware .

		There are also a few books .

		The books of the Mayas were long strips of paper made of maguey fibre , which were folded like a screen .

		Upon the pages thus formed were painted in black and various colors strange pictures and characters of the same sort as those engraved on the monuments .

		Most of the Maya books were early destroyed by the Spaniards , but a few still exist in libraries and museums .

		Of those known , four have been accurately reproduced for the use of students .

		In his '' Primer of Mayan Hieroglyphics , '' Dr.
Brinton	PERSON	aims to summarize present knowl - edge of this curious system of writing .

		The work of German , French , English , and
Ameri	PERSON	- can authors is collected , examined , and weighed .

		The number of American workers in the field of translating the Mayan hieroglyphs is not great .


Cyrus Thomas	PERSON	,
Philip Valentine	PERSON	,
Aug.	DATE	.

		Le Plongeon , and Dr.
Brinton	PERSON	are the ones whose writings are best known .

		Authors are not agreed upon very many important points .

		Thus the question whether the characters are pho - netic is still discussed .

		Some , by means of Landa 's '' alphabet '' and other '' keys '' translate everything .

		Others go so far as to say that everything is pictographic and that phonetic characters are wanting .

		Dr.
Brinton	PERSON	occupies a moderate position between these extremes .

		Considering the system as a whole , in its ori - gin , pictographic , he finds many of the char - acters to be of the nature of rebuses .

		At first pictures representing real objects , they have come to represent sounds derived from or sug - gested by the name of the original object .

		In the material studied there are three groups of elements recognized mathematical , pic - torial , graphic .

		The first group , the charac - ters connected with number , is important .

		In their peculiar way the Mayas were great mathe - maticians .

		With a vigesimal system of count - ing , they had distinct names for the various orders of numerals up to the sixth power of twenty .

		Forstemann , who in this matter is fol - lowed by
Brinton	PERSON	, claims that this mathemati - cal knowledge was chiefly of service in religio - astronomical computations .

		The pictorial ele - ments are mainly representations of gods or of sacred objects .

		In identifying them ,
Schellhas	PERSON	has been a chief worker .


Brinton	PERSON	summarizes his work , adding pertinent suggestions .

		The mathematical and pictorial elements , now fairly worked out , form a considerable part of the Mayan inscriptions and texts .

		The remainder the real graphic elements presents great difficulty .

		The signs of days , months , and car - dinal points are known ; the names of some gods have probably been made out .

		Most of the rest remain unconquered .

		In studying them , the characters , most of which are com - posite , must be analyzed into their component parts ; the original picture meaning of these must be determined ; lastly their rebus value , or sound , must be discovered .

		The work will be arduous , but it will probably be done .

		Dr.
Brinton	PERSON	's '' Primer '' will help on the work .

		It supplies the beginner with just what he needs , information as to what and how much others have really gained .

		48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, unaccustomed to the incursions of visitors , and a general unwillingness of the governments to admit foreigners , amounting in some instances to absolute prohibition .

		The condition of isolation which the oriental na - tions have so long maintained , and which some of them yet strenuously insist upon , may be figured , not inaptly , by the physical situation just described .

		Elevated , in their own opinion , far above all other races or peoples , they have entrenched themselves within walls of opinion or of prejudice as massive as their mountains , and moving as slowly as their glaciers .

		Having outlived many more active and progressive nations , it may not be surprising that they should imagine stability of government to be synonymous with perpetuity of custom ; and that they should think it therefore necessary to resist all innovations of persons or of ideas .

		For genera - tions , progress knocked at the gates of isolation , but gained no admission .

		By a display of courteous power ,
Japan	LOCATION	, already ripe for change , was induced to open her doors ; in response to the imperious de - mands of war ,
China	LOCATION	has reluctantly done the same ;
Korea	LOCATION	and
Siam	LOCATION	and Burmah conform in a more kindly fashion .

		But
Great Tibet	LOCATION	sits within her circumvallation of mountains and deserts , beyond the range of gunboats or gatlings , and refuses ad - mission to a single feringhee scout , either traveller or missionary .

		Her contention is that every visitor will be followed by a score ; and that the gates once opened , the isolation so carefully preserved for cen - turies will be irrevocably destroyed .

		No occidental may visit Lassa , or even enter
Tibet	LOCATION	; the native who aids such a visitor , or who even brings a request for admission , no matter in what respectful terms it may be couched , parts company with his head .

		Of the books of travel upon our list , four describe assaults upon the great central plateau and its some - what isolated people ; the other three present views within lands which have lately given admission to the stranger .

		Dr.
Lansdell	PERSON	, who gives to the ac - count of a long and most successful journey , full of interest and adventure , the modest title of '' A Ride to Little Tibet , '' unites in himself the characteris - tics of a traveller , a naturalist , and a pioneer of Christian missions .

		As the result of preceding jour - neys , he has described the northern or
Siberian Asia	LOCATION	, and that part of
Central Asia	LOCATION	which is gov - erned by
Russia	LOCATION	.

		In this journey it was his pur - pose to visit that part of
Central Asia	LOCATION	which is in - cluded in the Chinese Empire , although without the great wall .

		He so arranged his route as to enter this region , as he himself says , by the `` back way '' that is , from the west , crossing the Russian fron - tier , rather than by making the journey from the Chinese seaboard .

		As his friends deemed this pro- cedure extra-hazardous , they endeavored to dissuade him from it ; but by skilful approaches to the gov - ernments of
China	LOCATION	and of
Russia	LOCATION	, supported by his reputation already established with each , and aided by the kind offices of the British diplomatic and consular service , he was enabled so to conduct his travel as to relieve it of every inconvenience not im - posed by natural causes .

		Under instructions which everywhere preceded him , officers were on the alert to anticipate his wants .

		His goods passed frontiers not simply free of duty but free of inspection ; quar - ters , servants , and transportation were freely pro- vided , and even the postal service followed him to the heart of
Asia	LOCATION	.

		What with stalking deer and shooting wild asses , and gathering butterflies to make an entomologist green with envy , his collections in natural history seem to have been limited only by his means of transportation .

		With all this , it should be noted that other interests were constantly sub - ordinated to the great errand on which he had come , which ' was to make reconnaissances for suitable points for missionary stations , and to distribute translations of the Scriptures in lands where they were before unknown .

		These he found everywhere gladly re - ceived , the people offering large prices for books , when the supplies allotted for free distribution in specified localities were exhausted .

		Moving rapidly , as modern conveyances permit , from
London	LOCATION	by way of
St. Petersburg	ORGANIZATION	and the Black and Caspian seas , his first objective point was Kuldja , southeast of
Lake Balkash	LOCATION	, and north of the Thian Shans .

		Thence scaling its northern boundary by the Musart Pass , at an altitude of 12,000 feet , he entered the high basin of Chinese Turkestan , where he established himself at
Kashgar	LOCATION	, a point nearly north from
Bombay	LOCATION	.

		Here , thirty years ago , the
Mohammedan	LOCATION	chieftain ,
Yakub Kham	PERSON	, made against the Chinese Empire a revolt , briefly successful but after a time suppressed , which had its use in admitting a ray of modern daylight into a secluded region .

		Having completed his inspection , and visited
Yarkand	PERSON	and
Khotan	LOCATION	, cities yet but little known , Dr.
Lansdell	PERSON	continued his journey south - ward , crossing in succession the lofty ranges of the Kuen-lun , the Karakorum , and the Himalayahs , by passes each of which had an altitude of more than 17,000 feet .

		The beast of burden available at these great elevations , where horses and men suffer from the rarefaction of the air , is the yak , described as '' a grunting ox with a horse 's tail . ''

		It proved to be sure-footed and easily ridden along precipitous paths of alpine abruptness , encroached upon by glaciers of more than Arctic grandeur .

		The route finally emerged into
Kashmir	LOCATION	, in that part called
Little Tibet	LOCATION	, which gave the title to Dr.
Lansdell	PERSON	's book .

		Great Tibet he could not enter .

		No diplomacy from
England	LOCATION	or from
China	LOCATION	availed anything .

		An autograph letter addressed to the
Grand Lama	LOCATION	by the
Archbishop of Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	, whom Dr.
Lansdell	PERSON	described as the Chief English Lama , failed for want of delivery .

		From Bhotan , from Leh , from Darjeeling , he could only look over into the forbid - den land , which he could not enter .

		The route which Mr.
Shoemaker	PERSON	proposed to fol - low in the country somewhat indefinitely named by him Trans-Caspia , was a little less circuitous than
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL that taken by Dr.
Lansdell	PERSON	, though directed to nearly the same objective points .

		So far as
Tash	PERSON	- kend , they were the same ; thence he went toward
Kashgar	LOCATION	by the passes of the
Alai	PERSON	mountains , rather than by the long detour by the Issik-Kul lake , and the town
Kuldja	PERSON	.

		From
Kashgar	LOCATION	he proposed to enter
Kashmir	LOCATION	by Leh and the passes of the
Kara	PERSON	- korum .

		Mr.
Shoemaker	PERSON	had nearly reached Kash - gar when his farther progress was arrested by fever so serious as to require him to retrace his steps and regain the railway at
Samarkand	LOCATION	.

		The narrative , scarcely more than the introductory chapter of what was designed , is pleasantly written , but subjectively rather than objectively .

		The scene of Mr.
Ballantine	PERSON	's excursion is upon the southern slope of the
Himalayas	LOCATION	.

		Along this portion of the impregnable defense of
Great Tibet	LOCATION	lies a fringe of mountainous country , a strip of ter - ritory five hundred miles long by one hundred and fifty wide , yet unsubdued by the East Indian gov - ernment , and named
Nepal	LOCATION	, from the ascetic Hin - doo saint , Ne .

		The frontier of
Nepal	LOCATION	is reached at a point near
Segowli	LOCATION	, distant by rail from
Cal	LOCATION	- cutta four hundred miles , and from
Khatmandu	LOCATION	, the capital , about one hundred miles .

		The road is merely a track through the jungle , not passable by vehicles , patrolled by dangerous wild beasts ; the traveller must provide his own equipment for camp - ing at night .

		The city occupies a picturesque sit - uation between the spurs of the mountains .

		No one could expect other than mediaeval types ; great wealth existing in temples and shrines , little for the daily life of the people .

		Edifices for religious pur - poses exhibit an impressive architecture of Indian style , profusely enriched , especially with quaintly artistic carvings .

		The most startling event at the time of our traveller 's visit was a change in the gov - ernment , accomplished in the oriental fashion by the assassination of the prime minister and his gen - eral-in-chief of the army .

		The next anabasis is one undertaken from the
East	LOCATION	, under the auspices of the
Smithsonian Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tution , by
William Woodville Rockhill	PERSON	, previously of the
American Embassy	ORGANIZATION	at Peking .

		The objective point was the exploration of part of the great Asian plateau ,
Great Tibet	LOCATION	, and a visit to Lassa or , as he spells it , Lh ` asa the capital city of the grand lama .

		The route chosen was westward from Pe - king , to the vicinity of the lake , Kokonor ; thence over the high lands inhabited by the Mongols of the Kokonor , to the Tengrinor , where he would be within a few days ' march from
Lassa	LOCATION	.

		The journey was conducted as a scientific excursion , rather than as a
summer	DATE	excursion , and the narrative is given in the same spirit .

		The route is laid down with instrumental precision ; altitudes , temperatures , the weather , are carefully noted ; observations are re - corded whenever they have any bearing upon zoolog - ical , ethnological , or allied natural science .

		The record forms a valuable contribution to the geog - raphy of that part of
Asia	LOCATION	which was traversed .

		The reader will sympathize with the regret of the traveller when he found that the decision of the grand lama was consistent with previous refusals , and that he would be compelled to turn again east - ward and conclude his journey at
Shanghai	LOCATION	.

		Some time may yet elapse before any correspondent will date his letters at
Lassa	LOCATION	.

		Since the publication of the voluminous work of Dr.
Williams	PERSON	, we have seen no presentation of
China	LOCATION	and its people more admirable than that of Mr.
Chester Holcombe	PERSON	.

		One hardly needs to say that the Real Chinaman will not be discerned by the most astute tourist whose daily observations fall within daily changing horizons .

		For such a writer , the mental vision , like the physical , sees simply what is before it , is limited by its own aperture , and usually discovers only what it is looking for .

		His narrative describes himself as affected by novel conditions .

		It shows what the reader , if a person similarly constituted , would be likely to find on a similar journey .

		The vision may be truthfully pre - sented , but it is partial , superficial , and misleading in every important generalization .

		Especially in oriental lands , where all the elements of life , char - acter , education , art , are so strangely different from those which have developed the occidental mind , is it necessary that the observer should have the op - portunity given only by extended residence and inti - mate acquaintance , before his senses and his thoughts shall have adjusted themselves to the strange atmos - phere , and he be enabled to discover the real meaning of even everyday occurrences .

		Considering the wide gulf between oriental and occidental ideas , and the usually limited means for proper study , it is doubt - less true that '' the rule in
Western	LOCATION	lands is to mis - understand everything Chinese . ''

		Mr.
Holcombe	PERSON	has made skilful use of the singular advantages of his position as interpreter to the American legation at Peking , and afterward as secretary and acting minister .

		His work is concise , luminous , and of rare interest .


China	LOCATION	is a complete , coherent , and comprehensive organism .

		It is an Endogens .

		Its ideal assumes that every possible condition , social , religious , and political , has been recognized , ana - lyzed , and regulated , both as to substance and eti - quette .

		Revision is needless , alteration impossible .

		Education means the absorption by the memory of the entire regulative code , as it was long since form - ulated and expounded .

		The matter to be learned is , like the language , so wide in its scope and so infinitely multifarious in detail that a long life is too brief for its perfect mastery .

		Its political sys - tem is the r & ductw ad absurdam of what in the western world is the apotheosis of civil service .

		The unit is the family , in which the father is an autocrat ; the son is a vassal ; the daughter is nil .

		The son never becomes '' of age '' ; during his father 's life he may not plant a separate family tree .

		The state is the larger family of which the emperor is the paternal head .

		As he is the supreme father , the fibres of his absolute control permeate the mass of 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, hundreds of millions of people , and unite him per - sonally with the humblest subject , who may not even exchange his winter garments for his
summer	DATE	garb without permission from the vicegerent of heaven .

		Towards the highest power , next to that of the em - peror , any boy in the empire may aspire ; the route lies through a limitless jungle of education , and is marked by endless fences of examination .

		Like its most famous pagoda , the Chinese system is sym - metrical , consistent , finished , and lifeless .

		There is no place for foreign men or alien thought .

		There may be no migration , either inwards or outwards .

		The Chinese educated gentleman is like one of his choicest porcelain vases : elegant in form , polished in surface , artistic in its own way , unchangeable , and hollow .

		The china bowl floating beside the iron pot upon the swollen tide cried '' Keep away , for I am precious '' ; and she might have added fragile .

		Considered as to its own premises , the at - titude which
China	LOCATION	has assumed toward the rest of the world is logically correct .

		The premises are deficient , for they ignore the indispensible element of vitality .

		The irresistible logic of events is driv - ing her on .

		Whether collision come against the elegant bronze of
Japan	LOCATION	, or the rougher iron of
Russia	LOCATION	or of
England	LOCATION	, the porcelain vase of
China	LOCATION	is in imminent danger .

		From
China	LOCATION	to
Korea	LOCATION	Cho-sen , the Land of the Morning Calm the transition is natural .

		Upon Korean soil came the first collision between isola - tion , as championed by
China	LOCATION	, and the youthful virility of progress , as illustrated by rejuvenated
Japan	LOCATION	.

		So much , at least , has been gained by the struggle , whose outcome as yet does not clearly ap - pear , that this land has been opened to the inspec - tion of the world ; and of this opportunity Mr.
Sav	PERSON	- age-Landor has taken early advantage .

		In his brief visit he has seen much , which he has described in - structively .

		Whoever may have glanced at the volumes under consideration will have traversed in imagination the wide continent of
Asia	LOCATION	.

		With
Shoemaker	PERSON	he has stifled in the hot sands of the Black desert ; with
Lansdell	PERSON	has chased butterflies in the glades beneath the
Thian Shan	PERSON	, and struggled on yak-back over the glaciers of the Saser Pass ; with
Ballantine	LOCATION	has gazed at the gorgeous shrines near
Khatmandu	LOCATION	; with Rock - hill has turned sadly away from inhospitable
Tibet	LOCATION	; with
Holcombe	PERSON	has enjoyed a clear glimpse of Chi - nese political and social economy ; and with
Savage	ORGANIZATION	-
Landor	PERSON	has scampered through
Korea	LOCATION	.

		He would not willingly emerge from the glamour and the mys - tery of Asiatic communion , without a look at that farthest and fairest land where the East clasping hands with the West , joins the completed circuit of the world .

		With Mr.
Finck	PERSON	this will be a rapid but pleasant journey .

		We shall see the lovely land in its loveliest garb of Lotus-time .

		The places will be familiar ; for have we not , by proxy , visited all be - fore ?

		the foreign drink-bars of
Yokohama	LOCATION	, and the bright streets of
Tokyo	LOCATION	; ancient
Nikko	ORGANIZATION	, with its tor - rents and temples , its gay bridges and its sombre ave - nues of cryptomerias ; modern
Sapporo	LOCATION	, where a col - lege of agriculture , founded by Americans and taught by Americans , rejoices in
Jersey	LOCATION	cows and the
United States	LOCATION	dialect ;
Hakodate	LOCATION	,
Kyoto	LOCATION	, and imperial Fuji - san , are any of these new to us ?

		But the fresh visit with so versatile a companion will be not less delightful than were its predecessors .

		And if we , like him , have come with a purpose to see what we were looking for , we shall agree that in many respects
Japan	LOCATION	can show to us bustling Americans rare and worthy lessons in civilization of the highest type ; such as kindly love for little children and reverent care of parents ; real politeness , the cherished vin - tage of a thousand years ; a language without pro- fanity ; genuine altruism , and the purest and most unselfish patriotism .

		Even Shinto virtues are not to be despised ; they are , cleanliness , courage , cour - tesy , personal honor , patriotism : against such there is no law -

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		Some beautiful Mrs.
William Starr Dana	PERSON	's `` How new books about to Know the Wild Flowers '' -LRB-
Scrib	ORGANIZATION	- American flowers .

		ner -RRB- seems to have proved a distinct success , the title-page of the revised and enlarged edition now published announcing the twenty-sev - enth thousand of the work .

		In this edition there are fifty-two new plates , making the whole number of flowers pictured one hundred and sixty - four .

		Some sixty new descriptions have also been added , and many of the old ones amplified .

		The drawings are , with two or three exceptions , made directly from nature by Miss
Marion Satterlee	PERSON	.

		A work of similar character and larger scope is the '' Wild Flowers of the North-Eastern States '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , which has been prepared -LRB- both text and drawings -RRB- by Miss
Ellen Miller	PERSON	and Miss
Margaret Christine Whiting	PERSON	.

		This work , we understand , was undertaken some time before the appearance of Mrs.
Dana	PERSON	's book , and its preparation has been a labor of years .

		Three hundred and eight species are included , each having a page of descriptive text and a full-page plate in illustration thereof .

		The most distinctive feature of the work is found in the fact that each drawing -LRB- with two or three exceptions -RRB- gives us the exact dimensions of the specimen from which it was taken .

		If the plant is large , like Acorns Calamus , we have only the section that the page will admit ; if it is small , like Viola sagittata , we have an equally small drawing set in the midst of a great blank space .

		The carrying out of this idea made a large page necessary , and hence the volume is a bulky one .

		Anyone familiar with our wild flowers does not need to be told that the drawings for the pres - ent work have been made with great and loving care , but the following note from the introduction is of interest : '' Days have been pleasantly spent in searching for a specimen which would show most
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 51 typically the particular trick of growth , the charac - teristic gesture which individualized it from all other plants ; often a flower has been drawn and described as it grew , surprised in its familiar haunt . ''

		An Ariscema dracontium , slightly conventionalized , makes a beautiful and striking cover-decoration for this handsome volume .

		Mr.
F. Schuyler Mathews	PERSON	, in his '' Familiar Flowers of Field and Garden '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , has prepared a book to be read rather than referred to , and a charming book it is .

		The drawings are shaded instead of being the mere out - line sketches of the two books just described , and the artist has been extremely successful in getting the characteristic pose of his specimens .

		The de - scriptive text is accurate in fact and engaging in style .

		A peculiar point of excellence is found in the author 's color-vocabulary , which shows how the eye of the painter may be enlisted , and to good pur - pose , in the service of science .

		Mr.
Mathews	PERSON	is not the only student of botany who has been compelled to admit that Gray 's descriptions are often inaccu - rate as far as color is concerned .

		The grouping of species in this book is by months , and an extensive tabular index -LRB- with floral calendar -RRB- is appended .

		The last book in our list is by Mr.
Clarence Moores Weed	PERSON	, and is called '' Ten
New England Blossoms	ORGANIZATION	and Their Insect Visitors '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		As the title indicates , the main interest of the book centres in fertilization , and the author has brought numer - ous curious observations of his own to the store ac - cumulated by his predecessors .

		The subject is always fascinating , and Mr.
Weed	PERSON	brings it easily within the comprehension of the general reader .

		His illustrations , at least the larger ones , are repro - ductions of photographs .

		Mr.
Dana	PERSON	's '' The Art * Newspaper Making '' essays on '' News - -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a small volume into paper Making . ''

		which haye been gat h ere -LRB- J three lec .

		tures by the veteran Mr.
Charles A. Dana	PERSON	.

		The lectures are entitled '' The Modern American News - paper , '' '' The Profession of Journalism , '' and `` The Making of a Newspaper Man . ''

		That they are both readable and instructive goes without saying .

		Mr.
Dana	PERSON	knows his subject and knows how to write entertainingly about it .

		He comes out strong upon the ethics of journalism , and even goes so far as to formulate a code for the profession .

		The jour - nalistic principles thus enunciated are for the most part praiseworthy indeed , but those who have stud - ied the way in which the '' Sun '' practises these principles may possibly be led to think of the '' no - ble sentiments '' of
Joseph Surface	ORGANIZATION	.

		As was to be expected , Mr.
Dana	PERSON	, with the usual phrases about '' getting all the news , '' and '' feeling the popular pulse , '' defends the modern practice of pandering to the instincts of the vulgar , and of printing accounts of all sorts of occurrences over which it were best to draw the veil of reticence . ''

		I have always felt , '' he says , '' that whatever the Divine Providence per - mitted to occur I was not too proud to report . ''

		Of course the real motive of such a policy is to '' sell papers , '' as , for the rest , Mr.
Dana	PERSON	frankly enough admits . ''

		If any one newspaper regularly omitted to give an account of interesting swindles , or for - geries , or murders , the people would stop reading that paper and go off and get one where they could find all the news . ''

		This is the old plea of '' I am no worse than the other fellows , '' and it is as vicious in journalism as it is anywhere else .

		But few among journalists , we fancy , would have the sub - lime effrontery of Mr.
Dana	PERSON	in introducing the Di - vine
Providence	LOCATION	as a witness for the defence .

		We do not care to criticize these lectures in detail .

		Mr.
Dana	PERSON	could not be expected to write any kind of a book without introducing a slur upon President
Cleveland	LOCATION	; in the present instance the slur is both uncalled for and in the worst of taste .

		The arrange - ment of the newspaper hierarchy which places the editor at the head of things , calling him '' the final authority in everything , '' ignores the publisher , who is too often the real head of a newspaper , working the strings of the puppet-editor from the counting - room .

		Mr.
Dana	PERSON	's examples of newspaper poetry are not likely to become classics , and are perhaps best described in the phrase which calls them '' as good an article in that line as ever has been pro- duced in the past . ''

		One of the discoveries of the most iwrcK Hamlet , modern Shakespearian criticism is to the effect that certain of the perplex - ing scenes in
Hamlet	LOCATION	had their origin in the desire for an effect not so much tragic as comic .

		This idea seems very modern indeed ; it gives the mediaeval mind a dazed sort of feeling , mingled with its nat - ural contempt for newfangled notions .

		`` What , what , what ! ''

		says Grandpa ; '' do you mean to say that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	meant to make us laugh in that won - derful scene between Hamlet and
Ophelia ?	ORGANIZATION

		Did he think we should find something Fallstaffian in the awful utterances of the Ghost ?

		Is Hamlet 's mad - ness only a bit for the low comedian ?

		That may be well enough for the higher criticism , but as far as I can see , it 's no more than the most arrant non - sense . ''

		It is not long ago that Mr.
Wendell	PERSON	informed the world of Shakespearian scholars that Mr.
John Corbin	PERSON	-LRB- now `` of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	and Oxford '' -RRB- was pre - pared to maintain some such thesis as that indicated above , and not long afterward appeared Mr.
Cor	PERSON	- bin 's book itself `` The Elizabethan Hamlet '' -LRB- im - ported by
Scribners	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a very interesting little book .

		For some time it has been an idea of the stu - dents of '' quellengeschichten '' that a good deal could be found out concerning the lost play of
Hamlet	LOCATION	, which , as we know from various bits of evidence , was in existence some ten years or more before the Shakespearian Hamlet was written .

		The story it was written from is known ; two plays are also known for which it presumably furnished the original
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Hamlet and a German play .

		One would say that we should be able to get something of a notion of the play itself .

		This is the basis of Mr.
Corbin	PERSON	's study , which is well carried out , but his 52 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, idea is not merely a bit of reconstruction ; his chief intention is to bring forth something that will make a little less remarkable some of the difficulties and inconsistencies which have arisen in the study of Hamlet and which indeed seem to belong to the play itself .

		The book makes it pretty clear that in the old play there was a comic strain which , according to the humor of the time , included much that to us would not be comic at all , that there is a good deal of the old tragedy left in the Hamlet we are famil - iar with , and finally that some rather perplexing things in the modern Hamlet may be traced to this source .

		These are interesting points , and Mr.
Cor	PERSON	- bin sustains them sufficiently by the various means at the disposition of the student of the Elizabethan drama .

		The book is a good example of a study in literary sources that is of really practical use in mak - ing some masterpiece more comprehensible .

		Three figures in American literature .

		That part of the public who believe that
America	LOCATION	, if she has not yet reached her intellectual golden age , has at any rate evolved a written product which should excite the interest of all her loyal sons , will welcome a new book by Professor
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	, called `` Three Men of Letters '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , and issued between two important epochs in his monu - mental history of our literature .


George Berkeley	PERSON	, hitherto greeted mainly as the author of '' West - ward the course of empire takes its way , '' here ap - pears as the philanthropic idealist who would have dedicated this nation in its early day to learning and religion , by means of the mammoth university which
Walpole	LOCATION	's politic but broken promise failed to support with financial aid .

		President
Dwight	PERSON	of
Yale	ORGANIZATION	is depicted as the ascetic student seeking men - tal liberation through starvation of body , and as the author of the imitative pastoral poem , ''
Greenfield Hill	PERSON	. '' ''

		The Columbiad . ''

		one of our early would-be epics , far greater in conception than in execution , is described in connection with the ambition , the self-complacency , and the miscellaneous avocations of its author , Mr.
Joel Barlow	PERSON	.

		It is profitable to see these figures against the background of contem - porary
Europe	LOCATION	, to know that Swift 's `` Vanessa '' left Dean
Berkeley	LOCATION	a cozy legacy , that the amiable
Cowper	PERSON	criticised
Dwight	PERSON	's inevitable epic and praised one of his sermons , that
Barlow	PERSON	, in the troublous time of the Reign of Terror , was made a French citizen by the
National Convention	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such unexpected historical encounters , together with the author 's pure style , his lurking humor , his occasional tone of mild satire not preventing full and cordial appreciation , make the little book delightful to read and a charming earnest of greater things to come .

		The study of crime and the criminal !

		* now popular .

		Within a few years a whole literature in
Crimin	LOCATION	- ology or Criminal Anthropology -LRB- the latter an un - fortunate term -RRB- has grown up .

		In the book before us , `` The Female Offender , '' by
Caesar Lombroso	PERSON	and
William Ferreri	PERSON	, we have the first volume in a '' Criminology Series '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		There may be question as to the wisdom of greatly '' populariz - ing '' the subject .

		Everyone would promptly ad - mit that judges , lawyers , teachers , leaders of all kinds , ought to know the recent studies upon crim - inals , and to fully realize that '' born criminals '' exist , that degeneration in physical structure and mental endowment often accompany and evidence moral imbecility , and that many a criminal is only an unfortunate and irresponsible being .

		But it is certain that too much multiplication and populariz - ation of these ideas will remove the feeling of re - sponsibility from weak but normal or from slightly abnormal natures and lead to much unnecessary crime .

		Whether a '' criminology series '' work good or harm depends much upon its editor .

		The Messrs.
Appletons	PERSON	have been fortunate in their choice of Mr.
W. Douglass Morrison	PERSON	for so delicate a task .

		His introductory chapter to this volume is one of the clearest and simplest presentations of the claims of criminology in any language .

		As for the book itself , it considers woman as
Lombroso	LOCATION	's Uomo De - linquente -LRB- Criminal Man -RRB- considered man .

		The woman criminal is studied physically and mentally .

		The work has most of the strong and weak points of its predecessor , but , on the whole , is more cau - tious and conservative .

		After analysis of the crim - inal woman , a synthesis of elements is made and several types are studied the born criminal , the occasional criminal , the criminal of passion , and hysterical and epileptic criminals .

		The publishers have done their part well , but we must regret the wretched system of numbering and referencing the rather poor plates which illustrate the work .

		The editor might properly have improved here upon the customary slipshod methods of the famous author .

		A fascinating ac - N .

		other P hase of nineteenth-century count of the `` Lib - history offers so tempting a theme eration of
Italy	LOCATION	. ''

		f or historical treatment as the Italian Risorgimento .

		The right man for the task has not yet appeared , and perhaps the time is not quite ripe for his appearance , but when he comes he will find ready to his hand a story no less interesting than that of the French Revolution , the English Com - monwealth , or the repulse of the Persian by the Greek .

		Meanwhile , the story has been outlined by a number of writers , although such treatment as it has yet received , even at the hands of
Reuchlin	LOCATION	, is obviously provisional .

		In English , three attempts to tell the story have been made : that of Mr.
John Webb Probyn	PERSON	, clean-cut and matter-of-fact ; that of Mr.
William Roscoe Thayer	PERSON	, sympathetic but ver - bose ; and that of the Countess Martinengo-Cesar - esco , called `` The Liberation of
Italy	LOCATION	, 1815-1870 , '' and just now published in the '' Events of Our Own Time '' series -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The author has had pecu - liar advantages in the preparation of this work .

		She has known many of the Italian leaders , has had ac - cess to a great number of unpublished documents , and has visited the scenes of most of the events

		THE DIAL 53 The fifth issue of the '' Yellow Book .

		chronicled .

		On this latter point , she writes : `` I am familiar with almost all the places where they occurred , from the heights of Calatafimi to the un - happy rock of Lissa . ''

		This has given her the advantage that
Curtius	PERSON	had in writing the history of
Greece	LOCATION	, and
Colonel T. A. Dodge	ORGANIZATION	in describing the battles of his '' Great Commanders . ''

		Inspired throughout by intense sympathy for the Italian cause , and written from abundant knowledge in an attractive style , this book may be read as one reads a novel , and with interest equally unabated . ''

		The Yellow Book '' has been made the victim of a good deal of abuse on account of its decadent tendencies in both literature and art , the abuse , although ex - travagant , not being entirely unwarranted .

		But the publication seems to survive in spite of attack , and now comes up smiling with its fifth quarterly issue , dated
April , 1895	DATE	, and supplied in this country by
Messrs. Copeland & Day	ORGANIZATION	.

		Among the contents of this volume we note an amusing story by Mr.
H. D. Traill	PERSON	; a forced and turgid ode by Mr.
William Watson	PERSON	; '' The Phantasies of Philarete , '' a story by Mr.
James Ashcrof	PERSON	t Noble ; one of Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	's finely-chiselled sonnets ; a charming sketch -LRB- in French -RRB- by
M. Anatole France	PERSON	, and an appreciative study of that writer by the Hon.
Maurice Baring	PERSON	.

		A periodical that can boast of such collaboration as this , and of contributions by Messrs.
Gosse	PERSON	,
Ken	PERSON	- neth
Grahame	PERSON	,
Henry Harland	PERSON	, and
John Davidson	PERSON	besides all within the compass of a single issue need not fear to lift its head boldly in the most crit - ical of literary circles .

		For the art of the present volume , there is not much to be said .

		It is some - times interesting , but that is all .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		A Reader 's Guide to Contemporary Literature '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a '' First Supplement '' to Mr.
William Swan Sonnenschein	PERSON	's `` The Best Books , '' published in
1891	DATE	.

		It is practically a classified list of all the books of any importance published during the past five years in the principal languages of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		In many cases , brief characterizations of the books are given .

		Enormous labor must have gone to the preparation of this vol - ume , which contains nearly eight hundred quarto pages , and which is simply indispensable to the librarian as well as to collectors or students in special fields .

		The exquisite Dent series of volumes devoted to '' The Lyric Poets '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- now includes a selection of '' Lyrical Poetry from the Bible , '' edited by Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	.

		The selections are mostly from the Psalms and the Book of Job .

		There is an introductory essay which says fitly the things that should be said in such a place , and an appended '' historical synopsis '' of the selections printed .

		A second volume , to contain passages from the Prophets and the Song of Songs , is promised .

		For frontispiece ,
Blake	PERSON	's '' When the morning stars sang together '' is reproduced .

		For the '' English Readings '' series of text-books -LRB- Holt -RRB- , Mr.
Clinton Scollard	PERSON	has prepared a carefully - annotated edition of
Ford	ORGANIZATION	's '' The Broken Heart . ''

		We are glad to see that noble tragedy thus brought into the classroom .

		Mr.
Hammond Lament	PERSON	, in the same series , collects into a small volume a dozen of what he calls '' Specimens of Exposition , '' for the purpose of training the student in preparing analyses of extended discus - sions .

		The selections range from
Mommsen	PERSON	to a
New York	LOCATION	newspaper , and , in subject , from the steam-engine to
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		Another help for the instructor in English is Professor
Cornelius B. Bradley	PERSON	's volume of `` Orations and Arguments by English and American Statesmen '' -LRB-
Allyn	PERSON	-RRB- .

		There are nine examples : two from
Burke	PERSON	, one each from
Chatham	LOCATION	,
Erskine	LOCATION	,
Webster	PERSON	,
Macaulay	LOCATION	,
Calhoun	PERSON	,
Seward	LOCATION	, and
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

		What trance Has touched you now ?

		By all the gods above , Leave us this sweet romance .

		You '11 next abolish all the knights a-tilt Beneath the light of golden ladies ' eyes , And all the rainbow circle poets built That sat to judge the prize .

		No gallant knight e'er pricked along the plain Keen the fire-breathing dragon to oppose , Or in his woodland dream was ever fain To pluck the Rose .

		You '11 take the very rose itself away , With all the long-drawn sweet of its romaunt ; My iridescent dragon , too , you '11 say Those woods did never haunt .

		No Courts of Love !

		What pall is this comes down On all the widespread stillness of the place ?

		No Courts of Love , no queen , no rose , no crown !

		79 A YEAR OF
CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITERATURE I .

		In pursuance of a long-established custom , '' The Athenaeum '' for
July 6	DATE	publishes a se - ries of articles upon the literary output of the past year in the chief countries of
Continental Europe	ORGANIZATION	.

		These articles are fourteen in num - ber , and include every country of any literary importance , with the single exception of Port - ugal .

		We propose , as in past years , to sum - marize the more important information pre - sented by these articles , in our present issue taking up
France	LOCATION	and
Belgium	LOCATION	together with the countries of Teutonic speech , and reserving for a subsequent review the remaining articles , chiefly devoted to the countries of Southern and
Eastern Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		Literary activity in
France	LOCATION	, '' writes
M. Joseph Reinach	PERSON	, '' continues to be extremely prolific ; indeed , the output becomes greater in quantity year by year , but it would scarcely be true to say that during the last twelve months its quality has been either exceptionally bril - liant or of particularly solid merit . ''

		It is still the fashion in
France	LOCATION	to publish memoirs , and '' everybody 's sons and grandsons are busy ran - sacking the family desks and drawers in the search for letters and other ' remains ' of their forbears . ''

		The most important works of this class have been the memoirs of the
Chancelier Pasquier	PERSON	, of General
Thiebaud	PERSON	, and of Barras .

		Barras has been something of a disappointment . ''

		His scandalous chatter offers no serious rev - elations ; the man , save for his performances on the 9th of Therrnidor , was one of the most vulgar figures in the history of the Revolution , and his untrustworthiness as a historian is only equalled by his duplicity as a statesman . ''

		In contemporary history the following publications have been noticeable : Two volumes of a '' His - toire Generale du Second Empire , '' by
M. de la Gorce	ORGANIZATION	; a continuation of M. Alfred Du - quet 's ''
Histoire Militaire du Siege	ORGANIZATION	de
Paris	LOCATION	par les Prussiens , '' '' the most important work dealing with the war of
1870	DATE	which has yet been published in
France	LOCATION	'' ; the first volume of
M. Emile Ollivier	PERSON	's '' L'Empire Liberal '' ; and General
Lebrun	PERSON	's posthumous book on his se - cret embassy to
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		Among political works are mentioned
M. J. J. Weiss	PERSON	's post - humous '' Combats Constitutionals , ''
M. Rene Millet	PERSON	's '' L'Expansion de
France	LOCATION	, '' and
M. Eugene Eichthal	PERSON	's '' Souverainete du Peuple et Gouvernement . ''

		M. Brunetiere 's article on the '' bankruptcy of science '' and
M. Berthol	PERSON	- ot 's reply thereto have both been published in permanent form .

		In literary history and crit - icism , mention is made of
M. Gaston Paris	PERSON	, 62 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, with his lectures on the poetry of the Middle Ages ;
M. Monod	PERSON	, with his studies of
Taine	PERSON	,
Renan	PERSON	, and
Michelet	PERSON	; the '' Livre du
Centen	PERSON	- aire de 1 ` Ecole Normale '' ; and half a dozen volumes in the series of '' Grands Ecrivains Fran ^ ais . ''

		Important works of art include the sixth volume of '' L'Histoire de 1 ` Art dans 1 ` An - tiquite , '' by MM .

		Perrot et
Chipiez	LOCATION	; `` L'His - toire Ancienne des Peuples de FOrient Clas - sique , '' by
M. Maspero	PERSON	; the completion of
M. Miintz	PERSON	's '' Histoire de 1 ` Art pendant la Ren - aissance Italienne '' ; the beginning of M. Col - lignon 's '' Histoire de la Sculpture Grecque , '' and
M. Gaston Boissier	PERSON	's essays on `` L'Afrique Romaine . ''

		It is interesting to learn that
M. Perrot	PERSON	'' is a stylist as well as a savant '' and that '' his prose is always limpid and elegant . ''

		Readers of the astonishingly bad English trans - lation of his work would hardly suspect him of such qualities .

		In travel and description ,
M. Bourget	PERSON	's '' Outre-Mer , '' and ''
Pierre Loti	PERSON	's '' two books on `` Jerusalem '' and '' Le Desert , '' are singled out for a few words of praise .

		The only thing really new and noteworthy in poetry seems to have been the '' Pleureuses `` of
M. Henri Barbusse	PERSON	, '' less a series of pieces than one long poem purely subjective in tone , and touched in the form of a reverie , telling of the charm of mourning and shadows , of solitude and sorrow . ''

		The most brilliant work of fic - tion produced by the year is '' Le Lys Rouge '' of
M. Anatole France	PERSON	. ''

		It is true that we are getting rather tired of aristocratic liaisons , and some passages in this book are outrageously licentious .

		But it is a flawlessly beautiful piece of prose , and the descriptions of
Florence	LOCATION	are a series of exquisite pictures .

		No one has ever succeeded in conveying the peculiar charm of - that delightful city more completely than M.
France	LOCATION	. ''

		The same author has published '' Le Jardin d'Epicure , '' a volume of philosophical chats , and '' Le Puits de Sainte-Claire , '' a col - lection of tales .

		The most noteworthy of other novels are '' Les Demi-Vierges '' of M. Pre - vost , '' L' Armature '' of
M. Hervieu	PERSON	, the Myrrha '' of
M. Lemaitre	PERSON	, the '' Fors 1 ` Hon - neur '' of
M. Margueritte	PERSON	, and '' Le Silence '' and '' Les Roches Blanches '' of
M. Edouard Rod	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor
Paul Fredericq	PERSON	is the Belgian con - tributor to this series , and lays particular stress upon the department of social science , instanc - ing the '' Essais et Etudes '' of
Emile de Lavel	PERSON	- eye , the '' Depression Economique et Sociale '' of
M. Hector Denis	PERSON	, and the '' Organisation de la Liberte et le Devoir Social '' of
M. A. Prins	PERSON	, among other works upon social problems . ''

		Les Mysteres de Mithra , '' by Professor
Cu	ORGANIZATION	- mont , and an '' Etude Historique sur les Cor - poration Professionnelles chez les Remains , '' by Professor
J. P. Waltzing	PERSON	, are named as the most important publications in ancient history .

		Passing by the books of travel and of Belgian history enumerated , we come to literature proper .


M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	, it seems , while being himself translated into Polish and other lan - guages , has been translating
Emerson	PERSON	and No - valis into French .

		In literary history , there is Professor
Thomas	PERSON	's '' Histoire de la Littera - ture Latine jusqu'aux Antonins , '' and
M. Paul Hamelius	PERSON	's ''
Histoire Politique	ORGANIZATION	et Litteraire du
Mouvement Flamand	PERSON	. ''

		Flemish literature also flourishes , counting among its products the '' Letterkundige Studien '' of
M. Rooses	PERSON	, '' De j3Esthetieck van het Lyrisch Drama '' of
M. A. Cornette	PERSON	, and volumes of poems by Mile .


Hilda Ram	PERSON	,
M. Emmanuel Hiel	PERSON	, and
M. Pol de Mont.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fiction is represented chiefly by the '' Boerenkrijg '' of M. van den Bergh , a story of the insurrection of the peasants of Flanders against the conscription of the first French Republic ; ''
Sursum Corda	PERSON	, '' by
M. Cyriel Buysse	PERSON	, a novel descriptive of the aristocratic classes , with their narrowness , their prejudice , and their complete subjection to clerical dicta - tion ; and two novels '' Eene Idylle '' and `` De Bruid des Heeren '' by Mile .

		Virginie Love - ling , '' the chief of modern Flemish prose writers . ''

		It is an easy transition from
Belgium	LOCATION	to Hol - land , and we turn to M. Taco de Beer 's report from the latter country . ''

		The younger gen - eration have most of them abandoned poetry altogether , '' he says ; the reader who wishes to know what they have done is referred to
Heer van Hall	PERSON	's '' Dichters van
Onzen Tijd	PERSON	, '' an ex - cellent anthology .

		Dr.
Jan	PERSON	ten
Brink of Ley	ORGANIZATION	- den has begun the publication of an illustrated history of literature in
the Netherlands	LOCATION	.

		Un - interrupted activity is shown in historical writ - ing .

		In fiction , the tale of country life and the novel of the Dutch colonies are mentioned as two species that seem to be dying out .

		A few novels are singled out for extended men - tion , but none of them described with much enthusiasm .

		Among these are the '' Geheiligd '' of Miss
Marie Gyzen	PERSON	, the '' Zonder Illusie '' of Mrs.
Therese Hoven	PERSON	, and the ''
Sascha	PERSON	'' of a new author who calls himself '' Prosper van Haamstede '' for purposes of the pen .

		The article on
Germany	LOCATION	, by
Hofrath Zim	ORGANIZATION	- mermann , is much the longest of the series .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 63 To begin with , he tells of volumes of poetry without end , describing at considerable length the ''
Robespierre	LOCATION	'' epic of Frl .

		delle Grazie and the didactic poem '' Faust und Prome - theus '' of
Herr Hango	PERSON	.

		In the former , '' the author developes her conception of the French Revolution in a series of varied , effective pic - tures , sometimes , however , degenerating into coarseness . ''

		Of the latter we read : '' His
Faust	PERSON	is not
Gretchen 's Faust	PERSON	, but his ' grand - son ' ; it is not love-making , but investigation of the universe , that engages him ; Prometheus , the thief of fire , kindles the torch for him , too , which illumines the darkness of the eternal riddle of nature and humanity .

		Dealing with the science of to-day , whose teachings he ren - ders in luminous parables and melodious verses , the poet , with commendable outspokenness , declares himself against the lawlessness that follows in its train as well as the gloomy pes - simism which is built up upon it . ''

		Herr Nor - dau has published a play , '' Die
Kugel	PERSON	, '' which has not proved successful .


Herr Sudermann	PERSON	's comedy , '' Die Schmetterlingsschlacht , '' was a failure in
Berlin	LOCATION	and a success in
Vienna	LOCATION	.

		It '' is more suggestive of a contest between loath - some , poisonous spiders than one between light but lovely butterflies . ''

		The same writer has scored the greatest success of the year in fic - tion with his novel '' Es War . '' ''

		A deep moral tone breathes through the whole ; the descriptions of the country and the people that appear in it have a North German , or , to be more accurate , East Prussian character ; the local coloring of the language , the mode of thought , the conduct of life , are singularly successful . ''


Herr Spielhagen	PERSON	's latest novel , '' Stumme des Himmels , '' is described as lack - ing in lifelike character .

		It '' possesses neither a political nor a social purpose ; it only deals with a question of society , and a tolerably well - worn one , being an onslaught 011 aristocratic prejudices . ''

		The '' professorial '' novel seems to be played out , neither the '' Cleopatra '' of
Herr Ebers	PERSON	nor the ''
Julian	PERSON	der Abtriinnige '' of
Herr Dahn	PERSON	having succeeded in effacing the memory of their predecessors .

		Other fiction of note includes `` Wider den Kurfiirsten , '' by
Herr Hans Hoffmann	PERSON	, a tale of the siege of
Stettin	LOCATION	in
1678	DATE	; `` Die Martinsklause , '' by
Herr Ludwig Ganghofer	PERSON	; and shorter stories by
Herr Heyse	PERSON	and
Frau von Ebner-Eschenbach	PERSON	.

		Bismarck literature naturally cuts a large fig - ure in the work of the year , and includes a five - volume biography by
Herr Hans Blum	PERSON	, a col - lection of
Fiirst Bismarck	ORGANIZATION	's speeches , a new volume of '' Tischgesprache '' -LRB- including some interesting conversations with Motley -RRB- , and even the first issue of a Bismarck '' Jahrbuch . ''

		Professor von Sybel 's '' Geschichte der Be - griindung des Deutschen Reichs durch Wil - helm I. , '' of which the sixth and seventh vol - umes have appeared during the year , is vir - tually a biography of the Iron Chancellor .

		Goethe literature is represented by
Herr Rich	PERSON	- ard Meyr 's essays , and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	literature by
Herr E. Bormann	PERSON	's '' Shakespeare-Geheim - niss , '' which latter , '' in its curious handling of the Shakespeare-Bacon controversy , surpasses all its American and European predecessors in grotesque invention .

		According to this author ,
Bacon	PERSON	's Instauratio
Magna	ORGANIZATION	consists of two parts , the one scientific and written in prose under his own name , the other symbolic , in dramatic form , under the pseudonym Shake - speare .


Herr Bormann	PERSON	finds hints of the solu - tion of this riddle , in particular in the names of the characters ; thus in '
Hamlet	PERSON	' the soldier Francisco is no other than
Francis Bacon	PERSON	, while
Horatio	PERSON	, who to
Bernardo	PERSON	's question , ' What , is Horatio here ? '

		replies , ' A piece of him , ' de - sired thereby to designate the wisdom -LRB- Ho - ratio -RRB- of
Bacon	LOCATION	, which was embodied in him ! ''


Germany	LOCATION	has lost two great men during the year ,
Freytag	PERSON	and
Carriere	PERSON	.

		Of the latter , described as '' the most eloquent and purest representative '' of idealism , there have been published three books : '' Christus , '' ''
Das Wachsthum	PERSON	der Energie , '' and ''
Fichte	ORGANIZATION	's
Geis	PERSON	- tesentwickelung . ''

		They `` breathe the same enthusiastic inspiration , and reveal the same passion for beauty '' as the older works by which
Carriere	ORGANIZATION	is so widely known .

		Dr.
Alfred Ipsen	PERSON	, writing of Danish litera - ture , tells us that
Denmark	LOCATION	exhibits some symp - toms of a renascence of poetry , and , in fiction , '' a tendency toward symbolism and sundry vague forms of mysticism . ''


Herr Drachmann	PERSON	has , in '' Vblund Smed , '' given political hand - ling to a familiar Eddaic myth , the work being characterized by an '' exuberant and some - what sentimental sensuousness . ''


Herr J. Jor	PERSON	- gensen 's '' Bekendelse '' is a beautiful collec - tion of poems . ''

		A characteristic of this au - thor , as of others of the younger generation , is a certain monotony and a total absence of ideas ; everything is emotional with them , and there is a tone of archaism in their imagery . ''

		The most important novel of the year is '' Hjarl , '' by
Herr Einar Christiansen	PERSON	. ''

		The book is by no means sensational , but recounts plainly and quietly the story of a young man from his boy -
64	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, hood in a rich , aristocratic , but somewhat mo - notonous home , his hopes and strivings and his disappointments and shortcomings , telling it in an earnest tone , which moves the reader with - out being in the least sentimental . ''

		Another noteworthy novel is by
Herr Schandorph	PERSON	, called '' The College Years of
Vilhelin Vang	PERSON	, '' which pictures `` the hidden opposition between in - herited culture and the modern plutocracy . '' ''

		As for books on literature , the year has fur - nished a crop uncommonly rich in quality .

		There are at least two voluminous studies of more than usual ability : a monograph on Swed - ish Romanticism -LRB- the literature of the first half of the present century -RRB- , a beautiful book written in a somewhat rough style , by
Herr V. Vedel	PERSON	; and a large monograph on
Poul Mol	ORGANIZATION	- ler , a Danish poet of the same period , by
Herr Vilhelm Andersen	PERSON	, a young and promising stu - dent of our literature . ''


Norway	LOCATION	was not represented in the ''
Athen	LOCATION	- aeum '' summary of a year ago , and perhaps it is for this reason that the Norwegian corre - spondent , Dr.
C. Brinchmann	PERSON	, does not confine himself to the happenings of a single year , but roves somewhat indefinitely over the whole field of recent literature .

		He purposely says little of the two men who chiefly represent
Norwe	PERSON	- gian literature , because their recent works are already familiar enough to English readers .

		The man who stands next to them in import - ance is Herr Lie , whose latest work , ''
Lystige Koner	PERSON	, '' is not a novel , but a play .

		It is said to have made `` rather a weak impression . ''


Herr Garborg	PERSON	has just published a tale in verse , '' Haugtussa , '' in which '' he relates the sad love story of a young peasant girl who grows up amongst the cattle and the ling - covered hills .

		The girl is a visionary who holds con - verse with fairies and other supernatural be - ings , and some parts of the book contain so much naively gentle poetry that one is amazed how Garborg 's morbidly reflective mind could have produced it . '' ''

		Det Store Lod , '' the lat - est piece of
Herr Gunnar Heiberg	PERSON	, the dram - atist , '' describes the influence of money on an enthusiastic idealist . ''


Herr Knut Hamsun	PERSON	, one of the newer men , is made the subject of a paragraph , which concludes with mention of '' Pan , '' characterized as '' a wonderful book , notable for deep and genuinely poetic descrip - tions of nature and daring love scenes , '' and the drama , '' Ved Rigets Port , '' a '' weak and rather ordinary production . ''

		The best known of women writers ,
Camilla Collett	PERSON	, died a few months ago , and we are told of the rest that , with the exception of Fru Amalie Skram , they '' scarcely need to be mentioned from the point of view of art . ''

		Other items of interest are the continuation of
Herr Jaeger	PERSON	's history of Norwegian literature , and
Herr Collin	PERSON	's `` Kunst og Moral , '' which `` gallantly takes the field against the immoralities of naturalism , and warmly insists that the laws of morality should be respected even in art . ''

		Swedish literature , with which we close this section of our summary , is discussed by
Herr Hugo Tigerschiold	PERSON	. ''

		The Swedish poetical temperament , strongly influenced by its natural environment of vast and sombre forests , widely extending lakes , and foss-broken streams , is fundamentally lyrical .

		The simple , melan - choly tone of a folk-song runs through all true Swedish poetry . ''

		A number of lyrists have published during the past year , representing both the older and the newer schools .

		Real - ism , it seems , is losing its hold in
Sweden	LOCATION	, and '' a strong bent towards romanticism and sym - bolism is observable in every direction . ''

		This dictum is illustrated by mention of several works of fiction , the most noticeable being Fru Mailing 's `` En Roman om Forste Konsuln . ''

		This book is described as '' containing un - usually elegant and intimate sketches of the most remarkable personages who lived during the earlier stage of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's career .

		With the exception of Napoleon himself , who is too romantically drawn , and the heroine -LRB- the youth - ful Edmee -RRB- , a prettily poetic creature , the other numerous personages in the romance are excellent portraits .

		This romance , which tes - tifies to careful study , especially of the memoir writers of the period , is marked by quite an extraordinary power of vivid and concentrated character-sketching . ''

		The
Bellman	PERSON	and
Gus	PERSON	- taf Adolf commemorative festivals , both held during the past year , are discussed at some length , and each has stimulated the production of a considerable literature .


Herr Victor Ryd	PERSON	- berg is represented by ''
Varia	PERSON	, '' a volume con - taining the '' pieces written by him of late years , pieces in which the author , with youthful en - thusiasm , goes forth to combat modern mater - ialism . ''


Herr Tigerschiold	ORGANIZATION	's paper ends with the following bit of news : '' The Swedish Au - thors ' Union , which published its first literary calendar at
Christmas	LOCATION	, with contributions from many of our most eminent authors , has peti - tioned the Government for several necessary modifications to the legislation referring to lit - erature , with a view to
Sweden	LOCATION	's accession to the
Berne Convention	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		THE DIAL 65 ftfje Nefo `` THE COMING CONTmENT . ''

		*
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's prediction that in the twen - tieth century
Africa	LOCATION	would be the cynosure of every eye seems already in a fair way of ful - filment .

		According to a later dictum , of
Lord Salisbury	PERSON	, '' foreign politics '' already means for England African politics ; and what
Europe	LOCATION	in general thinks of the natural resources and political possibilities of the '' coming continent '' may be gathered from the broad fact that of its total area of 12,000,000 square miles she has left unappropriated only about 1,000,000 , which are confined to the sandy wastes of the Libyan Desert and the powerful and inacces - sible States of the Soudan .

		Africa contains about one-quarter of the land of the globe , her area being more than thrice
Europe	LOCATION	's , or almost as much as North and
South America	LOCATION	's com - bined ; and as one-fifth of her surface consists of rich savannas , and one-half of imperfectly tilled fields and fairly fertile virgin soil , the Malthusian danger in its broader aspect would seem to be , in our era of swift transport and world-wide commercial solidarity , relegated to the dim future , even for the populous countries of
Western Europe	LOCATION	.

		A popular general account of this deeply interesting transitional
Africa	LOCATION	of to-day , with its unique confrontation of the old and the new , the polished and the barbaric , which may serve in lieu of first-hand impressions that very few of us are likely to attain , is a need which is now satisfactorily met by Mr.
Frank Vin	PERSON	- cent 's `` Actual Africa . ''

		Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	is a veteran traveller who needs no introduction in that capacity to our readers ; and his latest work shows the same modest merits of pith and literalness of statement , and abstention from heightened colors and strained contrasts , which have made his widely-read volume on
South America	LOCATION	a favorite with readers in want of plain information .

		Leaving to more florid pens the task of painting the marvels and dilating on the mysterious and legendary past of the mighty continent that has inspired the literary fancy since the times of
Herodotus	ORGANIZATION	and
Strabo	PERSON	, he contents himself with setting forth in sim - ple prose such simple facts of actual observa - tion as any plain traveller seeking information would wish to gather for himself .

New York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		flavor of the guide-book is now and then mani - fest in Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	's work , that does not , at least , impair its usefulness . ''

		Actual Africa '' is the fruit of two years ' travel , within which period the continent was circled , and several deep dips were taken into the interior notably one , by river and caravan-road , to the capital of the famous Basongo chieftain ,
Pania Mu	ORGANIZATION	- tembo , in the heart of the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Nearly all the capitals and large towns , native and foreign , of the seaboard countries were visited ;
Madagascar	LOCATION	was traversed ; a long ex - cursion was made through the centre of the
Boer Republics	ORGANIZATION	and British Colonies ; the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	,
Quanza	LOCATION	,
Congo	LOCATION	,
Kassai	ORGANIZATION	,
Sankuru	LOCATION	, and
Kuilu	PERSON	rivers were ascended ; and a detour was made by
Madeira	LOCATION	, the Canaries , and the
Cape Verdes	LOCATION	.

		The author 's attention was about evenly divided between the native States , with their depen - dencies , on the one hand , and European pos - sessions and protectorates , on the other ; and it may perhaps be objected that a rather dis - proportionate amount of space -LRB- over a third of the volume -RRB- is given to the already familiar Mediterranean countries , which are now well within the orbit even of '' conducted '' tourists .

		Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	is a quick observer and a succinct writer ; and while anything like a fair resume of his very copious record is out of the ques - tion here , a few random passages from the more noteworthy chapters may serve as samples of the whole .

		An interesting account is given of
Kimber	PERSON	- ley , the capital and centre of the diamond min - ing district .

		Kimberley is a progressive mod - ern city , with its population of 30,000 , its tramways , electric lighting , cabs , good shops , hotels , theatres , daily papers , and
Botanical Garden	ORGANIZATION	.

		The four great mines , the
Kimberley	PERSON	, the De Beers , and the Bulfontein and Dutoits - pan , lie on the outskirts of the town , and are now united under the control of the
De Beers Consolidated Mines	ORGANIZATION	, Limited , with a capital of
$ 20,000,000	MONEY	, a sum about equalling the annual output .

		During the past twenty years
South Africa	LOCATION	has exported over fifty millions of car - ats of diamonds , of a total value of
$ 375,000	MONEY	, - 000 ; so that , a carat equalling four grains , the weight of diamonds exported has amounted to about fifteen tons !

		The
Kimberley	PERSON	gems pre - sent a great variety of colors green , blue , pink , brown , yellow , orange , etc. , with the in - termediate tints .

		The stones vary in size from those of that of a pin 's head to one found a few years ago in the De Beers Mine , which weighed in the rough 428 | carats , and measured -LRB- un - 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, cut -RRB- nearly two inches through the longest axis .

		About 12,000 natives are now employed , night and day , in the mines , under the supervision of some 1300 Europeans . ''

		Formerly there was a great deal of diamond steal - ing by native diggers and dishonest buying by white merchants .

		It is even said that these thieves stole one - quarter of the entire yield .

		Improved methods of sur - veillance are rapidly diminishing this loss .

		Now none but authorized agents are permitted to purchase or pos - sess rough diamonds , a large detective force is employed , and the natives are domiciled and confined in ' com - pounds ' or villages , enclosed by high walls , with doors of sheet iron . ''

		At the Kimberley Mine the author inspected one of these '' compounds '' a great square lined by iron sheds , surrounded by a high fence , and partially covered by a wire netting ar - ranged so as to prevent the miners throwing diamonds to confederates outside the barriers .

		The period of service for which the diggers engage is usually three months .

		From Kimberley the author went by rail to
Cape Town	LOCATION	, whence he sailed for
Madeira	LOCATION	, and thence back , touching at the Canaries and the
Cape Verdes	LOCATION	, to the Portuguese province of
Angola	LOCATION	.

		The Angolan towns of
Loanda	LOCATION	,
Ben	PERSON	- guela ,
Mossamedes	LOCATION	, etc. , were inspected , and a run of five hundred miles was made into the interior .

		Of the natural condition of
Angola	LOCATION	Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	speaks most favorably , pronounc - ing it , in view of its geographical position , variety of climate , and natural resources , su - perior to any other European possession of tropical
Africa	LOCATION	.

		He takes occasion at this point to interpolate a chapter touching the cav - alier treatment of
Portugal	LOCATION	by the Powers in respect of her African territory especially by
England	LOCATION	.

		The
Berlin Conference	ORGANIZATION	deprived her of the region between
Congo	ORGANIZATION	and
Angola	LOCATION	-LRB- including the mouth of the
Congo	LOCATION	-RRB- with its valuable riparian revenues , and
England	LOCATION	's ulti - matum of
1890	DATE	forced her to abandon her claims in the
Shire Highlands	LOCATION	and in
Nyassa	LOCATION	- land , as well as in
Manica	LOCATION	,
Matabele	ORGANIZATION	, and Mash - onaland .


Portugal	LOCATION	's claims to African terri - tory , resting on papal grant , discovery , priority of possession , and continuous manifestations -LRB- usually rather symbolical , we think -RRB- of sov - ereignty , have been pushed aside by
England	LOCATION	on the eminently Anglo-Saxon plea that since the Portuguese have shown that they can neither govern , colonize , nor develop their `` pos - sessions , '' it is high time that , in the interests of civilization , they were turned out of them .

		That African interests are likely to be better served in English than in Portuguese hands is scarcely an open question ; but Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	has no patience with this sort of logic .

		It is not , he thinks , at all a question of superior methods of colonization , '' but simply to which nation belongs the truest ' claims of posses - sion ' '' in which case , one might urge , the claims of the native tribes -LRB- though unsupported by papal grant -RRB- might even outweigh those of
Portugal	LOCATION	.

		The author goes on to say : '' Whether
England	LOCATION	can the better civilize inferior races , whether she can the sooner stop slavery or inter - tribal wars , whether she were the ablest to establish commerce , are interesting inquiries but can have noth - ing whatever to do with the present matter , which is solely a question of ownership of ground , or what in
Africa	LOCATION	has always constituted ownership .

		... In this political partition
England	LOCATION	has exactly reversed the maxim emblazoned on the facade of the Boer Parlia - ment
House	ORGANIZATION	at
Pretoria	LOCATION	, that ' right makes might , ' and has taken a course with
Portugal	LOCATION	like that which she re - cently took at
Venezuela	LOCATION	, regarding the frontier of Gui - ana , and has previously taken several times with smaller and feebler nations throughout the world .

		She breaks the Zulu power , but not the Russian .

		Her policy of ex - pansion is always out of
Europe	LOCATION	; in
Europe	LOCATION	she does noth - ing until she can find an ally .

		She has been thoroughly immoral in her dealings with weaker States , and seems always ready and eager to follow up her ' moral claims ' with very material troops and iron-dads .

		Is it not time that the motto ' Dieu et mon droit ' was changed to ' Dieu et ma force ' ? ''

		All generous spirits must lament , with Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	,
Portugal	LOCATION	's military and economic ina - bility to defend and justify her claims to that large share of the African continent which she so magnificently founded in the days of
Vasco de Gama	ORGANIZATION	and
Bartholomew Diaz	PERSON	.

		But in the centuries succeeding her period of maritime glory she has been hopelessly outstripped in the race of national progress ; and , sentiment aside , we find it difficult to regret that her once vast African possessions have largely slipped from her nerveless hands into the powerful grasp of the race which , with all its faults of territorial greed and apathy to the moral claims of weaker rivals , is the true
Mother of Nations	ORGANIZATION	and the inheritor of the political and colonizing genius of ancient Kome .

		England has confessedly played the bully more than once with lesser nations , and her recent minor wars have re - dounded little to her credit .

		Mr.
Eider Hag	PERSON	- gard has spoken plainly of her '' unjustifiable '' attack upon the Zulus , and Mr.
Labouchere	PERSON	has poured upon her the vials of his party wrath , touching the Matabele war .

		There is even a tincture of truth in Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's frank avowal that her Empire is the fruit of generations of buccaneering .

		But it must nev - ertheless be admitted that if she has taken much ,
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL she has given more ; that she has sown her path of conquest and influence with the seeds of progress , and planted and maintained law and order and the machinery of judicial jus - tice , where anarchy and public rapine have been the rule for ages .

		The record of her sway over foreign lands and peoples , if necessarily marred by human errors of judgment and conscience , shows nevertheless in its long roll of successes and benefactions but one conspicuous failure .

		Such petty flings as that
England	LOCATION	'' breaks the Zulu power , but not the Russian , '' and that '' her policy of expansion is always out of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope , '' seem sadly out of place in Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	's usually sensible and informing book .

		That
England	LOCATION	has not wasted herself and embroiled
Europe	LOCATION	in an insane attempt to '' break the power '' of
Russia	LOCATION	, and that her '' policy of ex - pansion '' has chosen the line of least resistance and widest promise , can scarcely be charged to her as a lapse either of statesmanship or good morals .

		The author gives a pithy and detailed ac - count of his trip from
Boma	LOCATION	, mainly by way of the
Congo River	LOCATION	and its tributaries , the
Kasai	LOCATION	,
Lulua	LOCATION	,
Sankuru	LOCATION	,
Kuilu	LOCATION	, etc. , into the interior of the
Congo Free State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many interesting facts as to the natives and their wonderful coun - try are recorded , and Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	's ascent of the Kuilu seems to fairly entitle him to rank as an African explorer .

		Near
Leopoldville	LOCATION	, in the
Congo	LOCATION	region , he had an opportunity of observing a native market . ''

		The sellers were nearly all women .

		There was a good variety of local produce , but no manufactures .

		Perhaps four hundred people were present , and their chaffering produced a perfect Babel .

		These markets are held regularly twice a week .

		You see manioc in several styles , cooked and uncooked and ground into flour , palm oil and kernels , beans , maize , salad , fowls , eggs , plain - tains , sweet potatoes , mushrooms , peanuts , peppers , to - bacco , large fish from the
Congo	LOCATION	, fruits , etc. .

		These things will be bartered for cheap blue cotton cloth , col - ored handkerchiefs , and bits of coarse brass wire , shaped like staples .

		These last pass for change , and are gen - erally carried in large bunches . ''

		Regarding the mental condition of the
Ba	ORGANIZATION	- kongos , a tribe dwelling about the banks of the Kassai , Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	observes : '' They are in most respects in a similar condition to that of children of eight or ten years old .

		They do not seem to think , reflect , or remember .

		The experi - ence of one is not always utilized by another ... Fear they possess in no unstinted degree , but love , other than the mere animal fondness of the mother for her offspring , seems entirely wanting ... They seem to have few religious ideas , and fewer institutions .

		Like all such forest-folk the expression of their religious feel - ing seems due to fear , fear of all the phenomena and processes of Nature which they can not comprehend .

		... The missionaries have now been at work some ten years among this and kindred tribes , but their success has been very dubious .

		Satisfactory statistics are not forthcoming to outside inquirers .

		The trouble is the natives lack capacity .

		They can not comprehend the Christian scheme of salvation , though they may be bribed to say they do , and to lead lives for a time in partial accordance therewith .

		But they are liable at any moment to relapse to paganism , and return to sav - agedom ... When I observe the prognathous heads and the utter bestial expression of these natives I am fully persuaded of the correctness of the Darwinian hypothesis .

		It requires no stretch of imagination to believe that this form of man , instead of being a little lower than the angels , is simply a trifle higher than the monkeys . ''

		We have no desire of reviving in these col - umns any discussion of the '' Missionary Ques - tion . ''

		But we venture to suggest that the real measure of the success of missionary enterprise among the
Congo	LOCATION	tribes is less the number of nominal Christians made than the degree in which the missionaries have succeeded in estab - lishing among these undeveloped anthropoid beings such rudimentary arts and conceptions of European culture as are within their mental grasp .

		There are no chasms in the continuity of human progress , individual or aggregate .

		To assert that so or so many of Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	's Bakongos ,
Bakutus	LOCATION	, or Bakubas have `` em - braced Christianity '' is , rightly understood , to assert that they have made the enormous intel - lectual leap from the grossest fetishism to a refined and abstract system of theology to say nothing of a doctrine of ideal morality the theory of which is as far out of their reach as its practice is out of that of the average
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- ropean .

		The real difficulty in the way of mis - sionary progress is simply stated by our author when he says that the natives '' can not compre - hend the Christian scheme of salvation '' ; and its only solution is partially indicated when he adds : '' Possibly by selecting a few of the brightest of the boys , and beginning their in - struction when very young , isolating them in the missions , and then pursuing the same course with their children for a few generations , some - thing might eventually result . ''

		We shall take leave of Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	's nar - rative with an extract from his account of that redoubtable potentate , King Pania Mutembo : '' He appeared as a dignified old gentleman , bearing a long wand as a badge of authority .

		He was dressed in a white shirt , open in front and worn over a colored silk waist-cloth , which descended like a skirt to his bare feet .

		Over the shirt he wore a light sack-coat , after the approved manner of Syrian and Egyptian drago - mans .

		His turban of blue cloth was arranged with the ends extending at the sides like the head-gear of the conventional Egyptian Sphinx .

		Around his neck he 68 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, wore four or five chains of immense blue beads , and also many bracelets of the same .

		Upon one finger was a copper ring , and upon his ankles were bands of leather .

		... The King went as he came , with much hauteur , his people fleeing in every direction before his approach .

		Pania Mutembo is reported to glory in upwards of five hundred < wives . '

		... We told the King that in our countries the married men were accustomed to have but one wife each .

		He replied that there our wealth was in other things , in gold and silver , and in ships and fac - tories , but here his property was in these wives , whom if he chose he could barter for anything he wanted . ''

		As a popular general description of the
Africa	LOCATION	of to-day , Mr.
Vincent	PERSON	's book has no superior .

		There are over one hundred photographic illus - trations , together with a good route map and a sufficient index ; and the publishers have shown their usual sound taste and liberality in the general make-up of the volume .

		THE THIRD VOLUME or MR. RHODES 'S HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES .

		* The first chapter of the third volume of Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	's '' History of the United States '' is de - voted to the material progress of the country from
1850	DATE	to
1860	DATE	, leaving out of view the striking events and political agitations of this period , and dealing only with the common life of the people , or what the author calls '' the blank leaves of history . ''

		And yet the subject is so admirably handled that we believe no chapter in the volume will awaken a livelier interest or better repay a careful perusal .

		He refers to the increase of our population and our material prosperity in their relation to the well - being of the masses .

		He dwells upon the pro- gress of mechanical invention and the marvel - lous growth of our merchant marine .

		He refers to railway extension and steam naviga - tion on our western rivers as great factors in our national progress .

		He devotes several pages to a very clear and timely exposition of the tariff question in connection with the panic of
1857	DATE	and the tariff acts of that year and the year 1846 , and he says these acts demon - strate that a high protective tariff is not nec - essary for the growth of our manufacturing in - dustry .

		He deals with the question of political corruption , the health of the people , their pro- gress in taste , refinement , and manners , the theatre , and the lecture system which reached its height during this period .

		He speaks of this decade as the golden age of American lit - * HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES , from the Compromise rf !

		erature , giving it credit for
Bryant	PERSON	,
Prescott	PERSON	,
Irving	LOCATION	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Holmes	PERSON	,
Hawthorne	LOCATION	, and Em - erson , and bestowing deserved praises upon the the only three magazines , ''
Harper	PERSON	's , '' '' Put - nam 's , '' and the ''
Atlantic	LOCATION	. ''

		He deals with the sexual morality of the people , their relig - ious character , including a graphic account of the great revival of
1858	DATE	, their seriousness combined with their love of humor , and their honesty in private life as contrasted with their lack of it in the management of public affairs .

		Indeed , the picture of American society and life is so charmingly drawn in this chapter that the impression left upon the mind of the reader is singularly wholesome and satisfying , while his love of country is heightened and his faith in our popular system of government is con - firmed .

		The other chapters of the volume deal with the state of the country following the presi - dential election of
1860	DATE	and including the first year of the War ; and they constitute by far the most important contribution to the history of this period which has yet appeared .

		The work is thoroughly and faithfully done , as at - tested by the ample foot-notes which support and illustrate the text , while the style is so lucid and animated that the attention of the reader is never intermitted .

		We feel confident that this volume will fully confirm the impres - sion made by the two preceding ones that the author has a genius for writing history .

		Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	discusses at much length the famous
Crittenden Compromise	ORGANIZATION	, and he shows that it was not the secessionists of the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, as has often been asserted , but the Republican leaders , who defeated the measure .

		He thinks that
Lincoln	LOCATION	was chiefly responsible , for he says that if he had favored the measure
Seward	ORGANIZATION	would have joined him and their influence would have secured its adoption , thus averting for the time the catastrophe of war .

		Whether Lincoln and the Republicans may be justified in their course at the bar of history he treats as a debatable question , and after considering it at considerable length and in all its bearings , he says : '' Between these alternatives , one of which was civil war , with its waste of blood and treasure , with its train of men 's sacrifices and women 's anguish , and with its failure to settle the race question in the South ; and the other , which would have been an aggravated repetition of what took place between
1854	DATE	and
1860	DATE	, with the probability of a war to follow between more powerful contestants ; between these an historian may well shrink from pronouncing a decided choice . ''

		We think this statement challenges criticism .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL It assumes that the question of duty involved in the alternative here presented was to be de - termined by carefully estimating the conse - quences of the choice to be made and not by the character of the surrender which this com - promise offered the South for the sake of peace .

		It overlooks the fact that there are worse things than war , even civil war , with all its unspeak - able horrors , and that a nation has no right to purchase peace at the price of dishonor .

		What was this now almost forgotten compromise ?

		It provided that in all the territory of the
United States	LOCATION	then held or thereafter acquired situate north of latitude 36 30 ' slavery should be prohibited , but that in all the territories south of said line it should be recognized as existing , and should not be interfered with by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, but should be protected as property by all the departments of the territorial government dur - ing its continuance .

		It provided that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should have no power to abolish slavery in places under its exclusive jurisdiction and sit - uate within the limits of States that permitted the holding of slaves : that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should have no power to abolish slavery in the Dis - trict of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	without compensation , and without the consent of its inhabitants , of Vir - ginia , and of
Maryland	LOCATION	; that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	should have no power to prohibit or hinder the trans - portation of slaves between slave-holding States and Territories ; that provision should be made for the payment of the owners by the
United States	LOCATION	for rescued fugitive slaves ; and that no future amendment of the Constitution should affect the five preceding articles , and no amend - ment should be made to the Constitution which would authorize or give to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	any power to abolish or interfere with slavery in any of the States by whose laws it was or might be allowed or permitted .

		Under these provisions slavery would no longer be a local institution dependent upon State law , but a national institution made per - petual by unalterable provisions of the Consti - tution .

		That such concessions would be fol - lowed by further demands is as certain as the action of gravitation .

		The career of slavery in the
United States	LOCATION	up to this time proved this .

		The adoption of this compromise would have made the acquisition of
Cuba	LOCATION	the watchword and rallying cry of the South .

		Filibustering for other tropical acquisitions would certainly have followed , while the revival of the foreign slave-trade would have been espoused as a part of the inevitable logic of the new dispensation .

		In a word , a great slave - holding and slave - breeding despotism would have been estab - lished on the ruins of the Republic , unless pre - vented by the military power of the free States in a conflict far more uncertain in its issue and more calamitous in its results than was our Civil War .

		But aside from any question of consequences , the
Crittenden Compromise	ORGANIZATION	was utterly indefensible as a scheme of bare-faced treachery to freedom .

		In the words of Lin - coln , it would have '' put us again on the high - road to a slave empire . ''

		It was a shameless repudiation of the principle on which the peo - ple had made him president , and a wanton be - trayal of the country to its enemies .

		It would have gladdened the hearts of despots and stifled the voice of republicanism throughout the world .

		If the courage and clear-sightedness of Lin - coln averted these calamities , then he , of all the famous men of his time , has the best right to be honored as the savior of his country .

		Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	discusses the generally accepted theory that the work of secession was concocted by a cabal of Southern senators and represent - atives in
Washington	LOCATION	, who gave direction to the movement through its ramifications in the States and interfered with the free action of the people .

		He carefully overhauls the his - toric facts bearing upon the question , and reaches the conclusion that no such conspiracy existed .

		He had shown in dealing with the
Crittenden Compromise	ORGANIZATION	that
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	was ready for a settlement upon that basis , and deplored the necessity for war .

		The course of
Stephens	PERSON	in opposition to secession is well - known .

		Even
Toombs	PERSON	, with all his impulsive - ness and bluster , was complained of by his Southern friends as too conservative .

		Says Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	: '' In its public manifestations secession had all the marks of a popular movement , proceeding in the regu - lar manner which we should expect from a community accustomed to constitutional government and to dele - gate its powers to chosen representatives .

		Legislatures called conventions of the people .

		Then , after animated canvasses in
Alabama	LOCATION	,
Georgia	LOCATION	, and
Louisiana	LOCATION	, and af - ter full understanding by the electors in all of the states that they were voting for immediate secession or in favor of delay , delegates were chosen to the convention at popular elections .

		Soon after each convention met it adopted by an imposing majority its ordinance of secession . ''

		The facts of the case in some of the States are not all in harmony with these statements , but when carefully sifted they do not support the conspiracy theory .

		Mr.
Rhodes	PERSON	thinks it very doubtful whether
Davis	PERSON	,
Toombs	PERSON	,
Orr	PERSON	, and
Benjamin	PERSON	, had they agreed with
Stephens	PERSON	, could have prevented secession , and that if they 70 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, had not headed the movement the people would have found other leaders .

		It will not be easy to dislodge the well-nigh universal opinion of the people of the
Northern States	LOCATION	ever since the outbreak of the Rebellion , and make them believe that the secession movement was the work of the people of the South , whose reputed leaders were only reluctant followers .

		But the truth ought to be known , and when supported by such authorities as
Rhodes	LOCATION	, Von Hoist , and
Schouler	PERSON	, must finally be accepted .

		Had it been understood during the great conflict , it is probable that many a flaming speech in favor of the hanging of the rebel leaders would have been less savage in its tone .

		Among the most attractive features of this volume are the personal sketches of eminent men , including Lin coin ,
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	,
Robert E. Lee	PERSON	,
Alexander H. Stephens	PERSON	,
Jeremiah S. Black	PERSON	, '' Stonewall ''
Jackson	PERSON	,
Joseph E. John	PERSON	- ston , and others .

		As an example , we quote a part of what the author says of
General Lee	ORGANIZATION	at the beginning of the War , and we quote it for other reasons which will appear : ''
Lee	PERSON	, now fifty-four years old , his face exhibiting the ruddy glow of health and his head without a grey hair , was physically and morally a splendid example of manhood .

		Able to trace his lineage far back in the mother country , the best blood of
Virginia	LOCATION	flowed in his veins .

		The founder of the
Virginia	LOCATION	family , who emigrated in the time of
Charles I.	PERSON	, was a cavalier in sentiment ; ` Light-horse
Harry	PERSON	' of the Revolution was the father of
Robert E. Lee	PERSON	.

		Drawing from a knightly race all their virtues , he had inherited none of their vices .

		Honest , sincere , simple , magnanimous , forbear - ing , refined , courteous , yet dignified and proud , never lacking self-command , he was in all respects a true man .

		Graduating from
West Point	LOCATION	, his life had been exclu - sively that of a soldier , yet he had none of the soldier 's bad habits .

		He used neither liquor nor tobacco , in - dulged rarely in a social glass of wine , and cared noth - ing for the pleasures of the table .

		He was a good en - gineer , and under General
Scott	PERSON	had won distinction in
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		The work that had fallen to his lot he had performed in a systematic manner and with conscien - tious care .

		< Duty is the sublimest word in our lan - guage , ' he wrote to his son .

		Sincerely religious ,
Provi	LOCATION	- dence to him was a verity , and it may be truly said , he walked with God .

		... As the years go on , we shall see that such a life can be judged by no partisan meas - ure , and we shall come to look upon him as the English of our day regard
Washington	LOCATION	, whom little more than a century ago they delighted to call a rebel .

		Indeed , in all essential characteristics , Lee resembled
Washington	LOCATION	, and had the great work of his life been crowned with success , or had he chosen the winning side , the world would have acknowledged that
Virginia	LOCATION	could in a cen - tury produce two men who were the embodiment of public and private virtue . ''

		This charming picture of a great Confeder - ate general suggests two instructive facts .

		In the first place , it shows how far we have drifted from the period of the Civil War and the ani - mosities which then filled the air .

		We recall some speeches in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	and elsewhere about General
Lee	PERSON	and his associates which would now seem as shocking and as completely out of tune with the times as this eulogy would have been during the conflict .

		The healing hand of time has done for both sections of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	what no other agency could possibly have ac - complished , and this volume , by its fairness in dealing with sectional and party issues , happily voices the general feeling of reconciliation and peace .

		In the second place , however , there may be some danger of too great a reaction from the patriotic memories and thrilling ex - periences of the great struggle for the nation 's life .

		Moral distinctions are never to be con - founded .

		The world will always recognize a difference between fighting for a slave empire and fighting for freedom and the universal rights of men .

		The man who violates his oath of loyalty to the Union can not occupy exactly the same moral level with the man who keeps it .

		Besides , General
Lee	PERSON	did not believe in the right of secession under the Constitution .

		He was a Union man on principle , believing that
Virginia	LOCATION	had a peaceable and constitu - tional remedy for her grievances .

		Neither did he believe in negro slavery , but regarded it as a great moral and political evil , and a greater curse to the white man than to the black .

		On his own showing , therefore , the secession of his native State was indefensible and unnecessary .

		The dilemma in which he was placed in having to choose between his loyalty to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	and his duty to
Virginia	LOCATION	was a most painful one , and no man will now judge him harshly or un - charitably ; but the attempt to liken his case to that of
Washington	LOCATION	seems a little far-fetched , and is not necessary to a just appreciation of his remarkable public career or his rare per - sonal traits .

		MODERN ART CRITICISM .

		* Some years ago a celebrated student of Ital - ian painting ,
Giovanni Morelli	PERSON	, went up into
Germany	LOCATION	and did great service to art history by overthrowing many of the attributions of Italian pictures in German galleries .

		He published the German ignorance of Italian art in several vol - umes , and was rewarded for his presumption by * MASTERPIECES OF GREEK SCULPTURE : A Series of Essays on the History of Art .

		By
Adolf Furtwangler	PERSON	; edited by
Eugdnie Sellers	ORGANIZATION	.


New York	LOCATION	: Imported by
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 71 no end of abuse from museum directors , con - noisseurs , and critics .

		Nevertheless ,
Morelli	PERSON	's shots struck home .

		The titles and ascriptions of many pictures were changed .


Morelli	PERSON	was more often right than wrong in his judgments .

		He claimed that he was quite infallible because he was working with '' a scientific method . ''

		The method was of his own adaptation .

		It was , briefly stated , based upon the theory that every painter was more or less conventional in his drawing of such details as hands , feet , ears , eyes , noses ; that he was largely influenced by his masters and associates ; that his brush-work , color , architecture , and landscapes were so many ear-marks ; and that by considering all these details the author of a picture could be surely ascertained regardless of written docu - ment or signature .

		The ancient methods of determining the painter of a work by intuitive feeling , by the personality of the work , and by its general spirit , were set down as ridiculously inaccurate .

		The application of this method to pictures was original with
Morelli	PERSON	, but the method itself was not new .

		The Germans who jeered at him as `` an ignorant Swiss Doctor '' had long before his time applied the method to the writing of his - tory .

		Rome was done over again with '' the his - torical method '' -LRB- a rebuke to
Gibbon	PERSON	-RRB- by drop - ping out the imaginative element and basing statements on existing documents .

		A study of the materials only could give the truth .

		We have had a recent echo of this method in Amer - ica in
Justin Winsor	PERSON	's ''
Columbus	LOCATION	, '' an excel - lent example of all the virtues and all the vices of scientific history .

		We know the same method in literary criticism .

		It has been unsuccess - fully applied to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, but its best known application has been to the books of the Old Testament .

		From
Eichhorn	PERSON	and Kuenen to Driver and
Briggs	PERSON	, all the way down the line , the
Pentateuch	LOCATION	has been slashed at and worried in the name of '' Higher Criticism . ''

		If we translate the
Pentateuch	LOCATION	into a picture and say that it could not have been painted by
Moses	PERSON	because the style is not his , the brush-work is too mature , the signature is a forgery , this part is the work of a modern restorer , and that part an impudent erasure , we shall have the atti - tude of the biblical critics and also their rela - tionship to the art critics .

		The method is the same now among all '' advanced thinkers . ''

		Everything is flatly placed on what is called a scientific basis at the start .

		We are not sur - prised then to find Professor
Furtwangler	PERSON	in his '' Masterpieces of Greek Sculpture , '' following these same methods .

		Indeed , he , in company with other German archa3ologists , has been fol - lowing them for years and telling us on material and scientific grounds what is an original , what is a copy , what is a variant , and what is a for - gery .

		Unfortunately , neither he nor any of the other scientific thinkers has told us what is logic .

		It is a great pity .

		Had they given us their notion of logic at the start , perhaps we should not have had occasion to find fault with their work .

		The conclusions deduced from as - sumed facts are the chief cause of skepticism and dissent on the part of the reader .

		No one doubts the long study , the intimate knowledge , the shrewd insight of these critics ; no one doubts that their scientific basis is the nearest to the true one that has ever been at - tained ; no one doubts that their researches have lightened many dark spots in history and archaeology .

		What one does doubt at times , however , is the proof of facts , the force of con - clusions .

		The journalistic way of assuming a point on one page and then declaring it `` proven '' on the next page , the pettifogging manner of slipping around a hard knot because it can not be untied , the naive forming of a theory and then calling every fact that interferes with it a forgery and every dissenting critic an igno - ramus , are not calculated to breed confidence in the reasoning .

		And then , the vast super - fluity of arrogance and pretension !

		From Mor - elli to
Briggs	PERSON	, they are all bubbling over with conceit .

		It is not that their method is a new aid , sheds new light , helps on the sum of knowledge , and taken in connection with past knowledge places us on a firmer basis ; but their method is infallible , their say-so incon - testable , their conclusions final , and everything to the contrary is mere '' leather and prunello , '' to be brushed aside .

		All this operates in the reader 's mind against the method and against much that is incontestably true and just in the results .

		Professor
Furtwangler	PERSON	's book , with all its knowledge , leaves the reader in a bad humor because of its arbitrary assumption , its pro- fessorial arrogance , its '' confounded cocksure - ness . ''

		The editor of the volume tells us that it has been '' received almost with acclamation by scholars of all schools . ''

		Very likely .

		It is so good a book that one feels vexed with its author that it is not better .

		There was need for a reconstructed history of Greek sculpture , and Professor
Furtwangler	PERSON	's book has come at the right time .

		Had it come modestly it would have been the more welcome , but even in its present shape it is not a book to be lightly cast 72 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, aside .

		It is an invaluable library of critical research into Greek sculpture .

		Heretofore the study of Greek art has run in narrow channels .

		Professor
Furtwiingler	PERSON	has sought to broaden them by reconstruction .

		Instead of speculation over the few Greek marbles that are left to us , he proposes to go back to the great lost orig - inals , by studying them in the
Koman	PERSON	copies .

		He claims that with few exceptions -LRB- notably the
Hermes	ORGANIZATION	of Praxiteles -RRB- the existing Greek marbles are by inferior men , whereas the Roman copies were copies of celebrated works by cel - ebrated men .

		He admits that there is a rich mine of error in discriminating between what is exactly reproduced and what is adapted in the copies , but he thinks he can avoid gross errors .

		So on this basis he starts out to recon - struct the art of Pheidias , from whose hand we have nothing that is absolutely authenticated .

		The Lemnian
Athena	ORGANIZATION	was an original by Pheidias preferred by the ancients to all his other works .

		It must have been copied by the Romans .

		Two statues at
Dresden	LOCATION	are said to be faithful copies of it .

		There is a third mu - tilated copy in the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	.

		Professor Furt - wangler restores the statue by placing a helmet in the right hand and a spear in the left .

		His warrant for the helmet he gets from a Roman gem in which an
Athena	ORGANIZATION	appears with a helmet put in at the side by the gem-cutter to fill space , and his warrant for the spear is the muscular play of the left arm and shoulder .

		He assumes from the technique of the copies that the origi - nal by
Pheidias	PERSON	was in bronze , of life size , and in general like the copies .

		Then , after five pages of postulated facts , we have him saying : '' We are now justified , I think , in claiming to possess exact copies after a bronze by
Pheidias	LOCATION	, and to have thereby gained for the first time a full conception of this artist 's achievements in the round . ''

		The alleged copies which are said to be '' faithful '' and '' accurate '' become then the criterion of Pheidian style and tech - nique , and everything that tallies with them is put into the charmed Pheidian circle .

		So Pro- fessor
Furtwangler	PERSON	goes on to tell us that the
Dresden	LOCATION	copy has all the '' characteristic and personal qualities of Pheidias ' Parthenos . ''

		He makes a comparison between the Parthenos and the
Lemnia	LOCATION	, and thus reestablishes the Par - thenos .

		He then pays his respects to the Olym - pian Zeus in the same manner , discusses the
Parthenon	LOCATION	frieze , and tells us what in extant work is Pheidian and what is not , on the pri - mary assumption that he has the Pheidian style in the alleged copies of the
Lemnia	LOCATION	.

		Now all this , covering as it does over 110 pages , is shrewdly argued and plausibly put .

		Professor
Furtwangler	PERSON	knows his subject so thoroughly knows all the technique of sculp - ture as well as the classic traditions that one is disposed to follow him wherever he leads .

		He is very likely right in his conclusions ; but suppose he is wrong in his first premises , what then becomes of his fine argument ?

		And what are his actual premises ?

		Lucian refers to the
Lemnia of Pheidias	ORGANIZATION	.

		It did exist , but no work of Pheidias is now known to us .

		That it was copied is assumed ; that the
Dresden	LOCATION	and
Vati	PERSON	- can Athenas were all copies of the original
Lemnia	LOCATION	, is merely a shrewd guess .

		On page 76 Professor
Furtwangler	PERSON	shows how easy it is to be mistaken about copies springing from a common original .

		Possibly they were not copies at all , but Roman eclectic works .

		The Romans did make copies of the Greek marbles , but the assumption that they never made anything else is an error .

		And if copies , why indisputably after Pheidias ?


Athena	ORGANIZATION	was the Greek and
Roman Madonna	ORGANIZATION	, and there may have been many conceptions of her by sculptors of rank whose very names are now forgotten .

		On page 42 Professor
Furtwangler	PERSON	rebukes Loschcke for assuming that the Zeus
Talleyrand	LOCATION	in the
Louvre	LOCATION	is '' a copy of a work belonging to the middle of the fifth century B. c. '' This he de - clares is a '' daring assertion . ''

		So it is , but not more daring than his own assertions .

		But to continue .

		The restorations of the alleged copies are probably correct , the '' full concep - tion '' of Pheidias means only a conception of the alleged copies .

		The '' Pheidian circle '' is Professor
Furtwangler	PERSON	's circle , and '' the char - acteristic and personal qualities of Pheidias '' are things that have only been hinted at by the ancient writers .

		In fact , the premises are strewn with pitfalls , and a false step anywhere along the line would be sufficient to overset the whole argument .

		As speculation , as suggestion for future work , the theory is capital and will undoubtedly lead to good results ; as proven fact , not even the author 's enthusiastic vehe - mence can make it wholly acceptable .

		With the
Lemnia	LOCATION	on one side of the circle and the
Dioscuri of Monte Cavallo	ORGANIZATION	on the other side , our author thinks he has found '' two fixed points which represent the opposite poles of Pheidian art . ''

		By way of additional proof he takes up the
Parthenon	LOCATION	marbles , the coins and vases , and also treats of the contemporary sculptors ,
Kresilas	PERSON	,
Myron	PERSON	, and Polykleitos .

		The style of each of these men is built up , not
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 73 from originals , for there are none , but from Roman copies , as in the case of Pheidias .

		The allowances made for innovations and additions by the copyists are liberal , but possibly they are liberally erroneous .

		The general evidence , however , creates a probability of correctness .

		The same method is followed with the sculptors of the succeeding period ,
Skopas	LOCATION	, Praxiteles , and Euphranor , though in the case of Praxiteles the famous original of
Hermes	ORGANIZATION	lends more cer - tainty to the conclusions .

		The information thrown out in these discussions is valuable , and indeed , the arguments themselves are most in - genious and worthy of more consideration than can be given them in this place .

		The chapters take the form of an historical development , and the last chapter but one of the book is devoted to a new examination of the
Venus of Milo	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is so very good , and the subject is so fa - miliar to all , that Professor Furtw angler 's argu - ment should be outlined .

		With the statue of the Venus of Milo were found some fragments a broken arm , a hand holding an apple ; an inscribed plinth , which was at first thought to be a later addition , was rejected , and was finally lost .

		Fortunately a drawing of the plinth had been made .

		It bore the artist 's name , Agesandros of
Antioch	LOCATION	.

		It was rejected by savants because the artist was unknown and the work was supposed to be of an excellence worthy of Praxiteles .

		The find - ing-place of the Venus and all the contradic - tory stories told about it are thoroughly reex - amined to prove the genuineness of the frag - ments .

		They undoubtedly belonged to the statue .

		The restoration is then begun by plac - ing the inscribed plinth at the right of the statue , the left foot resting upon the raised block .

		The square hole in the plinth is fitted with a short pillar for which abundant warrant is found in terra-cottas , coins , gems , and reliefs .

		The left arm and hand are adjusted to the figure by reference to the dowel holes , and are placed resting on the top block of the pillar , the hand holding the apple palm upward .

		The rough workmanship of the back of the hand -LRB- first thought an inconsistency -RRB- is now ac - counted for .

		The back of the hand turned downwards , and was not to be seen by the spec - : tator as it was originally placed .

		The right arm comes forward , and the hand clasps the falling drapery at the left hip .

		The uneasy motive of grasping the drapery with one hand and the restful motive of the hand loosely holding the apple are apparently contradictory .

		Professor
Furtwangler	PERSON	explains it by saying that
Agesandros	PERSON	was not entirely original in this work , that he borrowed two tra - ditional types and tried to combine them by modification .

		The motive of the left arm was taken from the Tyche of Melos , but the main design was taken from an original of which the
Venus of Capua	ORGANIZATION	is the best extant copy .

		The
Capuan Venus	PERSON	held a shield resting upon her left thigh , and contemplated her beauty in it as in a glass .

		Agesandros borrowed this motive for the
Venus of Milo	ORGANIZATION	, except that he removed the shield and placed the right hand holding up the drapery and the left hand holding the apple .

		The action is thus apparently strained , though whether the strain is in the statue or in Pro- fessor
Furtwangler	PERSON	's theory we are at some loss to determine .

		He thinks the whole conception was based upon a Skopasian Venus , but was somewhat exaggerated in the modification , just as the
Venus	PERSON	of Praxiteles was prettified into the
Venus de Medici	ORGANIZATION	.

		Perhaps Professor Furt - wangler is just a little copy-mad and can not see originality in anything .

		The technique of the statue , even , he thinks is borrowed .

		He detects a lack of definition , a weakening , a relaxation of firmness in the forms which is indicative of the decadence .

		This , with the epigraphy of the inscription , allows him to date the statue between 150 and 50 B. c. `` The stylistic peculiarities confirm this later date , '' he says .

		The hair is treated in the Skopasian manner , the drapery in the Pheidian manner ; but the latter is imi - tative , like almost all of the work of the middle of the second century .

		Therefore the sculptor was working in the style of Skopas , but availed himself of the technique of Pheidias in the drap - ery .

		Perhaps , again .

		This whole theory is most interesting , but we doubt very much if it will be accepted as the final word on the
Venus of Milo	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the mean time the
Venus	PERSON	, the Samothracian Victory , the
Hermes	ORGANIZATION	, loom colossal in their beauty , and while archaeologists are quarrelling over their dates , attributions , and restorations , how few there are who see the marbles with Greek eyes and appre - ciate their inherent excellence regardless of his - tory , name , or inscription .

		Professor
Furtwangler	PERSON	has written a book and shown his erudition as becomes a German pro- fessor .

		It is really a learned book , and has many excellent features that have not been mentioned here .

		It is a book that has come to stay for a generation or more , and , while it is positive to the quarrelling point , it is not a book that the student of archaeology can afford to neglect .

		He may doubt here and there , but the suggestive - 74 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, ness of the theories , the knowledge of materials , the keenness of insight , will more than com - pensate for errors of judgment or fact .

		The translation is good , and the publishers have - dealt handsomely with the book in the matter of binding , printing , and two hundred and seven reproductive illustrations that accompany | the text .

		SOME NEW BOTANIES .

		* Probably botanical activity has never been so great as during the
last decade	DATE	, and the notable feature of this activity is that it has been largely along new lines .

		The popular fancy is still too apt to regard botany as the `` scientia amabilis , '' and this reputation has brought the study somewhat into reproach as some - thing not exactly serious .

		The science of botany , however , has been revolutionized , and its grasp of the great problems of life is both serious and fruitful .

		The sudden gush of books which are coming almost daily to the tables of English-speaking students , is due primarily to the fact that the numerous new lines of research have been developed far enough to begin to apply the results to the general subject , and to reconstruct ancient texts upon the basis of new knowledge .

		Botanists have waked up to the fact that they have no adequate expression of their science in existing books , notably English books , and they are writing and translating at a rate which bids fair soon to supply this deficiency .

		The fact of the matter is , no teacher of botany today is quite satisfied until he has written a book of his own , and publishers must be getting bewildered that no text they can secure finds very extensive sale in the schools .

		The new publications in botany are largely those which deal with the great departments of plant phy - siology , comparative morphology , and cecology .

		The most ancient subject , however , is also feeling the stimulus of new knowledge , and systematic botany has been clothed with so new a meaning that the ancient mummy is not to be recognized .

		Numerous notable publications on systematic botany have re - cently appeared , or are in the process of publication , but the one just now before us will serve as an illus - tration of the modern tendency .

		It is commonly spoken of as the
Warming-Potter Botany	ORGANIZATION	, and is a translation by Professor
Potter	PERSON	of Dr.
E. Warming	PERSON	's Danish `` Haandbog i den Systematiske Botanik . ''

		The translation is a boon to English botanists , for this Danish work has long been recognized as an * A HANDBOOK OF SYSTEMATIC BOTANY .

		original and important contribution to systematic botany .

		Professor
Potter	PERSON	has done far more than the work of translation , for in the revision of many important parts he has called in the aid of distin - guished authorities , notably Dr.
Knoblauch	PERSON	for the Fungi , and Dr.
Migula	PERSON	for the
Bacteria	LOCATION	.

		The classification of plants is a very old subject , in fact the oldest phase of botany , as it will be the latest .

		The earlier schemes , however , were artificial , confessedly so , and the original division into '' trees , '' `` shrubs , '' and `` herbs '' is hardly less artificial than many that have come down to us and are current in existing manuals .

		Linnaeus is usually spoken of as the `` father of modern botany , '' which statement should be taken in a very restricted sense .

		His labors among plants were prodigious , but his results combined the labors of all those who worked with him and who had worked before him .

		Still , '' Sys - tematic Botany '' is using the Linnaean publications as the datum line , and we speak of pre-Linnaean and post-Linnaean times .

		Artificial classification culmin - ated in the famous twenty-four classes proposed by
Linnaeus	PERSON	, an easy device for the naming of plants , but suggesting nothing as to their relationship .

		After
Linnaeus	PERSON	`` natural systems '' began to be proposed , born of an increasing knowledge of plants , and the names of Jussieu , De Candolle ,
Robert Brown	PERSON	, End - licher ,
Brongniart	PERSON	,
Lindley	PERSON	,
Braun	PERSON	,
Hofmeister	PERSON	,
Bentham	PERSON	and
Hooker	PERSON	,
Sachs	ORGANIZATION	,
Eichler	PERSON	,
Engler	PERSON	, mark the development of increasingly `` natural systems . ''

		The recent rapid advance in our knowledge of the life histories of plants has thrown a flood of light upon their phylogeny , and these recent advances Dr. Warming has sought to express in his manual .

		The larger outlines have been sketched for some time , and successive books are chiefly concerned in re - arranging the details , but it is astonishing with what persistence current manuals cling to obsolete arrange - ments and mislead the student .

		It would not be possible to critically compare the Warming presen - tation with others that have gone before and have appeared since , but they are all broadly alike .

		To the general reader it is a matter of greater interest to know what really is a modern classification of plants .

		In the book before us , five grand divisions are recognized , being one more than the usual number .

		The lowest division includes the `` Thallophytes , '' plants which in general show no differentiation of the body into such vegetative organs as root , stem , and leaf .

		This lowest group has always been an un - certain one , for its forms are numerous and puzzling , and it may fairly be regarded as an artificial assem - blage .

		The three subdivisions of Thallophytes are , -LRB- 1 -RRB- the Myxomycetes , or `` slime-fungi , '' with bodies of naked protoplasm which are claimed alike by botanists and zoologists ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the Algae , that great assemblage of aquatic plants which represent the first development of the plant kingdom ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the Fungi , a host of saprophytes and parasites which by degenerate habits have fallen from the alga state .

		The next grand division includes the '' Bryophytes , '' the mosses and liverworts , where root and stem
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 and leaf are for the most part worked out , but whose bodies are weak from lack of a supporting woody framework .

		The third division includes the first of '' vertebrated '' plants , the '' Pteridophytes , '' where belong not merely the ferns , but the scouring rushes , the club-mosses , and certain groups that do not come within the common experience , but are of vast interest to the botanist .

		Pteridophytes have a woody framework and may attain tree-like proportions , but their spores are early separated from the parent , in a sort of oviparous fashion .

		The fourth and fifth divisions have been commonly kept together , as rep - resenting the great group of seed-producing plants , called `` Phanerogams , '' and commonly `` flowering plants . ''

		Flowers are not peculiar to them , however , as Pteridophytes also produce true flowers ; but the habit of retaining the spore on the parent during its germination , resulting in the structure known as the seed , a kind of viviparous habit , is peculiar to the group .

		Dr. Warming finds in the old group Phan - erogams sufficient diversity to raise its two usual subdivisions to the rank of main divisions , and hence '' Gymnosperms , '' including Conifers and Cycads , be - come the fourth grand division , and '' Angiosperms , '' the true flowering plants , the fifth and highest .

		It has long been known that the Gymnosperms are more closely related to the Pteridophytes than to the An - giosperms , and the present arrangement but empha - sizes this fact .

		It is very curious that in certain man - uals still current the Gymnosperms are placed in the very midst of the Angiosperms .

		To one familiar with the ordinary school manuals the arrangement of the families of Angiosperms would seem very strange , but it is just at this point that recent research appears , and , as a consequence , the old artificial grouping disappears .

		It is very evident that the old systematic botany , with its sets of pigeon-holes and its search for plant names , has been set aside , and that the new systematic botany deals with genetic relationships .

		One of the notable books of the year is Dr.
Vines	PERSON	's `` Text-Book of Botany . ''

		Ever since his admirable work on
Plant Physiology	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Vines	PERSON	has been recog - nized as one of our foremost teachers , and the knowl - edge that he had a general text-book in preparation created such a demand for it that the first part of the volume was issued separately in
1894	DATE	, and was followed by the remaining part in
1895	DATE	.

		The whole presents the most complete and compact view of mod - ern botany yet published .

		The notable feature of the book is that it presents a consistent terminology throughout , and that homologies are not disguised by a variable set of terms .

		As one approaches the higher plants from a study of the lower , he has been confronted by a morphology bred of antiquated ideas that has been confusing and misleading .

		It may come as a shock that '' stamens `` and '' pistils '' are not `` male '' and `` female '' organs , and that our whole conception of a `` flower '' was radically wrong , but it is just as well to have the truth presented .

		It would be impossible to present the details of such a book , and it can only be said that it binds the whole plant kingdom together in one consistent scheme .

		It is interesting to note Dr.
Vines	PERSON	's great divisions of the subject of Botany .

		The book is divided into four parts , entitled -LRB- 1 -RRB- Morphology , -LRB- 2 -RRB- The Inti - mate Structure of Plants , -LRB- 3 -RRB- The Classification of Plants , -LRB- 4 -RRB- Physiology .

		There can be no question that morphology and physiology are two very dis - tinct and fundamental divisions of the subject , and that classification -LRB- better taxonomy -RRB- is a sort of cap-sheaf for all departments ; but anatomy and histology should be considered more as a means to an end than a great division by itself .

		It enters essentially into all work , but can hardly be said to have any worthy autonomy .

		The compound micro - scope is also essential in most work , but it is hardly worth while to have a division of '' microscopy . ''

		The recognition of anatomy as an end , however , is not so surprising as the failure to recognize the great department of oacology .

		In one sense it may be included under physiology , but hardly more so than morphology could be included under taxonomy .

		This book will do more than bring to the beginning student the science of botany based upon the most recent morphology ; it will also go far towards bring - ing about that uniform terminology which was a crying need of botany .

		A most fascinating book , not only for the bot - anist but for the general reader also , is Mr.
Oliver	PERSON	's translation of
Kerner	PERSON	's `` Natural History of Plants . ''

		There are to be five parts , two of which are before us .

		The work is copiously and beautifully illus - trated , and deals in popular style , but with scien - tific accuracy , with some of the most interesting problems in the life of plants .

		It is a pity that the translator does not give even a brief preface ex - planatory of the status of the work and its purpose .

		Several colored illustrations supplement the num - erous original woodcuts .

		Professor
Kerner	PERSON	has done what more botanists should do : he has brought the most recent researches within reach of the intelli - gent reader , and in a style so charming that even the professional teacher may learn a lesson in the art of presentation .

		In the two volumes before us the general subjects presented are : '' the living prin - ciple of plants , '' a discussion of the fascinating prob - lem of protoplasm and its activities ; '' absorption of nutriment , '' taking up the various sources of sup - ply , which leads into such questions as parasitism , symbiosis , etc. ; '' conduction of food , '' where those who think they know something about the '' ascent of sap '' may find something to learn ; '' formation of organic food , '' the story of the conversion of the mineral into the organic ; '' metabolism and trans - port of materials , '' under which is described the inner activities of the plant ; '' growth and construc - tion of plants '' ; and '' plant-forms as completed structures . ''

		The two parts contain nearly 800 pages , but the subjects of reproduction and distri - bution , to be considered in the remaining parts , are capable of still greater interest in presentation .

		It 76 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, will be noticed that the subjects dealt with pertain chiefly to morphology and oacology .

		It is such books as this that will bring botany fairly before the pub - lic as a subject of absorbing interest ; that will illuminate the botanical lecture-room ; that will con - vert the
Gradgrind	PERSON	of our modern laboratory into a student of Nature ; that will help carry us through the regions of analysis to those of synthesis , where lies the real domain of science .

		BRIEFS osr NEW BOOKS .

		and the rise of
Wellington	LOCATION	. ''

		The Decline and , f Na P : Icon , by
Viscount Wolseley	PERSON	, and The Rise o f
Wellington	LOCATION	, '' by Gen - eral
Lord Roberts	PERSON	, form the initial volumes of a promising series of reprints -LRB- from the '' Pall Mall Magazine '' -RRB- of which Messrs.
Roberts Bros	PERSON	, of
Boston	LOCATION	are the American publishers .

		The ability of both the writers named to treat their respective themes adequately from the military standpoint needs no comment , while the literary competence of the former is amply attested by his brilliant Life of
Marlborough	LOCATION	.

		The central thesis of
Lord Wol	PERSON	- seley 's book is that the series of disasters , from
1812	DATE	to the final catastrophe at
Waterloo	LOCATION	, which marked the declining phase of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's career were due to the periodic attacks of a mysterious malady to which he is known to have been subject during his later years .

		These attacks , resulting probably from overwork and other less pardonable excesses , took the form of sudden fits of intense lethargy and moral prostration , and occurred at seasons of un - usual nervous strain and anxiety that is to say , precisely at those critical junctures where his su - preme gift of rapid forecast and decision were most needed .

		It is known , for instance , that
Napoleon	PERSON	was in a state of partial coma on the morning of
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		Grouchy strove to see him at daybreak , but was unable to secure his orders until afternoon a most disastrous delay which enabled Blticher to reach the field in time the following day to give the French their final dispatch there .

		Said Van - damme : '' The
Napoleon	PERSON	whom we have known exists no more ; our yesterday 's success -LRB- of Ligny -RRB- will have no result . ''

		Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	does not hes - itate to assign this curious malady as the primary cause of the Emperor 's overthrow at
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		Had
Napoleon	PERSON	, he concludes , been able to bring the impetuous energy of his early days to bear upon his grandly-conceived plan for the destruction of Wel - lington and
Bllicher	PERSON	-LRB- why will the English insist on printing it `` Blucher '' ? -RRB-

		in
Belgium	LOCATION	, the cautious Englishman would have at least retreated to his transports at
Ostend	LOCATION	, while the fiery Prussian would have been almost destroyed at Ligny and only too glad to place the Rhine between the remnants of his army and the victor of
Jena	PERSON	.

		Lord
Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	's account of the campaigns of
1812	DATE	,
1813	DATE	, and
1814	DATE	, of the Hundred Days , and of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, is necessar - ily concise ; but it is graphic and * pithy , and in - formed with a soldier 's enthusiasm for his calling .

		Lord
Roberts	PERSON	's '' Rise of
Wellington	LOCATION	'' is really a compact biographical sketch , touching lightly on the '' Iron Duke 's '' boyhood and youth , and more fully upon his military career , which naturally di - vides itself into three periods the Indian , the Pen - insular , and the one during which he commanded the Allied Forces in
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, and plucked a leaf from
Napoleon	PERSON	's fading military laurels at
Waterloo	LOCATION	.

		Lord
Roberts	PERSON	's style is smooth , balanced , and log - ical , and well adapted to his usually cool and crit - ical treatment of his theme .

		He gives an accurate presentment of
Wellington	LOCATION	's strong and masterful , if not very attractive , personality ; but we confess his conclusion that , as a general , the Duke was Na - poleon 's equal , if not his superior , strikes us as al - most as questionable as
Lord Wolseley	ORGANIZATION	's opinion that
Napoleon	PERSON	was '' by far the greatest of all great men . ''

		The intellectual gulf between
Napoleon	PERSON	and
Wellington	LOCATION	is measured by the interval between genius and sound practical sense .

		Although he had the good fortune to command at
Waterloo	LOCATION	-LRB- when famine , the snow , and the Cossacks had reduced to a spectre the superb fighting force which the lib - eral genius of the French Revolution launchep against Feudalism -RRB- ,
Wellington	LOCATION	still shows on the page of history as a pygmy beside the inspired ad - venturer who , springing from the meanest obscurity , turned the torrent of the Revolution into the chan - nel of his private ambition , and mastered
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The little volumes are very neatly gotten up , and are liberally sprinkled with charts and wood-cuts .

		A pleasant little volume , brimful of suggestions grateful to the fancy these torrid days , is Miss
Marie Fra	PERSON	- ser 's `` In
Stevenson	PERSON	's
Samoa	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The book is the outcome of a several months ' sojourn at
Apia	LOCATION	, within easy reach of ``
Vailima	LOCATION	, '' Mr.
Steven	PERSON	- son 's retreat , and affords an alluring glimpse of the idyllic life which so charmed the lamented genius who now '' lies where he longed to be , '' at rest on the towering peak of
Vala	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Fraser	PERSON	has natur - ally woven into her Samoan idyl many memories of her gifted neighbor , and they all bespeak the gracious temper and unique personal fascination which cast so potent a spell over those who knew him .

		Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	was deeply enamored of the primitive life about him , and would seem to have preferred to sever himself as completely as might be from the prose and ceremony of the bustling world to the westward .

		Even the library at ''
Vai	PERSON	- lima , '' with its books and pictures and suggestions of a renounced civilization , was formal enough to clog the wings of his fancy . ''

		I ca n't write in that room , '' he would say , u it 's all so suitable for a lit - erary man drives every idea out of my head . ''

		So he would retreat to his work-room , a little '' den '' with bare floor and varnished walls , from whence could be seen the snow-white tropic birds soaring Life and ways in ''
Stevenson	PERSON	's
Samoa	LOCATION	. ''

		1895 . -RSB-

		77 over distant
Vala	ORGANIZATION	, the summit of which he used to speak of as his final resting-place * . ''

		This , '' he said , '' is the sort of a place I can write in where noth - ing looks like literature .

		A deal table and a small bed are all I require ; chairs are an unnecessary luxury ; a mat flung on the ground is all one wants . ''

		So minded , he used to inveigh with comic vehe - mence against the untimely Europeanizing of his picturesque islanders especially in the matter of dress .

		His own household retainers wore , as a matter of right and duty , their graceful , if scanty , native garb ; and he was one day much scandalized at finding the Samoan servants of a neighboring English lady primly incased in `` made dresses . ''

		His sarcastic comments thereon drew the chaste re - ply : '' Yes , they are all clothed ; no woman shall come into my presence who shows any part of her body . '' ''

		Well , '' continued
Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, `` I just blazed at her . '

		Woman , ' I thundered , ' is your mind so base that you can not see and admire Avhat is beautiful in the form God Almighty created ?

		do you not understand that their own dress is right for the climate and their simple way of living ?

		and do you not see that the first thing you do on land - ing on this beautiful island is to pollute their minds and sully their modest thoughts ? ''

		The rejoinder of the British Matron is not recorded .

		We would by no means imply that
Miss Eraser	LOCATION	's book is inter - esting solely for what it tells us of Mr.
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		It is vivaciously written , with all the frank charm and gayety of the author 's sex and youth .

		Miss Era - ser 's story of her house-hunting and house-keeping adventures at
Apia	LOCATION	is very amusing ; and she draws an altogether engaging picture of Samoan life and ways so engaging , indeed , as almost to reconcile one to the philosophy of
Jean-Jacques	PERSON	, as unfolded in the Discourses .

		Mr.
James Payn	PERSON	furnishes a commendatory preface , and there is a frontispiece sketch of the family group at ''
Vailima	LOCATION	. ''

		Significance of the In '' Th .

		e Tragedy of Fotheringay '' execution of Mary , -LRB-
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- the Hon. Mrs. queen of scots .


Maxwell Scott	PERSON	, of
Abbotsford	LOCATION	, tells the story of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	's last days , of her trial and execution , in a spirit of loyalty to the memory of one whom the author evidently looks upon as a mar - tyr to her religious faith .

		The book is based on the best sources for these incidents ; principally upon the Letters of Sir
Amyas Paulet	PERSON	, the Queen 's jailer , and the Journal of
D. Bourgoing	PERSON	, her physician .

		This Journal was discovered at
Cluny	LOCATION	some years ago , in an anonymous copy by the French histori - cal writer M. Re ` gis Chantelauze , who published the text , in
1876	DATE	, at the end of a volume not unlike Mrs.
Scott	PERSON	's work in scope .

		It is with mixed feel - ings that the reader turns the leaves of this book .

		There is pity for the fate of such a woman as the Queen of Scots , and admiration for the noble dig - nity with which she faced a death of , to say the least , ambiguous significance .

		She seized every oc - casion to suggest the idea that she was to suffer for her religion .

		When
Lord Buckhurst	PERSON	came to warn her of her approaching death , she said in her reply , '' I thank God for giving me this grace of dying in His quarrel .

		No greater good can come to me in this world ; it is what I have most begged of God and most wished for . ''

		Such words do not carry conviction : the case is not made out .

		The English crown , rather than '' God 's quarrel , '' seems to have been the centre of her schemes .

		Memories of
Mary	PERSON	's dubious career in
Scotland	LOCATION	come in still fur - ther to temper one 's sorrow over her later misfor - tunes .

		Since Mrs.
Scott	PERSON	does not take up the broad historical questions connected with
Mary	PERSON	's death , she says nothing about
Mary	PERSON	's stanch defense of the '' divine right '' principle of the succession to the crown , as opposed to rights based upon par - liamentary decree .

		Probably
Elizabeth	PERSON	, in sending her cousin to the block , did not realize how bad an example she was setting to the next generation of radical Puritans ; but if she could execute an anointed Queen for reasons of state , they would doubtless find it easier for similar reasons to exe - cute this Queen 's grandson .

		Mary 's execution is consequently more important , historically , as an ele - ment in the break-down of the monarchical prin - ciple than as an incident in the religious struggles of the sixteenth century .

		Fifth volume of The fifth volume of '' The Writings the '' Writings of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	'' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- of Jefferson . ''

		covers the period preceding the open - ing of the States-general , when the amiable but unfortunate
Louis XVI.	PERSON	, with the help of M. de La - fayette , was endeavoring to find a basis of settlement between the aristocracy and the French people ; also that of the launching of the
American Ship of State	ORGANIZATION	under command of
George Washington	LOCATION	, with the Con - stitution as a compass .

		What a striking contrast be - tween the unrest and despair filling all the bounds of
France	LOCATION	, and the ardent expectations of four mil - lions of people in the
New World !	LOCATION

		Jefferson re - tired from the French mission in time to escape the bloody scenes of
Paris	LOCATION	, and was succeeded by
Gou	PERSON	- verneur
Morris	PERSON	, who sympathized with the
King	ORGANIZATION	and was horrified at the anarchy which emerged from the ranks of the tiers etat .

		In this volume , the writings of
Jefferson	PERSON	relating to the organization of the
American Government	ORGANIZATION	, and the commercial treaties with
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	, are of chief interest .

		Out of crude suggestions and tentative forms grew the simple republican system under which we have prospered , as a people , to an extent surpassing all previous experience .

		The wish of
John Adams	PERSON	, and a few others , to retain class dis - tinctions was overruled by the practical common - sense of the majority , who ,
Jefferson	PERSON	declared , showed genuine dignity in placing all on an equality .

		The unfortunate feature in
Jefferson	LOCATION	's career is the evidence of party bias of narrow judgments and jealousy .

		He could not live up to his own ideal .

		Thus , we find him saying to the Rev.
Charles Clay	PERSON	, candidate for
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in
1790	DATE	, '' I know you are too honest a patriot not to wish to see our country 78 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 1	DATE	, some literary prosper by any means , though they be not exactly those you would have preferred , '' and that '' It takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good . ''

		Yet , in brief , while he denounces the majority of the
Washington	LOCATION	administration for act - ing upon this principle , and persuades himself that his political opponents are monarchists in disguise , we see principally , in this volume , the benevolent and philosophical side of
Jefferson	LOCATION	, and this is always charming and instructive .

		The sor * of autobiography of which '' My Literaiy Passions '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- from Mr. itoweih .

		j g an exam pi e i s a l ways interesting .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is by no means the first to write upon the theme of '' Books Which Have Influenced Me , '' but we do not just now think of anyone before him who has made it the subject of a whole volume .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has had many '' literary passions '' fifty , or thereabouts , to reckon only from the chap - ter headings and in not a few cases it is obvious that he has loved not wisely , but too well .

		What we particularly like about the book , aside from the unfailing charm of its manner , is the frankly sub - jective character of the record .

		Mr.
Howells	PERSON	has elsewhere sinned not a little in attempting to pass off his personal likes and dislikes as objective criti - cism , but in the present case what he writes is just what it pretends to be a consecutive account of the books that came into his hands during his im - pressionable early years , and of the feelings with which he read them .

		There is an occasional touch of
Philistinism	LOCATION	, as in the plea more than once made for bowdlerizing the English classics in general , or of a lack of appreciation which is simply amazing , as in this opinion : '' I do not think I should have lost much if I had never read ' Pericles ' and '
Winter	DATE	's Tale . ' ''

		In the present work Mr.
Howells	PERSON	is con - cerned with the books that he read , and not with those that he wrote , but he does have a word to say of his own first volume , and it is to this amusing effect : '' The ' Poems of Two Friends ' became in - stantly and lastingly unknown to fame ; the
West	LOCATION	waited , as it always does , to hear what tho East should say ; the
East	LOCATION	said nothing , and two-thirds of the small edition of five hundred came back upon the publisher 's hands . ''

		`` Four Years of Novel - Reading '' A helpful book / tr j.u \ , for reading-circles , -LRB- * ieatn -RRB- is an interesting educational tract , descriptive of the work done by a
Reading Union	ORGANIZATION	in a
Northumberland	LOCATION	country town .

		The work included the reading of a certain number of selected novels by each member of the association , of meetings for discussion of the novels , and of the preparation of papers upon special sub - jects suggested by the novels .

		The little volume now published gives an account of
the Union	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
Barrow	PERSON	, its secretary ; an introduction on `` The Study of Fiction , '' by Mr.
R. G. Moulton	PERSON	; and four of the papers prepared by members of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		The list of books read during the four years includes twenty-five titles , among which `` The Wan - dering Jew '' and '' The Shadow of the Sword '' seem strangely out of place in an otherwise care - fully-selected company .

		With each novel is given a number of points which the readers were partic - ularly called upon to notice , and the subjects of the debates or essays which some of them were expected to prepare .

		Thus , in the case of Hugo 's '' Ninety - three , '' the '' points '' are the absence of female char - acters , the respects in which the story is '' character - istically French '' -LRB- whatever that may mean -RRB- , and Lantenac as typical of the best side of the ancicn regime .

		The '' debate '' is on the question of Ci - mourdain 's condemnation of Gauvain , and the '' es - say '' on Hugo 's view of the Revolution .

		The book will prove helpful to reading-circles having self - improvement as their aim , and suggests a means of culture particularly adapted to the needs of country towns and other small communities .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Mr.
M. C. Cooke	PERSON	-LRB- `` Uncle Matt '' upon the title - page -RRB- is the author of a series of five little books about the wild flowers , intended for the use of children .

		The books are of English origin , and published by
Messrs. T. Nelson & Sons	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each has a colored cover and fron - tispiece , besides many simple cuts .

		The species de - scribed are English , but so many of them occur in this country that the books will be found helpful by
Ameri	PERSON	- can children .

		The titles are these : '' Down the Lane and Back , '' '' Across the Common , '' '' Through the Copse , '' '' Around a Corn-Field , '' and '' A Stroll in a Marsh . '' ''

		Appletons ' General Guide to the
United States	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	'' makes its annual appearance a little late for the tourist season .

		The usual assurances are given that the work has been carefully revised to date , and we notice considerable evidence that such a revision has really been made , although the book presents much the same appearance as in former years .

		The Canadian section is very meagre .

		Although this is one of the most satisfactory guide-books produced in the
United States	LOCATION	, it is still far inferior to the
Baedeker	PERSON	manuals , and might learn many lessons from them .

		A beautifully-printed aud but moderately expensive reissue of Mr.
Henry Edward Watts	PERSON	's ''
Don Quixote	PERSON	'' is in course of publication by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are to be four volumes , plus a fifth in the shape of a biography of Cervantes .

		This translation is , on the whole , the best that we have in English , and even those who need no translation of the immortal romance will find the work almost a necessity to their libraries , on account of its notes and appendices , to say nothing of the forthcoming biography .

		A new edition of '' Gradatim , '' prepared by Mr.
W. C. Collar	PERSON	, has been published by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some errors have been corrected , a number of the old anecdotes dropped , and about thirty pages of new mat - ter , from Mr.
F. Ritchie	PERSON	's '' Fabulfe Faciles , '' added .

		The same publishers issue a selection of easy Latin prose from
Erasmus	LOCATION	, edited by Mr.
Victor S. Clark	PERSON	.

		We are glad to note these attempts to enlarge the read - ing of beginners in
Latin	LOCATION	, and trust that many more books of the sort will be forthcoming .

		189f > . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 79 LITERARY NOTES .

		A translation of Kenan 's '' Ma Soenr Hentiette '' will soon be issued by
Messrs. Roberts Brothers	ORGANIZATION	.

		A pretty , limited edition , at a moderate price , of
Fitz Gerald	PERSON	's `` Oinar '' will be published in a few weeks by the
E. W. Porter Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	.


Smollett	PERSON	's `` Peregrine Pickle , '' in four volumes , has just been added to the charming edition of that novelist which is sold in this country by the
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Beginning with the
May number	DATE	,
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will issue in the
United States	LOCATION	the monthly peri - odical '' Science Progress , '' well-known and successful in
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	's biography of
Stevenson	PERSON	need not be expected for two years or thereabouts , but a volume of the novelist 's correspondence is promised for the coming season . ''

		The New Galaxy '' is the title of a new ten-cent monthly magazine , published by Mr.
Harry C. Jones	PERSON	, favorably known as editor and publisher of `` The Monthly Illustrator . ''

		`` The Adventures of
Hajji Baba	LOCATION	of Ispahan , '' by
James Morier	PERSON	, has been added to the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	reprints of popular oldtime fiction .

		It has an introduction by the Hon.
George Curzon	PERSON	.

		An authorized translation of Dr.
Paulson	PERSON	's '' Intro - duction to Philosophy , '' prepared by Professor
Frank Thilly	PERSON	, of the
University of Missouri	ORGANIZATION	, with a preface by Professor
William James	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, is to be published immediately by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
Committee of Twelve of the American Philolog	ORGANIZATION	- ical Association have issued an address in support of their contention that '' not less than three years of in - struction in Greek should be required '' in our second - ary schools as preparation for the classical college course . ''

		A Reformate Wordsworthian '' writes from
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Dublin	LOCATION	, to the ''
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' apropos of the poetical vocabulary of Mr.
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, in the following terms : `` SiR , Could we not touch up the more popular songs of the obsolete poets so as to make them intelligible to the admirers of illuminate and volute redundance ' ?

		Mr.
Francis Thompson	PERSON	has enriched the English language with words like acerb , crocean , ostends , lampads , preparate -LRB- for ready -RRB- , reform - ale -LRB- for reformed -RRB- , and many equally desiderable latinate vocabules .

		Might we not , by following Mr.
Thomp	PERSON	- son 's method , add some degree of ' literary gorgeous - ness ' even to the least Thompsonian of our poems ?

		For instance , certain well-known verses would be re - deemed from much of their sordid quietude if presented thus : By fonts of Dove , ways incalcable , Did habitate A virgin largely inamable And illandate .

		A violet by a muscose stone Semi-occult , Formose as astre when but one Ostends its vult .

		She lived incognite , few could know When she cessated .

		But O the difference when , lo , She 's tnmnlated .

		Much obsolete poetry might thus be brought up to date . ''

		If this be not the hand of Professor
Tyrrell	PERSON	, we lose our guess .

		`` Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's new story is one of the daintiest little gems I have come across in my weekly literature hunt . ''

		ALAN DALE , in the
New York World	LOCATION	. ''

		The piece of fiction under consideration is the best short story presented in many years if not in a decade ... Pre - sented so thrillingly and graphically , we can not avoid pronouncing this short tale a masterpiece . ''

		Elmira Telegram . ''

		Every one who did not follow the story as it came out in the magazine will be glad of its appearance in book form , and it will find a wide reading , not only for the interest and originality of the story , but for the curiosity of seeing the author in an entirely new vein .

		As it stands completed it bears the unmistakable mark of an artist 's hand .

		In every way a remark - ably human and lifelike portraiture , which will take its place as a small but brilliant gem in the distinguished author 's literary crown . ''


Boston Courier	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has done nothing finer than this brief story .

		The sustained interest , which does not permit the reader to miss a line ; the vivid clearness in which each character stands out in self-revelation ; the unfailing insight into the familiar and confused workings of the village mind all represent work of the highest class . '

		The Story of
Bessie Costrell	PERSON	' will become an English classic . ''

		Christian World . ''

		There are masterly touches and striking sentences in many pages of this little volume ... Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's admirers will say that she has seldom written with more force than in describing the tardy remorse of the hard , unrelenting husband . ''

		London Times . ''

		Every page shows it to be the work of an artist .

		The observations of the trained eye , the touches of the skilled writer , are all there , and what I like in the story is that no words are wasted in the telling ... The interest is too strong for one to lay the book down until it is finished .

		Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	has never written anything more dramatic than this story ; the agony of Old
John	PERSON	over his loss , the tragedy of
Bessie	PERSON	's end , thrill the reader as few stories succeed in doing , though many of them make greater efforts . ''

CONTINENTAL	ORGANIZATION	LITER A TURE II .

		The condensation of the '' Athenaeum '' sum - mary of European literary productivity dur - ing the past year , begun in our last issue , will now be completed by a consideration of the re - ports from
Italy	LOCATION	and
Spain	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	and
Hun	PERSON	- gary ,
Bohemia	LOCATION	,
Poland	LOCATION	, and
Russia	LOCATION	.

		That a new poet has arisen in
Italy	LOCATION	is the cheering announcement of the
Commendatore Bonghi	PERSON	, who writes of things Italian in this series of articles .

		Sig .


Giovanni Pascoli	PERSON	, a pro- fessor at
Leghorn	LOCATION	, is the individual in question , and his volume is called '' Myricae '' a sug - gestion of the Virgilian `` Non onmes arbusta juvant humilesque myricse . ''

		Chastity and simplicity are the leading notes of this poet , although the simplicity is of thought rather than of style .

		Sig .


Alfredo Bacelli	PERSON	's '' Vittime e Rebelli '' is also a meritorious vol - ume of verse , and not as socialistic as the title would indicate .

		Sig .


Carducci	PERSON	's ode to the city of
Ferrara	ORGANIZATION	, written on the occasion of the ter - centenary of
Tasso	ORGANIZATION	's death , is , of course , the most important poetical product of the year in
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The Tasso celebration , indeed , '' has been the principal literary excitement of the twelve months , '' and has evoked many publica - tions .

		Chief of these is the three-volume work by Professor Solerti , which includes both the life and the correspondence of the poet .

		Other Tasso publications are : three volumes of
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.

		Solerti 's critical edition ,
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.


Prinzivalli	PERSON	's `` Tor - quato Tasso a Roma '' and ''
Torquato Tasso	PERSON	nella
Vita	PERSON	e nelle Opere , '' Sig .

		Prote 's '' Rin - aldo , '' and Sig .


Carducci	PERSON	's critique of the '' Aminta . ''

		Only one novel of the year is found deserving of praise , that one being Sig .

		Rovet - ta 's `` La Baraonda , '' an `` exceedingly clever picture of the coulisses of political life . '' ''

		Pic - coli
Schiavi Bianchi	PERSON	, '' by
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.


G. Errico	PERSON	, is a collection of short stories `` dealing with the troubles and sorrows of the poorer classes . ''

		The following paragraph about Sig .

		d'Annun - zio is of considerable interest : '' According to a French interviewer , he is now contemplating a series of novels which will be called ' I
Gigli	PERSON	. '

		He intends to publish these exclusively in 84 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, French , because he thinks that only French readers have ever really understood him .

		This is as good as saying that he does not wish these novels to appear in his own language .

		Never - theless the first of the series , ' La
Vergine	PERSON	alle Roccie , ' is undoubtedly coming out in ' II Con - vito , ' a very dainty periodical , in which the school of '
Young Italy	ORGANIZATION	' displays its prowess .

		I can not pretend to criticize it , as ' II Convito ' is at present only in its third number , and it is impossible to say how ' La
Vergine	PERSON	' will turn out . ''

		Don
Juan Riano	PERSON	, writing of
Spain	LOCATION	, begins with an account of the work being done by the
Royal Academy of History	ORGANIZATION	, and the remarka - ble activity recently shown in historical , archae - ological , and topographical fields .

		Even the novelist ,
Senor Galdos	PERSON	, figures in this depart - ment with his ''
Cuarenta Leguas	PERSON	por Canta - bria . ''

		The colonies also continue to occupy the attention of many writers . ''

		Columbus 's quatercentenary has passed away , and yet most of the periodical publications , collections of documents , reviews , and so forth , started on account of it , go on still printing papers and tracts -LRB- nay , works in three or more volumes -RRB- exclusively relating to
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Senor Du - puy de Lome has recently published an account of the war between
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	.

		Spanish poetry is in a state of decay , and the '' long - winded epic '' seems '' doomed to disappear alto - gether . ''

		In the drama , there have been two comedies by Senior Echegaray '' La Monja Descalza '' and '' Mancha que Limpia . ''

		The '' Teresa '' of Senor Alas and the dramatization of '' Torquemada y
San Pedro	LOCATION	, '' by Senor Gal - dos , have both proved failures .

		Some plays have been written in Catalan and produced at
Barcelona	LOCATION	, and we are told that the Catalan is '' spreading more than ever in the eastern prov - inces of the Peninsula . ''

		In fiction ,
Senor Pereda	PERSON	's '' Penas Arriba '' and
Senor Valera	ORGANIZATION	's '' La Buena Fama '' have been well received , while the great success of the year has been Father Coloma 's '' Retratos de Antano , '' which is rather more history than fiction , and might fairly be called `` Memoirs of the Court of
France	LOCATION	at the End of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The author closes with a somewhat lengthy dis - cussion of Cervantes literature and the prob - lems recently raised in connection with the im - mortal author of ''
Don Quijote	PERSON	. ''

		The most important book in this department seems to be ''
Cervantes Vascofilo	PERSON	, '' a vindication from the charge that
Cervantes	PERSON	thought and wrote dis - paragingly of the Basques .

		We do not expect much literature from mod - ern
Greece	LOCATION	, but Professor Lambros gives us an interesting article upon the subject .

		Among the books which he enumerates are a treatise on '' Greek Metres , '' by Professor Semitelos ; a '' History of Greek Literature , '' by Professor
Mistriotis	PERSON	; some '' Studies of Byzantine His - tory from the First to the
Final Conquest of Constantinople	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Paul Callegas	PERSON	; a '' History of
Athens	LOCATION	from the Birth of Christ to A. D.
1821	DATE	, '' by Mr.
George Constantinides	PERSON	; a work on '' Popular Cosmographic Myths , '' dedicated to Professor
E. Curtius	PERSON	by the au - thor , Professor
Nicolaus Politis	PERSON	; and the second volume of the '' Memoirs of Alexander Rhan - gabe , '' coming down to
1856	DATE	. ''

		Most engag - ingly , sometimes imaginatively , written , this book helps to illuminate the history of modern
Greece	LOCATION	, more especially of its civilization , and furnishes much that is novel with regard to those incidents in which the author himself bore a part . ''

		In belles-lettres , there is little that is noteworthy .

		Mr.
Ephtaliotis	PERSON	has pro- duced a collection of dialect '' Island Stories , '' and Mr.
Passojannis	PERSON	, in his '' First Fairy Tales , '' a volume of dialect popular legends .

		The tragedy of '' Fausta , '' by Mr.
D. Bernard	PERSON	- akis , is the foremost poetical work of the year .

		The celebration , last
February	DATE	, of
Herr Jokai	PERSON	's seventieth birthday provides
Herr M. L. Katscher	PERSON	with an appropriate introduction to his report upon Hungarian literature .

		Thirty volumes have appeared of the '' jubilee edition '' of
Jokai	LOCATION	, to be followed by seventy more .

		Of
Herr Brody	PERSON	, perhaps `` our second-best novelist , '' a twelve - volume edition has been published , besides a new novelette , '' Snow-white . ''

		The following new works of fiction are noteworthy : '' Occidental Tales , '' by
Herr	PERSON	Here/eg ; '' The Destruction of
Nineveh	LOCATION	, '' by
Herr Ambrus	PERSON	; ''
King Midas	PERSON	, '' by the same author ; '' The Key of the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	, '' by
Herr Tabori	PERSON	; and '' The Life of the Pohblys , '' by
Herr Gardonyi	PERSON	.

		Sev - eral volumes of poetry are briefly characterized , and two or three plays , among the latter
Herr Varady	PERSON	's iambic tragedy of '' Charitas . '' ''

		Its diction is splendid . '' ''

		In anticipation of the millennial celebration , in
1896	DATE	, of the founda - tion of
Hungary	LOCATION	, a grand '
Millennial National History of Hungary	ORGANIZATION	' is being issued in many volumes , three of which have already seen the light .

		It is being written by various eminent historians Professor
Marczali	PERSON	among the rest splendidly got up , illustrated with thousands of pictures , excellently edited by
Herr Sandor Szilagyi	PERSON	, and published by the Hungarian
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 85
Athenaeum Society	ORGANIZATION	.

		The same Society issues a similar monumental work by many writers , entitled ' Illustrated History of Literature , ' and having a biographical basis . ''


Bohemia	LOCATION	, too , has had its literary centennial during the year , according to Dr.
J. Krejci	PERSON	, this honor having been bestowed upon the memory of
Paul Joseph Safarik	PERSON	, historian , archaeologist , and philologist .

		As for the lit - erature of the twelvemonth , it is rich in belle - tristic work . ''

		Two volumes of verse , ' Here Roses ought to Blow ' and '
Magdalena	PERSON	, ' by Mr.
J. S. Machar	PERSON	, are the most conspicuous productions of last year .

		The former contains a series of beautiful lyrics , passages from the lives of suffering women ; the latter , scenes from the romance of a girl who , without any fault of her own , had been thrown into the gutter . ''

		Mr.
Svatopluk Cech	PERSON	's '' Songs of a Slave '' is a volume that has gone through twenty-three editions in three or four months . ''

		Freedom and liberty are the writer 's themes , and therefore the interest his verses have awak - ened is easily explained , considering our pecu - liar political circumstances .

		His lyrics have an eminently political tendency the author has himself acknowledged this and they have struck the right chord . ''

		Many other books of poetry are named , but those we have mentioned seem the most important .

		Bohemian writers of fiction have been '' especially diligent in writing stories of family and country life . '' ''

		Mr.
A. E. Muzik	PERSON	's ' Euins of Life ' contains some simple but touching pictures of human misery .

		Mr.
K. V. Rais	PERSON	describes in * Forgot - ten Patriots ' some of the best and noblest , though unacknowledged workers in the national cause .

		The same author 's pictures of highland life , under the title of ' Toil , ' are marked by the warm-hearted feeling which characterizes him .

		Mr.
Klostermann	PERSON	's story ' From the World of Forest Solitudes ' introduces the reader to the depths of the Bohemian Forest , while another of his tales , perhaps the best of them , ' In Search of Good Fortune , ' treats of the life of Bohemians who reside in
Vienna	LOCATION	, which is to many of them a foreign soil . ''

		The works of the savants are mostly continuations or new editions , and Bohemian scholarship is also represented by new historical and geo - graphical reviews .

		Dr.
Belcikowski	PERSON	tells us , what we might have been shrewd enough to guess , that '' The Pol - aniecki Family , '' by Mr.
Sienkiewicz	PERSON	, is the most important contribution to the Polish lit - erature of the year .

		Under the title '' Children of the Soil , '' this work was reviewed by us some weeks ago .

		The following paragraph embodies the most important remaining news of Polish fiction : '' Mr.
J. Zacharyasiewicz	PERSON	, who has just celebrated his fortieth year of literary work , is still , in spite of his years , busy , maintaining his well-merited reputation by new efforts , and has in the last twelve months brought out three new volumes : ' Under the Three Govern - ments , ' '
Orion	ORGANIZATION	and
Chrysanthema	LOCATION	, ' a cutting satire on the naturalistic school of the present day , and above all , the novel ' Bread , ' to which the political condition in recent years of
Prus	PERSON	- sian
Poland	LOCATION	forms a background that is de - picted with much skill .

		In a similar manner , but with a considerable infusion of satire , the celebrated Mr.
T. T. Jez	PERSON	has in his romance '
Elizabeth	PERSON	' portrayed the condition of
Gali	LOCATION	- cia . ''

		Besides these novels , mention is made of '' Begun in the Morning , '' a '' combination of realistic truth with a cheerful optimism , '' by Mr.
Gawalewicz	PERSON	; '' Cotton , '' a story of an in - dustrial town , by Mr.
Kosiakiewicz	PERSON	; and '' The Golden Chains '' of Mr.
Gomulicki	PERSON	, '' the highly esteemed lyrical poet and writer of short stories . ''

		The drama has not flourished of late in
Poland	LOCATION	, only a few second-rate plays being named ; on the other hand , Mr.
Kaszewski	PERSON	has made a new translation , '' which meets all ar - tistic and literary requirements , '' of the trag - edies of vEschylus .

		Mr.
K. Tetmajer	PERSON	has come to the front with a new volume of poems . ''

		He possesses a powerful fancy and integrity of feeling , yet most of his poems express an inner doubt and skepticism or an intoxication of the senses . '' ''

		Sobieski before
Vienna	LOCATION	'' is a note - worthy poem by '' Deotyma , '' a lady of the later
Romantic School	ORGANIZATION	.

		Finally , we must not fail to record the completion of the four-volume life of
Mickiewicz	LOCATION	, by his son .

		The last country upon our list is
Russia	LOCATION	, and Professor
Paul Milyoukov	PERSON	is the correspondent from the great Empire of the North .

		Fully half of his article is devoted to an account of economic and social discussion , the general ten - dency of which , in
Russia	LOCATION	, appears to be rather toward collectivism in one form or another .

		In belles-lettres '' the past year has produced noth - ing of capital importance . ''

		A novel by Mr.
Bob	PERSON	- urikin -LRB- not named -RRB- , one by Mr.
Mamin-Sibir	PERSON	- iak , entitled '' Bread , '' and Count Tolstoy 's '' Master and Man , '' are the chief representa - tives of the year 's fiction .

		Mr.
Korolenko	PERSON	, who recently made a trip to
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, has published '' A Free Fight in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' a semi-literary commentary on a well-known THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, incident in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	'' ; and '' Without a Tongue , '' which is '' descriptive of a charming and touching incident in the life - of some Western Russian peasant emigrants , hopelessly lost amidst what was to them the strange population of
New York	LOCATION	. ''

		Amongst scholarly works , special prominence is given to * ' The Origins of Contemporary Democracy , '' by Mr.
Kovalevski	PERSON	; and '' The Russian His - torical Epos , '' by Mr.
Jdanof	PERSON	.

		The following facts seem to us of peculiar significance : '' The great awakening of interest in reading and self - culture in all classes of society , to which I re - ferred in my last article , is confirmed this year by observation and facts .

		Inquiries amongst people connected with and interested in rural schools have revealed the existence everywhere of a profound interest in education amongst the rural population .

		The interest taken by the higher classes of the reading public is brought to light in the recently issued work by Mr.
Rubakin	PERSON	entitled ' A Study of the Russian Reading Public , ' as well as by the great suc - cess attained by the
Moscow Commission	ORGANIZATION	for the
Organization of Home Reading	ORGANIZATION	, which has scarcely commenced work and has already issued three editions of its ` Programme of Home Reading , ' or about 25,000 copies .

		Be - sides endeavoring to give a direction to home reading , the
Commission	ORGANIZATION	has made the first at - tempt to introduce another form of university extension by causing public lectures to be de - livered in the provinces by travelling lecturers .

		Parallel with this movement the issue of pop - ular works on science has made great strides , though these are as yet principally transla - tions . ''

		THE RECENT DEATH ROLL .

		Few men have so endeared themselves to the American people as Dr.
George F. Root	PERSON	of
Chicago	LOCATION	, who died at his
summer	DATE	home on the
Maine	LOCATION	sea - coast , the sixth of this month .

		To '' write the songs of the people '' has been held by excellent authority to be a nobler function than that of the statesman ; and Dr. Root was our song-writer at a time when song was most needed .

		Not a composer of music in any very high sense , he yet knew what chords would find responsive echo in the popular heart , and his gift was not grudgingly bestowed .

		`` Tramp , Tramp , Tramp '' and The Vacant Chair '' and '' The Battle Cry of Freedom '' are as much a part of our lives ^ as `` America '' and `` The Star Spangled Ban - ner , '' and we shall not forget to cherish the mem - ory of the man to whom we owe them .

		On the first of
August	DATE	the news came of the death of
Heinrich von Sybel	PERSON	, the great German historian , at the age of seventy-seven .

		He was born in
1817	DATE	, at
Diisseldorf	LOCATION	, and studied at
Berlin	LOCATION	under
Ranke	PERSON	.

		He occupied chairs at
Bonn	LOCATION	,
Marburg	LOCATION	, and
Munich	LOCATION	.

		He also took a prominent part in politics , joining forces with the liberals .

		His greatest work is his `` Geschichte der Revolutionszeit , '' in five volumes , brilliant in style and sound in scholarship , which mainly occupied him for a score of years .

		He also wrote an `` Entstehung des Deutschen Konigthums , '' and numerous books of less importance .

		He was the founder , in
1856	DATE	, of the `` Historische Zeitschrift , '' and director of the
Prussian State Archives	ORGANIZATION	.

		The death of
Julius Zupitza	PERSON	, on the sixth of
July	DATE	, coming so soon after the loss of Ten Brink , is a heavy blow to English scholarship in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Born in
1844	DATE	, he died at the early age of fifty-one .

		His academic posts were at
Oppeln	LOCATION	,
Breslau	LOCATION	,
Vienna	LOCATION	, and
Berlin	LOCATION	, and he filled the latter for nearly twenty years .

		His English studies were very numerous , and among them we should mention his edition of the ''

		He had the highest conceptions of the aims of university teaching and study ; his instruction was eminently effective , yet he never stooped to using merely utilitarian methods of in - struction .

		He always insisted on the absolute neces - sity of a truly scientific study of the English lan - guage and literature in their historical development , but he no less insisted on his students gaining a thorough knowledge of the present state of the lan - guage and of the masterpieces of modern literature , and he would urge them to make themselves familiar with English life and manners , if possible , by visits to this country .

		MACAULAY , whose discovery of a manuscript claimed to be the lost French poem of Gower we noted some weeks ago , now writes to the '' Academy '' sum - marizing the reasons in support of his claim .

		He says , in part : `` The title , the number of divisions , and the contents of the book , all correspond exactly with the account given by
Gower	PERSON	of his own work .

		The author is an Englishman and a layman , and the French in which he writes is the same in all essential points with that of
Gower	PERSON	's acknowledged French poems .

		At the same time , in its style and manner of treatment , this book most strikingly resembles the other acknowledged works of
Gower	LOCATION	.

		Finally , the book abounds with pas - sages which occur also in the ' Confessio Amantis ' or in the '
Vox Clamantis	PERSON	, ' and of the few stories which it contains most are reproduced in the ' Confessio Aman - tis . ' ''

		It is a century full of adventure and of change , of things to interest and of things to instruct .

		Great names and great deeds crop out over it , as '' Ik Marvel '' has said , as thickly as leaves grow in
summer	DATE	.

		It is the first century of distinctively modern times ; the period when the transition from the spirit of medievalism to that of modern com - merce was becoming manifest , and not only changes were taking place in the industrial and the political world , but revolutions were devel - oping in the religious , and above all in the so - cial , life of the people , revolutions which brought into England a '' new learning '' and a Renaissance , a new church and a new state , a new home and a new school , a new industrial relation and commercial connection , and a new society .

		Thus is evident at once the need and the difficulty of a scientific treatment of the facts and factors of this great period , as afford - ing a guide to the work of present-day social reform .

		Mr.
Traill	PERSON	's purpose is clearly manifested in the titles he has given to the successive chap - ters : '' The Old Order Changed , '' The New Forces , '' The New Order , '' and '' The Ex - pansion of

		He and his co-laborers seek to show how the preceding causes made subsequent results inevitable .

		late ; as it is for this very reason that history has constantly to be rewritten .

		Each succeed - ing generation , and each new reading of the inscriptions on the walls , makes possible a clearer view of the essential elements in human progress .

		The real historical significance of Tudor absolutism lies in the fact that by it
England	LOCATION	was steered safely through the revolutionary period of the sixteenth century .

		The storm of feudal controversy in the Wars of the Roses had prepared the way ; the culmination of the change , as the nations of
Europe	LOCATION	passed from the mediaeval to the modern mould , made the strong central power unnecessary .

		Before his death
Henry VIII.	PERSON	, '' without an army , without an independent revenue , with no open breach in constitutional forms , was exercising over a nation , still proud of its instincts of freedom and jealous of political innovation , a self-willed authority that amounted to a real despotism '' -LRB- p. 1 -RRB- .

		Men like
Wolsey	PERSON	and
Cromwell	PERSON	were instruments in his hands to be used in the building of a fabric of absolutism against which neither the Church nor Parliament , neither the aristocracy nor the third estate , was in a posi - tion to make a stand . ''

		The bishops ' courts , the privileges of sanctuary and clergy , had all been ` blown upon ' under
Henry VII.	PERSON	; and now the vast wealth and separate Parliament of the clerical estate , its alleged ownership of one-fifth of En - glish land , its dominance in the peerage -LRB- where the spiritual lords still numbered forty-eight out of eighty - four -RRB- , its hold on political power through the almost unbroken succession of clerical ministers , as chancellors , keepers , and presidents of council , all provoked the cry Restrain ' '' -LRB- p. 49 -RRB- .

		So Henry restrained .

		The new church be - came dependent on the crown , and the great lay classes gained a social victory over the clerical estate which they have ever since maintained .

		The new nobility was entirely dependent upon the crown . ''

		A personal nobility , indebted for their rank , their emoluments , their importance , and their employment , to their personal services about the king , enriched by wardships , by marriages , by forfeitures , by steward - ships in the royal demesnes , continually augmented by impeachments of the older houses , owed everything to the king .

		... As time went on , the ranks of the nobility were opened to merchants , lawyers , borough magistrates , and manufacturers , men who , risen from small fortunes , had been enriched by the confiscation of the monastic property .

		And thus it came about that from the ranks of the courtiers and from the middle classes arose a nobility which owed its position to wealth or to the favor of the king a nobility which was for many years utterly powerless to check the absolutism of the crown '' -LRB- p. 32 -RRB- .

		Perhaps the chief practical significance of a 88 -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, study of this century lies , however , in the light it throws on the lines of commercial develop - ment .

		A revolution was going on , in agricul - ture and industry , which
Henry	PERSON	was powerless to direct , although his ministers set themselves , all through the reign , to oppose the current tendency , and they were supported by all the preachers and thinkers of the day .

		Growing wool had become profitable and a commercial spirit was thus infused into agriculture , of which the results were twofold : '' First , the breaking up of the old agrarian partnerships , in which lords of the manor , parsons , yeomen , farmers , copyholders , and laborers were asso - ciated for the supply of the wants of the vil - lages ; and , secondly , the substitution of pas - turage for tillage , and of sheep for corn -LSB- wheat -RSB- . ''

		This led to extensive enclosures of common land and to an entirely new relation - ship between lord and tenant .

		`` Under the old system , it was open to the idleness of one man to cripple the energy of fifty others .

		To exchange , divide , enclose , and so consol - idate the holdings , became the object of the rural aristocracy '' -LRB- p. 353 -RRB- .

		This movement was greatly aided , consequently , by
Henry	ORGANIZATION	's schemes of confiscation from monastery and guild .

		In the mean time , manufacturing towns were springing up . ''

		Whilst the old corporate ' towns are decaying , the ` villages ' of
Manchester	LOCATION	,
Birmingham	LOCATION	, and
Sheffield	PERSON	were growing in importance , partly , no doubt , because they were comparatively free from vexatious restric - tions .

		Parliament vainly tried to compel people to work in the old towns .

		Economic forces were too strong for the Government ; in fact , the mediaeval organiza - tions of labor were breaking down on all sides .

		The rise in the price of wool was inducing landlords to turn their arable land into pasture , and this change involved extensive ejectments of agriculturists '' -LRB- p. 121 -RRB- .

		The growth of the spirit of commercialism among Englishmen in the sixteenth century is evidenced further in the changed feeling re - garding the taking of interest -LRB- usury -RRB- .

		The class of capitalist artisans was now developing into a class of capitalist employers ; a market was thus created for the productive use of wealth belonging to others .

		The mutually bene - ficial agreement to share the profits of the en - terprise , and gradually to take a definite per - centage on the capital as '' interest , '' was the inevitable result .

		The forces compelling it lie behind all government , deeply buried in the springs to human activity .

		Law may direct the current which it is entirely helpless to abolish .

		This principle is further illustrated by the laws which debased the currency so rap - idly and on so great a scale that the shilling issued in
1551	DATE	contained less than one-seventh of the amount of fine silver in the shilling of
1527	DATE	.

		This naturally threw prices and wages into confusion .

		A great temptation to coun - terfeiters aggravated the difficulty of estimat - ing how far the rapacity and ignorance of the dishonest
Council	ORGANIZATION	might carry debasement of the coin .

		All this was superadded to the change which must have come with the increase in the supply of the money metals resulting from the Spanish conquests in
America	LOCATION	.

		It thus hap - pened that the upper and middle classes derived almost the whole of the increased wealth in the sixteenth century .

		All transitions from one industrial pursuit to another are attended with much misery to a large body of the laborers .

		In this instance , the government persistently interfered to make it harder for agricultural laborers to adapt themselves to the new conditions .

		The late Professor
Rogers	PERSON	goes so far as to hold that even in this century the laborers of
England	LOCATION	have not recovered the level of the halcyon days of the fourteenth , from which Tudor des - potism degraded them .

		The classes immediately above the wage - earners , which included small farmers , shop - keepers , and the small employers , naturally profited greatly by the rise in prices , and they greatly increased , both in numbers and wealth , during the reign of Elizabeth . ''

		Among the upper classes , too , we find many evi - dences of increased prosperity .

		The rise in rents was not , indeed , proportionate to the general rise in prices ; but the upper classes invested largely in the trading and buccaneering enterprises of the time , which , in spite of frequent losses , brought in on the whole very advan - tageous returns .

		Moreover , owing to the spread of commerce , the prices of many luxuries from abroad ac - tually fell , while others only slightly advanced .

		The upper classes now lived in houses built of brick or stone , with chimneys and glass windows , carpets , cushions , and other comforts , which had been , before
Elizabeth	PERSON	's reigu , almost unattainable luxuries ; and there was a corresponding improvement in their dress and in their food '' -LRB- p. 548 -RRB- .

		It is the articles dealing with food and dress , with manners and customs , amusements , and the like , and contributed to this volume by
Miss Bateson	PERSON	, that give the reader the best view of social
England	LOCATION	.

		Human life is a growth , a development , an unfolding .

		Nowhere is this life more clearly registered than in the everyday affairs .

		Civilization is revealed in the social habits of people in the large cities .

		THE DIAL 89 DARWINISM AND RACE PROGRESS .

		* It is easy for most persons to admit a great scientific principle in a general way , without realizing what its application to details really involves .

		Many , who unhesitatingly accept the great Darwinian principle of Natural Selec - tion , probably have not thought of applying it to sociological questions .

		Professor Haycraft , in his little book , '' Darwinism and Race Pro- gress , '' makes such an application .

		Race and nation are widely different words .

		A nation may rise and fall without the race or races interested in it being profoundly affected .

		Our author says : `` It would be quite impossible for our Empire to crumble away from us .

		It is a political organization dependent upon ties of mutual advantage and sentiment and likewise upon the tolerance and weakness of other nations .

		But we may lose our colonies and be stripped of our prestige , and yet remain , man for man , as fine individually as when we gained them ; for bone , mus - cle , and brain are one thing , whilst the political union that binds us together is another . ''

		To improve race is the problem .

		Before we can solve it , we must know the laws of racial change .

		The fundamental law is selection .

		It should have free course ; the unfit must die , the fit must survive .

		Nature works constantly to such results .

		Haycraft says , '' leprosy ex - terminates the unhealthy , '' '' phthisis and scrof - ula are social friends , '' '' if we stamp out in - fectious diseases we perpetuate poor types . ''

		We are prone in these days of science to point with pride to what we are doing to prolong human life .

		We speak of a lengthening life average , we decrease infant mortality by im - proved sanitation , we rob smallpox of its ter - rors by inoculation .

		All of this is interesting ; nay more , it is wonderful achievement .

		But what is undoubtedly individual gain is racial loss .

		Lengthening the life of the weak or unfit increases the chances of their leaving behind them weak and unfit progeny .

		When pesti - lence sweeps a land but few physically able persons succumb ; the survivors are usually the ones whose progeny is desirable .

		Reducing quantity , the pestilence has distinctly improved quality .

		The statement appears harsh , but is it not true ?

		Take a single well-known disease consump - tion .

		Of it our author says : '' Now this phthisical type is very common with us indeed , and it appears to be an innate variation to which * DARWINISM AND RACE PROGRESS .

		our race is liable .

		It is evident , therefore , that those people with the tuberculous variation who , even under the present circumstances , manage to contribute their quota to the population , would , were the bacillus tuber - culosus altogether exterminated , contribute more than their share , and the type would become more common .

		And let it be remembered that this type , apart from the action of the bacillus , is a delicate and fragile one and liable to other affections , and the effect of giving the type any advantage in the struggle for life would surely imperil the well-being of the future of the race . '' ''

		The finest races are bred by hardship . ''

		Hard - ship destroys the fragile and .

		weak , leaving the strong , hardy , and vigorous to continue the race .

		The race begins already to feel the results of preventive medicine .

		Insanity and nervous derangement increase wherever civilization goes with germicides , inoculation , and sanitation .

		Well-meant agitations and reforms tend to dan - gerous ends .

		What is alcoholism ? ''

		a habit , a sign of mental instability . ''

		`` Drink is a selective agency '' destroying early and surely a class of persons whose continued existence is a menace to the race .

		Drunkenness is symp - tomatic of unbalancement .

		What results must follow and have followed prohibitory legisla - tion ?

		In
Maine	LOCATION	we find insanity , pauperism , crime , on the increase at an abnormally large rate ; in
Kansas	LOCATION	'' there were more prisoners in its penitentiary and county jails in propor - tion to population in
1890	DATE	than there were in
1880	DATE	, '' and it has a larger ratio of prisoners to population than its neighboring states ; in an
Iowa	LOCATION	town , where wine could not be had for a communion service , opium dens flourished for poor wretches whose craving for liquor could not be satisfied .

		Students of ethnology know into what insane methods of intoxication Mohammedans have been driven by the
Koran	LOCATION	prohibition of wine .

		Whole districts in Ire - land are to-day given over to ether drinking be - cause of Father
Matthew	PERSON	's phenomenal success in his temperance crusade .

		The whole matter lies in a nutshell in this statement : '' Excessive drinking can only be looked upon as a symptom of a debilitated or depraved nature , which , without access to drink , would show itself depraved in other ways , and which , if artificially kept sober and as - sisted thereby to live , will tend to perpetuate itself and widen the circle of its depravity . ''

		The author then studies the criminals and incapables , whom at present we seem to prefer to help to live and leave descendants .

		He shows in a study of competition how the ranks of the unfortunate are constantly recruited .

		Success to-day , in civilization , is not sure to go to the best unless by best we mean the `` pushing and diplomatic , '' the possessor of '' talons and 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, claws . ''

		Still worse , '' talent is being bred out of us , '' for the successful career in modern life '' carries with it and necessitates relative ster - ility . ''

		Among animals the fit are the ones who produce many and healthy young ; among men , '' the capable and successful are rewarded by honor and wealth , but are relatively sterile , and the man that society is inclined to overlook con - tributes a large percentage to the race of the future . ''

		All of which no doubt sounds to some pes - simistic and gloomy .

		Haycraft has his pan - acea .

		He does not demand relaxation in ef - forts to save individuals ; he can not help us at one sweep of the arm to rid ourselves of the insane , criminal , and incapable .

		He would have high-minded but diseased persons refrain from marriage ; he would have the bad and insane prevented from marriage or restricted in the production of children ; he would have the truly capable careful in selection of life part - ners , early in marrying , and conscientious in their duty as producers of children .

		With such steps taken , the unfit would soon disappear and the race would advance .

		The book will hardly meet an enthusiastic reception : it contains far too much of good , hard , common-sense .

		The author is thoroughly in earnest .

		His style is direct , forcible , inter - esting .

		However sound his argument may be , it will probably have little direct result .

		But he will set many to thinking , and it is well that some one should show us quite fearlessly and clearly that Darwinism can not stop just where we might like , and that Natural Selection af - fects man in society as much as any species or variety of animal .

		a Supplement included in the fifth volume , bringing it up to within the present year .

		By a rough estimate , four thousand histor - ical subjects are fully treated in articles vary - ing in length from a single paragraph to four hundred pages .

		Thus are included complete histories of all the nations of the earth , past and present , as well as of the smaller political divisions and important cities .

		Fully twelve thousand titles , chiefly biographical and geo - graphical , are introduced as cross references .

		An eclectic method has been employed in the preparation of these histories , and the works of experts and specialists have been freely quoted and duly accredited .

		To do this , fifteen hundred authors have been drawn upon , be - sides a large number of historical documents and the proceedings of historical societies .

		From the bibliographical tables in the supple - ment , it may be seen that over five thousand volumes have been made tributary to the work ; and in further aid of the student of history , references are given to double that number of volumes .

		All this attests the amount of labor required for the preparation of such a work .

		That Mr.
Lamed	PERSON	, who planned this reference library of history and has carried it forward to its suc - cessful completion , was amply equipped for the task , has been evident from the start .

		His con - nection with public libraries has given him an exhaustive knowledge of the sources of histor - ical information and ready access to the neces - sary materials for his work .

		Close scrutiny of the result proves that he has made a most judi - cious use of his materials .

		He has been espe - cially liberal in his choice of subjects , and care - ful that his work should be as comprehensive as possible and that nothing pertaining to the field of history should be overlooked .

		The fol - lowing subjects , fully treated , exhibit the wide scope he has given to his work : Education ,

		The editor has furthermore furnished transcripts of the con - stitutions of the various constitutional coun - tries , dynastic genealogies , chronological tables , and every other conceivable aid to the success - ful pursuit of historical study or reading .

		In its presentation of universal history in convenient encyclopaedic form , this work stands alone .

		The eclectic method pursued is a guar - anty of its trustworthiness ; but to make as - surance doubly sure in that regard , the editor has been careful to introduce the evidence on both sides of such historical questions as are still undecided , and to give references to recog - nized authorities holding views opposed to those selected for extended presentation .

New York	LOCATION	:
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is the only story of any length that the writer has thus far sought to tell , and it breaks down com - pletely when subjected to the tests we are bound to apply to full-fledged works of fiction .

		There is no description worth speaking of ; there is none of that power of characterization which gives inevitable - ness to the acts of the men and women concerned ; there is not very much to be said for the occasional pages of psychological analysis , although what praise the book deserves must be given to this feature and to the general phrase-making therewith associated .

		But the heaviest indictment against the book must be based upon the fact that its main interest cen - tres about a woman of type so loathsome that it is questionable whether it ought even to appear in fiction , and quite certain that it should be presented , if at all , with some measure of decent reserve .

		We are accustomed to such deep draughts of fiction from Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	, to canvases so large and filled so f ull with faithful detail , that '' The Story of
Bessie Costrell	PERSON	, '' being nothing more than a novelette , makes a disappointing impression , in spite of the fineness of its conception and execu - tion .

		It is a village tragedy , combined with a study of the peasant character as it exists in the midland districts .

		The central incident is the theft of an old man 's hoarded savings as in ``
Silas Marner	PERSON	, '' which it naturally suggests and the pathos is in both cases almost unbearable .

		The wretched woman who steals the money is a carefully studied type , but somehow comes just short of being a genuine creation .

		There is no doubt , however , of the fine quality of the constructive art displayed in these pages , and no living novelist would need to be ashamed of having written them . ''

		Into the Highways and Hedges '' is a title that straightway suggests the theme of the book that bears it .

		His mission takes him now to the morally benighted rural districts , now to the slums of
London	LOCATION	, and , since the period chosen is the mid - dle of the present century , the conditions he meets with are greatly different from those of the present day .

		Among those to whom his message makes a personal appeal is a young girl of refinement and good social position , unhappy in her home surround - ings , and impulsive enough to renounce them for the sake of sharing , as his wife , the hard existence of the preacher .

		It is an unpromising theme , and
Miss Montre	PERSON	`` sor achieves something of a triumph in compelling our sympathetic acceptance of so un - natural a relation .

		The simplicity , the courage , and the moral energy of the illiterate preacher end by winning the reader 's heart as they win the heart of the heroine , and these two types , at least , are de - lineated with real insight into the workings of char - acter .

		The remaining features of the book are rather mechanical , and we get no very vivid reali - zation of the other persons concerned .

		But the conception of the whole thing is a fine one , empha - sizing , as it constantly does , the fact that genuine worth is largely independent of the accidents of birth and breeding .

		Tales of the marvellous can nearly always count upon an audience , and Mr.
Max Pemberton	PERSON	is an adept in their narration .

		His marvels , to be sure , are of the rational sort made possible by science , but for that reason none the less impressive .

		His notion of an `` Impregnable City , '' built upon a rocky island in the
South Pacific	LOCATION	, and made by its founder -LRB- an enthusiast of the Count Tolstoy type -RRB- a city of refuge for the oppressed of all nations , is sufficiently novel to keep the interest alert , and the story is told with vivid coloring and dramatic effect .

		The love passages of the story are rather thin and unreal , but there is no doubt of the exciting quality of the chapters which depict the siege of the
City	LOCATION	and its downfall .

		In '' The Martyred Fool , '' Mr.
Christie Murray	PERSON	has given us a careful study of an anarchist of the practical modern sort , and an account of the con - dition and influences which are at work in society , and which are adequate here and there to shape a character of this , at first , seemingly inexplicable type .

		The first part of the book shows us our an - archist in embryo , a child in the Australian bush , living in extreme poverty , learning from his parents only one thing that the rich are always and every - where the oppressors of the poor , taking the lesson deep into his passionate heart , a child to whom the trial and execution of his father for murder appeal - only in the light of a triumphant substantiation of the truth of that lesson ; here is enough to account for the anarchistic predisposition , at least .

		In the second part , the boy , befriended and provided with an education , has grown to be a man , but his asso - ciations have been such as to confirm the prejudiced and bitter view of the social structure impressed upon him as a child , and a small group of desper - ate conspirators , making
Paris	LOCATION	their headquarters , find in him a ready tool .

		At the last moment , how - ever , realizing the essential baseness of the work that he has rashly undertaken to perform , and at the same time furious at the discovery that his as - sociates have tricked him , he turns the bomb with which the crime was to have been committed into an instrument of destruction for himself and for the more hardened criminals who have urged him on .

		The whole story is told with directness and dramatic effect , and the hero , little deserving of sympathy as he is , gets enough of it to remain throughout an object of interest .

		Abhorrence for the ideas and practices of the anarchist are not alto - gether incompatible with a certain degree of respect for his courage and his devotion to what he believes to be the cause of justice .

		This seems to us to be one of the best of Mr.
Murray	PERSON	's many books , and at the same time one of the best of the recent novels of '' underground
Europe	LOCATION	. ''

		It is far from reach - ing the level of Mr.
Black	PERSON	's '' Sunrise , '' for exam - ple , but it is also well above the level of the merely sensational stories of similar theme that have be - come so abundant of late .

		`` The Prince of Balkistan '' is not so distinctly raised above that level , and in some of its scenes becomes the merest melodrama .

		But a slight meas - ure of redemption may be claimed for it on behalf of its variety of ingenious incident , and the fresh - ness of some of its material .

		Balkistan is one of the
Balkan States	LOCATION	, and its Prince is a German placed upon the throne in accordance with the will of the people whom he governs , but in defiance of the wishes of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		The reference to recent happen - ings in
Southeastern Europe	LOCATION	is so obvious through - out that there is no real disguise in any of the proper names devised by the author .

		The story is essen - tially one of intrigue and adventure , well-planned and exciting .

		It is difficult to justify the existence of a book that makes its readers think meanly of mankind , although it possess all the virtues of finished style , symmetrical construction , and vital characterization .

		Since Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	's newest fiction , '' In the Year of Jubilee , '' makes not the slightest approach to any of these forms of excellence , and since its chief characters are without exception sordid and vulgar examples of humanity , the most complaisant of critics would find some difficulty in finding anything to praise .

		Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	's portrayals of low and mid - dle-class life in
England	LOCATION	are , with their dull real - ism , about as uninviting as anything that we have lately been called upon to contemplate , and the present example seems to be the worst of them all .

		The story of ''
Almayer	PERSON	's Folly '' takes us to so remote a place as
Borneo	LOCATION	, and tells the sombre tragedy of a Dutch trader , seeking a fortune that ever eludes him , and living unhappily with a Malay wife .

		Almost as much interest attaches to his daughter , in whose nature the strain of Malay sav - agery struggles with the European , and finally as -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 93 serts its mastery .

		Deserting her parents for the caresses of a native lover , she crushes the last hope remaining to her father , and leaves him to the min - istries of gin and opium that soon put an end to his miserable life .

		The Malay and Arab characters that figure in the narrative seem to be portrayed with fidelity to their respective racial types , and , by their contrast with the European , enforces once more the lesson that '' East is East , and West is West , and never the twain shall meet . ''

		It might be a little rash to say that the place of
Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, as a biographer of the beach-com - ber and a chronicler of life in the isles of the South - ern Seas , had been already filled , but it is certain that it has a not unwoi ` thy occupant in Mr.
Guy Boothby	PERSON	, two novels by whom are before us .

		While these books have not the felicity of style character - istic of '' The Ebb-Tide , '' and while they make oc - casional concessions to the lower instincts of novel - readers such , for example , as letting us know that the heroes in both cases are English noblemen in disguise that
Stevenson	PERSON	, with his healthy demo - cratic instincts , would never have made , yet they curiously reproduce in many ways the schooling of their unacknowledged but unquestionable exemplar .

		Of the two , '' A Lost Endeavor '' is the slighter per - formance , but perhaps the more artistic in the work - ing out .

		In '' The Marriage of
Esther	PERSON	, '' there are more loose ends , so to speak , more trains of sugges - tion started by the novelist and left for the reader to do what he can with .

		But both books are dis - tinctly clever performances , and their author is a man whom we are likely to have to reckon with dur - ing the next few years .

		Neither `` The Zeit-Geist '' nor `` The Mermaid '' will add anything to the reputation gained for Miss
Dougall	PERSON	by her two earlier novels .

		The former is hardly a story at all , but rather a theological dis - quisition of mystical flavor ; the other is so clumsy in its machinery that it keeps a reader continually out of patience .

		Both books are characterized by preoccupation with religious matters , and the writer seems to be struggling , not so much for suitable expression as for a distinct realization in her own mind of certain fundamental religious problems .

		This imperfect mastery of her material , coupled with much amateurishness and unnatural solemnity , prevents
Miss Bengali	LOCATION	's work from making a deep impression .

		It is too strenuous to be forcible , too monotonous to be attractive .

		Its main interest is to be found in its glimpses of everyday life in the Provinces of
Lower Canada	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	has allowed a fantastic im - agination to run riot in his tale of the year `` When Valmond Came to
Pontiac	LOCATION	. ''

		Yet utterly prepos - terous as is the conception of the story , it is told with such grace of diction and intensity of feeling that we are constrained for the moment to accept the hero and his claims , to sympathize with him in his devotion to his cause .

		For
Valmond	PERSON	, coming to the little Canadian village of
Pontiac	LOCATION	one
summer	DATE	in the late forties , with well-lined purse and the most winning of ways , passes himself off upon the simple village folk as a natural son of the great
Napoleon	PERSON	, and with their aid sets about the realiza - tion of a mad plan for the raising of an army , and the expulsion of
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	from the Tuileries .

		Valmond is represented as the embodiment of an almost fanatical enthusiasm for the Napoleonic idea , and as carrying self-delusion almost to the point of believing in his own claims .

		His influence upon the
Pontiac	LOCATION	folk , and the contagion of his enthusi - asm , are finely-planned effects in pure romance , and Mr.
Parker	PERSON	is to be congratulated upon having achieved a success almost commensurate with the daring of his invention .

		We do not know that much is gained by telling us , in an epilogue , that Val - mond really was , unknown to himself , what he had pretended , and almost believed himself to be .

		Yet the irony of the revelation , coming after his tragic end , is not without being impressive , and the study of
Valmond	ORGANIZATION	's character has evidently been made with this explanation in ultimate view .

		Mrs.
Burton Harrison	PERSON	's latest novel is in a new vein , for she has chosen , after the fashion of Mr.
William Black	PERSON	, to associate with the interest of a love-story the interest of travel in some of the most romantic parts of
Europe	LOCATION	, and thus to provide a pic - turesque and varied background for the '' Errant Wooing '' of her heroes and heroines .

		Of these there are four , and their story is one of '' elective affini - ties , '' declared early enough to preserve the con - ventionalities and avoid post-matrimonial complica - tions .

		It is pleasant to accompany these well-bred people in their wanderings through
England	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	, and
Morocco	LOCATION	, and to share in their hopes and fears , their ambitions and achievements .

		The novel is of the '' international '' genus , and brings into con - trast , with no little spicy suggestion , the character - istics of its English and American characters .

		The mark of the amateur is upon almost every page of Miss
Bigelow	PERSON	's '' Diplomatic Disenchant - ments , '' yet it seems less of a defect than it usually is , and gives the impression that the writer will soon and easily learn to avoid it .

		In spite thereof , and equally in spite of a certain carelessness of diction and of slips in the use of foreign words and proper names , there is a charm about this unpretentious story the charm of freshness and spontaneity , the charm that comes from an observant eye and a vivid sense of the minor humors of life .

		Then the ex - periences of an American scholar , suddenly trans - planted , rather against his inclination , from the pre - cincts of a
New England	LOCATION	college to the
United States Legation	ORGANIZATION	at a European capital , is by no means bad stuff for a novel , especially when the writer is qual - ified by residence in the capital concerned to write entertainingly and truthfully about it .

		But we ob - ject to her having come so dangerously near to mak - ing her minister out to be a simpleton ; it was her desire to score a few humorous points , rather than her better judgment , that caused him to be thus 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, pictured as the embodiment of guilelessness .

		Some of our national representatives in the diplomatic ser - vice abroad do queer things , Heaven knows , but not those belonging to the social stratum in which Miss
Bigelow	PERSON	has chosen to find her example of the class .

		Mr.
Bliss Perry	PERSON	is one of the most promising of the younger Americans who have taken to story - telling , and one takes up with pleasurable anticipa - tions his latest and most ambitious book . ''

		The Plated City '' is not so very ambitious , either , for it deals only with a little group of people in a Con - necticut manufacturing town , and its plot has but a moderate degree of complication .

		The most no - ticeable thing about the book is the careful finish of the workmanship ; there is nothing scamped , even in the lesser details .

		This quality is a source of distinct and unfailing pleasure in itself , and when we add that it is conjoined with good style and ex - cellent taste , an interesting story and shrewd sym - pathetic character-drawing , we need hardly make in so many words the inference that Mr.
Perry	PERSON	has done a very satisfactory piece of work .

		One of the most healthful symptoms of our recent literature has been the multiplication of novels based upon the history of our colonial period .

		Mr.
Bynner	PERSON	and Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	gave us much admirable writing of this sort , and many others of our late writers have re - verted to the scenes and incidents of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries .

		Miss
Maud Wilder	PERSON	Good - win , already accredited to literature by her finished study of '' The Colonial Cavalier , '' now joins the ranks of our colonial novelists with '' The Head of a Hun - dred , '' a story of
Virginia	LOCATION	in the
early seventeenth century	DATE	.

		It is an exceptionally graceful piece of work , a love-story told with feeling and insight , im - bued with the spirit of its period , and made quaint by effective touches of archaism .

		The career of the hero is unfolded , in well-ordered sequence , from the time when he seeks the New World to forget the maiden whom he fancies is lost to him , through various exciting episodes of frontier adventure and Indian warfare , to the final reunion with the wo - man who has loved him all the time , he being too modest or dull-witted to realize it .

		The book is a very charming one , simple , tasteful , and bathed in the atmosphere of romance .

		Dr.
Underwood	PERSON	's posthumous novel comes to us as something of a surprise , for we had supposed that the author early in life abandoned fiction as a medium of self-expression . ''

		Quabbin , '' to be sure , had the semblance of a novel , but the semblance only , for it was evident enough that the real pur - pose of that remarkable book was the presentation of a social study . ''

		Dr.
Gray	PERSON	's Quest , '' too , has something of this character , and will perhaps be more highly valued for its intimate view of
New England	LOCATION	town life early in the century than for its qualities as mere narrative .

		In some of its aspects it is even too intimate to get much sympathy from readers not of the very puritan stock with which it deals , while those who are of that stock will prob - ably exaggerate the merits of the book , and give to constructive art the credit for what is , after all , nothing more than keen observation and close com - prehension of a bygone phase of American life , clothed in the mellow wisdom of philosophic age .

		For the present writer , it is no easy task to charac - terize this book , so strong is its personal appeal , yet we are compelled to recognize the fact that it has many faults , that some of its incidents are highly improbable and some of its characters very imper - fectly vitalized ; that the action is stiff throughout , and the method old-fashioned in the bad sense as well as the good .

		On the other hand , the general plan is well-conceived and even striking , while two or three at least of the leading figures are strongly individualized .

		Of the many volumes of short stories brought forth by the past few months , few seem deserving of special mention .

		We have chosen half a dozen of them , English and American , that seem to call for consideration in this article .

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	shall head the list with '' In Deacon 's Orders and Other Stories . ''

		There are eleven pieces in this collection , that which gives it a title being the most important .

		The author calls it a study in '' relig - iosity , '' a word which is hardly adequate to express the consummate rascality and hypocrisy combined of its principal character .

		The remaining stories are slight productions , and two or three have a dis - tinct flavor of allegory .

		They are marked by ease and fluency , much fertility of invention , and whole - someness of tone .

		Mr.
George Moore	PERSON	's three studies of `` Celibates '' are as distinctly unwholesome as Sir
Walter	PERSON	's tales are wholesome .

		They have a certain finish of style , and attempt a subtlety of analysis that we should hardly expect of Sir
Walter	PERSON	, but the sane outlook of the latter is a far more desirable equipment than Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's jaundiced vision .

		Indeed , it takes as ugly a word as bestial to characterize the imagina - tion revealed in the worst scenes of this book .

		There is nothing edifying , or even attractive , about the sickly types of manhood and womanhood that fill Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's gallery ; they are '' degenerates '' of a peculiarly disagreeable sort .

		The author 's impres - sionist method , moreover , is as unsatisfactory in an artistic sense , as , from a moral point of view , is his choice of subjects .

		To turn from Mr.
Moore	PERSON	's pages to those of Mr.
Kenneth Grahame	PERSON	, in '' The Golden Age , '' is like passing from the miasmatic exhalations of a swamp to the fragrant air of some daisy-starred adjoining meadow .

		Mr.
Grahame	PERSON	's '' golden age '' is the one in which we have all lived for a brief space , the age when the world was full of wond ^ er , and the imag - ination doubted not of its own creations .

		But few of us , when we have outlived it , are able to erect once more in thought the structure of that age , its form and pressure ; the once firm outlines are irre - vocably lost , and the passion of our regret clings to images that are but shifting , and to memories
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 95 whereof we may not understand why they remain so dear .

		Mr.
Grahame	PERSON	is one of the few fortunate to whom , in manhood , the child 's point of view re - mains yet accessible , and these little stories or sketches , that so irresistibly command alternate smiles and tears , are unmatched by anything that we know of , unless it be
Stevenson	PERSON	's volume of child - hood verse .

		No descriptive words can do justice to the exquisite art of this lovely book to the charm of its style , the gentleness of its irony , the lambency of its humor , or the deep tenderness of its feeling .

		Such sketches as '' A Harvesting , '' '' The Argo - nauts , '' and '' The Roman Road '' are classics in miniature , to be read and reread with ever deepen - ing delight .

		There are but two stories in Mr.
George Bas	PERSON	- sett 's `` Hippolyte and Golden Beak , '' and the com - ponent parts of this title are their respective names .

		The author , though he writes from the wilds of Wis - consin , appears to be an Englishman .

		Both stories are well told , and provided with startling denoue - ments .

		Hippolyte is a precocious French boy who serves as a gentleman 's valet , and ends his career with the explosion of a dynamite bomb , snatched and run away with in time to save the lives which it threatened ; Golden Beak , alias Mrs.
Potwin	PERSON	, is an American divorcee , loved by a descendant of the Tokugawa shoguns , and by him murdered , in strange Oriental fashion , when he deems her faith - less .

		Mr.
Henry Harland	PERSON	is , we trust , still an Amer - ican , although we have lost his presence , and although Yellow Books and Parisian haunts now claim his attention .

		The '' Gray Roses '' of his new volume are nine in number .

		They are tales and sketches tinged with the pathos of retrospect , and prefaced by this '' keynote '' motto : '' Yes , the conception was a rose , but the achievement is a rose grown gray . ''

		Several of them are stories of Pays Latin , and most of them are infused with the sentiment of the Quarter . ''

		The Bohemian Girl '' and '' Castles near
Spain	LOCATION	, '' first and last in the collection , are probably the most successful of these pieces .

		It is a relief to pass from these sketches of a sophisticated civilization to Miss
Murfree	ORGANIZATION	's pictures of nature and primitive man in the
Tennessee	LOCATION	mountains .

		Miss Murfree has turned to the short story once more , and five such stories , finely imag - inative , fill the volume before us .

		The scenes are - by this time familiar enough to her readers , but the Rembrandt-like quality of her art has the old fascin - ation , and its essential truthfulness makes it accept - able in spite of its repetitions .

		Perhaps the grave and studied rhetoric of the descriptive passages is not altogether in keeping with the simple conditions of life that are portrayed , or with the rugged emo - tional nature of these untutored mountain-folk , but the sum total of the effect is certainly impressive , and reveals one of the most masterly hands now at s work in American literature .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		A volume of English fishing lore .

		BRIEFS O : NJNE \ V BOOKS .

		Holiday-makers of a piscatorial turn will find Mr.
John Bickerdyke	PERSON	's '' Days of My Life '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- a rare book to beguile the evening after a hard day 's fishing .

		Indeed , we should be puzzled to name on short notice another one of the class quite so good .

		The author , we need scarcely say , is a noted English Brother of the Angle , and his stories are all first-hand and capitally told .

		They range themselves under the two main headings : '' Fresh Water '' and '' Salt Water , '' with such pleasantly suggestive minor titles as `` Three Thames Trout , '' `` In the Murgthal , '' `` A Glacier Salmon River , '' `` On a
May Day	DATE	, '' `` Trout Problems , '' `` The Bass of the Maelstrom , '' etc. .

		Several of the papers are of a humorous turn , among them one with the curious title '' Fin-de - Siecle Fish . ''

		Fin-de-siecle fish , as we gather from Mr.
Bickerdyke	PERSON	, are of no special scientific variety .

		An outcome of civilization , and found always near great centres of population , their chief character - istic is extreme distrust of man , and consequent in - difference to the usual blandishments in the way of bait .

		If caught at all , it is only by uncouth and unorthodox methods as in the case of Mr.
Bicker	PERSON	- dyke 's famous fin-de-siecle trout .

		This sagacious fish '' had his headquarters opposite a clubhouse on a certain famous stream . ''

		Flies innumerable had floated captivatingly , yet harmlessly , above his ven - erable head ; and there was a story that once , in an unguarded moment , getting hooked on a piece of bread , he had quickly '' warped '' the line round a convenient stump , extracted the hook , and was pla - cidly rising to some natural flies half an hour after - wards .

		New club-members used to bet they would catch him , and old ones would take their bets and pocket their money , as a matter of course .

		One day there joined the club a comparative novice who , with a novice 's conceit , promptly proposed to catch the fin-de-siecle trout .

		Old members laughed , took his bets as usual , and languidly awaited the result .

		Next evening the new member arrived provided with many bluebottle flies and -LRB- Shade of Walton ! -RRB-

		a peashooter .

		He at once began , so to speak , to lay his parallels .

		Says our author : `` Deftly a half - dead bluebottle was puffed out of the tube in front of the fish .

		It was taken , of course , as everything eatable from a trout 's point of view was taken .

		The fish had a rare supper that evening ... He fed the trout in this way for more than a week ; the others smiled and looked on . '

		I will catch him soon , ' said the new member , ' I am only waiting for wind . '

		In three weeks there came a day when a stiff breeze was blowing up-stream .

		The new mem - ber appeared at the clubhouse with a long , slender rod , with running tackle and a length of fine but strong gut , terminating with a single hook .

		He took his stand some distance below the fish and began feeding him as usual .

		On the hook was a bluebottle .

		Good luck helped our friend , who , however , exhibited some skill .

		The up-stream breeze took the hooked 96 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, fly just over the trout , and the new member at the same time puffed a fly out of the tube .

		Which would the trout take ?

		Had the rod been in front instead of behind him he would have taken neither .

		But he did not see the rod , having no eyes in his tail -LRB- this has been questioned -RRB- , and the fly containing the hook was sucked in .

		How he fought !

		He died , as wise and grand a specimen of a fin-de-siecle fish as has ever been seen in a trout stream . ''

		A good deal of English fishing lore may be extracted from Mr.
Bickerdyke	PERSON	's book .


Etsa	ORGANIZATION	s b Square and Circle '' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- a '' `` punch '' Ian -RRB- , by ``
Jack Easel	PERSON	, sometime contributor .

		Punch 's Roving Correspondent , '' is not a treatise on geometry or carpentry , as one may hastily infer from the title . ''

		Mr.
Easel	PERSON	's '' Square is only
Dexter Square	PERSON	,
Bayswater	LOCATION	; and his Circle is merely that of his acquantances and household .

		The reader will perhaps '' shy '' at first at the omi - nous fact -LRB- strangely paraded on the title-page -RRB- of the author 's '' sometime '' connection with '' Punch '' - a journal of rather atrabiliary suggestions to the American mind .

		We hasten to say , however , that '' Mr.
Easel	PERSON	's '' humor is as remote in quality from the depressing article that forms the staple of that respectable
London	LOCATION	weekly as it is from the cheap buffoonery of the miscalled '' humorous columns '' of our own daily papers . ''

		Mr.
Easel	PERSON	'' is a de - lightfully amusing and withal refined writer , with a playful , gently-satiric vein , at times almost
Thack	PERSON	- erayan in quality .

		His book comprises a series of brief causeries on his drawing-room , his sanctum , his books , pets , servants , amusements , etc. , spiced with any number of piquant '' asides '' on all sorts of topics .

		Evidences of sound taste and sound read - ing are abundant ; and if '' Mr.
Easel	PERSON	's '' standards and preferences in art and letters are not exactly of the ultra '' up-to-date '' order , our readers are not likely to think the less of him for that .

		As to paint - ing , for instance , he complains , with much reason : '' Old canons of style and grace are forgotten old standards of excellence are set aside .

		The one essential condition of success for a fin-de-siecle pic - ture is that it shall be original .

		Group your figures in constrained attitudes enshroud them with fog or deck them in all the colors of the rainbow : paint your skies red and your meadows blue : show us a sea without ships , knights without courage , youth without joy , love-making without beauty , drapery without texture ' impressions ' good , bad , or indif - ferent no matter so long as they are original ! ''

		Had '' Mr.
Easel	PERSON	, '' in this passage , written '' eccen - tric '' in place of `` original '' he would seem to have hit the case fairly well .

		We suspect that '' impres - sionism '' -LRB- a much-abused term -RRB- is made to cover a multitude of sins in the direction of personal inca - pacity and lack of technical skill ; and certainly the ways of
Providence	LOCATION	are not more inscrutable than is the current vogue of those amazing productions in purple , orange , pink , pea-green , and vermillion , that one is nowadays asked to accept -LRB- on trust -RRB- as quite peculiarly truthful representations of nature .

		Luck - ily , however , every fad has its day ; so we may cheerfully expect pseudo - impressionism to go the way of good Bishop
Berkeley	LOCATION	's tar-water and Gen - eral Pleasan ton 's blue-glass ere long .

		* ew selections '' The Golden Book of Coleridge '' from
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	is the happy title chosen by the Rev. and
Shelley	PERSON	.

		Stopf ord
A. Brooke	PERSON	to adorn his vol - ume of selections from
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's verse .

		A golden book it must be that contains `` Christabel '' and ''
Kubla Khan	PERSON	, '' in spite of whatever alloy of the less finished work the editor has thought it wise to include .

		A feature of the book that must not be over - looked is the remarkable introductory essay , which makes us more impatient than ever for the comple - tion of the author 's long-planned and partly executed history of English poetry .

		The essay is upwards of sixty pages in length , and at least equals the best critical treatment to which the poetry of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	has yet been subject .

		We can not refrain from quot - ing a part of what is said of the poet 's opium-eating : '' More than enough has been said about it from the moral point of view .

		The mass of right and gentle - thinking folk are thoroughly sick of the Pharisaic habit in which so many writers indulge , of making the great poets as well as other men of genius the moral object-lessons of mankind , or of using their errors , especially in matters relating to women , as the ground for endless discussions in biographies , reviews , sermons , and the daily press .

		These dis - cussions minister to the ugliest of all the cravings of Society ... The long discussion about
Shelley	PERSON	and his wife and
Mary Godwin	PERSON	is intolerable , and as uninteresting , except to those whose nectar is scandal and whose ambrosia is gossip .

		And how wicked it has been !

		It has turned men 's eyes away from the permanent and noble in him to the tran - sient and the commonplace .

		The reverence due to his work has been lowered , and this is an injury to mankind .

		Even
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	was carried away into a ludicrous attempt to make Shelley vulgar .

		He might as well have tried to vulgarize the star Arcturus . ''

		These are words that have long needed to be said , and we are glad that Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	has spoken them with so much emphasis .

		We may fitly couple with this volume of Coleridge the sim - ilar volume , edited by Mr.
Ernest Rhys	PERSON	, of '' The Lyric Poems of Shelley . ''

		The editor 's introduc - tion is brief but just in its appreciation .

		Both of these books have the Dent imprint , and are supplied in this country by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
William H. Rideing	PERSON	's '' In the L and of
Lorna Doone	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- is a pretty , inexpensive book , com - prising five brief descriptive papers of a rural and '' summery '' flavor , which readers with a taste for literary quality will do well to add to their sum - mer 's list .

		The volume takes its title from that of the initial paper , the others being : '' In
Cornwall	LOCATION	with an Umbrella , '' '' Coaching Trips out of
London	LOCATION	, ''
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 97 '' A Bit of the
Yorkshire Coast	ORGANIZATION	, '' and ''
Amy Robsart	PERSON	, Kenil worth , and
Warwick	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Rideing	PERSON	's grace - ful and graphic pen seems to bring one very near the rustic
England of Abbey	ORGANIZATION	and
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	the
England	LOCATION	, as he says , '' of ' The Quiet Life , ' of fat meadows , flowing verdure , tiled and thatched cottages , mossy , dripping mill-wheels , hawthorn hedges , inviting inns , and spacious parks , where the beeches and oaks throw out rounded , drooping vol - umes of foliage , that have the soft density of an exhalation , and where the cuckoo , lark , and night - ingale are fearless visitors . ''

		The reader who is familiar with the polished , park-like beauties of old
England	ORGANIZATION	will feel the truth of Mr.
Rideing	PERSON	's de - scription .

		It accentuates , too , it may be added , pre - cisely that note of English landscape which , charm as it may at first , soon palls upon the transatlantic visitor , and awakens a longing for the wilder and less prim and regular beauties of American field and woodland .

		Very different , however , from En - glish landscape in general is that of the land of ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	'' mostly moorland , wild , unculti - vated , and solitary , clothed with only gorse , heather , and bracken , or clumps of scrub oaks and dwarf pines , still the haunt and cover of the wild deer .

		Nearly everyone who visits this country nowadays brings , as a matter of course , Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	's ro - mance with him . ''

		The visitors , '' says our author , '' go forth in the morning , book in hand , and make it the gospel for the day '' which ought to be glory enough for Mr.
Blackmore	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Rideing	PERSON	has sea - soned his pages with some quaint specimens of rustic dialect .

		Here is one from
Cornwall	LOCATION	: `` While we were at Penzance a high-pressure sermon was delivered against modern unbelief ; and a fisherman who was asked what he thought of the preacher answered , ' Aw !

		a stunner a was .

		He es the boy fer the in - ferels .

		Iss aw iss ; and a sent the sances -LRB- sciences -RRB- to shivereens too .

		Es no good fer ould
Bardar	PERSON	- laugh or
Darby	PERSON	-LRB-
Darwin	LOCATION	-RRB- to coom where a is . ' ''

		We infer that those ancient temporal and spiritual lords , the '' squire '' and the '' parson , '' are still strong in
Cornwall	LOCATION	.

		spiritual life in modern English poetry .

		^ e Spirit in the Mod - ern English Poets '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Migg y ida j -RRB- S cu -LRB- Jder , is a work difficult of characterization in a few words .

		At - tempting , although on a smaller scale and within the limits of a single nationality , what Dr.
Brandes	PERSON	has attempted in his '' Hovedstromninger , '' Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	has sought to isolate for special study such aspects of modern thought as have attracted to them - selves the greater part of English poetic energy such things , for example , as the revolutionary im - pulse , the new scientific spirit , the sympathetic envis - agement of the historical past , and the aspirations of a deanthropomorphized religion . ''

		Let us study , '' she says , '' the influence of science in all our poets ; the new democracy , especially in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	; the early religious and social ideals , especially in
Shelley	LOCATION	; the power of the past in the poetry of reversion ; the power of the present in the ironic art of
Brown	PERSON	- ing ; the poetry of religious inquiry in its various phases ; and , finally , the outlook of faith . ''

		This is a praiseworthy programme , even if we may not ac - cept the conclusion , u that the poetry of our age has a vital unity , and witnesses to an advance of the spirit , straight as the logic of experience , from doubt to faith and cheer . ''

		Anyone who starts out upon a critical excursion with such a thesis as this to maintain will be apt unconsciously to make the facts fit therewith ; and , however plausibly they are arrayed by Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	in support of her conten - tion , we feel at many points that something might be said upon the other side .

		Her appreciation of the spiritual elements in Victorian poetry is usually keen and adequate , although she now and then dis - plays a curious blindness , as , for example , toward the social and ethical phases of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's work .

		To speak of him as '' acknowledging no sphere but that of the senses and the passions '' is the most gro - tesque of perversions .

		We are surprised , also , to find no account made of Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	and
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, in which work the '' life of the spirit '' is surely , if anywhere , to be found .

		But in spite of some defects , Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	's book is a noteworthy contribution to poetical criticism , and deserves the careful attention of students .

		The new English edition * f Balzac . ''

		^ a P eau de Chagrin , '' translated by Miss
Ellen Marriage	PERSON	as '' The wild Ass 's Skin , '' inaugurates the new Dent-Macmillan edition of Balzac in English which Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	has been engaged to edit and superintend generally .

		The edition will , we understand , be a practically complete version of the novels , extending to something like forty vol - umes .

		Each novel will have a special introduction by the editor , these introductions forming , with the prefatory essay now published , `` a sufficient study of Balzac and a sufficient commentary on his work . ''

		We have no doubt that Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	will fulfil rea - sonably the boast implied in the above words , and shall await with pleasure his remarks upon the suc - cessive volumes .

		The first volume is well printed , tastefully bound , and provided with three etchings .

		If it may be assumed to set the standard for the series , the completion of the undertaking will pro- vide English readers with a Balzac far more attract - ive mechanically than anything existing in French .

Scribner	ORGANIZATION	's Sons -RRB- '' a study of in - dustry among primitive people . ''

		Early man and his companion , early woman , were the great invent - ors .

		They found a world to be subdued .

		Fire was to be discovered and tamed ; water was to be har - nessed ; plants and animals were to be cultivated , domesticated , and improved ; materials were to be sought after and utilized .

		Professor
Mason	PERSON	sketches 98 THE DIAL -LSB-
Aug. 16	DATE	, the history of progress in these and other directions in this truly interesting and suggestive book .

		The style , though vague at times , is usually pleasing .

		The descriptions of devices are not always clear .

		The illustrations are mainly from specimens in the
United States National Museum	ORGANIZATION	, with which the author is officially connected .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		In the '' Library of Philosophy , '' edited by Mr.
J. H. Muirhead	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- there has recently been pub - lished a translation , by Miss
Helen Dendy	PERSON	, of the '' Logic '' of Dr.
Christoph Sigwart	PERSON	, of
Tubingen	LOCATION	.

		The translation is not only authorized , but has been carefully revised by the author .

		It fills nearly a thousand large pages , divided into two volumes .

		In comparison with this bulky treatise , Dr.
Noah K. Davis	PERSON	's '' Elements of Inductive Logic '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is as a pygmy to a giant , being designed for use as an elementary college text - book .

		It is a systematic and carefully-written manual .

		Two translations of Count Tolstoy 's '' Master and Man '' have reached us .

		One is translated by Mr.
A. Hulme Beaman	PERSON	-LRB-
Appleton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and has an introduction by Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	; the other is the joint production of Miss
Yekaterina Alexandrovna Ludwig	PERSON	and Dr.
George Bruce Halsted	PERSON	, and is published by '' The Neomon , '' in
Austin	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	.

		The latter version appears to be the more careful and exact .

		As for the story , it teaches , in the author 's familiar didactic style , the lesson of the common humanity that is shared by the lowest and the highest in the social scale , and exalts the beauty of sac - rifice in a singularly touching manner .

		Mr.
Richard B. Gruelle	PERSON	is the author of a volume of '' Notes , Critical and Biographical , '' upon the famous art collection of Mr.
W. T. Walters	PERSON	, of
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		Aside from the artistic feeling and critical insight dis - played in no small measure by this work , it appeals to the book-collector by the great beauty of its mechanical execution .

		The volume is one of over two hundred pages , and is printed in black and red , upon Michallet paper .

		It is published by Mr.
J. M. Bowles	PERSON	, the editor of '' Modern Art , '' in a limited edition , and copies may be had at the absurdly low price of
seventy-five cents	MONEY	.

		We predict that the edition will not last long .

		The ad - dress of Mr.
Bowles	PERSON	is 286
Roxbury	LOCATION	street ,
Boston	LOCATION	.

		`` Dentscher Wortschatz ; oder , Der Passende Aus - druck , '' is the title of a sort of German thesaurus pre - pared by
Herr A. Schlessing	PERSON	, and obtainable in this country from
Messrs. B. Westermann & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its lists of synonyms and groupings of allied words and expres - sions make it a very valuable aid for those who have occasion to express themselves in German , or to trans - late into that language .

		The work was first published three years ago , and the present is a second and revised edition .

		Dr.
Morton W. Eastman	PERSON	's '' Readings in Gower '' is a recent publication of the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, obtainable through
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Dr.
Eastman	PERSON	has been going through the Gower manuscripts in the British Museum , and has made a large number of cor - rections in the current printed texts .

		Every owner of
Pauli	ORGANIZATION	will need this little volume as a supplement , and will be likely to share the author 's conviction that a new edition of the ''
Confessio Amantis	PERSON	`` is sorely needed .

		LiITERARY NOTES .

		`` The American Historical Review , '' already an - nounced in these pages , will make its first appearance in
October	DATE	.

		Eighty-three titles are included in a list of the books written or edited by the Rev.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	.

		May he live to complete his century !

		Professor
James Taft Hatfield	PERSON	reprints from the '' Methodist Review , '' in pamphlet form , a sympathetic critical study of '' The Poetry of
Wilhelm Mtiller	PERSON	. '' ''

		The Mid-Continent , '' until recently '' The Southern Magazine , '' has discontinued publication , having sold its subscription list and good will to the publishers of `` Scribner 's Magazine , '' who will fill out all unexpired subscriptions .

		Mr.
J. M. Bowles	PERSON	has moved his beautiful quarterly , '' Modern Art , '' from
Indianapolis	LOCATION	to
Boston	LOCATION	, and now inaugurates his third volume with a number dated Jan -
uary 1 , 1895	DATE	.

		Two more numbers will follow in quick succession , enabling the periodical to '' catch up . ''

		A new typographical dress makes it more attractive than ever .

		A new series of manuals of the history of literature , projected by Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, is promised for the near future .

		English literature will be taken by the editor , French by Professor
Dowden	PERSON	, Italian by Dr.
Garnett	PERSON	, Greek by Professor
G. G. A. Murray	PERSON	, Japanese by Mr.
Basil Hall Chamberlain	PERSON	, and Modern Scandinavian by Dr.
Georg Brandes	PERSON	.

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have purchased the library of Mr.
Norton Q. Pope	PERSON	, of
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, and will place it on private sale .

		There are less than ten thousand vol - umes in the collection , but the average value is very high .

		The most famous number is the
Caxton	ORGANIZATION	''
Morte Darthur	PERSON	, '' the only perfect copy in existence .

		It is re - ported that the price paid for the library was
$ 150,000	MONEY	.

		The latest addition to the lengthening list of publica - tions issuing from the
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	is the first number of '' The American Journal of Soci - ology , '' a bi-monthly review .

		The
Faculty of Social Science	ORGANIZATION	, with Professor
Albion W. Small	PERSON	at the head , constitutes the editorial board .

		The new review pre - sents a dignified appearance and an attractive pro- gramme .

		We congratulate the editors both upon their first number and upon their pioneer occupation of an important field .

		Mr.
Frederick Saunders	PERSON	, librarian of the Astor Li - brary , celebrated his eighty-eighth birthday on the thir - teenth of
August	DATE	.

		He is well preserved and active .

		Mr.
Saunders	PERSON	was born in
London	LOCATION	, his father having been the senior member of the firm of
Saunders & Ot	ORGANIZATION	- ley , book publishers .

		He was well educated , and at the age of thirty he was sent to this country to endeavor to influence such action by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	as would prevent American piracy of English books .

		His attempts to this end were not successful , although petitions for an international copyright were headed by such men as
Irving	LOCATION	,
Bancroft	LOCATION	, and
Bryant	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Saunders	PERSON	deter - mined to remain in this country , and was engaged in various positions before becoming connected with the
Astor Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1859	DATE	he was appointed assistant librarian of the
Astor Library	ORGANIZATION	, and in
1876	DATE	librarian , where he has continued ever since .

		Mr.
Saunders	PERSON	is well known to book readers , particularly of the older generation , as the author of '' Salad for the Solitary '' and other once-popular volumes of light essays .

		A FEW WORDS ABOUT EDUCATION .

		At no previous time in the history of this coun - try has the discussion of educational questions been so serious a preoccupation as it is at pres - ent .

		During the
past quarter	DATE	of a century we have become pretty thoroughly awakened , not so much to the importance of education , which has never been questioned , as to the import - ance of establishing education upon the right foundation , and of conducting it in accordance with the most enlightened methods .

		So great a fermentation in so important a department of thought is , of course , a desirable thing , even if its blessings be not wholly unmixed .

		It is well occasionally to shake off our torpor , to get out of ruts , to avoid stagnation at almost any cost .

		But such a condition of intellectual un - rest , such a determination to reexamine the old grounds of the faith , is always fraught with the danger that we may , in our haste to make all things new , sweep away the good with the bad , and discard some of the fundamental principles of the philosophy of a sound education .

		Many zealous advocates of what they are pleased to call '' the new education '' are so thoroughgoing in their notions that the tem - perate onlooker is compelled to view their pro- posed policy somewhat askance .

		They would 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, have us believe that the world has hitherto been all astray , that the educational wisdom of the ages is little better than foolishness , that we are upon the eve of a reform in our practice which is to be nothing less than revolutionary in its effect .

		These theorists complain , briefly , that education has in the past been made too much a matter of words ; the remedy they offer is to make it in the future chiefly a matter of things .

		To bring about this radical change , it is pro- posed to displace , to a great extent , the sterile practices of literary , philological , and historical study , by the productive practices with which physical science acquaints us ; to substitute for the study of man in his social and political character the study of man in his character as a tool-making and tool-using animal , mainly intent upon material comfort and progress .

		The educational tendency here suggested is very marked at the present day , and the signs of the times in many ways force it upon our attention .

		It is a tendency more marked , per - haps , during recent years than ever before , and more marked , probably , in our own country than in any other .

		This is a fact easily to be ac - counted for .

		The development of physical sci - ence is the dominant intellectual characteristic of the age , and this development , with its count - less implied possibilities of material ameliora - tion , has diverted many eyes from those things of the spirit that are so essential to the higher welfare of mankind , fixing them instead upon the objects which their lower natures demand ; it has , in a word , substituted ideals of comfort for ideals of virtue and of the full-statured life of the soul .

		And this diversion of attention from the higher to the lower aims of life , this substitution of lesser ideals for greater , of ig - noble for noble purposes , has been nowhere else so nearly complete as in this country of unexampled material resources and unexam - pled material prosperity .


Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, in one of his essays on re - ligious subjects , has a passage exactly descrip - tive of our too prevalent attitude toward the educational problem .

		This passage , with the necessary substitution of '' the humanities , '' or some such phrase , for the word '' religion , '' runs f n '' as follows : '' Undoubtedly there are times when a reaction sets in , when an interest in the processes of productive indus - try , in physical science and the practical arts , is called an interest in things , and an interest in -LSB- the humanities -RSB- is called an interest in words .

		People really do seem to imagine that in seeing and learning how buttons are made , or papier mdche , they shall find some new and untried vital resource ; that our prospects from this sort of study have something peculiarly hopeful and ani - mating about them ; and that the positive and practical thing to do is to give up -LSB- the humanities -RSB- and turn to them . ''

		Now a great many sincere and well-meaning people have been telling us of late that '' the positive and practical thing to do '' in educa - tion is to set aside such useless studies as '' mere '' history and literature , as '' dead '' lan - guages and ancient civilizations ; to restrict considerably the attention paid to most other kinds of '' book '' learning ; and to devote the time thus reclaimed from waste to such scien - tific and even manual pursuits as are likely to have some direct bearing upon the everyday life of the men and women that our school - children are so soon to become .

		Half-truths are often more dangerous than downright errors , and the consequences of the sciolist theory of education just outlined are in many directions manifest .

		For one thing , there is the loud outcry , heard in many quarters , for the introduction of '' manual training '' into our common-school systems , not as an adjunct to intellectual training , which it may very prop - erly become , but as a substitute for what is contemptuously styled the Wortkram of the old-fashioned systems .

		One persistent advo - cate of this particular nostrum goes so far as to say that in the ideal school of his imagining '' the highest text-books are tools , and how to use them most intelligently is the highest test of scholarship . ''

		In the field of higher educa - tion , the same spirit is illustrated by the im - mense expansion of the technological and sci - entific departments of our universities , at the expense , too often , of the humanities , and by the determined warfare that has been waged , during the past score of years , upon the clas - sical and other branches of the older education .

		In the development of the current popular opinion upon this all-important subject , we may distinguish two phases .

		To begin with , science , in the first flush of its great mid-century achieve - ments , put forth the arrogant plea that it alone was deserving of serious consideration as an educational discipline .

		Mr.
Spencer	PERSON	's famous tractate upon '' Education '' seemed to give cogency to this plea , and for a time did duty as a sort of gospel of the new dispensation .

		But the narrowness and inadequacy of that gospel became , after a while , apparent even to the less reflective of minds , and a new doctrine emerged to fit the altered educational attitude .

		That doctrine , which has lately been urged with considerable eloquence , is , substantially , that
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 107 all subjects are equally valuable as intellectual disciplines , and that physics and biology , if pursued in the proper spirit , are as potent to build up the full-statured life as are history , and literature , and philosophy .

		But there are now indications that a third phase of the dis - cussion is at hand , and that the question of relative educational values is about to receive a more searching examination than it has ever had before .

		And , in this connection , it is in - deed significant that the President for
1895	DATE	of the
National Educational Association	ORGANIZATION	, in pre - paring his inaugural address , should have felt that the time was ripe to use such words as the following : '' If it be true that Spirit and Reason rule the universe , then the highest and most enduring knowledge is of the things of the Spirit .

		That subtle sense of the beauti - ful and the sublime which accompanies spiritual insight , and is part of it , is the highest achievement of which humanity is capable ... The study of nature is en - titled to recognition on grounds similar to those put forward for the study of literature , of art , and of his - tory .

		But among themselves these divisions of knowl - edge fall into an order of excellence as educational ma - terial that is determined by their respective relations to the development of the reflective Reason .

		The ap - plication of this test must inevitably lead us , while hon - oring science and insisting upon its study , to place above it the study of history , of literature , of art , and of in - stitutional life . ''

		Contrasted with such an ideal as this of the well-ordered education , how poor are all ideals that but proclaim the watchword of a narrow practicality .

		One of the finest expressions ever given to the nobler view is embodied in this pas - sage from
Newman	PERSON	's '' Idea of a University '' : '' That perfection of the Intellect , which is the result of Education , and its beau ideal , to be imparted to indi - viduals in their respective measures , is the clear , calm , accurate vision and comprehension of all things as far as the finite mind can embrace them , each in its place , and with its own characteristics upon it .

		It is almost prophetic from its knowledge of history ; it is almost heart-searching from its knowledge of human nature ; it has almost supernatural charity from its freedom from littleness and prejudice ; it has almost the repose of faith , because nothing can startle it ; it has almost the beauty and harmony of heavenly contemplation , so intimate is it with the eternal order of things and the music of the spheres . ''

		Nor does this higher aim concern the advanced stages of educational work alone .

		It should be an inspiring force in the kindergarten no less than in the college ; for the child , as well as the man , does not live by bread alone , un - less , indeed , it be that `` pan degli Angeli '' whereof
Dante	ORGANIZATION	tells us . ''

		Those few , '' he says , '' are blessed who sit at the board '' where it is eaten .

		Let it be our task to make the few the many , and the largess such as knows no stint .

		Efje THE LIFE or A `` TYPICAL , ENGLISHMAN . ''

		* Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	's Life of his brother , Sir
James Fitzjames Stephen	PERSON	, is an admirable bio - graphy which may be read with interest even by those who care little for its ostensible theme .

		Fitzjames
Stephen	PERSON	, eminent alike as journalist , judge , jurist , and writer on polity and jurispru - dence , seems to have corresponded pretty closely in his general make-up with what we Americans have in mind when we speak of the '' typical Englishman '' a type perhaps on the whole more forcible and virile than engaging .

		A rug - ged , combative , unpliable man , massive alike intellectually and physically , he could well afford to accept life -LRB- as we think he did accept it , under qualification -RRB- as an ordered form of the Hobbesian war of each against all a grand trial of individual strengths , regulated by gov - ernment charged mainly with the duty of keep - ing the lists and seeing fair play between the competitors .

		All
Fitzjames Stephen	PERSON	asked for himself in the contest was a fair field and no favors ; and we fancy he had a hearty contempt for anyone who asked for more .

		Our social ideals are constructed , however unconsciously , with reference to our own personal needs and aptitudes ; and
Fitzjames Stephen	PERSON	, a born ath - lete , was naturally not averse to an order of things in which the race is to the swift and the battle to the strong .

		We find him once frankly declaring -LRB- though he seems to have been rather ashamed of the sentiment afterwards -RRB- that '' to be stronger than other people , and to have one 's own will as against them , is the deepest and most general of human desires .

		If it were a wish which fulfilled itself , how very strong and how very triumphant I should be . ''

		His bio - grapher hastens , with brotherly solicitude , to style this outbreak '' a mere passing velleity '' ; but it seems characteristic enough of the speaker .

		The opening chapters contain a brief history of the
Stephen	PERSON	family , dating from the early part of the last century , and beginning with
James Stephen	PERSON	, a thrifty
Aberdeenshire	LOCATION	small farmer , '' with no insuperable objection to deal - ing in contraband articles . ''

		The

		108 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, three inches , tradition says that when a friend once offered him a pony to carry him home after dinner , '' he made and won a bet that he would carry the pony . ''

		As an amusing con - trast to this Titan may be mentioned a member of the family by marriage , one Mr.
Garratt	PERSON	, a barrister of high character and standing , though a dwarf in stature . ''

		Mr.
Garratt	PERSON	! ''

		an irascible judge once shouted , '' when you are addressing the court you should stand up . '' ''

		I am standing up , my lord . '' ''

		Then , Mr.
Garratt	PERSON	, you should stand upon the bench . ''

		`` I am standing upon the bench , my lord , '' meekly rejoined Mr.
Garratt	PERSON	.

		Sir
James Ste	PERSON	- phen , grandson of the smuggling ancestor and father of Fitzjames and
Leslie	PERSON	, was a really eminent man .

		As under
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	for the Colonies , he '' literally ruled the Col - onial Empire , '' and seems to have been in his quiet way a masterful character , albeit cursed with a shyness beyond , said a colleague , '' all shyness you could imagine in anyone whose soul had not been preexistent in a wild duck . ''

		A shining Evangelical light , Sir
James	PERSON	was ascetic by temperament , hating long dinners , abhorring port wine , and appearing to his sons a sort of living '' categorical imperative . '' ''

		Did you ever know your father do a thing because it was pleasant ? ''

		Lady
Stephen	PERSON	once asked one of her children . ''

		Yes , once when he married you , '' was the young courtier 's neat reply .

		Sir
James	PERSON	himself used to say , and it was no empty boast , that he was one of the few people to whom it was the same thing to eat a dinner and to perform an act of self-denial .

		He once smoked a cigar , and found it so de - licious that he never smoked again ; and he in - dulged in snuff until it suddenly occurred to him that snuff was superfluous , when the box was solemnly emptied out of the window and never refilled .

		Fitzjames
Stephen	PERSON	was born on
March 3 , 1829	DATE	; and , if the maternal record of his in - fantile doings and sayings is to be trusted , he was a remarkable child indeed , a young non - conformist much given to reflection on precepts which are commonly taken on trust , and filled with notions which resolutely declined to run in the regulation moulds .

		At four we find him sagely refusing to join in a hymn which ex - presses a premature desire '' to die and be with God , '' on the ground that even good people may prefer to stay in this world ; and , later , he evolves a kind of
Benthamee	LOCATION	- Christian theory that , as naughtiness is extremely pleas - ant in itself , and as we know that it is finally expiable by repentance , the true rule would be '' to be naughty all your life , and to repent just at the end , '' thereby , we suppose , securing the greatest possible measure of bliss in this world , without unduly drawing on one 's account in the next .

		Fitzjames 's first school , at
Brighton	LOCATION	, was a sort of spiritual forcing-house , a young prig 's paradise , where there was no cricket , no fighting , no fagging , and an excess of evan - gelical theology .

		At prayers -LRB- they were nearly always at prayers -RRB- the boys used to be ques - tioned : '' Gurney , what 's the difference be - tween justification and sanctification ? '' ''

		Ste - phen , prove the omnipotence of God , '' and so on .

		Rescued betimes from
Brighton	LOCATION	,
Fitz	PERSON	- james was sent to
Eton	LOCATION	, where , it is needless to say , there was plenty of fighting and fagging , and no evangelical or other theology to speak of .

		A tutor once rather naively excused this lack on the ground that he '' was always of opinion that nothing was so important for boys as the preservation of Christian simplicity '' ; and Fitzjames always considered the answer a '' perfectly admirable '' one .

		Partly because he was an '' up-town boy '' he lived with his parents at
Windsor	LOCATION	, and not in college and partly because of his rather unsocial turn ,
Fitz	PERSON	- james was at first dreadfully bullied at the shrine of ''
Henry	PERSON	's holy shade . ''

		But he pres - ently grew so tall and strong that it was dan - gerous to attack him .

		As pugnacious as
Keats	PERSON	, the once passive victim became a doughty cham - pion in his turn .

		Says an old Etonian : '' Often have I applauded his backhanders as the fore - most in the fray .

		He was only vanquished by numbers .

		His bill for hats must have amounted to a stiff figure , for my visions of Fitzjames are of a discrowned war - rior , returning to
Windsor	LOCATION	bareheaded , his hair moist with the steam of recent conflict ... The kicks , cuffs , and hat-smashing had no other result than to steel his mind forever against oppression , tyranny , and unfair - ness of every kind . ''

		We do not find that Fitzjames was among the crack verse-makers at
Eton	LOCATION	, or that he spe - cially distinguished himself in any way save pugilistically ; but he there learned the lesson which he never forgot , that to be weak is to be wretched , that the state of nature is a state of war and
Vce Victis Nature	ORGANIZATION	's primal law .

		His recollections of Eton -LRB- like his brother 's -RRB- are not wholly flattering : '' The teaching was ' wretched ' ; the hours irregular and very unpunctual ; the classes were excessively large , and the tutorial instruction supposed to be given out of school frequently neglected . '

		I do not believe , ' says my brother , ' that I was ever once called on to construe at my tutor 's after I got into the fifth form ... ' Bal - ston , our tutor , was a good scholar after the fashion of

		If you are not a man of taste , how can you ever hope to be of use in the world ? '

		a sorites , says my brother , which must be somewhere de - fective . ''

		A man of taste
Stephen	PERSON	major certainly never became , though he acquired a forcible and even brilliant prose style .

		For art he cared little , and for poetry less .

		He honestly con - fessed , to the dismay of the judicious
Balston	LOCATION	, that he could not see why people wrote poetry at all . ''

		When a man has anything to say , I am always tempted to ask why he can not say it in plain prose . ''

		The
Eton	ORGANIZATION	course was fol - lowed by two rather profitable years at
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, where the principal , Dr.
Jelf	PERSON	, represented the high and dry , cock-sure form of Anglicanism .

		Says our author : '' I can remember how , a little later , I used to listen with wonder to his expositions of the Thirty-nine Arti - cles .

		What a marvellous piece of good fortune it was , I used dimly to consider , that the Church of
England	LOCATION	had always hit off precisely the right solution in so many and such tangled controversies ! ''

		At
King 's College	ORGANIZATION	, Fitzjames was much at - tracted by Professor
Maurice	PERSON	, and for the time fancied himself more or less of a Mauricean .

		Afterwards , in his skeptical days , he used to say , picturesquely enough , of
Maurice	ORGANIZATION	's preach - ing that it was like '' watching the struggles of a drowning creed . ''

		In
1847	DATE	Fitzjames entered
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		The Cambridge of those days , says Mr.
Leslie Ste	PERSON	- phen , had merits now too likely to be under - valued ; but the course was strangely narrow .

		To adapt a phrase of
Hume	PERSON	's , she virtually said to her pupils : `` Is this a treatise upon geometry or algebra ?

		No .

		Is it , then , a treat - ise upon Greek or Latin grammar , or on the grammatical construction of classical authors ?

		No .

		Then commit it to the flames , for it con - tains nothing worth your study . ''

		In both these arenas , Fitzjames was comparatively weak .

		He had neither head nor heart for mere scholar - ship , was clumsy at calculation , and lacked the docility which so often enables a merely clever and teachable boy to outfoot rivals of ten times his real power and originality the latter a quality which '' tempts a man outside the strait and narrow path leading to the maximum of marks . ''

		So , despising at heart what he con - sidered the trivial standards and empty pedan - tries of the place , Fitzjames left
Cambridge	LOCATION	without academical honors .

		Three times in life Fitzjames performed du - ties thoroughly consonant with his talents and temper : as journalist , as legal member of the
Council	ORGANIZATION	at
Calcutta	LOCATION	, and as a judge on the crim - inal bench .

		In the last capacity the characteristics which impeded his fortunes at the bar where his career is described as a series of '' tantalising half-successes '' became distinctly advantages .

		His contempt of trickery ; willingness to give , and determination to have , fair play ; and his inbred disdain of all arguments not going to the substantial merits of the issue , were com - patible at least with high judicial qualities .

		Woe to the pettifogger who tried to eke out a flimsy case by playing on the foibles or throw - ing technical dust in the eyes of Judge Ste - phen !

		Viewing himself as in some sort the organ of the moral sense of the community , he leaned rather to severity than mercy ; and when , after a fair trial , a man had been clearly proved before him to be a scoundrel , so far from affecting the usual reluctance in passing sentence , he showed rather the grim satisfac - tion of a man crushing a noxious reptile .

		Yet he showed , in doubtful cases , an almost pain - ful anxiety to secure fair play to the accused .

		One incident out of many of his love of exact justice may be quoted : '' A man accused of stabbing a policeman to avoid ar - rest , pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven years ' penal servitude .

		On being removed by the warders , he clung to the rail , screaming , ` You ca n't do it .

		You do n't know what you are doing ! '

		Fitzjames shouted to the warders to put him back ; discovered by patient hearing that the man was meaning to refer to some cir - cumstance in extenuation , and after recalling the wit - nesses found that the statement was confirmed .

		< Now , you silly fellow , ' he said , < if you had pleaded '' not guilty , '' as I told you , all this would have come out .

		It is true that I did not know what I was doing , but it was your own fault . '

		He then reduced the sentence to nine months , saying , ' Does that satisfy you ? ' '

		Thank you , ' my Lord , ' replied the man , ' that 's quite right , ' and left the court quite cheerfully . ''

		Stephen rigidly suppressed anything in the court-room tending to lower the dignity of the proceedings ; and it is recorded that when a spectator once laughed at a piece of evidence which should have disgusted him , he promptly had the fellow placed by the side of the pris - oner in the dock , and kept him there till the end of the case .

		The promiscuous attendance of ladies at '' sensational '' trials was the sharp - est of thorns in his side ; and he once gave offence by speaking of some persons of that sex who were fighting for admission as '' women . ''

		Possibly this was during the trial of Mrs.
May	DATE	- 110 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, brick , a cause celebre at which he presided .

		It will be remembered that Mrs.
Maybrick	PERSON	was convicted of the murder of her husband , and that her sentence was commuted -LRB- with Ste - phen 's approval -RCB- to imprisonment for life , on the ground that , although there was no doubt that she had administered poison , it was pos - sible that her husband had died from other causes .

		Says Mr.
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	: '' A great deal of feeling was aroused ; Fitzjames was bitterly attacked in the press , and received many anon - ymous letters full of the vilest abuse .

		Hatred of wo - men generally , and jealousy of the counsel for the de - fense , were among the causes of his infamous conduct suggested by these judicious correspondents ... But as attacks were made in public organs upon his behavior as judge , I think it right to say that they were abso - lutely without foundation .

		His letters show that he felt the responsibility deeply ; and that he kept his mind open till the last .

		From other evidence I have not the least doubt that his humanity and impartiality were as conspicuous in this as in other cases , and I believe were not impugned by any other witnesses , even by those who might doubt the correctness of the verdict . ''

		The author gives a detailed account of his brother 's career in literature and journalism , at the bar and on the bench , and of his official work in
India	LOCATION	.

		The chapters analytical of his somewhat involved religious , philosophical , and political convictions are full of interest and sug - gestion .

		The work is finely mounted , and con - tains two excellent portraits .

		Mr.
Parkman	PERSON	's volumes are marked , in the first place , by the results of laborious and suc - cessf ul research .

		They are real contributions to * THE
MISSISSIPPI	LOCATION	BASIN .

		The Struggle in
America	LOCATION	between
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, 1697-1763 .

		knowledge .

		But , more than this , Mr.
Parkman	PERSON	has used his materials , so conscientiously gath - ered , with excellent effect , combining and pre - senting them with such admirable literary skill that the series is a brilliant picture , on a great canvas , of the competition of
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	for dominion in
North America	LOCATION	.

		In the first of these particulars , Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	is fully Mr.
Parkman	PERSON	's equal : he is quite as thorough in investigation .

		Indeed , his books are not unlikely to impress some readers as the more learned of the two .

		But to literary art Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	can lay no claims .

		He is often for - cible , and occasionally animated and pictur - esque ; but , on the whole , he carries his nar - rative as heavily as Mr.
Parkman	PERSON	carries his lightly .

		It is owing in part to this difference , and in part to differences in ideal and subject - matter , that the unpracticed reader is likely to overrate , comparatively , the intrinsic value of Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	's books , as suggested above .

		Ow - ing to these three causes ideal , matter , and style Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	's volumes are not likely to prove attractive to the conventional general reader ; but historical students and scholars will hold them in highest estimation .

		It must be said that Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	's researches have run mainly in a different channel from Mr.
Parkman	PERSON	's ; or , to be more exact , that they have run mainly in one of the two channels in which the earlier writer moved .

		The sub-title of the earlier work , '' Geographical Discovery in the Interior of
North America	LOCATION	in its Histor - ical Relations , with full Cartographical Illus - trations from Contemporary Sources , '' indi - cates what this channel is .

		Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	is here seen at his best in a field that is peculiarly his own .

		It is a part of the field that he culti - vated with such good results in the ''
Narra	ORGANIZATION	- tive and Critical History of
America	LOCATION	'' and in the ''
Christopher Columbus	PERSON	. ''

		He now returns to it for the purpose of a richer and more thorough tillage .

		It is true that the present work has the alternative title , '' The Struggle in
America	LOCATION	between
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	'' ; but geographical discovery and exploration are still kept at the fore , and the cartographical illustrations , partially changed indeed in char - acter as the progress of history compels , are as abundant as ever .

		In a word , the writer 's main purpose is to exhibit to his readers that gradual uncovering or disclosure which explor - ers of the North American continent made to the eyes of the civilized world from
1634	DATE	to
1763	DATE	, or at least so much of it as was in - volved in the competition of the two powers
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL ill with which he deals .

		The properly equipped reader who will read these pages , and study the accompanying maps , will see unrolled be - fore his eyes a panorama of events that , of their kind , are perhaps the most interesting that the world has seen .

		It is true that Mr.
Park	PERSON	- man is also strong in this field ; but his work is much less minute , while the cartographical studies and illustrations are meagre indeed when compared with Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	's affluence of such material .

		It is also to be said that , in respect to discovery , the one writer dwells more upon the merely historical aspects , the other upon the scientific aspects .

		The further re - mark is to be made that , although Dr. Win - sor 's present sub-title is the same as the title of Mr.
Parkman	PERSON	's series , the struggle , even relatively , is far less prominent in his pages .

		The value of Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	's account lies far more in the indication of the causes that made the struggle inevitable , and that also predeter - mined its character and result , and especially the geographical causes , than in his handling of proper historical material .

		Parkman has given far more attention to the human , or strictly his - torical , aspects of the story .

		A few illustrations of the difference in method will be given .

		Parkman gives a chapter of thirty - eight pages to
Deerfield	LOCATION	;
Winsor	ORGANIZATION	barely alludes to it .

		Parkman finds two volumes necessary for dealing with the last act of the drama ; Win - sor dispatches it in one hundred pages .

		Park - man devotes three long chapters to
Wolfe	PERSON	's great exploit ;
Winsor	LOCATION	, barely as many pages .

		Parkman lengthens out his account of the fall of Louisbourg into the hands of
Pepperell	LOCATION	and
Warren	PERSON	, in
1745	DATE	, until it fills two chapters of fifty-four pages ;
Winsor	PERSON	finds a single para - graph of eleven lines sufficient .

		On the other hand ,
Winsor	ORGANIZATION	gives a much more minute and careful account of the establishment of the French settlements on the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	and on the
Lower Mississippi	LOCATION	, and has a sharper eye for the progress of discovery in that quar - ter .

		Parkman , indeed , gives nearly forty pages to the heroic achievements of the La Verend - ryes in the far West , which is about twice the space Winsor thinks necessary ; but the ca - reers of these adventurous and self-forgetting men gave
Parkman	PERSON	one of his good opportu - nities for the multiplication of historical detail and picturesque writing .

		And so we might go on , were it necessary to go further .

		It will be seen that we have chosen to char - acterize the work that Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	has done in his present field rather than to deal partic - ularly with the book before us .

		This is because his qualities as historian are the same through - out .

		Eespecting the new book , it will suffice to say that he begins with defining the position of the rival claimants to
North America	LOCATION	at the close of the seventeenth century , indicating also the titles upon which they rested ; that he then draws the boldest and most comprehensive out - line of the grand natural features of our con - tinent to be found in any book of history ; that he then takes up the work of
Iberville	LOCATION	and Bien - ville on the
Lower Mississippi	LOCATION	; that he closes with the completed occupation by the English , in
1765	DATE	, of the empire that the French had yielded to them two years before ; and that every intervening chapter and page is filled with valuable information and discussion , the whole illustrated with such wealth of maps as to show that the author has really laid all lit - erature under contribution .

		An abstract of two of his later pages will at once illustrate his method , and at the same time show why the boundary which the Treaty of
Paris	LOCATION	gave to the
United States	LOCATION	in
1782	DATE	was an impossible one .

		While the upper waters of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	were not at this time -LSB-
1763	DATE	-RSB- supposed to be connected with the water - system of
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's Bay , the contemporary cartographers placed the river 's source anywhere from latitude 45 to 55 .

		Jefferys thought it somewhat above 45 .


Samuel Dunn	PERSON	put it , a little later , under 46 , and he clusters sev - eral lakes about the source .

		Buache , the French map - maker , places the fountain at 46 , among the
Sioux	LOCATION	.

		A map based on
Danville	LOCATION	, and using material gathered by Governor
Pownall	PERSON	, puts the source in a lake at 47 , due south of the Lake of the Woods .

		The Dutchman ,
Vander Aa	ORGANIZATION	, in
1755	DATE	, puts the springs doubtfully at 55 , but in
1763	DATE	he finds reason to place a little group of three lakes , out of which the river flows from a triple source under 49 .

		A French map , prepared for the Company of the West , establishes the head under 50 .


Bowen	PERSON	, in a map produced to show the treaty bounds , says the position of the source is uncertain , but that the Indians report it under 50 , and in a marshy region .


Robert Rogers	PERSON	says the
Mississippi	LOCATION	rises in a lake '' of considerable bigness '' into which flows a stream through a notch in the mountains , carrying a red substance .

		Some geographers still clung to an older notion of in - terlinking inland waters , flowing in different directions .

		It was common for these to connect the upper wa - ters of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	with a reticulation of lakes and streams having a dependence upon Hudson 's Bay , and sometimes upon that mysterious channel which formed a union with the western sea .

		Roberts , an English car - tographer , in
1760	DATE	, makes the
Mississippi	LOCATION	rise in
Lake Winnipeg	LOCATION	.

		Palairet , a French map-maker , connects the sources with
Lake Winnipeg	LOCATION	, though he acknowledges the upper parts of the channel are little known .

		He adds that some suppose there is a connection between the
Mississippi	LOCATION	or
Missouri	LOCATION	and the
Manton	PERSON	-LRB-
Mandan	LOCATION	-RRB- River , which he represents by a dotted line as flowing ultimately into the Sea of the
West	LOCATION	.

		This same de - vice of an uncertain dotted line is used by
Emanuel Bowen	PERSON	, in
1763	DATE	, to join the upper
Mississippi	LOCATION	with the 112 -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	,
Red River	LOCATION	of the North .

		The
Neptune	LOCATION	Fran ^ aise has no hesitancy in connecting the
Mississippi	LOCATION	with
Lake Winnipeg	LOCATION	, and a most wonderful network of waters is supposed by
Vander Aa	ORGANIZATION	on a map of
1755	DATE	, where the
Mississippi	LOCATION	,
Winnipeg	LOCATION	, Lake Superior , and
Hudson	ORGANIZATION	's Bay are all brought into a single system of communica - tion .

		In
1776	DATE
Jefferys	ORGANIZATION	connects
Winnipeg	LOCATION	with a fan - ciful inlet on the
Pacific	LOCATION	coast , which D'Aguilar is sup - posed to have entered in
1603	DATE	.

		Explorers were still beguiled by the Indian tales of the connection of the
Missouri	LOCATION	by means of a string of interjacent lakes with the
South Sea	LOCATION	, and there were stories which induced Carver to believe that the Shining Mountains -LRB- Rockies -RRB- stretched from about 48 north latitude toward the south , and divided the waters flowing into the Gulfs of
Mexico	LOCATION	and
California	LOCATION	.

		He suspected that north of 48 there was a water-system somehow connecting
Hudson	PERSON	's Bay with the
Pacific	LOCATION	, and lying somewhere thereaway were the Straits of Anian , '' which , having been discovered by Sir
Francis Drake	PERSON	, belong of course to the English . ''

		Even the most careful scholars commit blun - ders .

		Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	brings La Salle to the shore of the
Gulf of Mexico	LOCATION	in
1681	DATE	-LRB- page 4 -RRB- , and
Pineda	PERSON	to the mouth of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	in
1579	DATE	-LRB- page 6 -RRB- .

		On page 279 he names the south branch of the
Potomac	LOCATION	where he evidently means the north branch .

		The index to the work is perhaps as complete as could reasona - bly be expected , but the lack of an analytical table of contents is a great drawback .

		Then Dr.
Winsor	PERSON	, of all writers , should be the last to omit from such a work as this all references or other indications of his sources , save the very general ones that are found in the text .

		THE LOWEST OF THE BACK-BONED ANIMALS .

		* Since the discovery of the vertebrate nature of the Lancelet , by
Gabriel Costa	ORGANIZATION	, in
1834	DATE	, this little creature has been an object of special in - terest to anatomists , to taxonomists , and to evo - lutionists alike .

		It is a vertebrate animal re - duced to its lowest terms , being deprived of all those structures with which the name ver - tebrate is usually associated .

		The Lancelet , or Amphioxus -LRB- in technical nomenclature , Bran - chiostoma -RRB- is fish-like in form and habit , but it is as far below or behind the fishes as man is above or beyond them .

		It lacks limbs , scales , skull , brain , jaws , eyes , ears , heart , red - blood , and vertebra .

		Its existence shows that all these structures are results of special de - velopment additions not essential to the * AMPHIOXUS AND THE ANCESTRY OF THE VERTFTJRATES .

		primitive definition of a '' back-boned animal . ''

		Of late it has been supposed that Bran - chiostoma is of the type of the primitive ver - tebrates , and that the study of its structure and embryology would give a clue to the steps by which the chordate or vertebrate animals had risen from worm - like forms .

		But this has not been certain , nor have the features of degeneration been clearly separated from those of primitive simplicity .

		In his work on '' Amphioxus and the An - cestry of the Vertebrates , '' Dr.
Willey	PERSON	treats in detail all these matters , with also an account of the Ascidians ,
Balanoglossus	LOCATION	, and other types near the border-line between vertebrates and invertebrates .

		His final conclusions are thus expressed : '' The proximate ancestor of the vertebrates was a free-swimming animal intermediate in organization be - tween an Ascidian tadpole and Amphioxus , possessing the dorsal mouth , hypophysis , and restricted notochord of the former ; and the myotomes , ccelomic epithelium , and straight alimentary canal of the latter .

		The ulti - mate or primordial ancestor of the vertebrates would , on the contrary , be a worm-like animal whose organi - zation was approximately on a level with that of the bilateral ancestors of the Echinoderms . ''

		The eight species of Amphioxus are all placed by Dr.
Willey	PERSON	in one genus ,
Amphi	LOCATION	- oxus .

		As Dr.
Gill	PERSON	has shown , the secondary modifications of this group are better shown , for purposes of classification , by its division into four genera ,
Branchiostoma	LOCATION	, JEpigon - ichthys ,
Asymmetron	LOCATION	, and Amphioxides .

		The book is a very valuable resume of our knowledge of a branch of zoology especially interesting in its relations to evolution .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 113 Attacks , which they thought would be destructive in a high degree if not final , have passed by as mere episodes in a general development of religious be - lief .

		Conventional rites and creeds that seemed like barren fields exhausted by careless and routine tillage broken in on , no matter where or how , have shown a soil full of seeds , capable of astonish - ing life .

		If any faith has been stripped away , it has given place , like a felled forest , to another and equally abundant form of growth .

		This pertinacity of life has shown itself , on the one side , in the able and sturdy defence , even with a backward trend , of older forms of faith ; and on the other side , in the eagerness with which every new position is taken up in the spiritual world and fortified as if it had something of the nature of a finality .

		No bands of inquirers , even in science , are disposed to pitch their camp for a single night without throwing out some defensive works on the side of religious belief .

		The one omnipresent thought with men , more than ever before , is : How do these facts bear on man 's spiritual hopes ?

		We are impressed anew with this perennial flow of faith by the range , force , and depth of the works before us for review .

		With all the diversity of tendencies they present , there is no languor nor indifference . ''

		As Others Saw Him '' is a well-written , agree - able book .

		It is not a product simply of the imag - ination , but an effort to construct , pictorially and historically , the farther side , the more unfamiliar side , of the life of Christ .

		The '' others '' in the title stand for those not his disciples , yet those whose interested attention was called out by
Christ	ORGANIZATION	.

		The author strives to restore the impression which the presence and words of Christ must have made upon them .

		In doing this he avails himself , not merely of the Gospel narrative , but also of all sayings and representations afloat in '' patristic literature . ''

		Works of this cast encounter a difficulty hard to escape .

		Events that are intensely momentous , pre - eminently historical , can accept only with some con - fusion of impression , and shock of feeling , an im - aginary form .

		Earnest minds prefer a severely critical method that does not admit of any slurring of the facts , or of the evidence on which they rest .

		The author , however , uses the freedom of an imag - inary restoration of the life of Christ with forbear - ance and good taste . ''

		A
Creedless Gospel	ORGANIZATION	and the Gospel Creed '' is a comprehensive , able , and abating one 's own be - lief that it is inadequate a profound work .

		It is an earnest plea for the supernatural character and force of the leading facts and doctrines of Christian faith as presented in the Apostolic Creed .

		It is divided into three parts .

		The first part endeavors to show the inadequacy of the grounds of belief which have been given by science , philosophy , ethics , natural religion , and social growth .

		The second part presents , on the positive side , the chief events on which Christianity rests , as the author conceives it : the self - revelation of God , the incarnation , the crucifixion , the resurrection , the ascension , the Holy Ghost , the church , the judgment .

		The third part is a brief enforcement of Christian courage , knowl - edge , joy in the presence of this supernatural light .

		The book is well-fitted to impress the mind with a sense of the zeal and the redemptive power of the old forms of faith .

		Here is the true seed broken indeed for many of us and left behind by the divine process of growth out of which emerges the spir - itual life of man .

		The work is too wide and thorough in its scope to be criticized hastily , or to be advan - tageously found fault with , in single details .

		We draw attention to a few of the general considerations which have made , and still make , against an inflex - ible defence of the supernatural as hitherto con - ceived .

		The words of
Christ	LOCATION	, defining our relations to God , are the very essence of naturalism .

		If we make religion a field foreign to science , to philoso - phy , to morality , to society , we , at the same time , make science , philosophy , morality , and society in the same measure fields foreign to religion .

		We break the harmony of the universe .

		We oppose religion to the universe .

		Evolution , rightly ren - dered , must find its way , does find its way , into religious faith .

		Faith can not be opposed to rea - son or put above reason .

		Reason must be ultimate .

		When faith at any point transcends reason , it owes its acceptance in that relation to reason itself . ''

		The
United Church	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	'' is a volume made up chiefly of essays addressed , at var - ious times , to distinguished assemblies and to the public on the question of
Church Unity	ORGANIZATION	.

		The au - thor has been , for a long time , a prominent ex - pounder and advocate of this unity .

		The book is a full and accumulative presentation on the writer 's part of this discussion .

		It seems to us character - ized by an extravagant estimate of the importance of the theme , and by vagueness in its presentation .

		The first assertion of the preface is : '' It has been becoming evident to many thoughtful observers that the chief Christian problem of our age is the Re - union of
Christendom	LOCATION	. ''

		This , in view of the social and spiritual questions at issue with us , seems a very extreme assertion .

		The author misconceives the value of an outer unity .

		`` But surely , if social ills are fast coming to a crisis , it is folly to ignore them ; and if organized Christianity is their only perfect remedy it is madness to withhold that remedy '' -LRB- p. 260 -RRB- .

		The vagueness of the work is in keeping with the over-estimate of its subject .

		The unity of the Church may be spiritual or formal .

		The two , however , in clear discussion must be kept apart .

		We may dwell at liberty on the need of spiritual unity , and nobody will say us nay .

		The moment we propose some distinct formal union , most persons will lapse into indifference ; many will violently oppose it ; and the advantages to be gained by it will rapidly disappear .

		The author seems to us to stand with one foot on the land the firm land of spiritual unity and the other on the sea the sea of rites and creeds still indeterminate in 114 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, men 's minds , and to be very careful not to throw his weight forward into the position next in order a distinct form of union .

		The dispersive results of intellectual activity are not yet complete .

		The truly vital forces are still explorative and devisive .

		It is vain to try to bring them together till they begin to come together .

		If Episcopacy in
England	LOCATION	were to-day to be disestablished , it would be very likely to drop into three parts , a high church , a low church , a broad church .

		Formal unity is to be gained by interior growth and lies far in advance of us .

		`` The Bibles and Beliefs of
Mankind	LOCATION	'' is an after-clap of the
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is made up of three parts : The Bibles and Beliefs of
Mankind	LOCATION	with liberal quotations ; Churches and Communions associated with Christianity ;
Parlia	LOCATION	- mentary Utterances .

		It is popular and pictorial in form , and has especially some fine portraits of those who took part in the Assembly of
1893	DATE	.

		It is an effort still farther to utilize the wide impressions made by that expressive , fruitful , and somewhat scenic assembly The Parliament of Religions . ''

		Life Here and Hereafter '' is a volume of ser - mons ; the earlier ones on immortality , the later ones on various subjects .

		They are republished from corrected newspaper reports .

		They are not remark - able for literary excellence , for critical investigation , or for unusual spiritual insight .

		Taken , however , as sermons , as plain , practical , and earnest enforcement of accepted truths , they are much to be commended .

		There is nothing in them conventional on the one side , nor sensational on the other .

		There is only a simple , well-proportional effort to draw from the truth , as apprehended by speaker and listener , its appropriate impulses .

		They are good sermons .

		They do credit to the integrity of mind and heart both of the speaker and of his audience .

		They have also a fair breadth of theme , touching on such top - ics as
Party Spirit	ORGANIZATION	,
Capital and Labor	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are such discourses as do most men good to hear or read .

		The last two volumes on our list rightly claim the attention of all whose view of the world in which we are has first received the expansion of scientific thought , and is now coming under its limitations .

		The human mind by being too long or too exclus - ively occupied with one class of themes , or one method of inquiry , suffers something very like atro - phy .

		This atrophy , unfortunately , lies , most of it , in our time , in the direction of spiritual truth .

		These two books in very different ways should at least serve to disclose this atrophy to those who suf - fer from it , and to correct it with those not con - firmed in it .

		The Foundations of Belief '' is the product of a very active , wide-ranging mind , and one fairly familiar with , and impressible by , the facts and arguments of naturalism .

		Without this ap - preciation , nothing can now be said to much purpose in defense of faith .

		The drift of the book is well put by the author at the opening of the fourth part . ''

		We have now considered beliefs , or certain important classes of them , under three aspects .

		We have con - sidered them from the point of view of their practical necessity ; from that of their philosophic proof ; and from that of their scientific origin .

		Inquiries relating to the same subject-matter more distinct in their char - acter it would be difficult to conceive .

		It remains for us to consider whether it is possible to extract from their combined results any general view which may command at least a provisional assent '' -LRB- p. 241 -RRB- .

		The treatment will constantly call out dissent , but it will also as constantly open up wider views than those which become habitual in naturalism , and will confront its assertions with corrective principles .

		The author , without dogmatism , has a strong hold on the spiritual elements in our nature , and walks by reason , not as a veiled * lantern , which casts its entire light on the particular path pursued , but as one which sends some disclosure in all directions .

		We commend the book as well fitted to help the mind out of narrow and positive opinions into wide , open possibilities .

		The naturalism , whose weak - nesses Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	exposes in many effective ways , is that complete naturalism which rests on a purely empirical philosophy .

		This naturalism , as a final and adequate theory , receives no quarter at his hands .

		The gist of the book is found in the relation of reason and authority as sources of belief .

		The author magnifies authority .

		Yet the ninety-nine persons and opinions resting on authority have less philosophical interest and importance than the one hundredth person and opinion making an appeal to reason .

		These are the points of growth .

		Mr.
Bal	PERSON	- four 's enforcement is the enforcement of a states - man rather than of a philosopher .

		`` Thoughts on Religion '' is remarkable in the same direction , but in another fashion .


George John Romanes	PERSON	, during his whole life , was closely identified with inquiries involved in evolution , espe - cially with those which unite in development the intellectual powers of animals and of men .

		Unlike
Darwin	PERSON	, however , he constantly interested himself in the speculative bearings of the facts under dis - cussion . ''

		Theism , '' published by him some years ago under the designation of '' Physicus , '' was a very thorough presentation of the grounds of unbelief .

		It showed no hesitancy in reaching its conclusions .

		He was a man of candor and of restless inquiry , and the present volume presents accumulated mem - oranda of beliefs slowly forming in his mind , that looked toward a complete even more complete than many believers would accept reconstruction of faith .

		As this reconstruction is as purely ra - tional as the destruction which preceded it , the fact is most significant .

		Both books will make the mind a broader and better instrument in the search for truth .

		THE DIAL 115 RECENT POETRY .

		* Among the English poets of the later Victorian period , contemporary criticism has made a fairly sharp distinction between the six dii majores of song and the host of minor versifiers .

		The consecrated group that includes
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	, Ar - nold and
Rossetti	PERSON	, Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	and Mr.
Morris	PERSON	, seems now to be separated by a pretty deep and definite gulf from the other occupants of the hill of
Parnassus	LOCATION	, and it is not probable that posterity will take a different view of the situation .

		Here and there a plea will doubtless be made for the admis - sion of some outsider or other into the charmed cir - cle of the elect , but we doubt if any of these will obtain the requisite suffrages .

		Among those who will , however , come the nearest to such apotheosis are two or three whose work has been practically unknown to the generation in which they have lived , for the simple reason that they have not chosen to strive for the plaudits of the crowd .

		Such a poet is Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	, who has until recently been but a name and hardly that to lovers of poetry ; another such is Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	, who has only just now consented to the publication of a volume of his work .

		Still another is the author of the fol - lowing lines , descriptive of the ambition of Phae '' - thon : '' As when the rathe and poignant spring divine Sighs all too soon among the hoary woods , And from the fleecy drifts of sodden snow With promise and with perfume calls her buds , And the buds open when they hear her feet , And open but to perish .

		So his heart Bloomed in a burst of immortality , Nor feared the onward rolling vans of doom .

		BLUE AND GOLD .

		By
William S. Lord	PERSON	.

		Chicago :
The Dial Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		A dream divine , whose passionate desire Flooded his soul , till in the golden car He trembled at the vision : as a leaf Moved by a gale of splendour , that comes on , When , at the point of sunrise , the wind sweeps With sudden ray and music across the sea .

		So in that rapture of presumptuous joy He spake a dreadful and impious word ; That he was nature 's lord and king of gods , He cared not now for Zeus , how should he care ?

		Let the old dotard nod and doze above .

		He rode the morning in unchecked career , Apparelled in his sire 's regalities , The new Hyperion , greater than his sire ; While the swift hooves beat music to his dream : And for a little while his heart was glad , Throbbing Olympian ichors .

		For an hour Elate , he bore an ecstasy too great For mortal nerve , and knew the pride of gods . ''

		This passage occurs in one of the longer of the sec - ond series of '' Poems , Dramatic and Lyrical , '' by Lord De Tabley .

		It is blank verse that will bear a close examination ; that needs careful scrutiny , in fact , to disclose all of its subtle beauty .

		Its affini - ties seem to be partly Landorian and partly Ten - nysonian , although it misses the severity of the earlier and the exquisite dreamy languor of the later poet .

		More strictly Tennysonian are these stanzas : '' I fain would have thee at my side ,
When Spring	ORGANIZATION	is reaching out her hands , When
April	DATE	, like a weeping bride , Sails o'er the rosy orchard lands . ''

		When
May	DATE	winds bathe the reedy isles , Where swans are nesting with their broods , And sheets of sapphire pave for miles The floors of hyacinthine woods . ''

		Elsewhere , there may be found a touch of the sweet paganism that Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	so often sang for us in his earlier years .

		Swinburnian , although with a passion tuned to lower and more decorous pitch , is '' A Hymn to Aphrodite , '' from which this stanza comes : '' To thee , enwreathed with passion flowers , Our unreluctant prayers are given : Thou art so near , when other powers Seem worlds away in frigid heaven : They know not , for they live apart , The craving tumult of the heart . ''

		In '' The Wine of Life , '' on the other hand , we hear such a grave philosophic note as Arnold so often gave us : '' How idle for a spurious fame To roll in thorn-beds of unrest ; What matter whom the mob acclaim , If thou art master of thy breast ? ''

		If sick thy soul with fear and doubt , And weary with the rabble din , If thou wouldst scorn the herd without , First make the discord calm within . ''

		If we are lords in our disdain , And rule our kingdoms of despair , As fools we shall not plough the main For halters made of syren 's hair . ''

		Yet with all these suggestions of other poets , we never feel that Lord De Tabley is an imitator .

		He speaks with his own voice , and we must hold either the Zeitgeist or the spirit of classical culture respon - sible for whatever similarities may be noted be - 116 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, tween his work and that of his contemporaries .

		The dignity of his thought and the knowledge which he displays -LRB- particularly of the intimate aspects of nature -RRB- , added to the true poetic feeling that per - vades his work , warrant the belief that his place at the Victorian banquet-board will prove a high one , late-comer though he be at the feast .

		Mr.
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	is one of the younger En - glish men of letters , and has heretofore been known by a number of delicate critical studies , mostly pub - lished in the English reviews .

		He now puts forth a volume of '' Poems , '' gleaned from the work of something less than ten years , and bearing much evidence of thoughtful workmanship .

		The main current of the thought which they embody is one of religious mysticism , adorned with the symbols of the Romanist faith .

		Other influences at work in his verse are the racial feeling of the Celt , and the ideals of Greek and Latin literature .

		An elegiac strain pervades the work , and may be detected in many of the poems besides those that are frankly commemorative .

		The blending of classical and Christian motive is happily illustrated in the two poems , '' Men of
Assisi	LOCATION	'' and '' Men of Aquino , '' the one singing of Propertius and St.
Francis	PERSON	, the other of Juvenal and
St. Thomas	LOCATION	.

		We quote the open - ing and closing stanzas of the former poem : '' A crown of roses and of thorns ; A crown of roses and of bay : Each crown of loveliness adorns
Assisi	LOCATION	, gleaming far away On Umbrian heights , in Umbrian day . ''

		One bloomed , when
Cynthia	PERSON	's lover sang
Cynthia	PERSON	, and revelry , and
Rome	LOCATION	: And one his wounded hands did hang Whose heart was lovelier Love 's dear home ; And his , an holier martyrdom . ''

		O city on the Umbrian hills :
Assisi	LOCATION	, mother of such sons !

		What glory of remembrance fills Thine heart , whereof the legend runs : These are among my vanished sons . ''

		The purely elegiac strain may be illustrated by the lines '' To a Traveller . '' ''

		Fare thee well , strong heart !

		The tranquil night Looks calmly on thee : and the sun pours down His glory over thee , O heart of might !

		Earth gives thee perfect rest : Earth , whom thy swift feet pressed : Earth , whom the vast stars crown . ''

		The religious vein of Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's verse , in one of its simpler aspects , finds beautiful expression in a prayer to the Virgin on behalf of a fishing hamlet . ''

		Mary , Star of the Sea I Look in this little place : Bless the kind fisher race ,
Mary	PERSON	, Star of the Sea !

		`` Send harvest from the deep ,
Mary	PERSON	, Star of the Sea !

		Mary , Star of the Sea !

		Let not these women weep . ''

		We might illustrate another of the marked currents of the author 's thought by the fine poem on '' The Classics , '' but prefer to take the briefer ''
Sortes Virgilianae	PERSON	, '' a sonnet in alexandrines . ''

		Lord of the
Golden Branch	ORGANIZATION	,
Virgil !	PERSON

		and
Cassar	PERSON	's friend : Leader of pilgrim Dante !

		Yes , things have their tears : So sighed thy song , when down sad winds pierced to thine ears Wandering and immemorial sorrows without end .

		And things of death touch hearts , that die : Yes ; but joys blend , And glories , with our little life of human fears :
Rome	LOCATION	reigns , and
Caesar	PERSON	triumphs !

		Ah , the Golden Years , The Golden Years return : this also the Gods send . ''

		O men who have endured an heavier burden yet !

		Hear you not happy airs , and voices augural ?

		For you in these last days by sure foreknowledge set , Looms no Italian shore , bright and imperial ?

		Wounded and worn !

		What
Virgil	PERSON	sang , doth God forget ?

		Virgil , the melancholy , the majestical . ''

		Arnold is the only other poet that we know of who has made such beautiful use of the sunt lacrymce rerum , '' The Virgilian cry , The sense of tears in mortal things . ''

		The masterpieces of modern literature have inspired some of Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	's best verses , and notably the poem upon the
Bronte	PERSON	sisters , which has the follow - ing close : '' Children of fire !

		The Muses filled Hellas with shrines of gleaming stone ; Your wasted hands had strength to build Gray sanctuaries , hard-hewn , wind-blown . ''

		Over their heights , all blaunched in storm , What purple fields of tempest hang !

		In splendour stands their mountain form , That from the sombre quarry sprang . ''

		Now the high gates lift up their head ; Now stormier music , than the blast , Swells over the immortal dead : Silent and sleeping , free at last . ''

		But from the tempest , and the gloom , The stars , the fires of God , steal forth : Dews fall upon your heather bloom , royal sisters of the North ! ''

		Our last citation shall be a fragment from the beau - tiful tribute to our own Hawthorne . ''

		Hesperian soul !

		Well hadst thou in the West Thine hermitage and meditative place : In mild , retiring fields thou wast at rest , Calmed by old winds , touched with aerial grace : Fields , whence old magic simples filled thy breast , And unforgotten fragrance balmed thy face . ''

		We have sought , in making the above quotations , , to represent Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	, as every poet should be represented , by his best work , and there is little need to state how good that work .

		is .

		But it is due in - justice to say that much of his work is faulty r either in technique or in thought .

		There are many poems in which , while we are conscious of a profu - sion of poetical material , we must recognize that the material has not been properly elaborated ; the expression is diffuse and the thought far from clear .

		How imperfect the technique may be , a single verse will show . ''

		Well couldst thou justify severe thoughts then '' is a phrase which one would hardly suspect of being a verse , did it not occur in what is - clearly meant for a poem .

		Such a verse may fairly justify a few severe thoughts on the part of the critic , however well he may wish its author .

		THE DIAL 117 A deep feeling of the unity of the universe finds expression in '' Homeward Songs by the Way . ''

		To pierce through the veils of sense , discerning the transcendental realities beyond ; and then to inter - pret these realities in half-mystical language , yet with all the glow of sensuous imagery , this has been the essential task of the true poet whose per - sonality is modestly hidden beneath the initials that alone acknowledge authorship of the beautiful little book before us . ''

		I moved among men and places , '' so runs the preface , '' and in living I learned the truth at last .

		I know I am a spirit , and that I went forth in old time from the Self-ancestral to labours yet unaccomplished ; but filled ever and again with homesickness , I made these songs by the way . ''

		One is reminded over and over again of such poems as
Emerson	PERSON	's '' Brahma '' and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Her - tha , '' even more , perhaps , of
Vaughan	PERSON	's mystical song . ''

		Dusk '' is an exquisite example of this writer 's work . ''

		Dusk wraps the village in its dim caress ; Each chimney 's vapour , like a thin grey rod , Mounting aloft through miles of quietness , Pillars the skies of God . ''

		Far up they break or seem to break their line , Mingling their nebulous crests that bow and nod Under the light of those fierce stars that shine Out of the calm of God . ''

		Only in clouds and dreams I felt those souls In the abyss , each fire hid in its clod ; From which in clouds and dreams the spirit rolls Into the vast of God . ''

		A second note of this collection , or rather a corol - lary of its main thesis , is foreshadowed in the words already quoted : '' In living I learned the truth at last . ''

		The ultimate harmonies of thought must come to the soul as the resolution of the discords of life .

		Says '' The Man to the Angel '' : '' I have wept a million tears .

		Pure and proud one , where are thine ?

		What the gain , though all thy years In unbroken beauty shine ? ''

		All your beauty can not win Truth we learn in pain and sighs : You can never enter in To the Circle of the Wise . ''

		One more example must suffice us , and this pair of quatrains it shall be : '' I heard them in their sadness say ' The earth rebukes the thought of God ; We are but embers wrapped in clay A little nobler than the sod . ' ''

		But I have touched the lips of clay : Mother , thy rudest sod to me Is thrilled with fire of hidden day , And haunted by all mystery . ''

		This is the poet 's even nobler way of saying what
Tyndall	PERSON	so nobly said in the
Belfast	LOCATION	address , when he swept away the reproach of materialism by bid - ding us view the material world in the new light of modern physical science .

		A few bluff and stirring ballads , some lyrics and meditative pieces in rough or unconventional metres , and a few classical echoes , are the contents of Mr.
Beesly	PERSON	's '' Ballads and Other Verse . ''

		The work , as a whole , displays poetic energy rather than poetic art , and but a moderate degree of either quality .

		The influence of
Browning	PERSON	is very marked , as in '' ' Life worth living ? '

		Well , maybe Not by you , I agree , If the best of it you pawn For a yawn , '' or in the dramatic piece , `` A Woman 's Last Word '' : '' Dead ?

		Yes .

		I see him stark there on the bed , Thank God , stone-dead .

		Nor can I , as you preach to me I ought , Think one kind thought , Or say one soft word to his memory , Howe'er I try . '

		De
Mortuis	PERSON	' it is a fool who writes For hypocrites ; Better without false tear or feigned ruth The whole , black truth .

		God !

		how I always hated him , and how I hate him now .

		By him , I tell you , even from the first , My life was cursed : He made me traitress to divinest trust , And his hands thrust Away whatever nobleness I had And made it bad , Whatever sweetness took my fancy thrall He turned to gall , Whatever woke in me of steadfast will He stifled still , Whatever spark was struck of generous flame He quenched in shame : Had he but made my body loth to live I could forgive , But not the mocking thief who stained and stole My very soul . ''

		The quotation must end here , but the whole piece is finely conceived .

		One half of Mr.
Block	PERSON	's new volume of verse is made up of a single poem '' The New World '' published two years ago as ''
El Nuevo Mundo	PERSON	, '' and then reviewed in these pages .

		Of the remaining con - tents , the most important , or at least the most am - bitious , are the long poems upon
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Dante	PERSON	, and Plato , and '' The Friendship of the Faiths . ''

		The latter work , which was read at the
Parliament of Religions	ORGANIZATION	in
1893	DATE	, has also had previous publi - cation .

		Besides these lengthy productions , the vol - ume contains several carefully-finished sonnets , po - etical tributes to
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Whitman	LOCATION	,
David Swing	PERSON	, and
Alice Gary	PERSON	, and a few short lyrics .

		We hardly need to repeat upon this occasion the high estimate previously given of Mr.
Block	PERSON	's work , of its opulent vocabulary , its dignity , its high seriousness , and , in the longer poems , its largeness of utterance .

		The defects of these qualities sometimes appear , indeed , for the vocabulary includes some words that had better have been spared , and the utterance , while large , is sometimes also a little thick .

		Mr.
Block	PERSON	is best when his expression is most nearly simple , as in the following paraphrase of certain familiar Goethean ideas : 118 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, '' He only wins his freedom truly , Who daily wins it fresh and fair ; He only rises ever newly Into the regions of the purer air Who falters not for blame nor praise , But lives in strenuous and victorious days .

		Past the times that bore and held him Looked the gray poet with his quenchless gaze , Some dear vision hovered and compelled him Toward the Future 's sunnier ways .

		Over the ocean 's welter westward Sped his hope and strengthening thought , Where each tenth wave rolled higher to crestward Even as Fate rose nobler wrought . ''

		This stanza from the poem on
Dante	ORGANIZATION	is also an example of sincere and heartfelt expression : '' We climbed that Mount where pain is held and sought As expiation of the luckless deed , We heard the hymns of deep contrition wrought , We saw the stars that glowed for each one 's need ; We felt the mountain thrill , And knew some happier will Had found release from its long-harbored grief , And in the Heavens its fit and sure relief . ''

		Perhaps the most satisfactory thing in the whole volume is the Dante-suggested sonnet , '' The Garden Where There Is No
Winter	DATE	, '' which readers of THE DIAL will remember .

		A delicate spirituality is also the predominant note in the '' Sonnets and Lyrics '' of Mrs.
Trask	PERSON	, whose post - Arthurian idyls -LRB- `` Under King Con - stantine '' -RRB- we had the pleasure of praising two or three years ago .

		This fine sonnet exhibits Mrs.
Trask	PERSON	's work at its best : '' I wander in the desert of this world , See God 's effulgence for a moment 's space On some
Mount Sinai	LOCATION	, then come face to fate With altars to the Golden Calf .

		Thus hurled From holy heights , my soul in depths is whirled ; Tea , from the Blessed swiftly to the base .

		Ah ! '

		t is a desolate and barren place ; My heart is weary ; but , behold I unfurled Before me floats a fleecy cloud of light , A roseate pillar through the toiling day , Illumining the desert 's arid sand ; And , lo !

		a vivid guiding flame by night . '

		T is Love that goes before me on my way , And leads me onward to the Promised Land . ''

		The chaste and tender diction of the poems from which this selection comes is unfailing in its charm , and the beauty of the soul which can thus express itself is everywhere manifest .

		The '' Poems '' contained in Father
Tabb	PERSON	's mod - est little volume are the merest seed-pearls of song , so simple and unpretentious they are .

		Many of them are only quatrains , and few -LRB- the group of son - nets excepted -RRB- fill more than eight or ten lines . ''

		Narcissus '' is a good example : ' ' The god enamoured never knew The shadow that beguiled his view , Nor deemed it less divinely true Than Life and Love . ''

		And so the poet , while he wrought His image in the tide of thought , Deemed it a glimpse in darkness caught Of light above . ''

		The author is certainly an adept in the compact pre - sentation of detached thoughts ; his taste is well-nigh faultless , and the stamp of spirituality is upon every page of his book .

		Some one has cynically remarked that almost anyone can write sonnets , but that few can read them .

		Certain it is that the writing of sonnets is becoming more and more affected by the minor poets of
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, and it is equally certain that many of these attempts at one of the most difficult of verse-forms serve mainly to illus - trate the well-known saying about reckless fools and timorous angels .

		The '' Distaff and Spindle '' of Mrs.
Mary Ashley Townsend	PERSON	, for example , is a vol - ume containing nothing but sonnets sixty-nine of them ; and , while her verse displays much poetic sensibility and fineness of perception , it should have been cast in any mould other than that of the son - net .

		We do not now speak of such technical im - perfections as the scant verse '' Odorous invisibil - ity , '' or of such lapses from poetic diction as '' The phonograph , that marvel of our age , '' but rather of the fact that these pieces , far from being '' moments * monuments , '' are nothing more than so many short didactic and discursive poems , among which one would seek in vain for other than accidental illus - trations of the fundamental principles of sonnet - structure .

		The example which we are about to quote comes far nearer than most of the poems to what a sonnet ought to be , and is chosen because it is always our wish , in these reviews of current verse , to represent a writer by the best that he has to give us . ''

		Come forth , Beloved !

		the hour has grown so still That I can almost hear the violets blow , And hear the sap stir in the palms below The lawn , and , listening , seem to hear that thrill The lily feels when , bending down to fill From urns of dusk her petals with the slow Sweet-odored dews that out of darkness grow , One ardent star comes trysting o'er the hill !

		I believe that I could hear if even a thought , Or yearning glance , of thine this way should pass , Or if thy white soul beckoned me apart ; Love has a sense so delicately wrought That it could hear thy shadow cross the grass , Or thy chill silence drifting toward my heart I '' We would say of this volume , in conclusion , that it would have been the gainer had the effort expended in searching for strange expressions and verbal effects been directed to the more important tasks of polishing the rhythm , illuminating the structure , and reducing by one the number of rhymes that the author has allowed herself in her sestets .

		What we have just said of Mrs.
Townsend	PERSON	's son - nets applies also in considerable measure to those fifty or sixty in number in Mr.
Nesmith	PERSON	's volume .

		Yet in this case the poetic energy is so marked , the stuff so various and well-fitted for treatment , and the thought so compact , that the failings of the poems considered strictly as sonnets become less apparent .

		Mr.
Nesmith	PERSON	has studied good models
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Milton	PERSON	and echoes from
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 119 them all at times strike the ear .

		What , for exam - ple , can be more Rossettian than this : '' What drear encampment of encircling glooms , Or sick surmise of culminating fate , Can bid To-day put off her eddying plumes .

		Her orb , her ornaments , and purpled state '' ?

		A certain austerity of feeling also not infrequently suggests
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	or
E. R. Sill	PERSON	, with the latter of whom the author seems to have no slight degree of spiritual kinship .

		One of the best of the sonnets is '' Subtle Spring '' : '' What subtle touch upon what secret string , What naked bleakness of wind-withered bowers , What frozen barrenness of wintry hours , What sick surmise , forlorn imagining , Makes sad the haunting melody of
Spring	DATE	; Her songs , her pomp , her verdure and her blooms , Her friends , her coronals , and eddying plumes , While all the cherubs of the morning sing ?

		Subtle as
Sphinx	ORGANIZATION	is she , too subtly wise To dull the soul with undisturbed content ; But with suggestions sad and subtly blent , She weaves in her enchanting mystery Musings and thoughts that touch eternity , The songs of
April	DATE	and the breath of sighs . ''

		The spirit thus described is very different from the riotous Spring invoked by Mr.
Charles Leonard Moore	PERSON	's magnificent sonnet , but it represents with no less fidelity its own temperamental point of view .

		It will be noticed from the quotations above made that Mr.
Nesmith	PERSON	takes all sorts of liberties with the form of the sonnet , that if a phrase pleases his fancy he does not hesitate to use it more than once , and that he is not careful to avoid pressing a word too often into service in the same context .

		Five poems which are not sonnets are included in the volume , and one of them , '' Philoctetes at Lemnos , '' gives it a title .

		We are less impressed by this frag - mentary imitation of Greek tragedy than by the fine '' Hymn of Nature '' that follows a poem of unusual imaginative power and felicity of phrase .

		On the whole , although the present volume hardly exhibits an advance upon the '' Monadnoc '' of six years ago , it sustains the note sounded by that note - worthy volume , and we are glad to repeat some - thing of the praise then bestowed by us upon the author in these pages .

		A copy of verses left among the manuscripts of the late
Frank Bolles	PERSON	has just been published , and reveals that lover of nature in a new light .

		It is called '' Chocorua 's Tenants , '' and describes the say - ings and doings of a dozen or more of the birds of
New England	LOCATION	.

		It can not be said that the author had the poetical gift in any marked degree , and these verses , in the trochaic metre of '' Hiawatha , '' may be praised , not as verses , but simply as a new illustration of the author 's fine and sympathetic quality of observation , of his intimate feeling for the message of nature of birds , and flowers , and rugged mountain fastnesses .

		One example is as good as another for our present purpose of illustra - tion , and hence , opening the book almost at random , we pluck from its pages these lines : '' Midway in the month of roses , When beside the brook is blooming , Pure and shy , the sweet linnsea ; In the pines , among the beeches , On the boulders , cawing , scolding , All the crows in Crowlands gather .

		Then it is the young are learning How to stand and beat their pinions , How to caw , and croak , and bluster .

		Happy days those days in June-tide ; Days of feasting , days of plunder . ''

		Not upon mountain slopes , but '' In Woods and Fields , '' are set the scenes of Miss Larned 's mus - ings .

		They are pretty , tasteful lyrics , soaring to no heights , but tender with reflections of the beauty of nature in her restful moods .

		Let us take , for example , some verses written '' At Evening '' : '' Within this hushed and sacred hour The silence blossoms like a flower , And color melts unseen away , And leaves the silver and the gray ; So thought gives place to vague content , The soul of music twined and blent With reveries dim and pleasing throng , A soundless chant , a wordless song . ''

		Another thin volume , Mrs.
Poole	PERSON	's '' A
Bank of Violets	ORGANIZATION	, '' has natural beauty for its keynote , although the fancy sometimes wanders into the world of books and men .

		We can not do better than reprint the opening triolet : '' Were Poetry the sweet south breeze , To breathe upon my violets , Delight would thrill the neighboring trees Of
Helicon	ORGANIZATION	; and Fancy ease Her heart in far-heard triolets , Were Poetry the sweet south breeze To breathe upon my violets ! ''

		Miss
Susanna Massey	PERSON	's volume , '' God 's Parable and Other Poems , '' takes a wider range than the collection just mentioned , and finds inspiration in life rather than nature .

		Its contents include the long titular poem a sort of dramatic idyl some bits of French verse , a translation from the '' Chan - sons de Guzla , '' echoes of European travel , songs , and sonnets .

		We reproduce the irregular sonnet called '' An Aspiration . '' ''

		Peak piled on peak , like dim cathedral spires , Prick the light lace-work of the amber sky .

		On the green slopes weird , twisted shadows lie , Cast , dark and writhing , from the sun 's fierce fires .

		Upward we strain our gaze , the soul aspires Unto those heights I Oh , but for wings to fly , To mount and mount with zeal that never tires To burst Earth 's clod and live , though we should die . ''

		To reach the vast Beyond ah , that Beyond , Which only once was bared to mortal eyes On
Pisgah	ORGANIZATION	's mount !

		To knit the unseen bond , That twixt the Infinite and Finite lies !

		The pent soul struggles , and the heart grows fond , Whilst dimmer through our tears , the dim peaks rise . ''

		It is a pity that so unpardonable a license of form should mar what is otherwise an excellent sonnet .

		A lack of technical finish , we should add , is fre - quently to be observed in
Miss Massey	LOCATION	's poems .

		Our final word shall be given to the sheaf of un - pretentious verses called '' Blue and Gold . ''

		They are hardly more than the recreations of a few idle 120 THE DIAL .

		WILLIAM
MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		A new study of In his volume entitled `` Man and the capabilities of Woman , '' Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	, the man versus woman .

		e -LRB- jitor of the '' Contemporary Science Series '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- in which the book appears , pre - sents data resulting from a dozen years ' reading in sociological and anthropological literature .

		The au - thor has tried to gather and to present clearly our actual knowledge regarding the secondary sexual characters in the human species .

		The work is a timely contribution .

		Just at this time it is com - monly asserted that woman is capable of undertak - ing and accomplishing almost anything and every - thing that man can do .

		The idea is necessarily erroneous .

		Inherent differences due to sex are present in the whole of human life .

		Woman can never do man 's work ; man can never do the work of woman .

		Each sex is adapted to a particular sphere of activity .

		This is not to assert that woman is man 's inferior , either wholly or in most respects .

		But man and woman are necessarily unlike .

		The male is everywhere militant , active ; the female is everywhere industrial , passive .

		This fundamental distinction exists not only in humanity ; it goes throughout the animal and vegetable series until one gets very far down .

		No number of social ex - periments or emancipations will ever do away with it .

		Militancy demands the harmonious combination of certain characteristics : industrialism demands an equally happy combination of other characteris - tics .

		Neither is superior , neither inferior ; for race perpetuation and progress , both must be present , and both well characterized .

		To study these com - binations of qualities is a legitimate task in science .

		In his book Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	breaks ground in this direc - tion .

		Anatomical , physiological , psychical com - parisons are made .

		Too little definite work has been done by original investigators for the book to give much of final conclusion .

		But it is an excel - lent compilation of present knowledge , and points out hopeful lines for future work .

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	him - Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	's studies of men .

		self appears to conclude that women are nearer like children than like men ; that women are not unde - veloped men ; and that the child represents a higher degree of evolution than the adult .

		He appears also to expect a gradual approximation between the sexes , in which man may go further to reach the common ground than will woman .

		While not very fully agreeing with the author 's deductions , we can heartily commend the book to thoughtful readers .

		That stanch Tory and amusing quid - mine , Mr.
G. W. Smalley	PERSON	, signalizes his return to democracy and his na - tive heath by reprinting in book form a number of his
London	LOCATION	letters to the
New York	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' under the title '' Studies of Men '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The papers are all chatty and readable , and filled with a certain unconscious humor for which the writer is noted .

		Thackeray should have known Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	.

		The '' Studies '' are largely concerned with the no - bility and gentry , with whom the author seems to have been on almost as good terms as '' Mrs.
Jar	PERSON	- ley '' ; and the name of that eminent layer of corner - stones and glass of fashion , the Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	, crops up with agreeable frequency .

		Literary and political lights are not neglected , there being some very good papers , in the journalistic way , on Ten - nyson , Professor
Jowett	PERSON	, Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	, Mr.
Parnell	PERSON	, Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	, and others .

		One of the best of them is '' A Visit to Prince
Bismarck	PERSON	, '' reprinted from the '' Fortnightly Review . ''

		Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	tells a story of
Lord Granville	LOCATION	, then Foreign Minister , which he thinks very characteristic of him , and which we quote as very characteristic of Mr.
Smal	PERSON	- ley .

		Lady
Granville	PERSON	was giving a party at the
Foreign Office	ORGANIZATION	, and host and hostess were receiving their guests on the landing of the great staircase .

		It was a notably grand affair .

		Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	was there , and the Prince and Princess of
Wales	LOCATION	were momentarily expected .

		At this solemn juncture were announced '' let us say Mr. and Mrs.
Jones	PERSON	two very humble units in the brilliant procession which was advancing up the staircase .

		In another country than
England	LOCATION	it would hardly be under - stood , but here a guest not known to the Foreign Minister or his wife may easily enough pass both of them in the crush without recognition .

		Lord Gran - ville knew Mr.
Jones	PERSON	, and shook hands with him .

		Mrs.
Jones	PERSON	, with a dozen other ladies equally unre - marked , was passing on .

		The first notes of ' God Save the Queen , ' proclaiming the approach of the royalties , were heard just then .

		Lord
Granville	PERSON	heard them , but he stopped Mr.
Jones	PERSON	, with that leisurely manner which he had in such perfection , and said : ' Pray introduce me to Mrs.
Jones	PERSON	before you go up . '

		And he found time to murmur a polite greeting in Mrs.
Jones	PERSON	's ear , while the music swelled and the Prince and Princess drew near ; and he reached the hall to receive them , with an infinitesi - mal fraction of a second to spare . ''

		Of such small phenomena Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	is the keenest of observers and most unctuous of chroniclers .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 A hopeful view Mr -
Arthur Henry Jones	PERSON	is not only of the future of the author of successful plays , such as English drama .

		u The Middleman , '' '' The Tempter , '' etc. , but he is also an agreeable writer on subjects pertaining to the dramatic art .

		His lectures and essays of the last ten years have covered nearly every phase of the dramatic situation in
England	LOCATION	; and these he has now published in a volume called '' The Renascence of the English Drama '' -LRB- Mac - inilla.ii -RRB- .

		At a time when so much is said and written of the hopelessness of the dramatic outlook , it is pleasing to find one well-informed writer tak - ing a cheerful view of the case .

		Mr.
Jones	PERSON	pro- nounces the present a very critical period in the history of the English drama , the two most recent schools having perished because they failed to fur - nish any satisfaction to the artistic sense , and sup - plied only amusement .

		But in the last few years an improvement in public taste begins to be manifested ; audiences have become educated at least up to the point where they can detect artificiality and insin - cerity in plays .

		He has hopes for the foundation of a school of modern English drama , for a school of plays of serious intention , plays that implicitly assert the value and dignity of human life , that deal with its great passions and great aims , and show that it is full of meaning and of moment .

		Another interesting feature of the book is Mr.
Jones	PERSON	's con - tention that the chief tests of a good play are '' lit - erature and character-painting . ''

		The test of a good play , we are usually told , is , `` How will it act ? ''

		Our author grants only that this is the test of a popular play ; that the test of a really good play is , '' Can it be read as well as acted ? ''

		Mere inge - nuity of situation , dramatic surprises , and complica - tions of a story , are at bottom worthless unless they illustrate and develop human character ; and every dramatic work of lasting value will stand the test as literature and as character-painting , though it may not stand any other test .

		The author has a great admiration for
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, as is ap - parent not only by his direct tributes occasionally , but by his imitations , probably unconscious , of Ar - nold 's literary style .

		There is , in both , the same fondness for reiteration of a happy phrase -LRB- for ex - ample , the `` billy-cock-hat criticism '' -RRB- , the same tendency to humor of a somewhat frisky order , the same type of allusions , as well as the same high qualities of directness , simplicity , and insight .

		The second volume of '' Moods '' -LRB- '' a childish ' '' Moods . ''

		Journal Intime , wherein the Artist and the Author pleaseth himself '' -RRB- is upon us before we have noticed the first .

		We hasten , therefore , with a slight remark on the sec - ond , in order that the third may not find us still among those who are unimpressed by this manifesto of the youth of the day .

		Certain things about this publication will be remarked by everyone : we need merely note that such an artistic publication is always , in a general way , a good thing , as showing some movement of ideas ; that this particular one is an imitation of the '' Yellow Book '' ; that it is quite amateurish , especially in its pictures ; that the
Jenson Press	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- `` Makers of Unique Volumes '' -RRB- is kept rather too prominently before the reader ; and that it must be pleasant for the young artists of this country to have some city of refuge from those cold encouragers of youthful genius , the '' Century Magazine '' et aliis .

		Having said so much , the whole contents of kk Moods '' may well enough pass without special comment , and one or two general remarks on the publication will be sufficient for practical purposes .

		The first is that , while there are several things that one may easily acknowledge to be quite clever , there is nothing from cover to cover -LRB- in Volume Two -RRB- that absolutely compels ad - miration .

		This is a pity ; a few such things give sufficient reason for a publication of this kind .

		One would think that in such a movement of generous - hearted young men and women , there would surely be something which would make one say , '' That 's the real thing ; that fellow has the right stuff in him ; there 's a lot of rubbish about it , but it 's a thing you have to acknowledge , whether you like it or not . ''

		But no such genuine feeling has disturbed the mind of any reader of '' Moods . ''

		There 's not a spark of real life .

		The second thing to observe is that there is a tone of indelicacy and immodesty in the book which is unbecoming .

		We use these mild words , because stronger ones would seem to indicate a certain virility or manliness which is absent .

		The pub - lication is by no means wholly improper ; but about half of the young men of the day have written things which their mothers will be pained to read .

		Mr.
Owen Wister	PERSON	and Mr.
Walter Blackburn Harte	PERSON	give rather slight assistance in counterbalancing the child - ishness of the rest , but they have much to contend with .

		We have then , on the whole , a book without anything of commanding excellence , and with a great deal that really demands the contempt that such ventures as '' Moods '' are too apt to receive .

		T < FT - TT i ?

		> i is a '' Life of
Li Hungchang	PERSON	, by Professor
Robert K. Douglas	PERSON	.

		Considering the ob - vious difficulties in the way of the biographer of a Chinese statesman , the author has done his work re - markably well , tracing intelligibly the military and diplomatic career of the Viceroy from his first active services at the time of the T'aip ` ing Rebellion , down to the late ruffianly assault upon him in the streets of
Shimonoseki	LOCATION	.

		With many admirable qualities , and even a certain sense of the superiority of West - ern nations in point of practical science and the me - chanical arts , Li has never been able to shake off the chains of the fatal conservatism which have bound his countrymen for ages .

		The evidence of his senses has forced upon him the unwelcome fact that in the appliances of industry and warfare the '' bar - barians '' of the West and their facile imitators in
Japan	LOCATION	have far outstripped his countrymen ; but never for an instant has been shaken his implicit 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, belief in '' the ineffable wisdom of the founders of Chinese polity , or in the superiority of the civiliza - tion of
China	LOCATION	over that possessed by any other na - tion on the face of the earth . ''

		Nevertheless ,
Li Hungchang	PERSON	has rendered his country signal ser - vices .

		It is a pity that his long and heretofore rel - atively useful career should close with a series of national disasters due to his fatal inability to read aright the drift of Japanese policy in
Korea	LOCATION	.

		With
China	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	in accord , and
Korea	LOCATION	strength - ened and developed into an effective '' buffer '' state , Russian advance to the southward would receive a serious check ; and it is plainly the Russian Drang nach
Suden	PERSON	that furnishes the key to
Japan	LOCATION	's ac - tivity in the '' Hermit State . ''


Heinrich Heine	PERSON	once predicted that the time would come when all
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope would `` smell of Russian leather . ''

		The spirit of the prediction , or the thought that inspired it , has long pervaded the diplomacy of the Orient ; and that so astute a man as Li , filled moreover with a wholesome dread of the '' grasping policy of Rus - sia , '' should have failed to join hands with
Japan	LOCATION	in the Korean matter , is surprising enough .

		The volume contains portraits of
Li Hungchang	PERSON	and of Vice-Admiral
Ito	PERSON	.

		Dr.
G. F. Browne	PERSON	's Off the Mill '' A collection of / .

		, > \ , .

		a , Alpine sketches .

		-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is chiefly made up of papers on Alpine subjects , which first appeared some thirty years ago in various periodicals .

		These productions will be of some interest to the present generation of Alpine climbers as reflecting the conditions that faced the amateur mountaineer before
Einspdnners	PERSON	and the like valetudinary helps had made the ascent of Mont Blanc comparatively a rather commonplace , not to say cockney , affair .

		Your genuine mountaineer nowadays , men like Messrs. Con way and
Whymper	PERSON	, are content with nothing short of the Andes and the
Himalayas	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Browne	PERSON	's Alpine sketches , we learn , were originally printed with illustrations , '' the earliest , or almost the earliest , of Mr.
Du Maurier	PERSON	's work '' ; and these chefs-d'oeuvre have , we regret to say , been omitted from the reprint on the singular plea that `` the great change which has taken place in the ladies ' dress would cause the illustrations to seem unreal . ''

		The creator of '' Trilby '' is not just the man , per - haps , to do justice to the Alps ; but we should very much like to see what he would make of them .

		Other papers in the volume are : '' A Night with a Salmon , '' '' The Engadine , '' '' Collecting Ancestors , '' '' Archaeological Frauds in Palestine '' -LRB- a very good one -RRB- , ''
Pontresina	LOCATION	, '' etc. .

		Professor
F. M. Warren	PERSON	's '' History Lei .

		of the Novel Previous to the Seven - teenth Century '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- is a useful contribution to literary history , although it is a somewhat discursive production , and not as well written as it ought to be .

		The idea of the book was suggested by KOrting 's `` History of the French Novel in the
Seventeenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' and the method of study derived from
Rohde	PERSON	's `` History of the Greek Novel . ''

		After an introductory chapter , which aims chiefly at distinguishing between the terms '' story , '' '' romance , '' and '' novel , '' the author dis - cusses in successive chapters the Greek novel , the romance of chivalry , the Italian and Spanish pas - toral , and the Spanish picaresque novel .

		Lengthy analyses are given of such works as the '' Amadis of
Gaul	PERSON	, '' the '' Palmerin of
England	LOCATION	, '' the '' Ar - cadia '' of Sannazaro , the '' Diana '' of Montemayor , and the '' Lazarillo de Tonnes . ''

		The author de - serves much credit for the patience with which he has read and summarized these wearisome produc - tions , and for the measure of success with which he has traced the ancestry of the typical forms of mod - ern fiction .

		For a large part of the ground covered by this work , we had , previous to its appearance , nothing better than
Dunlop	ORGANIZATION	in English ; and
Dun	ORGANIZATION	- lop , viewed in the light of modern criticism , leaves much to be desired .

		Readings from old English dramatists .

		Two volumes of '' Readings from the Old English Dramatists '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- have been compiled by Mrs.
Erving Winslow	PERSON	, the selections being con - nected and introduced by some discussion of the successive dramatic periods thus represented .

		Be - ginning with a chapter called '' Miracle to Masque , '' the subject is carried through the '' Comedy of the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The compiler has shown much skill and taste , together with occasional orig - inality .

		The chapter on '' Minor Elizabethan Dram - atists '' is noteworthy because it is an appreciative tribute to a class of men that commonly have scant justice done them .

		The readings here are from
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's '' Every Man in his Humour , '' from
Dekker	PERSON	's ''
Shoemaker	PERSON	's Holiday , '' and
Heywood	PERSON	's '' A Woman Killed with Kindness . ''

		Speaking of the first appearance on the stage of women actors , in place of the boys who had previously played the women 's parts , the author makes this striking ob - servation : '' Here is a mystery , with all the ad - vantages offered to the modern dramatist by the greatest actresses , it is but rarely that he moulds a perfect woman for the stage ; while the ancient poets were inspired by these beardless youths to some of their most delicate productions , and sex seems never to have been forgotten . ''

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		We take pleasure in calling attention to the excep - tionally neat and well-edited German texts that have recently been published by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They include
Schiller	PERSON	's '' Jungfrau von Orleans , '' edited by Mr.
A. B. Nichols	PERSON	; ScheffePs '' Trompeter von Sak - kingen , '' edited by Miss
Mary A. Frost	PERSON	; a volume of '' German Prose and Poetry for Early Reading , '' edited by Mr.
T. B. Bronson	PERSON	; and a selection of `` Deutsche Gedichte , '' edited by Dr.
Camillo von Klenze	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Bronson	PERSON	's volume includes
Hauff	PERSON	's '' Karawane '' and many shorter pieces ; Dr.
von Klenze	PERSON	's book is devoted

		Professor
B. A. Hinsdale	PERSON	's work on ''
The American Government	ORGANIZATION	, National and State '' -LRB-
Werner	PERSON	-RRB- was first published four years ago , and now reappears in a re - vised edition , printed entirely from new plates , and embodying many alterations and improvements .

		The work must be regarded as one of the best of our college text-books , and as an invaluable aid to teachers of the subject in our lower schools .

		Compactness , careful arrangement of matter , and a plain forcible style , all commend the book to both teacher and student .

		The treatment is throughout historical , and the
State	ORGANIZATION	govern - ments get their due share of attention .

		The constant and increasing demand for Dr. Mas - pero 's '' Manual of Egyptian Archaeology '' has caused the publishers -LRB- Putnam -RRB- to issue a new edition '' in as light and portable a form as possible . ''

		This new edi - tion has been revised and enlarged by the author him - self , and made more useful than ever to the traveller in
Egypt	LOCATION	, or to the student at home , as a work of refer - ence .

		The text of the translation is that made by the late
Amelia B. Edwards	PERSON	, subject , of course , to the modifications that have been found necessary to bring the work to date .

		There are over three hundred illus - trations .

		The excellent new English edition of Balzac -LRB- Dent -
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- , the initial volume of which was noticed in our last issue , has been extended by two more volumes '' The Chouans , '' translated by Miss
Ellen Marriage	PERSON	, and '' At the Sign of the Cat and Racket , '' translated by
Miss Clara Bell	PERSON	, and supplied with a preface by Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	.

		The new edition of
Defoe	ORGANIZATION	, edited by Mr.
George A. Aitken	PERSON	and illustrated by Mr.
J. B. Yeats	PERSON	, and bearing also the Dent-Macmillan imprint , reaches its ninth volume in '' A Journal of the Plague Year . ''

		It is a pleasure to commend such beautiful books as are contained in both these sets .

		Mr.
A. P. Gage	PERSON	's '' Elements of Physics '' has been for the past dozen years the best American book of its kind accessible for high school use .

		It is now supple - mented -LRB- we can hardly say replaced -RRB- by the more com - prehensive and up-to-date '' Principles of Physics '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , which exemplifies the same admirable methods of presentation as the earlier work , and offers material enough for both high school and college courses .

		It is a book of between six and seven hundred pages , with all sorts of helpful illustrations in abundance .

		LITERARY NOTES . ''

		A Pair of Blue Eyes '' has just been added by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	to their handsome library edition of the novels of Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	.

		The Dent-Lippincott imprint is borne by the title - page of a new and revised edition of Mrs.
Alfred Bald	PERSON	- win 's '' The Story of a Marriage . ''

		A pleasant surprise for the

Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co	ORGANIZATION	a new volume of poems by
Lowell	LOCATION	, with a new portrait as frontispiece .

		Notwithstanding the almost innumerable editions of De Amicis ' '' Cuore , '' a new one , illustrated , is nearly ready for publication by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
International Literary and Artistic Association	ORGANIZATION	will hold its seventeenth congress at
Dresden	LOCATION	from Sep - tember 21 to 28 , under the patronage of the

Humphry Ward	PERSON	's new novel , '' Sir
George Tres	PERSON	- sady , '' upon which she has been at work for the
past two years	DATE	, will appear as a serial in '' The Century , '' beginning with
November	DATE	.

		The first story by
Michael Field	PERSON	to appear in an American periodical is begun in the
September	DATE	''
Atlan	PERSON	- tic '' with the title of '' Tiger Lilies . ''

		Is not this , by the way , the title of
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	's earliest novel ?

		A new edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , intended espe - cially for high school and college classes , will be begun at once by
Messrs. D. C. Heath & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are sev - eral editors , and the text is based on that of
the Globe	ORGANIZATION	edition .

		It is reported , from
London	LOCATION	, that
Li Hung Chang	PERSON	, the Chinese Viceroy , desires to spend next winter in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		A book of '' impressions '' by him dur - ing his sojourn here would be an interesting literary announcement .

		The '' Literary World '' of Bostqn has changed editors , Mr.
N. P. Gilman	PERSON	retiring to become a professor of sociology in the
Meadville Theological School	ORGANIZATION	, and the Rev.
Edward Abbott	PERSON	, who was editor of the paper for about twelve years previous to
1889	DATE	, resuming his old position .

G. H. Putnam	PERSON	'' their recognition and appreciation of the services he has rendered to the cause of interna - tional copyright , in conjunction with Mr.

		The recent death of the artist
Hovenden	PERSON	, in
Phila	LOCATION	- delphia , has inspired a movement , on the part of the
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	Academy of the Fine Arts , for a memorial exhibition of his works , together with those of two other
Philadelphia	LOCATION	artists also lately deceased ,
P. F. Roth	PERSON	- ermel and
I. L. Williams	PERSON	.

		The Academy would be glad to hear from owners of pictures by these artists , as it is desired to make the exhibit a full and representative one .

		The address is
Philadelphia	LOCATION	.

		150 BOOKS OF THE COMING SEASON .

		If we may judge from the announcements of new books made by the publishers for the season just opening , the trade of the bookman is anticipating its full share in the revival of prosperity that seems to be close at hand , if it has not already begun .

		Following our usual custom , we print in this
mid-September	DATE	issue of THE DIAL a classified list of the announce - ments already made by American publishers , and , although there are doubtless many more to come during the next few weeks , the list as it now stands is considerably more extensive than any that we have previously had occasion to present .

		The object of the present article is to single out from the multitude of books already definitely promised a few of those that are likely to attract the most widespread atten - tion and find greatest favor with book-lovers .

		The most important work of the year , at least from the strictly literary point of view , will be the long-deferred collection of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's letters , edited by Mr.
George Russell	PERSON	.

		Nothing promised us of late years has been so impatiently awaited as this collection , and we hail with delight the prospect of its early ap - pearance .

		In the same category come three other collections of letters , all soon to be pub - lished : the ''
Vailima	LOCATION	'' letters of
Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	, the letters of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	to
Fanny Kemble	PERSON	, and the '' Family Letters '' of
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	, edited by his brother , Mr.
W. M. Rossetti	PERSON	.

		Here , indeed , are four books that will be read with avidity by all lovers of literature .

		Literature and literary history are also to be represented by '' Anima Poeta3 , '' a series of hitherto unpublished passages from the note-books of
Coleridge	LOCATION	; `` An Introduc - tory to the Study of Literary Criticism , '' by Professor
C. M. Gayley	PERSON	; a work on '' Modern German Literature , '' by Dr.
B. W. Wells	PERSON	; '' Books and Their Makers during the Middle Ages , '' by Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	; '' The Literary History of the American Revolution , '' by Professor
Moses Coit Tyler	PERSON	; a volume of '' Miscellaneous Studies , '' by
Walter Pater	PERSON	; and the long-promised '' Victorian Anthology '' of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	, a work which will , we doubt not , surpass in taste , judgment , and knowledge all 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, previous attempts to represent by a series of se - lections English poetry of the last half-century .

		Of new literature , in the narrower sense , it seems that we shall have our full share .

		Vol - umes of poetry by
Thoreau	LOCATION	, Mrs.
Stoddard	PERSON	, Mr.
Frederick Tennyson	PERSON	,
James Russell Low	PERSON	- ell , Mr.
Francis Thompson	PERSON	, Mr.
William Dean Howells	PERSON	,
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Marriott Watson	PERSON	, are a few of the many gifts to be brought us from the kingdom of song .

		We suppose that '' The Wood beyond the World , '' by Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	, must be described as fiction , although it is sure to have more of the characteristics of poetry than many a volume of rhymed and rhythmical utterance .

		A few titles of forthcoming novels are the following : '' The Stark Munro Letters , '' by Dr.
A. Conan Doyle	PERSON	; '' Clarence '' and '' In a Hollow of the Hills , '' both by Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	; '' The Mys - tery of Witch-Face Mountain , '' by Miss
Mary N. Murfree	PERSON	; `` A Gentleman Vagabond , '' by Mr.
F. Hopkinson Smith	PERSON	; '' The Amazing Marriage , '' by Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	; '' The Second Jungle Book , '' by Mr.
Rudyard Kip	PERSON	- ling ; ''
Joan Haste	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
H. Rider Hag	PERSON	- gard ; ''
Casa Braccio	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
F. M. Craw	PERSON	- ford ; '' The Red Cockade ? '

		by Mr.
Stanley J. Weyman	PERSON	; '' The Day of Their Wedding , '' by Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	; His Father 's Son , '' by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	; and `` A Three - Stranded Yarn , '' by Mr.
W. Clark Russell	PERSON	.

		Among biographical works , the most inter - esting to Americans will be the memoir of Fran - cis Parkman , by Mr.
C. H. Farnham	PERSON	; the '' Recollections of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Ward H. Lamon	PERSON	; and the story of
Townsend Harris	PERSON	, our first envoy to
Japan	LOCATION	, by Dr.
W. E. Griffis	PERSON	.

		A '' Life of
Gustave Flaubert	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
J. C. Tarver	PERSON	, is an extremely interesting an - nouncement , and hardly less interesting are the promised life of
Hans Christian Andersen	PERSON	, by Mr.
R. Nisbet Bain	PERSON	; of
W. H. Seward	PERSON	-LRB- in the '' American Statesmen '' series -RRB- , by Mr.
T. K. Lothrop	PERSON	; of
Agassiz	ORGANIZATION	, by
M. Jules Marcou	PERSON	; of
Cardinal Manning	ORGANIZATION	, by Mr.
E. S. Purcell	PERSON	; and of
Cardinal Wiseman	PERSON	, by Mr.
Wilfred Ward	PERSON	.

		Mr.
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	's book on ''
Constan	PERSON	- tinople '' is sure to be among the most popular works of travel and description published dur - ing the year , and many readers will also be found for '' Advance ,
Japan	LOCATION	! ''

		by Mr.
J. Mor	PERSON	- ris ; and for the first volume of Mr.
A. H. Keane	PERSON	's great work on
Africa	LOCATION	.

		One of th ?

		most ambitious of recent undertakings in the liter - ature of art is the great '' Cyclopedia of Art and Architecture in
Italy	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	, and the Le - vant , '' edited by Mr.
W. P. P. Longfellow	PERSON	.

		Other important art-works are
Sig	ORGANIZATION	.

		Cattaneo 's '' Architecture in
Italy	LOCATION	from the Sixth to the
Eleventh Century	ORGANIZATION	'' ; '' Lectures on Art , '' by Mr.
John La Farge	PERSON	; and '' The Art of Velas - quez , '' by Mr.
R. A. M. Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Art the - ory and criticism will be exemplified by Mr.
George L. Raymond	PERSON	's `` Painting , Sculpture , and Architecture as Representative Arts , '' Mr.
Frank P. Stearns	PERSON	's '' The Midsummer of Italian Art , '' and three essays , published in separate illustrated volumes , by the late
P. G. Hamerton	PERSON	.

		In the department of political and social science we may mention Dr.
Albert Shaw	PERSON	's ''
Munici	PERSON	- pal Government in
Continental Europe	LOCATION	, '' '' The Principles of Sociology , '' by Professor
F. H. Giddings	PERSON	; '' Lectures on Political Science '' and '' The Growth of British Policy , '' both by the late Sir
John Seeley	PERSON	; ''
The Science of Finance	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Professor
Henry C. Adams	PERSON	; '' Money and Banking , '' by Mr.
Horace White	PERSON	; and a work on '' The Poor of Great Cities , '' by various hands .

		In religious history , the most important announcements seem to be the lectures of Professor Rhys-Davids on '' Bud - dhism , '' and the popular papers of Professor
C. H. Cornill	PERSON	on The Prophets of
Israel	LOCATION	. ''

		Finally , we may include in this category of the works of serious scholarship the promised translation , from the Greek of Dr.
Crestos Tsountas	PERSON	, of his great work on '' The
Mycen	PERSON	- a?an Civilization , '' Professor
J. P. Mahaffy	PERSON	's '' History of the Ptolemies , '' and volumes by the late
E. A. Freeman	PERSON	upon
Western Europe	LOCATION	in the fifth and eighth centuries .

		Three classes of books yet remain to be scanned the special holiday publications , the continuation of works already in part before the public , and the reprints of standard literature .

		In the first of these classes , the announcements now made cover but a small proportion of what may be expected as the
Christmas	LOCATION	season draws near .

		We may mention here the holiday edi - tions of Mr.
Dobson	PERSON	's poems , of
Reade	ORGANIZATION	's ''
Christie Johnstone	PERSON	, '' of Spenser 's ''
Epithala	PERSON	- mium , '' of '' Rip Van Winkle '' -LRB- by Mr.
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	, illustrated by the author ! -RRB-

		, of Mr.
Timothy Cole	PERSON	's engravings from the Dutch and Flemish master , of
Scott	PERSON	's '' The Betrothed '' and `` The Talisman '' -LRB- edited by Mr.
Lang	PERSON	-RRB- , of a collection of '' Victorian Songs '' -LRB- edited by Mr.
Edmund Garrett	PERSON	-RRB- , of White 's '' Sel - borne '' -LRB- edited by Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	-RRB- , of '' The Manxman , '' and of Mrs.
Jane G. Aus	PERSON	- tin 's '' Standish of Standish . ''

		A prominent place in this holiday group must also be given
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL to Mr.
Edwin A. Grosvenor	PERSON	's great illustrated work on '' Constantinople , '' which , with Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's less pretentious volume , will enable us to visit the Golden Horn without leaving the library fireside .

		The important works of which publication is to be continued or com - pleted during the year form a considerable list of their own .

		Mr.
Henry M. Baird	PERSON	's '' The Huguenots and the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes '' will - serve to remind us that we still have in our midst a historian not unworthy to succeed
Prescott	PERSON	and
Motley	ORGANIZATION	.

		We are to have the third volume of M. Leroy-Beaulieu 's '' Em - pire of the Tsars and the Russians , '' the fourth volume of Mr.
Traill	PERSON	's '' Social England , '' the fifth -LRB- and last -RRB- volume of Renan 's '' History of the People of
Israel	LOCATION	, '' the third volume of the '' Life and Correspondence of
Rufus King	PERSON	, '' the sixth volume of the '' Writings and Corre - spondence of
Thomas Jefferson	PERSON	, '' the fourth vol - ume -LRB- '' Gustavus Adolphus '' -RRB- of Colonel
T. A. Dodge	PERSON	's '' Great Captains , '' the third vol - ume of Professor
Charles S. Sargent	PERSON	's great work on '' The Silva of
North America	LOCATION	, '' and the second volume of each of the three follow - ing works : ''
Darwin	PERSON	and after
Darwin	PERSON	, '' by
George J. Romanes	PERSON	; '' A
Natural History of Plants	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Professor
Kerner von Marilaun	PERSON	; and '' A Literary History of the English People , '' by Mr.
J. J. Jusserand	PERSON	.

		As for the promised reprints , they are legion ; and , as they usually mean handier or more tasteful editions than we have had before , even if they do not incorpor - ate new material , they are cordially welcome .

		What could be more satisfactory , for example , than a complete
Browning	PERSON	, in a single volume ?

		And that is just what is promised us , by a house whose name is a guarantee that we shall not be disappointed in the mechanical features of the book .

		A complete one - volume
Holmes	PERSON	-LRB- that is , the poetry -RRB- is promised us by the same house .

		A five-volume edition of Mrs.
Jame	PERSON	- son 's works on art will supply an obvious want , for these books hold their own , although recent scholarship has left them less adequate than they once were .

		The new Poe , edited by Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	and Professor
Woodberry	PERSON	, will be on the market complete at a very early date .

		As for new editions of
Stevenson	PERSON	, they are so nu - merous that we have not space even to name them all .

		In old-fashioned fiction , we shall have an eight-volume edition of Gait 's novels , and doubtless many other reprints of like char - acter .

		During the coming months , of course , the works above mentioned , together with many others , will receive characterization and criti - cal treatment , at the hands of the most compe - tent American authorities , in the pages of THE DIAL ; and it shall be our constant endeavor , as it has been for the past fifteen years , to pro- vide the prospective buyer and reader of the new books with impartial and trustworthy guid - ance in his selection of the volumes that he may wish to add to his shelves .

		MODERN DANISH LITERATURE , AND ITS FOREMOST REPRESENTATIVE .

		For a considerable part of the present century ,
Denmark	LOCATION	was the country of Romanticism .

		There are those who would say that such is still the case .

		Names from that period could be mentioned which , if known , would shine among the world 's best ; but it was their fate to write in a language familiar to but a small fraction of the European population .

		After the war of
1864	DATE	, the disrupted and discour - aged country was most concerned with healing its own wounds .

		The patriotism which has always distinguished the Danish nation naturally favored , after such disappointment , an absorption in the past which had somewhat the character of an after - growth of Romanticism .

		The predilection for sub - jects of historical and legendary character , with a deep feeling for their value because they were na - tional and Danish , and the enthusiasm for the peas - ant character , with its simple unaffected ways , as the core and centre of a national regeneration , have left a deep impression on the literature and life of this period .

		The great change , however , which institutions and ideas underwent all over
Europe	LOCATION	after the
Franco	PERSON	- German war , together with the establishment of the German Empire , has given rise in
Denmark	LOCATION	to a school of distinctly modern writers .

		The hegemony of the German Empire on the continent made clear to intelligent patriots the utter hopelessness of any dreams of restitution of that part of the conquered provinces which the
Danes	ORGANIZATION	claimed as theirs in ac - cordance with the sentiment of nationality .

		When the thought of revenge was recognized to be vain , the greater part of the population decided to accept the situation as it was , and to make the most of it from a standpoint of absolute neutrality ; to content themselves with peaceful efforts in the arenas of science , literature , and art , as well as in commer - cial enterprise and progress .

		In such conditions the modern literary school has firmly established itself , and has gained possession of the Parnassus of Danish literature .

		The present craze for military equipment , which ruins the Danish treasury and im - perils its future , brought about as it is by a power - ful but unpopular faction which has the sympathy of the crown , but has for years governed against the expressed will of the nation at large , is viewed with no little grief and indignation by all sensible peo - 136 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, pie .

		The actual if not recognized leader of this opposition party has been , and is ,
Herr Georg Brandes	PERSON	, renowned not less for his eminence as a writer and critic than for his wonderful versatility and truly cosmopolitan interests .

		The remark of
M. Zola	PERSON	, that
Denmark	LOCATION	seemed like a small animal with big feelers stretched toward the general cur - rent of European life to find out what was going on , is no inadequate simile .

		And the one who really established such a communication between the life in the great centres of culture outside and the intel - lectual circles of his own fatherland , is undoubtedly
Herr Brandes	PERSON	.

		Such a thing is usually undertaken for private benefit only ; but
Herr Brandes	PERSON	has had greater and wider aims than personal pleasure or fame .

		Always ready to accept and utilize new impulses , never corrupted or crushed in the service of the ideas he has advocated through more than a generation ,
Herr Brandes	PERSON	seems imbued with the inexhaustible energy of the wonderful Semitic race to which he belongs .

		It is , moreover , a character - istic feature of his activity that hardly anything he writes or says fails to arouse antagonism among his countrymen , and to call out an assault upon his veracity , knowledge , understanding , judgment , and what not .

		This in turn rouses his friends and fol - lowers to rush to his defence .

		Thus , amidst the dead calm of a government of the utmost reaction - ary and absolute tendencies , the spiritual atmos - phere at least is frequently renewed , and a steady cur - rent of controversy , with an occasional whirlwind , keeps things on the move and prevents stagnation .

		It is no wonder that a writer with such ideal aims and of so firm a fibre should become the creator and chief supporter of a new school of thought and culture .

		That this school has , as its programme , sympathy with all modern literature , is only a necessary consequence .

		The aim of this school , con - sciously or unconsciously , has been to combat the supposition , sometimes expressed , that
Denmark	LOCATION	in its reduced circumstances has played out its part in the world 's drama , and is on the point of losing its individuality , its character , and its rank among na - tions .

		This aim has been so successfully main - tained , that Danish art and literature at least stand worthily side by side with the strivings and achieve - ments of the general spiritual life of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Among the host of younger and older authors of this new phalanx , the poet and painter
Holger Drachmann	PERSON	is indisputably the most gifted , and at present we are glad to say the most popular .

		He is a painter of no small ability , and a writer of much force and originality in his various novels ; but by far the greatest manifestation of his genius and power is shown in his lyrical poetry , which unites a singular freshness of feeling with exquisite melody and perfection of form .

		It has been said that
Herr Drachmann	PERSON	became a painter from love of the sea ; but when he saw that his pictures were dumb that they lacked the roar of the gale , the ripple of the waves , the sigh of the water on the shore , he began to paint with words , and in rhythms .

		In
Herr Drachmann	PERSON	's work , the love of the sea is the predominant chord , whether he writes songs , novels , or plays , for he has many strings in his lyre .

		In this respect one might think there existed some resemblance between
Herr Drachmann	PERSON	and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		But this is not so ; the Greek character so prevalent in Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's poetry is entirely lacking in
Herr Drachmann	PERSON	's .

		Dreaminess is not his characteristic , nor is philosophy , nor pure harmony .

		Artistic love of light and color imbues his poetry with a special charm .

		The rhythm and rhymes flow from his pen as easily as from Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's ; but his verse lacks the sombre tint and the peculiar redundancy of melody characteristic of the English poet .


Herr Drachmann	PERSON	made his literary debut with a little work in prose , entitled '' With Charcoal and Chalk '' ; and in
1872	DATE	his first volume of poems ap - peared .

		Little by little the poet became more pow - erful than the painter , and after some years the brush had wholly to give way to the pen .

		Since then , half a hundred volumes in prose and verse have appeared , and among them works that are a true ornament of Danish literature .

		The tendency in his works is certainly modern ; but
Herr Drach	PERSON	- mann can be classed neither with the '' naturalists '' nor with the '' symbolists . ''

		He has his own indi - vidual forte , which is at the same time thoroughly popular .

		He is much attracted by the fantastic , but by the fantastic in such measure and form as is possessed by the fairy story .

		His particular aim , especially in later years , has been to reach the heart of the common people , to draw nearer to them and draw them closer to him , in order to find thereby a broad field for an activity both encouraging and awakening , which he thinks is needed in order to rouse their slumbering powers and deadened energy .

		His life with the fishermen at
Skagen	LOCATION	, his travels and conversations , have opened his understanding to the struggles and the unostentatious bravery shown in the existence of the hundreds and thousands of men upon whose courage and resistance the ten - acity of a nation depend .


Herr Drachmann	PERSON	is a pa - triot of the most exultant character .

		All through the earlier part of his productive period he was almost too turbulent in praise of his country and advocacy of its cause .

		In later years , however , the continued misgovernment , and the increasing lethargy of the people in allowing the ministry to continue their absolute ignoring of all constitutional rights , have made him more and more distrustful and hopeless concerning the future .

		Accordingly , in
1890	DATE	, with the publication of his largest and weightiest novel , '' Pledged , '' the poet made up the account between himself and his past .

		An attempt to establish in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	a place of public resort of a high in - tellectual grade , yet not of an '' academic '' charac - ter , receiving the ideas and movements of the time , and allowing artists and poets to bring their works directly to an unprejudiced public , hoping thereby to educate the masses , failed utterly .

		It is the re - sult of ideas cherished by
Herr Drachmann	PERSON	, that

		THE DIAL 137 the '' free theatre , '' on the plan of the Tlie & tre libre in
Paris	LOCATION	, enjoyed its brief existence .

		But his liter - ary-popular `` cafe '' had not even such fortune .

		Wearied of the hopeless project , which met no in - terest and support from the wealthy classes ,
Herr Drachmann	PERSON	left the country , and has since spent his time mostly in
Germany	LOCATION	the land from which he thinks
Denmark	LOCATION	has much to learn .

		His stay in
Hamburg	LOCATION	during the cholera epidemic , his cour - ageous and helpful conduct during that time , when even the inhabitants themselves lost hope and wished to desert the plague-stricken city , have been favor - ably commented upon in the German papers .

		His productivity as an author has lost nothing during his absence from home , and although his health is not strong , his friends and admirers may still hope to see much from his pen in years to come .

		To English readers , it may be of interest to know that
Herr Drachmann	PERSON	has made himself known also as a brilliant translator of Byron 's ''
Don Juan	PERSON	, '' a task not yet finished .

		Here the translator has done his brother poet a service such as few have been able to render .

		It is true of music that no - body can render a composer as well as one who is himself a composer ; and the same must be true of poetry .

		The masterly handling of the difficult ma - terial places this translation of Byron scarcely be - low the original .

		Whether
Herr Drachmann	PERSON	him - self , and especially in some of his best lyrics , shall ever be satisfactorily translated into English , is a question time only can answer .

		Perhaps in his most genuine works he is as little translatable as is Dr.
Ibsen	PERSON	, although some reproductions may be a pleasant exception .

		Of his works the following are probably the best known : '' Songs by the Sea , '' ''
Venezia	PERSON	, '' '' From the Frontier , '' '' The Princess and Half the Kingdom , '' ''
Lars Kruse	PERSON	, '' '' East o ' the Sun and West o ' the
Moon	PERSON	, '' '' The Daughter of the Waters , '' ''
Paul	PERSON	and
Virginia	LOCATION	of a Northern Zone , '' Once Upon a Time , '' '' The Book of Songs , '' `` Pledged , '' ''

		LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE IN
JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		An interesting controversy is going on , in the col - umns of the literary magazines of
Tokyo	LOCATION	, on the ques - tion of the abolition of the Chinese idiographs in the written language .

		The weight of centuries of usage and of economy , through conciseness in the expression of ideas , is in favor of their retention .

		But they are so complex and so cumbrous , and require so much time for study in a curriculum tremendously overcrowded , that they are felt to be a great drag upon popular edu - cation .

		And especially do they seem to be entirely un - suited for the new career for which
Japan	LOCATION	is evidently destined .

		There is a strong feeling among thinking men that the Japanese language and Japanese literature can not adapt themselves to modern thought and attain the possibilities of modern civilization with such incon - venient and unpractical modes of expressing and com - municating thought .

		It is argued , therefore , that a more simple and easy alphabet must be substituted for the prevalent mixture of Japanese characters and Chi - nese idiographs , if
Japan	LOCATION	wishes to maintain communi - cation with the world at large .

		But the reformers are thus far unable to agree upon a substitute .

		Some urge the adoption of Roman let - ters ; others are in favor of using only the Japanese Kana ; '' while yet others propose modifications of the
Kana	ORGANIZATION	so as to meet the requirements of transliterating foreign names . ''

		These last , who seem to be supported by a majority of the literary reformers , also recom - mend the mode of writing from left to right in the European fashion .

		It is also proposed to make '' radical changes in the grammar of the Japanese language , '' so as to recognize constructions that have lately been introduced through imitation of Western modes of thought .

		This proposal has , of course , '' evoked a loud protest from the votaries of classical Japanese , '' but is '' welcomed by the literary public in general . ''

		These attempts to conform the Japanese language to the requirements of foreign intercourse are accompanied by an increased interest in the study of foreign lan - guages .

		This extends , in the first place , to the Korean and the Chinese languages , and reaches , also , even in spite of political prejudices , to the Russian language and literature .

		`` But the language whose status has been most extensively and permanently improved is En - glish , '' the importance of which , '' as a medium for con - ducting business transactions and international inter - course , '' is now more fully recognized .

		This same tendency to emphasize the necessity of '' modernizing '' is apparent in a recent address on '' The Future of Japanese Literature , '' by Professor
Tsubou	PERSON	- chi , '' one of
Japan	LOCATION	's foremost literati . ''

		He spoke along this line : '' At the present time , unfortunately , there are no standard works in the realm of Japanese literary thought .

		Those works which foreigners read in a translated form , believing them to be the finest literary products of
Japan	LOCATION	, are without exception old classics , and have nothing in common with the trend of modern ideas .

		It is impossible to rest satisfied with this state of affairs ; we can not hope that Occidentals will ever rightly un - derstand the Japanese people if they are to have noth - ing better than these antique and obsolete works as their standards .

		The encouragement of a national literature is thus at the present moment of prime importance .

		It is the only means which will serve to promote an inti - macy with the Western world .

		We have now to pro- duce a series of masterpieces that will show us in the true light the progressive , invincible Japanese of the
19th century	DATE	. ''

		It will certainly be interesting and instructive for all scholars , especially for comparative philologists , to watch these attempts to reform a language and a literature that are not only of old standing , but that for at least two and a half centuries were crystallized .

		Even though radical reforms may not be accomplished , great changes will be made , have already been made , in both the language and the literature of
Japan	LOCATION	.

		138 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, - Books * A FINANCIER OF
FRANCE	LOCATION	.

		* To most English readers , the name of Tur - got is only one in a group of distinguished men who , in the middle of the eighteenth century , prepared the mind of
France	LOCATION	for the transition from the old to the new regime consummated by the Revolution .

		His writings , however , have not ceased to interest and instruct thought - ful readers who desire to learn something about one of the most interesting men of his century , and to know accurately the condition of
France	LOCATION	in the twenty-five years prior to the Revolution . ''

		Every science , every language , every litera - ture , every business , '' says
Michelet	PERSON	, '' inter - ested Turgot . '' ''

		He took to the work of civil government , '' says
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, '' in what spirit many of us know , and whoever of us does not know should make it his business to learn . '' ''

		The nineteenth century is the true century of Turgot , '' says
Leon Say	PERSON	, '' because it is that in which his ideas have been applied , and in which he has borne manifest sway over minds and over things . ''

		These are quite sufficient reasons to justify Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	in his '' attempt to provide English readers with a fuller and more exact knowledge of Turgot and his writ - ings than they have hitherto possessed . ''

		Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	, within the limits he set , has probably condensed , as he says , into a single volume all matter of sufficient importance and interest for general readers of the present day .

		Industrial students , however , who can spare the time , will not be satisfied with selections and condensa - tions , but will go to the original fountains the entire works of Turgot .

		Prior to the Revolution , there were only three openings for sons of the French nobility civil administration , the army , and the church .

		Turgot , being the youngest of three sons , was destined for the church .

		He was accordingly sent to the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, where , however , his studies took a wide range , including a full course in the civil law .

		At the conclusion of these studies , and with his father 's consent , he announced his determination not to follow the ecclesiastical calling .

		His fellow-students urged him , with many reasons , to reconsider his de - termination .

		`` Take for yourselves , '' he re - plied , '' the counsel you have given me , since you can follow it .

		not enter into your views .

		As for me , it is im - possible to subject myself all my life to wear - ing a veil over my face . ''

		For a few years after leaving the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, Turgot held a judicial office .

		In
1761	DATE	he was appointed Intendant of the Generality of Li - moges , the poorest of the thirty-five Generalities in
France	LOCATION	.

		But genius makes its own place .

		He refused many offers to transfer him to richer and more desirable Generalities .

		For thirteen years he gave the best of his life to the people of
Limoges	LOCATION	, who excited his sympathies because they were oppressed and degraded .

		He began at once to institute those reforms with which his name will ever be associated .

		Taxes were unequal , and the heaviest burdens were laid upon those who could least support them .

		He restored equality and removed the undue bur - den .

		The roads were made by the forced and unpaid labor of the peasants .

		He abolished compulsory service , substituted equal taxation , and changed the poorest into the best roads of the kingdom .

		The details of his great work can not be given here .

		He sought from every - body information in relation to his duties .

		Through the curates , who were near to the peo - ple , he gained the people 's confidence .

		In those laborious years he studied profoundly the causes of the evils existing in
France	LOCATION	; and his reports to the Comptroller-General during that period , while accurately stating the facts of the cases under consideration , were also economic treat - ises , good for all time .

		The reader who cares to pursue the subject fully will find the desired information in the works of
Turgot	LOCATION	, and no - where besides .

		Turgot had a scholar 's love of study .

		He was probably the profoundest thinker then in
France	LOCATION	.

		He knew the sacrifice he made .

		His friend
Condorcet	LOCATION	wrote to him : '' You are very fortunate in having a passion for the public good , and in being able to satisfy it ; it is a great consolation , and of a very superior order to the consolation of mere study . ''

		`` Nay , '' replied Turgot , '' whatever you may say , I be - lieve that the satisfaction derived from study is superior to any other kind of satisfaction .

		I am perfectly convinced that one may be , through study , a thousand times more useful to men than in any of our subordinate posts . ''

		Turgot was appointed
Comptroller-General of Finance	ORGANIZATION	,
July 24 , 1774	DATE	; and held the office a little more than twenty months .

		He devoted every spare moment of that period , with intense and passionate earnestness , to the execution of his comprehensive scheme of reform .

		He un -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 139 derstood well the risk he was taking , the oppo - sition he would encounter , and the danger of failure in the execution of his plan ; but he considered that the emergencies of the time justified him in taking any personal risks in order to avert if possible the greater calamities of the then pending Revolution .

		His method was statesmanlike . ''

		If one is not to give up the attempt to correct little by little the faults of an ancient constitution , '' he said , '' it is necessary to work to that end slowly and ac - cording to the measure in which public opinion and the course of events render changes possi - ble . ''

		He was not a novice .

		He had been twenty-one years in public life , had travelled over the provinces of
France	LOCATION	with his friend the celebrated
Gournay	PERSON	, then perhaps the clos - est living observer of economic conditions .

		Turgot 's special studies , as well as his great experience , qualified him in the highest degree to prepare to explain and to introduce the gen - eral scheme of reforms with which his name will be forever identified .

		In a general way it may be said that these reforms involved the reestablishment of the public finances , then deranged to the verge of bankruptcy ; the cor - rection of innumerable abuses which were the heritage from a worn-out feudal system ; the destruction of special privileges , under the operation of which the mass of the people were reduced to poverty and despair ; freedom from the monopoly of the guilds ; and freedom of commerce and the industries from intolerable burdens and restrictions .

		Turgot 's state papers during this period are the best existing exposi - tion of all these evils and the measures he took to reform them .

		France at that period had no constitution in the English or in the American sense .

		There was no organized public opinion to which a statesman could make an appeal .

		The blind obstinacy of the privileged classes was such that no material reforms could be effected ex - cept by the prerogative of the king or by revo - lution .

		Turgot relied only upon the prerogatives of the king , whose power was absolute ; for
France	LOCATION	at that time was monarchical to the core .

		The king controlled the purse and the sword .

		He could send his parliaments , then judicial bodies , into exile or into bastiles .

		He could , by his edicts , make and repeal laws ; and he had control of all the offices of administra - tion .

		It was upon this vast power that Turgot relied .

		The king at first resolved to sustain Turgot in all his proposed reforms .

		The queen and her courtiers , the nobility and the higher clergy who had inherited their privileges , and the rich bourgeois who had bought them , would not have it so .

		The weak king yielded to the pressure .

		Turgot was driven from the Minis - try , and his reforms were not then accom - plished .

		A little more than eight years after
Turgot	PERSON	's death , his triumph came , not , how - ever , as the great statesman desired , by the peaceful and orderly steps of progressive re - form , but through the exaltation of revolution - ary feeling , when , on the memorable night of the fourth of
August , 1789	DATE	, all feudal rights and privileges were abolished , and
France	LOCATION	passed at once and forever from the old to the new regime .

		The selections made by Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	give a fair idea of Turgot 's rank as an economist .

		The average reader has but little conception of the restrictions laid upon trade , commerce , and the industries , in
Turgot	LOCATION	's time ; and does not appreciate the debt of gratitude we owe to the earlier economists who led the way to the com - parative freedom now enjoyed in those pursuits .

		The celebrated edicts prepared by Turgot dur - ing his ministry were based upon his matured convictions that industry and the exchanges of commerce , being entirely a matter of individ - ual right , should be maintained free from every restriction on the part of government , and that it was no part of the function of government to interfere at any time or anywhere with these in - dividual rights ; that the imprescriptible right of labor involved as corollaries , first , the right to enjoy property as the fruits of labor , and , sec - ond , the unqualified right of exchange between individuals .

		All those great edicts were pre - ceded by ' ' Memoires '' fully explaining their pur - poses .

		Leon Say says : '' That which impressed the friends of the minister at first , and united the approbation of all men of elevation of mind , was the care taken by Turgot to explain in an extended preamble the reasons of the change made by the new decree to the legislation then in force .

		To discuss before the public , was a novelty .

		Turgot was thus the inventor of that usage , generally practiced since in free govern - ments , to preface the projects of laws by that which we call to-day an exposition of its mo - tives . ''

		And
Voltaire	PERSON	said : '' We have not be - fore had edicts in which the sovereign deigned to teach his people , to reason with them , to in - struct them in their interests , to persuade them before commanding them . ''

		These great writ - ers are , however , not quite accurate in their claim that
Turgot	PERSON	was the inventor of this ad - mirable usage .

		In the fourth book of
Plato	ORGANIZATION	's 140 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, '' Laws '' -LRB- pp. 720 et seq. -RRB- the Athenian Stranger says : '' And is our legislator to have no preface to his laws , but to say at once do this , avoid that ; and then , holding the pen - alty in terrorem , to go on to another law ; offer - ing never a word of advice or exhortation to those for whom he is legislating ? ''

		It is credit enough for Turgot that he was the first to embody in the laws of a great people the ideas of the immortal Greek thinker .

		Turgot 's writings cover a period of about thirty years .

		His first publication ,
1749	DATE	, is a letter to
L'Abbe de Cice	ORGANIZATION	upon Money .

		In that letter he exploded the mischievous brood of fallacies that still torment us , based upon the same error that the fiat of government can compel commodities of unequal value to be taken as equivalents in exchange for each other .

		Mirabeau exploited that fallacy , with his usual eloquence , when he misled a small majority of the
Constituent Assembly	ORGANIZATION	into issuing the as - signats , and , with the usual result , paralyzing the industries of
France	LOCATION	for six years from
1790	DATE	.

		Seventy-two years later , our practical statesmen , who had learned nothing from the economists and nothing from the experience of the nations , put out the '' legal tenders , '' at a cost to the people of the
United States	LOCATION	, it is estimated , of some thousand
millions of dollars	MONEY	.

		A great fallacy is sometimes more costly than a great war .

		The last state paper of
Turgot	LOCATION	, dated
April 6 , 1776	DATE	, was a `` Memoire '' prepared in re - sponse to a request from
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		for his opinion in writing in relation to the part
France	LOCATION	ought to take in the American war .


Vergennes	LOCATION	,
Secretary of Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, had determined to declare war against
England	LOCATION	, ostensibly in aid of the Colonies .

		Turgot , for many statesmanlike reasons which I can not here recite , advised the king to give the col - onies every possible assistance allowed by an honorable neutrality , but not to declare war in their favor .

		Vergennes cared nothing for the American cause .

		Turgot cared for all causes in which men struggled for freedom .

		His whole official life was a protest against the restrictions which monopoly imposed upon industry and trade within the limits of
France	LOCATION	.

		He did not , however , believe that the principle governing trade was limited by national boundaries , and that restrictions upon it ceased to be injurious when they become colonial or international ; and in his last state paper he declared that the independence of the English colonies would dis - sipate the delusion which for two centuries had led European nations erroneously to believe that they could gain wealth by reserving to themselves the exclusive right to buy from and sell to their colonies . ''

		I firmly believe , '' says Turgot , '' that all the mother-countries will be forced to abandon all empire over their colonies , to leave to them entire freedom of commerce with all nations , to content themselves in par - taking along with the others this liberty , and in maintaining with their colonies the ties of friendship and fraternity .

		OUR PRESENT KNOWLEDGE or THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES .

		* In Professor
Marshall	PERSON	's '' Lectures on the Darwinian Theory '' we find a simple , direct , and accurate account of our present knowledge of the origin of species .

		The matter is cast in the form of
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	lectures eight in number elementary in character , , as befits the interest of an intelligent but un - scientific audience .

		In his exposition , Profes - sor
Marshall	PERSON	follows closely the lines of argu - ment laid down by
Darwin	ORGANIZATION	.

		In other words , he is guided by what is really known , and has no hypothesis of his own to be maintained or illustrated .

		In reading these lectures , one is impressed by the self-restraint of the author .

		He never forgets his purpose , never falls into rhetoric , never makes points , and never puts himself in any degree into a controversial attitude .

		Out of the wealth of his knowledge he draws noth - ing that he does not need .

		Often the results of years of investigation are summarized in a single paragraph .

		Matters still under dispute as the inheritance of acquired characters are passed by without mention , as not yet a part of science .

		Every effort is made to con - centrate attention on that which is known and essential to the doctrine of the development of species through natural selection .

		The analogies between changes in words by natural selection and changes in species are well brought out by Professor
Marshall	PERSON	.

		The physical kinship of man with the lower ani - mals is very clearly shown .

		He says : '' In fact , unless man wishes to continue going about the world stamped with living and palpable proof of LECTURES ON THE DARWINIAN THEORY .

		THE DIAL 141 his kinship with lower animals , he had better stop up his ears , or , still better , cut them off altogether ; for so long as he bears at the side of his head those tell-tale flaps , with their aborted and rudimentary muscles , so long as he hears by means of that slit , once a gillcleft , now by change of function become an accessory organ of hearing , so long does he carry about in sight of all men sure proof of his relationship with lower , even with water-breathing , animals .

		Yet one can scarcely recom - mend the operation , for if you were to remove one by one the various parts of your body which proclaim this kinship , you would get rid in succession of skin , mus - cles , nerves , bones , etc. , and all that would be left in the end as man 's special and peculiar possessions would be : -LRB- 1 -RRB- certain parts of his brain , and these only doubt - fully ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- the extensor primi internodii pollicis muscle , which straightens the first joint of the thumb ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- the peroneus tertius , a small muscle in front of the lower part of the leg and ankle , inserted into the base of the little toe ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- certain portions of other muscles . ''

		Again , if we turn from bodily structure to the other characteristics of man , we find the same tendency to over-population , resulting in the same struggle for ex - istence and the same survival of the fittest .

		Indeed , it was from the study of
Malthus	PERSON	' ' Essay on Population ' that
Darwin	PERSON	was led to the theory of
Natural Selection	ORGANIZATION	.

		So it is with the history of the rise and fall of nations , with the evolution of human speech , customs , and cloth - ing .

		All alike conform to the same laws as those regu - lating the structure and habits of other animals .

		And so with the influence of man on other animals ; the ad - vent of man has simply been the arrival of another ani - mal , better equipped , and more cunning , more cruel , than any other ; acting with supreme selfishness ; toler - ating the existence of other animals only when they can be made subservient to his own wants or pleasures ; ruthlessly exterminating all that offends or thwarts him .

		His only kindness is merely a nominal exception , for if perchance he appear kindly disposed to certain animals , it is only to satisfy his own selfish ends , that he may fleece them of their coats or pluck them of their feath - ers to adorn himself ; or to fatten them , that they may acquire a flavour more acceptable to his palate . ''

		Again , referring
Marshall	PERSON	observes : to Language , Professor '' Language has been said to be ' the one great differ - ence between man and brutes , ' and an ' insurmountable obstacle to the theory of alliance by descent . '

		This has been urged even by those who accept the theory as ap - plying to all other animals . ''

		But has not language a history , has it not been evolved gradually , and is it not constantly , even daily , undergoing change ?

		Is not this evolution , are not these changes of a nature precisely similar to those which have governed the animal kingdom in other branches , and have made it what it is at the present day ? ''

		The controverted questions as to man 's spir - itual kinship with the beasts are brushed aside , perhaps too easily , on the doubtful ground that science has nothing to say regarding them . ''

		Whether there is anything further than this , whether man has other attributes , either peculiar to himself or held by him in common with other animals , whether these are attributes that can not be explained by these laws , is a question with which we have no concern here .

		Science has nothing to do with such mat - ters , and has nothing to say for or against them . ''

		One slight error may be noted .

		Surely the lung of mammals is not derived from the swim - bladder of fishes .

		The swim-bladder is a de - generate organ , existing in all stages of degra - dation .

		It was developed from a respiratory structure which in land animals has culminated in the lung .

		THE BASES OF APPRECIATION iisr ART .

		* Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	's more popular presentation of the subject of ^ Esthetics has to contend with a difficulty that confronts any other book on the theory of art .

		The '' general reader '' does not desire instruction on the topic .

		Political econ - omy is one of those matters on which , accord - ing to common feeling , any voter has as good a right to an opinion as the most devoted and learned student .

		Such is also the case in mat - ters pertaining to the fine arts , with the addi - tion that here special thought and exact knowl - edge are usually held to cloud and befog the freshness necessary to excellent views on the subject .

		In literature , in painting , and else - where , the generally accepted dictum is , '' I do n't know anything about the rules of art , but I know what I like , '' with which is coupled a firm determination not to like anything that one does n't want to of one 's own mere motion , and , indeed , not to submit to any interference that in any respect smacks of thought or knowledge of the matter in hand .

		Discussions , then , of the reasons which un - derlie our artistic appreciation , and principles which may be deduced as to what is better to like and what worse , are sure to meet at the outset with a good deal of indifference and prejudice in the mind of the general reader .

		The psy - chologist , the critic , the art student , may wel - come a new theory ; a few thinking readers may be interested ; but unless it is presented in a particularly persuasive manner , the hearts of most readers do not warm to it .

		It is per - haps just as well .

		Taine 's works , especially the `` English Literature , '' and
Euskin	ORGANIZATION	's `` Modern Painters , '' are cases in point .

		These books owed their popularity chiefly to their style .

		Now , unfortunately , Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	has not any special gift of style .

		He writes clearly and concisely : he is not -LRB- in the present book at least -RRB- a difficult author .

		But he has not any special igift of popular exposi - tion .

		`` Esthetic Principles '' can be read easily enough if one is determined to read it , but it has no charm , it does not tempt the indifferent to continue ; unless impelled by his own zeal , the reader is not unlikely to faint by the way - side .

		Despite the effort to the contrary , the book is somewhat arid .

		This is the more unfortunate , since Mr.
Mar	PERSON	- shall has much that would be of use to just the sort of reader whom he will fail to interest .

		If one can emerge from the class of readers in question and realize that we have here a dis - cussion of a profoundly interesting topic , one will find in `` Esthetic Principles '' a great deal that is worth while .

		Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	's first book was original and scholarly ; so is this one , and also far simpler and less technical .

		One great excellence , on the whole the first to be remarked , is that Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	not only recognizes that there are different points of view in this matter , but plans his book on that basis .

		People are apt to read different things about art , a bit from
Taine	LOCATION	, as has been said , something of
Ruskin	PERSON	's perhaps , and some hard saying of
Hegel	LOCATION	, and there is generally a bad hitch when they try to coordinate their views .

		They seem to be on wholly different topics .

		Everybody does n't know , or does n't see at once , that
Taine	PERSON	is generally concerned with those forces which go to produce a work of art , while
Ruskin	PERSON	is apt to be thinking of those forces which a work of art tends to produce , and
Hegel	PERSON	con - siders beauty rather in itself than as a cause or an effect .

		Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	begins almost at once with '' two different standpoints : first , the ' Ob - server 's Standpoint , ' relating to the field of Impression ; and , second , the * Artist 's Stand - point , ' which deals with the Art Instinct . ''

		And the first of these is developed into a Critic 's Standpoint ; which gives us three ways of look - ing at the matter .

		The term '' observer '' does not seem to me a very happy one .

		When we have looked at a picture , or read a book , or heard music , or anything of the sort , we never think of our - selves as observers .

		When we think of an ob - server we think of somebody studying the habits of the domestic fly , or the tendencies of our present social system , or something of the sort .

		Where art is concerned , we are hardly observ - ers , we are enjoyers .

		But '' enjoyer '' is a ridicu - lous word , and when we try for another we have no easy task in improving Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	's ter - minology : amateur , art-lover , connoisseur , none of them give us anything of the idea we have in mind , of the normal person of cultiva - tion who receives enjoyment from the various forms of art .

		In spite of all this , however , one can not remain contented with '' observer '' ; it introduces into the idea a dry scholastic ele - ment , which should be very foreign to it .

		As to the use of the word artist for '' the aBsthetic worker in each and all of the varied fields in which beauty is of moment , '' that use of the word has been so long habitual to many writers , that even those who usually understand by it '' painters and draughtsmen only '' will be ready to extend their conception .

		Beginning , then , with this division of our study into three topics the Observer 's , the Artist 's , the Critic 's Standpoints we get at once a good way out of
Egypt	LOCATION	, and come to Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	's special theory .

		As to this the - ory , on which the book is built , it is not nec - essary to discuss it now .

		It is , of course , the theory propounded more fully and scientifically in the author 's '' Pain , Pleasure , and JEsthet - ics , '' published a year or so ago in book form , and before that in one of the philosophical journals .

		It is a theory which calls for the special criticism of the psychologist : the gen - eral reader is no better off if one authority pro- nounces it sound , and no worse off if another authority pronounces it fallacious .

		The chief point of interest , I believe , is that it is a theory which is stimulating and suggestive .

		Once get hold of the idea , that , for each man , that is beautiful which results in pleasurable '' reviv - als , '' or recollections , and that he will do well to think beautiful that which results in pleas - urable recollections to the ideal type of the cul - tivated man -LRB- the esthetic man , if we do well to imitate the Frankenstein of the political economists -RRB- , once get a good idea of what is meant by this conception and of the possible applications of it , and one finds a sort of spur , and at the same time a help , in thinking about some things that have been puzzling .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 143 Many people will seriously object to the as - sumption that the aim of art is only to give pleasure .

		The objection comes from the dif - ferent ideas of pleasure that people have .

		Some people regard pleasure as being at bottom a deceitful , grovelling evil .

		Others conceive more readily of pleasures which are candid and noble , which do not lead astray , but carry us to places where we say , '' It is good for us to be here . ''

		Naturally enough , those who think of pleasure as something essentially low do not feel that mere pleasure is a very good aim for art or for anything else .

		Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	, however , under - stands by pleasure a quality which may belong to any element of consciousness .

		It is subject - ive : the pleasures of a noble man are noble , the pleasures of a degraded man are not .

		The pleasures of a good man are in good things , and they lead him to desire them .

		The pleasures of our artistic type are , then , of a fine and in - spiring kind ; they are not Capuan in charac - ter , nor is their effect relaxing .

		But the word '' Hedonist '' has a bad sound in the ears of a nation which has not forgotten the Puritans , and there will be many who will not be able to think with equanimity of pleasure as the aim of art .

		However this may be , Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	shows how the assumption gives a basis to the art - lover , the artist , the critic .

		He then proceeds to amplify the last topic in a discussion of '' gen - eral laws of esthetic practice from a consider - ation of the conditions upon which pleasure - getting depends . ''

		Here we may leave the subject , with a single remark .

		I have said that Mr.
Marshall	PERSON	has not the gift of a persuasive and engaging style .

		He has , however , a very nice way of working his principles out into applications which take our attention at once .

		We are attracted by his de - veloping the conclusion that an early disposi - tion to draw pictures does not constitute a di - vine call to an artist 's life ; we see that we have to do , not with a mere theorizer , but with a scholar who has his own outlook on the world .

		So , also , when he shows us that bad architec - ture is a lasting calamity , that it is impossible that everyone should enjoy the best art , espe - cially such as have always lived in the '' slums , '' that although different people must like differ - ent things , some are better worth liking than others , and so on .

		Such points serve a double purpose : they are hints to us for our own think - ing , and they give us confidence in our author , a confidence in this case not undeserved .

		SEVEX BOOKS OF TRAVEL , .

		* Mr.
Swettenham	PERSON	, the author of u Malay Sketches , '' informs us that his is '' not a book of travels , '' but rather '' a series of sketches of Malay scenery and Malay character , drawn by one who has spent the best part of his life in the scenes and amongst the people he describes . ''

		We judge , however , that an account by a foreigner resident in strange lands is , in a large and true sense , a book of travel .

		The mere fact that one writes from a foreign country from a stationary point of view , as in Mrs.
Martin	PERSON	's '' Ostrich Farm , '' Lady
Barker	PERSON	's ''
South Africa	LOCATION	, '' or Mr.
Swettenham	PERSON	's '' Malay Sketches , '' does not debar the work from being considered a book of travels .

		One who stops in a country a few years , and gives us a book about it , does not radically differ from him who stops a month and gives us a chapter .

		Mr.
Swettenham	PERSON	is connected with the
English Government	ORGANIZATION	in
Perak	LOCATION	, a division of the
Malay Peninsula	LOCATION	; and he has there made the ob - servations upon which this book is based .

		It is his object to put before us the real Malay in his own environment ; to give us an intimate knowledge of his appearance , character , and habits .

		But we are disappointed in finding that
this Malay	DATE	is not , after all , the real aboriginal one , but the Islamized , and to some extent Europeanized , one .

		This modernized Malay , who dynamites fish , who has tricycles and music-boxes , who is under police and judges , is de - scribed by our author simply and clearly .

		Still , de - scription of scenery and people , even when good , is inferior to illustration , which this book entirely lacks .

		A lifelike picture of a Perak Malay would save many words of description , and help the reader to realize his characteristics .

		Mr.
Swettenham	PERSON	offers to '' the jaded pleasure-seekers of the West '' a new form of amusement practised by the Malays , namely , sliding down a waterfall into a pool at the base .

		He has probably never heard of our water-chutes .

		His chapter on the running Amok does not enlighten us much as to its real nature and causes .

		Again , he asserts that the Malays can not be christianized , but still , in his opinion , they are not to be swept out of existence by superior races ; two opinions that are * MALAY SKETCHES .

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		144 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, not supported by due evidence .

		On the whole , this book does not attain its object ; it is not a deep study , and the reader gets merely a few rather superficial glimpses of this interesting people .

		The writer 's point of view is , after all , that of an outsider and of one in authority .

		If some artistic realist , like
Miss Wilkins	PERSON	, would go to Perak and write tales full of local color , we should gain that complete pic - ture of the Malay which this book can not give us .

		Mr.
F. G. Jackson	PERSON	, in the expedition which he describes in '' The Great Frozen Land , '' had two objects in view : '' the first and more important was to experiment with and test a selected variety of equipment , clothing , and food , under the conditions of an Arctic winter , in order that the results of this experience might be utilized in the more prolonged and far more difficult journey contemplated to the unknown Arctic area north of Franz Josef Land . ''

		The second object was '' to visit and , for some months , to live with that primitive group of the hu - man family , the Samoyads of the Great Frozen Tundra of Arctic
Russia	LOCATION	. ''

		These two objects Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	fairly accomplished in his journey through
Siberia	LOCATION	and
Lapland	LOCATION	in the winter of 1893-94 .

		To the general reader , the most interesting part of his book is that which describes the rude Samoyads .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	thus pictures a night halt at a wayside hut or choom : '' As we found three Samoyads there , we made in all a party of nine in a choom nine by ten .

		And I must not forget indeed , I can not forget that in addition to these , there was a Samoyad baby of about eighteen months , who kept up a vigorous crying and made itself generally felt .

		My companions , including the Russian , were soon deep in a feast on raw reindeer , and the
Sam	PERSON	- oyad lady on my right comfortably seated herself on the ground and placed the stomach of a deer on her lap .

		It was full of blood , and she dipped in it the pieces of raw meat she was eating .

		As the coloured candles the same as they use before their ikons flared and nick - ered , the blood-smeared faces of these hungry eaters framed in a strange circle of primitive life .

		However , hunger provided sauce and overlooked surroundings , and I supped well , and then tried to thaw the sleeping - bag , which had frozen hard after getting wet -LRB- we had been driving in 14 F. of frost -RRB- , but the attempt was not very successful , and I had eventually to sleep on the ground in my clothes .

		It was amusing to see the baby , which had been sitting up and had eaten a fairly good supper of raw meat , put to bed by its mother .

		She first wrapped it in furs , then placed it in a box shaped like a coffin , and laced it in with narrow strips of hide , so that it was not only impossible for it to fall out , but also very difficult for it even to move . ''

		And yet these people who live on raw meat , and who never bathe or change their clothes , are affected by the ceramic craze , their chief treasures being china cups and saucers .

		Though publicly
Chris	PERSON	- tians , in private they are pagans .

		Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's description of the frozen Siberian marsh or Tundra is impressive : '' Nothing I know of in nature can equal the dreari - ness and solitude of the Tundra .

		Mile after mile , as you travel along , there is no break in the monotony of this great frozen land .

		Everywhere is snow , everywhere the vast white plains .

		In the perspective of distance , the very ridges melt into the general level ; and as you look around , everywhere you are met with the same great mantle of unbroken snow .

		The country lies be - fore you as an earth that is dead , so still , so motionless , so rigid is the landscape .

		Life has fled before the icy winds which draw out of the north , and the land you traverse is surely the land of death .

		There is scarcely the cry of a single bird to break upon the ear in this untenanted wilderness ; the very streams are motionless masses of ice .

		Track there is none , and you may wan - der east , west , north , and south , without a landmark to set you right .

		Day after day and week after week your deer will gallop along their frozen way , and your com - pass , or , if the grey clouds will lift for a while , the stars in the heaven above , will be your only guide . ''

		This book is a conscientious piece of work .

		It is well illustrated , and is provided with very good maps .

		It concludes with chapters on Language and on Folk - Tales , and with appendices of scientific value .

		While on the whole it appeals more to the scientist and explorer , the book possesses no little interest for the general reader .

		Miss Hapgood is well and favorably known as a translator of the works of Tolstdy -LRB- as she spells the name -RRB- .

		In her volume of '' Russian Rambles , '' which is largely a reprint of magazine articles , she seeks to dispel '' some of the absurd ideas which are now current about
Russia	LOCATION	, '' that is , ideas of
Russia	LOCATION	as a country full of despotic cruelty , of start - lingly strange customs , and where the visitor is being constantly dogged by a lynx-eyed police .

		She de - nounces -LRB- p. vi . -RRB-

		as an incredible yarn the story that a peasant was met on the NeVsky Prospe * kt , '' holding in his hand a live chicken , from which he was taking occasional bites , feathers and all . ''

		However , her own story -LRB- p. 115 -RRB- about '' people walking along the streets with bunches of pea-vines , from which they were plucking the peas , and eating them , pods and all , quite raw , '' might seem to some people a doubtful tale .

		Miss Hapgood is too severe in her constant polemic against other writers .

		Others need not be disbelieved in order to believe her .

		If she had comparatively little annoyance from the pass - port system , and the censorship , for example , this was largely due to her tact and knowledge of the native language * One official , indeed , was so im - pressed by her proficiency that , '' Rising , drawing himself up , with the heels of his high wrinkled boots in regulation contact , and the scarlet pipings of his baggy green trousers and tight coat brist - ling with martial etiquette , he made me a profound bow , hand on heart , and said : ' Madam , accept the thanks of
Russia	LOCATION	for the high honor you have done her in learning her difficult language . ' ''

		Miss Hapgood has kept the best wine to the last ; her earlier chapters are rather inferior in interest and style to the later ones .

		Four out of the eleven pages of Chapter IV. , '' Bargaining in
Russia	LOCATION	, '' are taken up with a description of furs and Russian houses .

		For the best remarks on bargaining and shopping , see pp. 109 ff .

		Chapters V.-VIII .

		and
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 145 X. XI .

		may be recommended as the most entertain - ing and instructive in the book .

		Miss Hapgood became quite intimately acquainted with Count Tolstdy , and her description of the man is very in - teresting and seems quite veracious . ''

		I am aware that it has become customary of late to call Count Tolstdy ' crazy , ' or ' not quite right in the head , ' etc. .

		The inevitable conclusion of any one who talks much with him is that he is nothing of the sort ; but simply a man with a hobby or an idea .

		His idea hap - pens to be one which , granting it ought to be adopted by everybody , is peculiarly difficult in his own case .

		And it is an uncomfortable theory of self-denial which very few people like to have preached to them in any form .

		Add to tbis that his philosophical exposition of his theory lacks the clearness which generally not always results from a course of strict preparatory train - ing , and we have more than enough foundation for the reports of his mental aberration .

		On personal acquain - tance he proves to be a remarkably earnest , thoroughly convinced , and winning man , although he does not de - liberately do or say anything to attract one .

		His very earnestness is provocative of argument . ''

		Miss Hapgood falls often into the easy fault of travellers , of using foreign words without due ex - planation .

		For instance , on pages 250-251 , there are five Russian words at whose meaning we are left to guess -LRB- cf. pages 87 , 106 , 243 , 249 -RRB- .

		If Rus - sian words must be used , there should be a glossary .

		But on the whole , this is a very commendable book .

		Miss Hapgood , by knowing the language and going without guides , improved the opportunity , during a two-years residence in
Russia	LOCATION	, of coming to a direct knowledge of the people and of the country , and she has given expression to these experiences in a bright femininely written account .

		Certain surface aspects of Russian life are pleasantly and truthfully treated , and if this was the aim of the book it is certainly a success .

		If Miss Hapgood gives us the brighter side of Russian life , Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	, in '' The Borderland of Czar and
Kaiser	PERSON	, '' emphasizes the darker side .

		To Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	,
Russia	LOCATION	is a '' sad gray land , '' a '' mourn - ful empire , '' where the unmitigated political despot - ism of the czar and his officials , the religious despot - ism of a fanatical priesthood , and the financial des - potism of the avaricious Jew , make life not worth the living .

		Further , he regards the peasantry as a hopeless race of dull and shiftless drunkards .

		The book is mostly made up of a series of conversations with chance acquaintances .

		But Mr.
Bigelow	PERSON	in this way gets too much at second-hand to make his work either very reliable or interesting .

		His studies are not independent , unbiassed , first-hand impres - sions , and seem hardly candid or thorough .

		In these respects , however , his remarks on
Germany	LOCATION	are more satisfactory than the Russian sketches .

		Most if not all of the material has previously ap - peared in ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		The book is clev - erly illustrated by Mr.
Frederic Remington	PERSON	.

		In '' The
Great Dominion	ORGANIZATION	, '' Mr.
Parkin	PERSON	has given us a good book of information , provided with ex - cellent maps , and of especial interest to the intend - ing settler or investor .

		It is for the most part a reprint of letters to the ''
London	LOCATION	Times , '' and takes on the whole a very optimistic view of
Canada	LOCATION	as a British possession .

		He regards the annexation movement as practically dead . ''

		In
1892	DATE	, some remnant of this feeling could yet be discovered ; in
1894	DATE	it was gone .

		The unparalleled wave of business depression which swept over the
United States	LOCATION	during the interval ; the spectacle of Coxeyite armies of the unemployed moving on
Washington	LOCATION	; of
Atlantic	LOCATION	steamboats crowded with emigrants returning from the
United States	LOCATION	; of industry paralyzed by strikes which divided authority made it difficult to repress , all made Canadians more conscious than they had ever been before of the serious social and political problems which their neighbours have to confront .

		The fact that
Canada	LOCATION	's industrial condition was meanwhile scarcely affected , emphasized the advantages of her independent position on the continent . ''

		The
Great Canadian Northwest	ORGANIZATION	is rapidly filling up with desirable immigrants .

		There are now ten thousand Icelanders in
Manitoba	LOCATION	.

		Further , there is a considerable immigration from the
United States	LOCATION	, especially from
Dakota	LOCATION	,
Nebraska	LOCATION	, and
Washington	LOCATION	.

		This , however , is more than offset by the emigration of French Canadians into '' the States , '' though Mr.
Parkin	PERSON	regards
M. Louis Frech	PERSON	- ette 's estimate , in '' The Forum , '' of eleven to twelve hundred thousand Canadians now resident in the
United States	LOCATION	, as `` much exaggerated . ''

		Yet I find that the census returns show over one million immi - grants into this country from
Canada	LOCATION	during the
last thirty years	DATE	, and it must be apparent that
Frechette	PERSON	's is rather an under estimate .

		Moreover , the French Canadian is enormously prolific .

		On this point , Mr.
Parkin	PERSON	himself says : '' Three or four years ago the government of the province , reverting to the policy of the French Kings in the early days of Canadian colonization , instituted a system of premiums on large families , by offering to give a grant of a hundred acres of land to all heads of families who had twelve or more children .

		This grant has already been made in nearly
2000	DATE	cases , and appli - cations are said to be flowing in .

		Families of twenty children are common ; families of twenty-five or more are not unknown . ''

		Mr.
Parkin	PERSON	emphasizes the perfect security to life and property in Canadian frontier life as a contrast to the lawlessness so often displayed in the Western life of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		However , he says noth - ing about the Indian difficulties in the
Canadian Northwest	ORGANIZATION	, nor does he even refer to the Indian problem at all .

		Dr.
Henry M. Field	PERSON	, the veteran traveller and writer of travels , in his last book , '' Our Western Archipelago , '' gives an account of an Alaskan trip .

		However , less than seventy pages of the two hundred and fifty are concerned with
Alaska	LOCATION	, the rest being a description of the outward trip by the
Canadian Pacific Railway	ORGANIZATION	, and the journey back by way of the
Northern Pacific	ORGANIZATION	and through Yellow - stone Park .

		These familiar letters of travel con - 146 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, tain little that is new , or of great interest .

		The style is rather diffuse and garrulous , although some - times the garrulity may be even attractive , as in Chapters V. and VI .

		In the opening of Chapter XXIII .

		is a suggestive account of a bear who do - mesticated himself at a Yellowstone Park hotel as readily as a sparrow ; and we quote this account as an example of Mr.
Field	PERSON	's method of descrip - tion : '' He was not an old acquaintance , as he had come from the woods only a week or two before , but was of such a domestic turn of mind that he made himself at home anywhere , whether ` under the greenwood tree , ' or under a house or barn .

		But in coming to abide with men he did not submit to be a servant under bondage , to be confined in a cage or held by a chain ; but was a free and independent citizen , free in all his goings out and comings in , as if he took the place of a faithful old servitor , who has earned the right to have his own way ; to have the run of the kitchen , or what was thrown out from it ; and in all respects to live as a pensioner of the family .

		... I was curious to see this addition to the family , and asked Where is he ? '

		with vague suspicions that he might be a myth .

		But ' No , no , ' said the inn - keeper ; by and by he will make his appearance .

		Per - haps he is here now . '

		With that he went about the house , looking underneath it , till suddenly he exclaimed , ' Why , there he is . '

		I was down on my knees in an in - stant , and sure enough , right under the floor , indeed , under my very feet , where I had been writing , was what might be a bear or a buffalo .

		The next thing was to stir him up , and make him show himself .

		The master of the house tried to poke him with a stick , but had not one long enough .

		Then he threw stones at him .

		But the thick brown hair was proof against stones , and the burly old creature slept on with proper contempt of the pygmies that were trying to disturb his repose .

		I con - fess , I rather respected him for his royal indifference to his puny assailants .

		The landlord apologized for his want of deference to his visitors , but explained it thus : ' The old fellow takes his time about everything .

		He has probably been off in the woods to visit his family , to see Mrs. Bear and his children or grandchildren , and is now a little tired .

		By and by he will wake up and feel hungry , and then he will come round to the door for his breakfast , which he will take from our hands as if he were a
Newfoundland	LOCATION	dog . ' ''

		Dr. Field 's pleasant , easy-going , optimistic person - ality permeates the whole hook .

		He was accom - panied by his niece , and his references to her are hardly in taste in a book designed for the general reader .

		Thus , '' Oh , dear , oh , dear , my poor little chicken , that was hardly out of the hen-coop , '' etc. .

		-LRB- p. 235 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Field	PERSON	's remarks regarding his friends are apt to he rather fulsome ; as , for instance , in regard to Lord Dufferin and Mr.
Harper	PERSON	-LRB- pp. 21 , 25 -RRB- .

		The book is illustrated with process cuts , and is provided with a map .

		The first volume of Mr.
Henry M. Stanley	PERSON	's la - test work , '' My Early Travels and Adventures in
America	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	, '' is a series of letters , which , as he himself acknowledges , '' were not written with a view to permanent publication , but for the exacting and imperious necessities of American newspapers , principally for ` The
Missouri	LOCATION	Democrat ' of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, and a
New York	LOCATION	paper . ''

		As special corre - spondent , Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	accompanied General Han - cock , and , later ,
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	, in expeditions against the Indians ; and he narrates in vigorous and terse style many incidents of Indian and fron - tier life .

		The book throbs with the wild and pro- gressive spirit of the sixties in
Kansas	LOCATION	,
Nebraska	LOCATION	, and
Colorado	LOCATION	, and will be found very interesting by all who have had any experience of pioneer life .

		The story of the
Plum Creek Massacre	ORGANIZATION	is particu - larly vivid .

		Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	's description of the buffalo is quotable : '' Until to-day we were not prepared to accept all the statements we heard about the numbers of buffalo on the plains , for prairie folk are like sailors , fond of em - bellishing the truth .

		When we were told that the prai - rie has been so packed with them that one might walk on their backs for ten miles , we set it down to the nar - rator 's desire to express a countless number , rather than as a literal fact .

		When they swore that , not many years ago , military expeditions were compelled to mow a pas - sage through them with grape shot from their howit - zers , we thought they were taking advantage of the credulity of youth , and inwardly lamented their de - pravity .

		We are becoming wiser every day , however .

		We think of all the bales of buffalo robes annually ex - ported East , of the many thousands of hides required by the 150,000 Indians of the plains for their wigwams , of the thousands of robes in use among the military and civilians out West ; and we are not so skeptical as formerly .

		We have seen many herds at various times , but to-day we had the pleasure of seeing ten great herds , of about a thousand head each , guarded by their sentries and videttes , which suspiciously watched our advance , and continually snorted the alarm to the re - spective hosts .

		It was to me a thrilling sight . ''

		Occasionally these letters show defective editing , thus -LRB- p. 157 -RRB- , a '' first letter '' is referred to , which nowhere appears .

		And again -LRB- p. 160 -RRB- , there is a hiatus after '' when it had gathered . ''

		If most of the official speeches and all the official letters and inventories -LRB- as on pp. 45 , 135 , 229 -RRB- , and all other matter of historical value , but of no interest to the general reader , had been relegated to an appendix , and the remaining matter were disconnected from the epistolary form and chronological order , and thrown by subjects into chapters , we would have a very interesting book .

		As it is , the reader must do some judicious skipping , which is always vexatious .

		Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	's second volume contains newspaper letters on the inauguration of the
Suez Canal	ORGANIZATION	, on a Nile trip , on explorations in
Jerusalem	LOCATION	, and on a journey to
Persia	LOCATION	.

		Some of this material may have a historical value , but to the general reader much in these reports will appear dry and perfunctory .

		Some portions of the Persian journey may be read with interest , particularly the visit to
Teheran	LOCATION	.

		However , most of the topics discussed have been much more fully and better treated by other writers .

		In short , we do not think this book will much en - hance Mr.
Stanley	PERSON	's reputation .

		He has given us the scrapings from his barrel , and we find them little satisfying .


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 147 BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		A sensible book The misgiving with which we natur - about
America	LOCATION	, ally take up a book about the
United	ORGANIZATION	by a Frenchwoman .

		g tategj written by ft f ore i gne r after a few months ' sojourn in the country , is soon dis - pelled after opening the pages of
Madame Blanc	ORGANIZATION	's -LRB- Th .

		Bentzon -RRB- '' The Condition of Woman in the
United States	LOCATION	, '' in Miss
Alger	PERSON	's excellent transla - tion -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The accomplished author has wisely added the modest sub-title , '' A Traveller 's Notes , '' thus saving the reader all disappointment at a some - what careless composition , or rather disposition of the material , for the style is all that could be de - sired .

		Less stimulating to thought than more pre - tentious publications of this class by writers with whom philosophizing is more of a profession , Mme.
Blanc	PERSON	's chapters appeal rather to the emotions , and will be read with satisfaction and profit by those not very familiar with the amount of good done in this country by individual women and women 's or - ganizations .

		For the interest of the book centres in its subject , not in its foreign authorship , though the latter frequently heightens the relief in which things appear .

		The vivid accounts of repeated visits to
Hull House	ORGANIZATION	, for example , can not fail to awaken the strongest sympathy for
Miss Addams	ORGANIZATION	's noble work .

		So with regard to other institutions in the
West	LOCATION	and in the
East	LOCATION	.

		The generous hos - pitality enjoyed by the French visitor at the homes of so many distinguished women in the land has not , it seems to us , betrayed her into any indiscre - tions , though modesty might have prevented some of her hostesses from too positively sanctioning all of her statements .

		Neither , do we believe , will sensible Americans take umbrage at some instances of candid and good-natured disapproval , out-bal - anced as they are by the author 's unrestrained ad - miration for what is good and beautiful .

		Individ - ual readers will no doubt occasionally differ with Mme.
Blanc	PERSON	in matters of judgment and opinion , but her book will give rise to no bitterness of feel - ing .

		Miss
Alger	PERSON	contributes to the volume a brief biographical sketch of the author , and a strikingly good half-tone portrait of the latter is inserted as frontispiece .

		The remarkable The ^ e ^ the remarkable Russian life-story of a woman ,
Sonya Kovalevsky	PERSON	, who died Russian woman .

		f -LRB- mr yearg ago ftt S tockho -RSB- mi ig Qne of very uncommon interest .

		At the age of twenty - four she had received a doctor 's degree from the
University of Gottingen	ORGANIZATION	; at thirty-one she was made a privat-docent by the
University of Stockholm	ORGANIZATION	, and three years later a professor of mathematics -LRB- one of the most distinguished of the
University	ORGANIZATION	's posi - tions -RRB- , thus sweeping away the traditions , preju - dices , and customs of centuries .

		This appointment , made when the universities of
Germany	LOCATION	would not even consider the question of permitting women to study in them , made a marked sensation in the learned world .

		Still another sensation was produced when it was discovered that she was the winner of the greatest scientific honor ever gained by a woman , one of the greatest , indeed , to which anyone can aspire , the
Bordin	PERSON	prize from the French Aca - demy of Science .

		The jury of the Academy made the award in entire ignorance that the winner was a woman , though it doubled the prize -LRB- making it five thousand francs -RRB- on account of the '' quite ex - traordinary service rendered to mathematical phy - sics by this work . ''

		These brilliant achievements were terminated by
Sonya Kovalevsky	PERSON	's death , at the early age of forty-one .

		The event called out remarkable manifestations of sympathy and appre - ciation .

		Telegrams of condolence poured in from nearly all parts of the civilized world ; cartloads of flowers were heaped upon her grave ; Russian women resolved to erect a monument on her tomb at Stock - holm .

		Yet
Sonya Kovalevsky	PERSON	was the last woman to be satisfied with being regarded simply as a kind of mental giant , a woman with an unusually developed brain .

		Her emotional nature the hunger of the heart for loving and for being loved was as strongly marked as her intellectual development .

		There was thus in her life a sort of double nature , at war with itself ; and the story of this life is one of fascinating , almost tragic , interest .

		She was never happy , even when most honored .

		Near the close of her life she wrote : '' It is a great misfortune to have a talent for science especially for a woman , who is forcibly drawn into a sphere of action where she can not find happiness . ''

		She considered her life a failure , and said : '' Some other human being must have received the part of happiness that I longed for and dreamed of . ''

		This unusual and engross - ing life story in part autobiographical has been simultaneously published by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	and by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, the first-named using the translation from the Russian made by Miss Isa - bel F. Hapgood , and the latter the translation from the Swedish made by
Louise Von Cossel	ORGANIZATION	.

		The fifth volume of the new edition of .

		Poe ' s Complete Works -LRB-
Stone & Kimball	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is noteworthy for its reprint of '' The Journal of
Julius Rodman	PERSON	, '' not before included in any collection of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's tales .

		This sketch of adventure along the shores of the
Missouri	LOCATION	seems almost to have been written to show what the romancer could not do : its incident is meagre , char - acterization is entirely lacking , and the style itself is hardly to be recognized .

		The real inspiration of the story was doubtless the unpleasant necessity of eating .

		In this volume of the series , and its pre - decessor , the promised notes begin to appear .

		The chronological list of the tales will be gladly con - sulted by all students of them .

		An equal amount of research has been devoted to showing that
Poe	PERSON	borrowed his quotations at second-hand , and para - phrased much of his material in geography and natural history from extant scientific works .

		The value of such scholarship is more questionable .

		It is as if the editor had determined that this luxurious 148 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, edition , with its special paper , its portraits , its sym - pathetic illustrations , should not delude the public into too favorable opinion of the author .

		Editoral criticism nowadays is not depreciative .

		Imagine an edition of
Longfellow	LOCATION	which should set itself the task of indicating that poet 's frequent obligation to his sources !

		But
Poe	PERSON	, since the days of
Griswold	ORGANIZATION	, has been doomed to have his fame reduced to its lowest terms .

		Fortunately , the most scathing re - buke can not invalidate the genius of the man who is to-day the commonplace of the literary conver - sation of Frenchmen with Americans , and whose poems were esteemed by
Dante Rossetti	PERSON	along with
Tennyson 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		_ Mr.
Frederic Remington	PERSON	's '' Pony Tracks '' -LRB- Har P er -RRB- embraces fif ^ en sketches , the drift of which is indi - cated by such titles as '' Lieutenant Casey 's Last Scout , '' '' A Rodeo at
Los Ojos	LOCATION	, '' '' Coaching In
Chihuahua	LOCATION	, '' '' Policing the Yellowstone , '' '' A Merry Christmas in a Sibley Tepee , '' etc. .

		Little need be said of Mr.
Remington	PERSON	as a delineator of Far Western life and types .

		His studies , descriptive and pictorial , of the `` Cow-puncher , '' the `` Grea - ser , '' the post soldier , etc. , are inimitable in their way , and the present work contains some of the best things he has given us .

		The volume is a hand - some one , and the seventy odd drawings are done in the author 's usual spirited , if somewhat over - literal , style .

		We have spoken before of the com - ical Muybridge effects of Mr.
Remington	PERSON	's more miraculous horses .

		Safe advice `` The Choice of Books , '' by
Charles	PERSON	about books
F. Richardson	PERSON	-LRB-
Lovell , Coryell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is one of those curious produc - tions that seem the result of spontaneous genera - tion .

		No date of publishing is given , no hint of copyright , no preface , no information concerning the author , beyond his name ; while the contents have come together mostly from other publications .

		We believe that the book was originally published about fifteen years ago , by an author who has since that time given us some more original work .

		If such be the case , the book may have a certain right to its title , which , if it were a more recent produc - tion , would seem to belong to Mr.
Frederic Harri	PERSON	- son .

		Whether this be so or not , it might just as appropriately have been called `` A Choice from Books '' ; for , as is not uncommon nowadays , it con - sists almost entirely of quotations .

		Of the three chapters which we have particularly examined , one has a sixth original matter , one a fifth , one a fourth .

		In the two hundred pages we have one hundred and forty-seven extracts , of which about twenty are two pages or more in length , the others being shorter .

		`` In this chapter , '' remarks the author on page 27 -LRB- but the limitation was unnecessary -RRB- , '' I prefer to express my own conclusions principally in the words of mightier men . ''

		Such a practice has decided advantages to the reader : it is much easier to recog - nize a good passage than to write one , so the reader is surer of getting them .

		This volume , then , has in it a great deal that is interesting about books and reading , and may be confidently recommended to anyone who desires advice on the subject in hand .

		The cover presents a design having one book in the centre between three other books .

		From the inside it would appear that these other books must be re - spectively by
Noah Porter	PERSON	,
Hamerton	LOCATION	, and
Emerson	LOCATION	.

		Specimens of the humor of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		A fresh and very acceptable addi - tion to the '' Library of Humor '' se - ries -LRB- imported by Scribner -RRB- is the '' Humor of
Russia	LOCATION	, '' admirably translated by
E. L. Voynich	PERSON	, and furnished with an introduction by
S. Stepniak	PERSON	.

		The translator has aimed to give samples not only of the best , but of all , Russian humor ; hence her list includes , beside the masters , such names as
Glyeb	LOCATION	,
Nikolai	PERSON	,
V. Slyeptzov	PERSON	, and even Gorbounov .

		As
M. Stepniak	PERSON	observes , '' there is hardly a name worth mentioning that could be added to these . ''

		Among the selections are
Gogol	ORGANIZATION	's '' Marriage '' and `` A Madman 's Diary , ''
Shchedrln	PERSON	's -LRB- Saltykov -RRB- '' The Self-Sacrificing Rabbit , '' Dostoyevsky 's '' The Crocodile , '' Gorboun6v 's '' La Traviata , '' and Step - niak 's delightful '' Story of a Kopeck . ''

		The book sparkles from end to end with good things , and the collection is fairly representative .

		BRIEFER MENTION .


Richard Whately	PERSON	wrote his '' Historic Doubts Rela - tive to
Napoleon Buonaparte	PERSON	'' -LRB- now reprinted by Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- in
1819	DATE	, to show that theories of evi - dence like those
Hume	PERSON	developed in his '' Essay on Miracles '' break down in quite a ridiculous fashion when applied even to well-known historical facts , and conse - quently are not to be trusted in the criticism of the Scripture narratives .

		As a controversial tract belong - ing to the
first quarter of the century	DATE	, its reputation for acuteness need not suffer .

		Its interest is , however , purely historical , because its argument has no point in the controversy about more recent methods of criticism .

		It is not often that a railroad company , desirous of providing a seductive handbook for travellers over its tracks , presses into its service so distinguished a man of letters as Professor
Charles G. D. Roberts	PERSON	.

		This , however , is what has been done by the Dominion At - lantic Railway of
Nova Scotia	LOCATION	, and the resulting book , called '' The Land of Evangeline , '' is equally good read - ing , whether one travels in
Acadia	LOCATION	or remains at home .

		It is prettily printed and illustrated , and , we presume , distributed free of charge by the company that issues it .

		It is a little curious that the sprightly Frenchwoman who writes under the name of '' Gyp '' should not have found favor with English translators .

		Her bright and entertaining stories of up-to-date society have a consid - erable degree of literary merit , and are exceptionally readable .

		One of the best of them , '' Le Mariage de Chiffon , '' recently published in the `` Revue de
Paris	LOCATION	, `` has , however , just found not one translator , but two Mr.
Henri Pene du Bois	PERSON	, who calls his version `` A Gallic Girl '' -LRB-
Brentano	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- ; and ''
M. L. J.	PERSON	, '' whose translation is more
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 149 literally styled '' Chiffon 's Marriage '' -LRB-
Lovell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Both books are neatly and attractively made .

		A recent issue of '' Sound Currency '' reprints from Mr.
W. A. Shaw	PERSON	's '' History of Currency '' the chapter which discusses bimetallism in
France	LOCATION	, remarking that '' of all the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	artillery that has been used by our friends of the
Bimetallic League	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- alias
U. S.	PERSON	silver mine owners -RRB- , none has done better service than the alleged experience of
France	LOCATION	. ''

		Of course , every well-informed student of finance knows that
France	LOCATION	never had bi - metallism in the sense of concurrent circulation of the two metals .

		The superstition is a hard one to kill , and '' Sound Currency '' provides some effective ammuni - tion , while its gun is not of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	sort .

		The semi - monthly pamphlets of which this is one are doing ex - cellent service in the cause of honest money , and friends of that cause will do well to aid in their circulation .

		They are issued by the
Sound Currency Committee	ORGANIZATION	of the
New York Reform Club	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Maid Marian '' and ''
Crotchet Castle	PERSON	, '' combined in a single volume of the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	series of old-fashioned fiction reprinted , will be welcome to all existing Pea - cockians , and will probably bring some new members to that select guild .

		The introduction to this volume is by Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	, who has recently discov - ered in Marmontel 's '' Contes Moraux '' what he believes to be the model that
Peacock	PERSON	had in view when he wrote ''
Headlong Hall	PERSON	, '' and who has thus brought the whole Peacockian series of tales into at least a shadowy connection with the literature of that period .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	is at work upon a biography of
Lockhart	LOCATION	.

		The value of
Huxley	LOCATION	's estate is a little less than nine thousand pounds .

		Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons have just added ''
Leighton Court	PERSON	'' to their edition of the novels of
Henry Kingsley	PERSON	. ''

		Hypatia '' is the first volume of a new '' pocket '' edition of
Charles Kingsley	PERSON	's novels , published by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The publications of the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	will hereafter be issued in
England	LOCATION	by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who succeed Mr.
T. Fisher Unwin	PERSON	in the agency . ''

		Richard III . ''

		and ''
Henry V.	PERSON	, '' the newest volumes of the '' Temple '' Shakespeare -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , delight the sense no less than have done their many predecessors .

		The long looked for `` Letters of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, '' as also the '' Letters of
Edward Fitzgerald	PERSON	to
Fanny Kemble	PERSON	, '' are promised for the present month by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Holger Drachmann	PERSON	, the Danish novelist and poet , a sketch of whose life and work appears in this issue of THE DIAL , is shortly to be introduced to American readers by a translation of one of the best and most characteristic of his shorter stories ''
Paul	PERSON	and Vir - ginia of a Northern Zone , '' to be published by
Messrs. Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	.

		The
International Congress of Journalists	ORGANIZATION	, now -LRB- Sep - tember 13-17 -RRB- in session at
Bordeaux	LOCATION	, is particularly occupied with discussing the desirability of a
Bureau Central des Associations de Presse	ORGANIZATION	, '' for the purpose of establishing friendly feelings and common action be - tween them in regard to all purely professional ques - tions , irrespective of creeds , political opinions , races , and nationalities . ''

		The
Hakluyt Society	ORGANIZATION	will issue almost immediately a volume from the pen of its president , Mr.
Clements R. Markham	PERSON	,
C.B.	LOCATION	, consisting of a translation of the journal kept by
Pedro Sarmiento	PERSON	during his voyage to
Magel	PERSON	- lan 's strait in 1579-80 , supplemented by documents procured from the archives at
Madrid	LOCATION	.

		Another of the
Society	ORGANIZATION	's volumes , which , under the joint care of Mr.
C. A. Gosch	PERSON	and Mr.
Miller Christy	PERSON	, deals with the Arctic voyages of
Jens Munk	PERSON	and
James Hall	PERSON	, is in the press , and may be expected shortly ; while a commence - ment has also been made with the printing of Dr.
Robert Brown	PERSON	's edition of the '' Travels of
Leo Africanus	PERSON	. ''

		A meritorious bit of bibliographical work is the '' Bib - liografia di
Pompei	PERSON	,
Ercolano	PERSON	e Stahia , '' by
M. Friedrich Furchheim	PERSON	.

		It presents with great exactness the titles of the works , both large and small , that have been written about the buried cities of
Campania	LOCATION	, dealing with the popular as well as the scientific side .

		More than five hundred titles are given , in one hundred and sixteen attractively printed pages ; and there is an in - troduction of fifteen pages -LRB- in Italian -RRB- , giving a general survey of the literature .

		It is announced that a simi - lar bibliography covering Vesuvius ,
Capri	LOCATION	, and other points of interest about the Bay of
Naples	LOCATION	, is in prepara - tion .

		-LRB-
Naples	LOCATION	:

		The '' Baconian craze '' can hardly be said to be ex - tinct , since three new books inspired by it are announced two of them by lawyers : Mr.
T. S. E. Dixon	PERSON	of Chi - cago -LRB- ''
Francis Bacon	PERSON	and his Shakespeare , '' The
Sar	ORGANIZATION	- gent
Publishing Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and the other by Judge
Stotsen	PERSON	- berg of
Indianapolis	LOCATION	.

		The third is a recent German work , a translation of which is promised by Mr.
Henry Brett	PERSON	.

		The aim of Mr.
Dixon	PERSON	's work is stated to be '' to present , in a critical exposition , the data -LRB- almost wholly new -RRB- whose consideration has convinced him of
Bacon	LOCATION	's authorship of the plays .

		The hypothesis is also given a crucial test in a novel and striking interpreta - tion of the play of '
Julius Csesar	PERSON	, ' under the illumina - tion afforded by
Bacon	PERSON	's acknowledged writings . ''

		The speech made by Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	at
Ashfield	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, about three weeks ago , attracted much attention by its outspoken strictures upon popu - lar education in this country .

		We reproduce the most significant passage of the address : `` We speak of popu - lar education as the foundation of republican institu - tions , and so , indeed , it is .

		But when we boast that it exists in
America	LOCATION	we delude ourselves .

		We have indeed a very imperfect system of popular education , but of true education of the people there is not enough to guar - antee the prosperity of the republic .

		The minds of the mass of Americans are still in a prehistoric , or at least in a mediaeval stage .

		It is folly to call a com - munity educated in which such an organization as the
A. P. A.	PERSON	can spread widely .

		Its members have not learned the first , the simplest lesson of good citizenship .

		The records of our recent
Legislatures	ORGANIZATION	, the records of both houses of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, give evidence that a very large proportion of their members have no claim to be recog - nized as educated men .

		The great body of our news - papers in every part of the land not merely display , but contribute to , the lack of education of the community .

		The speeches and the acts of many of our most promi - nent men , public men , men who have had every advan - tage that school and college can afford , give proof that their authors belong among the uneducated or the mis - educated . ''

		THE DIAL , -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, ANNOUNCEMENTS OF FALL , BOOKS .

		In accordance with our established custom , we pre - sent herewith our annual list of the more important books to be issued during the Fall season by American publishers .

		The list contains nearly seven hundred titles , and represents forty-two publishers ; the largest number of entries for one house is over a hundred , and the smallest is one , the average being about seventeen .

		The unusual size of the list makes it necessary to ex - clude juvenile books , the most of which appear rather late in the season , and the announcement of which is of minor literary interest .

		In all other departments , how - ever , the list is believed to be full and representative .

		The proper classification into departments is of course the difficult part , and it is made doubly difficult by the inadequate or misleading information sometimes sup - plied .

		Books that have not yet been received by THE DIAL , and hence that have not yet appeared in its regu - lar printed List of New Books , are included among the books announced , although in some cases the books may have been actually issued by the time this list is pub - lished .

		The books in the list are presumably all new new editions not being included unless having new form or matter .

		Some analysis of the list , and com - ments upon its more interesting features , may be found in the leading editorial article of this issue .

		The recent revival of interest among American and English readers in the novels and romances of
Dumas	PERSON	and
Balzac	LOCATION	is rapidly extending to their contemporary , the gifted genius who styled herself George Sand .

		Although no complete edition of her books in English has ever appeared , their number perhaps precluding it , many of them have been trans - lated into English and have had a wide circulation .

		The best of these the masterpieces of George Sand are the books here described .

		With one exception they deal with nature , with country life , with the French peasant ; and
George Sand	PERSON	's transcendent genius in all these has never been rivalled by any of the authors of her land or time .

Hoffman	PERSON	, one of the most successful workers in the field of American ethnology , presents the first steps in the development of writing from tangible reminders like quipus and wampum belts , through picture writing to phonetic writing with an alphabet .

		These first steps are described especially as they are shown among North American tribes .

		Our native peoples made much use of reminders ; they drew truly expressive pictures ; they developed complicated systems of pic - tography ; and some peoples of
Mexico	LOCATION	and
Central America	LOCATION	were pass - ing from the use of idiograms to phonograms .

		This transition period is most interesting .

		It is believed that this work will supply a special want .

		There is no subject taught in the elementary scho'ols that taxes the teacher 's re - sources as to methods and devices to a greater extent than arithmetic , and none that is more dangerous to the pupil in the way of deadening his mind and arresting its development , if bad methods are used .

		The authors of this book have presented in an admirable manner the psy - chological view of number , and shown its applications to the correct methods of teaching the several arithmetical processes .

		12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		This original and dramatic story presents fresh types , extraordinary situations , and novel suggestions with a freshness and vigor which show that the romancer 's heart was in his work .

		How far certain incidents of the story are based upon personal experiences it is impossible to say , but the unflagging interest and unexpected phases of the romance are no less in evidence than the close personal relations established between author and reader .

		THE MOTTOES AND COMMENTARIES OF
FRIEDRICH FROEBEL	PERSON	'S MOTHER PLAY .

		`` Mother Communings and Mottoes '' rendered into English Verse by

		12mo , cloth ,
$ 1.50	MONEY	.

		The increased interest in kindergarten work and the demand for a clearer exposition of
Froebel	ORGANIZATION	's philosophy than has heretofore appeared have made a new version of the '' Mother Play '' an imperative neces - sity .

		No one is better equipped for such a work than Miss Blow , as her late book , '' Symbolic Education , '' has attested .

		In the '' Mottoes and Commentaries '' the original pictures have been faithfully reproduced , except where bad drawing rendered slight changes necessary .

		It is an attractive volume of a convenient size , and a book of specific value to mothers as well as to teachers of every grade .

		It will be followed shortly by another volume containing the songs and games .

		He that so often bade us smile , What later whim hath bid us weep ?

		Or was it some new jest , that while He jested he should fall asleep ?

		His mirth , we now remember , stood Next neighbor always to regret .

		Responding to his merriest mood , We often found our lashes wet .

		With courtly quip , and kindly scoff , And laughter never long or loud , His fun was not the common stuff , His fancy fooled not for the crowd ; But , Humor 's mild aristocrat , He bowed him through these busy days , Half wondering what the world was at , And shrewdly smoothing it with praise .

		And now he lives but in his page , Where wit and wisdom are comprised , The gentlest breeding of the age Most graciously epitomized .


CHARLES G. D. ROBERTS	PERSON	.

		THE ITALIAN NOVEL OF THE YEAR .

		One of the foremost books of the year in
Italy	LOCATION	, , and certainly the foremost novel , has been
Girolamo Rovetta	PERSON	's '' La Baraonda . ''

		Signer
Rovetta	PERSON	has been held , for some time , to be one of the cleverest of the Verists ; but he has done nothing which has met with the amount of attention bestowed on '' La Baraonda . ''

		There are particular reasons for this - The novel is entertaining as literature , but it is also striking as an epitome of the precise social , political , and moral crisis through which
Italy	LOCATION	is now pass - ing .

		One may go further , and say that Signer Ro - vetta 's book gives the measure of a crisis in the evo - lution of the whole Latin race a crisis than which it has known none more serious .

		This means much ; and it explains the mark which the book has made r and the fact that thoughtful minds should have oc - cupied themselves so much with it .

		`` Baraonda '' is an untranslatable word .

		It is nearer in meaning to the French '' Debacle '' than to any work that we have in English .

		It signifies a crumbling to pieces , a going down , a breaking up , a foundering .

		The main motif of
Signer Rovetta	PERSON	's novel is the career of one Cantasirena , formerly friend and associate of
Giuseppe Garibaldi	PERSON	in the liberation of
Italy	LOCATION	, and now become , by a gradual 170 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, descent through devious ways , a bombastic , melli - fluent , tireless , and an utterly unscrupulous promoter of bubble companies .

		This character is a type , a creation .

		It is drawn with a masterly hand .

		Can - tasirena has a niece , who has beauty and a voice , and whose moral sense is about what might be ex - pected from the precepts and practices current in the household where she has been brought up , where friends under one pretext or another are dexter - ously relieved of ten-franc notes to pay waiting cabs .

		Acquaintances and strangers are manipulated for loans that are never paid back , and the air is per - petually filled either with the infuriated denuncia - tions of ancient dupes , or the orotund discourses of the great Canasirena drawing new ones into the nets of countless associations and societies that
spring	DATE	into being , fully organized , from hour to hour , in his fertile brain .

		The niece succeeds in marrying the
Duke of Casalbara	ORGANIZATION	, an elderly viveur , but the possessor of an ancient name and of untarnished reputation and honor .

		The end is to be expected .

		The '' Zio Matteo '' uses the Casalbara influence to float a wild-cat scheme on a gigantic scale , the gov - ernment lends its support , and we have the whole tragi-comedy of the
Panama	LOCATION	scandals , and of the
Giolitti	PERSON	and
Banca Romana	ORGANIZATION	infamies , unrolled be - fore us .


Signor Rovetta	PERSON	wastes no time in pointing morals ; but he goes his way , and says his say , with a cynical frankness that drives the nail in to the head .

		The book must indeed be a sad one to that generation of Italians who , high hopes and lofty enthusiasms burning in their souls , gathered about the noble spirits that fought with their blood , and toiled with their brain , for a
United Italy	LOCATION	.

		Where is the pure and ardent patriotism , where is the devotion to the most unselfish ideals , of
Mazzini	LOCATION	,
Garibaldi	LOCATION	,
Cavour	PERSON	?

		What has become of these things , through which
Italy	LOCATION	was united , in the
Italy	LOCATION	of to-day ?


Signor Rovetta	PERSON	has allowed them to survive in one charac - ter of his latest book , that of the old soldier who , hav - ing lost his leg in the Garibaldian wars , now stumps it on a wooden one , but whose faith has never dimmed ; who lives on in the service of the unspeak - able rascal and charlatan
Cantasirena	LOCATION	, in candid ignorance and innocence of all that passes beneath his eyes , still ingenuously and heroically glazing in that great past ware of exalted patriotism , which to
Cantasirena	ORGANIZATION	is a magniloquent catch-word to entice victims mad with the desire to get rich , and faith - fully , from the bottom of his honest heart , crying '' Viva 1 ` Italia ! ''

		in response to that individual 's sonorous harangues .

		One grows fond of the old sol - dier .

		What has been debased into a cloak for every humbuggery and corruption in others is still a great and disinterested sentiment to his simple soul .

		He alone purifies a little the atmosphere in which Sig - nor
Rovetta	PERSON	's knaves and fools and dupes and trick - sters move and have their vulgar and sordid being .

		It has been said that '' La Baraonda '' derives its value from the accuracy with which it has caught the social , economical , and political phase through which modern
Italy	LOCATION	is now passing ; through which , in a wider sense , the whole Latin race is now passing .

		No one who has studied the two countries can fail to have been struck with the similarity of social phenom - ena there occurring .

		The
Panama	LOCATION	and
Giolitti	PERSON	scan - dals did not come so near together for nothing .

		They are symptoms of deep-lying causes .

		The pressure of the new industrial conditions , the money-fever that has spread over the world with the enormous extension that commercial enterprise has taken on , are having an effect upon the Latin peoples which presents some very curious aspects .

		It may be said , roughly generalizing a very complex consensus of phenomena , that money looked upon in the posi - tion which it has and as the power which it is in modern life and the Latin genius , are incompat - ible entities .

		Modern industrialism , in its essence , tends to create material needs in the individual , that it may supply them .

		That is its whole process .

		The race which develops these needs in the greatest number , and is most dependent upon their gratifi - cation , is the Anglo-Saxon .

		The uses to which the Englishman , left entirely to himself , puts wealth , and the uses to which the Italian , or Frenchman , also quite uninfluenced , would naturally put it , are different from the root up .

		The conception of lux - ury , in the Latin race , has never been separated from aesthetic conceptions .

		Money has meant art , in some form or other ; in different words , it has the satisfaction of a certain inborn desire for that sort of grace-harmony in the surroundings which affects the spirit rather than the flesh .

		There is no denying that we of the English-speaking race are more materialistic .

		Money means , to us , before it means anything else , bodily comforts : the com - forts under the guarding shield of which all the nat - ural processes of sleep , digestion , etc. , go on most easily and perfectly .

		Perhaps it has not been suf - ficiently considered how ethically dangerous such a view of comfort might become , if pushed to the ex - treme .

		However this may be , it has certainly acted , so far , upon the races with whom it is not indi - genous as a very perilous dissolvent and disinte - grator .

		Exacting in the aesthetic direction , the Latin peo - ples have hitherto been content with comparatively little materially .

		But now that the rage for ma - terial possessions has infected them , their more sen - sitively-responsive nervous organization has been led to exaggerate the desire into a sort of frenzy .

		They are not moving along a line natural to them , and they have lost their balance .

		There never was a sadder , a more ignominious , collapse of great dreams , noble ideals , than that which within this generation has befallen
Italy	LOCATION	.

		Its tottering financial condition has aided the causes just outlined to give impetus to a speculative mania that invades , in some shape , all classes of society .

		Bearers of historic names who formerly would have supported reduced circumstances in dignified retire - ment , secure in their station , and disdainful of ad - vantages of the sort that any parvenu possessed of
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 171 gold could purchase , now parting clandestinely with the treasures of priceless family collections to make a figure in the general display ; ministers lending the prestige of their official station to float rotten financial enterprises ; these are characters that many French and Italian novelists have rendered familiar to us .

		In '' La Baraonda '' we see how the '' little folk '' rush in likewise , how they invest their savings feverishly in any scheme whatever , regard - less of consequences .

		It has been said that this is a sad book .

		It is certainly one that awakens thought , and gives rise to many questions .

		What is the outcome of this crisis to be to
Italy	LOCATION	, to the Latin race in general ?

		Are we confronting one of those social cataclysms in which a race literally , so far as national cohe - siveness is concerned , crumbles away in the shock of contact with another race capable of adapting itself more easily and completely to the conditions of existence of the moment ?

		Or will there be pro- cesses of adjustment , the great agility and supple - ness of the Latin genius enabling it to take from the new conditions what it can digest , and to reject the rest ?

		No cultivated reader will lay down '' La Baraonda , '' with its keen observation , its photo - graphic characterization , without the sensation that it defines a critical situation , and is quite worthy of giving pause to the student of social manifestations .

		ALINE GORREX .

		THE DECADENCE OF A SCHOLAR .

		At the seventh unsuccessful application for a po - sition ,
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	lost heart .

		Professorships were no longer plums , ready to fall into the hands of him who had most conscientiously prepared himself .

		The fact was plain that since
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's departure for those subsequent hard years of study in Ger - many , conditions had arisen in his own country which involved a political idea .

		Public sentiment was against scepticism in any form ; it was not enough that one should be a quietist in his worship of unusual and Utopian theories : he must give as - surance that his study ran resolutely into the chan - nel of popular and conservative thought .

		In short , without any will of one 's own , truth , to be popular , must coincide with the dominant belief .

		Thomson knew that the truth for which he had labored was of no kin to the ideas in vogue .

		At first , this consciousness rather amused than troubled him .

		Recollections of German lecture-rooms were fresh , in whose atmosphere of catholicity and unbias the contraries of these qualities of mind were un - realities , hardly to be taken seriously .

		As time gradually opened to him the order of things in his native land , what he had at first termed provincial began to assume the royal value of sovereignty .

		The people , the popular will , above all the popular level , were factors which had had small place in his scientific vigils .

		German imperialism had lent its authority to her learned men of the universities .

		As in
France	LOCATION	, and to a less degree in
England	LOCATION	,
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	had followed others of his kind into un - questioning allegiance to authorities of the book .

		Here , all was changed .

		There seemed to be no authorities .

		Clear and independent conceptions the scientific point of view had been allowed a brief utterance , only to be silenced by ridicule and misappreciation .

		When
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	left for Ger - many five years before , the light shone bright ahead .

		He remembered standing , outward bound , on the prow of the great liner , the spray stinging his face as the Titanic iron wedge rose and ploughed into the sea .

		A break in the clouds let down the imprisoned silver light to flood the horizon . ''

		Is it not , '' he thought , '' pure science clear truth , that needs no guardian or embellishment which is to bring light to my land , where war has been , and ignorance , and all uncharitableness ? ''

		There could be no doubt .

		He would return with some message from wise and sober
Germany	LOCATION	.

		What a child-like dream !

		Politics recked not of truth or sobriety .

		The last letter from an edu - cational Power , announcing
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's unfitness for the position , contained these words : '' Whilst I have no doubt of your ability to lecture along cer - tain lines , the question of opinion , of political tim - bre , is of more importance to us than adroitness in special work .

		Indeed , I take the liberty of an older man , in advising you -LRB- who have your work to do here -RRB- that the people care very little for German training in your subject .

		Whether the fact is to be deplored or not , such training is rather a hindrance than a help to your influence and advancement . ''

		The friendship of the letter was unmistakable .

		Equally so was the tide in
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's affairs which bore him mute and helpless from his moorings .

		His old enemy , Popularity , met him at every turn , and he read in the kindly letter from the President a reflection of popular desire .

		At this scattering of
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's forces , he felt himself bound to lay hands on something that was fast in general esteem .

		As our ablest critic has said , ''
Philistia	LOCATION	has its aesthetic rituals and pageantry '' ; and
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	was drawn to them .

		Already the special workers , his old colleagues , seemed high priests of Phariseeism , and the careful cultures of remote and independent inquiry took on the form of curious exotics .

		His contributions to print ap - peared to belong to the poetry of science rather than to actual life .

		Then came the corollary , biting and poisonous to his self-esteem : that truth , for which he had renounced the world , and which was to make him free , lacked the first quality of truth uni - versal application .

		Doubt is a tragedy with some men ; it was with
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fast upon his years of firm resolve , of puritan training , of simple and reverent life , there crowded brutal moments of vulgarity .

		His friends made money .

		An old acquaintance , who never worried over truth or untruth , was high in political 172 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, life .

		His good-natured condescension to
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	had indeed caused the first serious conflict of ideas in the brain of the careful student .

		Whether right or wrong , this man , whom
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	had been wont to regard with little respect , had influence and power .

		He represented thousands of human beings .

		Thomson felt that his own clientele could be spelled by a capital Ego , or at best by a few others like himself .

		Herein lay the tragedy ; for he was hu - man , and selfishness to him was inhuman .

		It was at this point that he lost heart . ''

		After all , '' he said to his old university chum , '' can a man rise higher than his source ? ''

		and quickly denying the affirmation of his friend , ''
John Tyndall	PERSON	was sure of a response somewhere when he played the seer in his essay ' On the Scientific Use of the Im - agination . '

		Is there in all the land a want repre - sented by this work of mine ?

		The source of power desire is in myself alone ; that of the politician is the desires of others .

		I can not rid myself of the idea that the men who have stayed at home , even those of no training , as we say , know people , grasp these human conditions , are better men for the place , than you or I. '' '' It is for us to create new wants , '' said his friend . ''

		I am not so certain of that .

		A man should be the product of his time , and the days of the seer are numbered . ''

		u .

		A year went round , and the period of opportun - ity again arrived .

		It seemed to
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	that the twelve months had been worse than lost : he had not stood still , but had gone backward .

		Upon his table lay a pile of rejected
MSS	ORGANIZATION	.

		and unapplauded addresses .

		Science was indeed a stern mistress .

		The boy who used to blacken his boots rode by on a spirited horse .

		There were cards announcing the marriage of the Politician and the girl upon whom
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	had been dependent for an occasional word of good cheer .

		In the morning 's mail there was a letter from an old friend of his father 's . ''

		I have watched , '' the letter ran , ' ; your career with interest and some anxiety , knowing full well that prolonged study abroad would tend to unfit you for the practical work ahead .

		Your habits of quiet study and reserve , your intense application to the hidden labor of the lamp , are un-American and un - popular .

		There may come a time when our civil - ization will demand such sacrifices .

		To-day , how - ever , it is the man who knows not so much , maybe and who wears his knowledge broadly and with a smile , that finds his place and audience .

		Close your books ; go out among men ; meet the politi - cians , noting how they toil and spin and flourish .

		Above all , do not take yourself so seriously .

		Your theories may be true enough ; but only a sense of i p .

		humor can save you from too quixotic a service to them ... Let me say to you , in closing , that sooner or later a man must meet the people on their own terms .

		He must be of actual use to some community if he ask for its support . ''

		Thomson groaned . ''

		I pledged my word in Ger - many that I would teach nothing that I did not be - lieve to be the truth : and now , with
Pilate	ORGANIZATION	, must I ask , ` What is truth ' ? ''

		The bell rang , and a telegram was brought in .

		Thomson read : '' The professorship in Col - lege is vacant .

		Cultivate
Wilcox	PERSON	and you may get it . ''

		Signed by his own friend .


Wilcox	PERSON	was the Politician whose marriage was announced .

		He was not only a financial patron of the college ; he was a director of its policy , which was narrow and closely sectarian .

		How great was
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's fall when he did eventually '' cultivate '' this man , obtain the posi - tion , and sink by slow degrees to the level of his environment !

		He has been heard to say that as a people we were nearer truth in
Jefferson	LOCATION	's day than in the present year of grace .

		Whatever may be argued in
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's behalf , his decadence is now complete .

		He is a laudator temporis acti .

		Louis Pasteur was born
December 22 , 1822	DATE	, at
Dole	ORGANIZATION	, and died
September 28 , 1895	DATE	, in his suburban home near
Paris	LOCATION	.

		His death , which was not un - expected , came as the result of an apoplectic stroke , and was painless .

		He was not , like
Huxley	LOCATION	,
Tyn	PERSON	- dall , and
Helmholtz	PERSON	to name the greatest men whom science has lost of late a writer of books that were known to the general public ; but his sci - entific work was widely familiar , and popular report can hardly have over-estimated its value to man - kind .

		We think of him first and foremost as a bac - teriologist , and his studies of such subjects as the silkworm disease , anthrax , fowl cholera , and rabies , have proved immensely fruitful in practical results .

		Huxley 's statement that the discoveries of Pasteur had more than made up to the French people the five milliards of the war indemnity is probably well within the truth .

		And of even greater sig - nificance is the fact that , thanks to his efforts , hy - drophobia has been robbed of its terrors , and added to the rapidly growing list of human diseases that are amenable to treatment .

		He ranks among the greatest benefactors of mankind known to all his - tory , and it will not be easy to do adequate honor to his memory .

		CRIME IN PROHIBITION STATES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Professor
Frederick Starr	PERSON	, in his review of Haycraft 's '' Darwinism and Race Progress '' in THE DIAL , gives circulation to some statements that can , I think , be safely challenged .

		When he says that '' In
Maine	LOCATION	we find insanity , pauperism , crime , on the increase at an
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 173 abnormally large rate , '' he gives sanction to an untruth , if we can believe the statements of representative men of that
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Such assertions have often been made by the enemies of prohibition , without any warrant from official and authorized sources .

		Professor
Starr	PERSON	also makes a quotation to the effect that in
Kansas	LOCATION	'' there were more prisoners in its peni - tentiary and county jails , in proportion to population , in
1890	DATE	than there were in
1880	DATE	, '' with the inference that prohibition had caused an increase of crime .

		As a resident of
Kansas	LOCATION	during the years mentioned , and until within the past two years , and having some knowl - edge of the facts , I ask for proof of what I believe is a falsehood .

		The warden of the penitentiary of
Kansas	LOCATION	reported in
1890	DATE	almost the same number of convicts in the penitentiary as there were in
1882	DATE	, the year pro- hibition took effect ; although the population of the
State	ORGANIZATION	had increased some half a million .

		I have not the official figures as to the inmates of county jails , but I believe they will show the untruthfulness of the state - ment '' that
Kansas	LOCATION	has a larger ratio of prisoners to population than its neighboring States . ''

		It seems re - markable that so intelligent a people as the residents of
Maine	LOCATION	and
Kansas	LOCATION	and
Iowa	LOCATION	should advocate a pol - icy that increases crime and vice .

		I would not have felt like noticing these statements , had not Professor
Starr	PERSON	said that the book under re - view '' contains far too much of good hard common sense '' to '' meet an enthusiastic reception . ''

		If its statements on other questions are as unreliable as those on prohibition , it is unworthy of the notice of honest people .

United States	LOCATION	and Can - ada , '' and the United States Census of
1880	DATE	and
1890	DATE	.

		I have assumed the accuracy of quotation and figures , and have not compared our author with the original authorities .

		After showing from insane asylum statistics that insanity in
Maine	LOCATION	is not nota - bly decreasing , Mr.
Haycraf	PERSON	t presents Census figures showing an abnormal increase in the prison popu - lation of that
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The statement Mr.
Milner	PERSON	ob - jects to in reference to
Kansas	LOCATION	is based upon the Census figures , and ends as follows : '' Of all the neighboring States ,
Kansas	LOCATION	had in
1890	DATE	absolutely the largest ratio of prisoners to population . ''

		If Mr.
Milner	PERSON	can show that the Census is inaccurate , or that Mr.
Haycraf	PERSON	t has used it wrongly , he has a good case .

		In this country we constantly depend upon the Census for comparisons , and must forgive a British writer who does the same .

		I have not looked up the figures , because the statements appear to me to be reasonable .

		By prohibiting the sale of strong drink , the drunkard is not made over .

		It is very doubtful if the man who would be a sot in
Illinois	LOCATION	is likely to be a good citizen in
Iowa	LOCATION	.

		No one deplores the use of liquor or the crimes done under its influence more than myself .

		But the would - be - drunkard is the same weak , unstable , viciously-inclined creature in
Kansas	LOCATION	that he would be in
Texas	LOCATION	, and probably full as harmful .

NORTON	PERSON	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		In the report of my address at
Ashfield	LOCATION	from which you copied some words into your issue of
Sept. 16	DATE	, there was an error which I should be glad to have corrected .

		I did not say , '' We have a very imperfect system of popu - lar education '' but '' We have a very imperfect system of popular instruction . ''

		My point was to make a wide dis - tinction between education and instruction .

		So long as the speech was having a mere ephemeral existence in the daily newspapers , it did not seem worth while to make the correction ; but now that you have cited the passage in THE DIAL , and , so doing , given to it a chance of longer life , the correction seems needed .

		THE CRAZE FOR WRONG SPELLING .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THB DIAL . -RRB-

		At different times I have noticed in the newspapers poems of good quality , marred only by the fault of bad spelling , intentional bad spelling .

		In a recent speci - men that I have examined , nearly every line contains misspelled words .

		The syntax from first to last is fault - less , with the exception of the omission of words neces - sary to the sense , which are left to be understood ; and this is allowable .

		The wrong spelling appears to be intended to represent vulgar pronunciation ; the writer , strangely enough , seeming to believe that these faults in some way add to the value or the interest of his work , but how or why will never be known to anyone but himself .

		Of course , when to wrong spelling and vulgar pronun - ciation are added '' slum '' English expressions , and igno - rant grammatical distortions of any kind , the evil be - comes so much the more grievous .

		There is no conceivable temptation that can justify the use of orthoepic , ortho - graphic , or syntactical irregularities , unless it be a de - sire for picturesqueness such , for instance , as is found in the Scottish dialect , or the dialect which
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	musically portrays ; and perhaps in poems intended to hold up to ridicule brother villains other than versifiers the versifier being sufficiently damned by his own act .

		The common American half-dialect which is found in most of these poems is altogether unpicturesque and unbeautiful ; and no attempt to make poetry of it has ever resulted in anything but disaster .

		Dialect poems are , of course , sometimes so good as to be still good , though defaced in this manner ; as are some of the pieces of the well-meaning
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	, at present the chief offender , and , strange to say , a poet of considerable strength , who has hosts of misguided imitators , weak , weaker , and weakest .

		If wisdom is to be drawn from the mind of a humble man , may not humble good English well be put into his mouth to make his words respectable too ?

		Our English language is so simple that no one who can read is excusable if he utter grammatical absurd - ities every time he opens his mouth ; and , it is needless to say , his words ought never to be repeated if he do .

		Many a good poet would redeem himself , and many a grievous one greatly mitigate himself , by spelling rightly .

		They should respect the English language , not degrade and deface it .

		MORE FITZGERALD LETTERS .

		* Little need be said in the way of general praise or characterization of the sprightly little volume of '' Letters of
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	to
Fanny Kemble	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The premier translator is al - ways admirable , whether in verse or prose , and his good wine needs no bush .

		The letters , rang - ing chronologically from the middle of
1871	DATE	to within three weeks of the writer 's death in
1883	DATE	, form a nearly continuous series ; and , ex - cept a few of the later ones already printed in the `` Letters and Literary Remains , '' they will be new to most American readers .

		Perhaps the best of the book , as of its monumental prede - cessor , is the constant suggestion of a singularly engaging personality a sort of happy mean , as one may guess , between the recluse Gray and Mr.
Rickman	PERSON	,
Charles Lamb	PERSON	's famous '' pleas - ant hand . ''

		Like
Elia	ORGANIZATION	's friend , Mr.
FitzGer	PERSON	- ald was '' hugely literate , '' without conceit of scholarship ; '' up to anything , '' without the pitiful assumption of aloofness from current pursuits and interests .

		Mrs.
Kemble	PERSON	was a congenial spirit and his life-long friend ; and he chats with her unreservedly of his daily do - ings , his reading , his friends , his literary and other likes and dislikes the latter never very violent , for '' dear old Fitz , '' as his familiars called him , was anything but a good hater .

		Like his prime favorite Mme. de Sevigne -LRB- who , he says somewhere , '' with
Crabbe	ORGANIZATION	and
John Wesley	PERSON	seem to be my great hobbies '' -RRB- , he gives his pen the loose rein ; and , indeed , one de - tects in his style an echo , sometimes playfully deliberate , of the fluent stream of alternate sense and sportiveness , depth and badinage , that marks the epistles of the incomparable mistress of the '' Rochers . ''

		It is in a letter of
1875	DATE	that we find him first occupied with Mme. de Sevigne . ''

		I should like , '' he says , `` to send you a Bouquet of Extracts '' ; and a year later he runs on , quite in the Sevigne manner : '' * Ho I parlons d'autres choses ma Fille , ' as my dear Se ` vigne ' says .

		She now occupies
Montaigne	ORGANIZATION	's place in my room : well worthily : she herself a lover of Mon - taigne , and with a spice of his free thought and speech in her .

		I am sometimes vext I never made her ac - quaintance till last year : but perhaps it was as well to have such an acquaintance reserved for one 's latter years .

Rochers	ORGANIZATION	' in Brittany . ''

		The letters are freely sprinkled with literary and personal allusions little asides mostly , thrown in haphazard amid the general stream of chat .

		An interesting series of references to
Carlyle	LOCATION	, or rather to his unexpectedly outspoken biographer , may be quoted without comment .

		Shortly after
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's death , Mr.
FitzGerald	PERSON	writes : '' I was touched with the account of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	's simple Obsequies among his own Kinsfolk , in the place of his Birth it was fine of him to settle that so it should be .

		I am glad that Mr.
Froude	PERSON	is charged with his Biog - raphy : a Gentleman , as well as a Scholar and < Writer of Books , ' who will know what to leave unsaid as well as what to say . ''

		In a letter of the following month , we read : '' You have , I suppose , the
Carlyle	LOCATION	Reminiscences : of which I will say nothing except that , much as we out - siders gain by them , I think that , on the whole , they had better have been kept unpublished for some while at least .

		As also thinks
Carlyle 's Niece	ORGANIZATION	, who is sur - prised that Mr.
Froude	PERSON	, whom her Uncle trusted above all men for the gift of Reticence , should have been in so much hurry to publish what was left to his Judgment to publish or no . ''

		The Biography is more favorably judged : '' The
Carlyle Reminiscences	ORGANIZATION	' had long indisposed me from taking up the Biography .

		But when I began , and as I went on with that , I found it one of the most interesting of Books : and the result is that I not only admire and respect
Carlyle	PERSON	more than ever I did : but even love him , which I never thought of before ... His indifference to her -LSB- Mrs.
Carlyle	PERSON	's -RSB- sufferings seems to me rather because of Blindness than Neglect ; and I think his Biographer has been even a little too hard upon him on the score of Selfish disregard of her .

		In - deed , Mr.
Norton	PERSON	-LRB- of
Cambridge	LOCATION	-RRB- wrote to me that he looked on
Froude	PERSON	as something of an lago toward his hero in respect of all he had done for him .

		The pub - lication of the Reminiscences is indeed a mystery to me : for I should have thought that , even in a mercantile point of view , it would indispose others , as me it did , to the Biography .

		But lago must have bungled in his work so far as I , for one , am concerned , if the result is such as I find it or unless I am very obtuse indeed .

		So I tell Mr.
Norton	PERSON	, who is about to edit
Carlyle 's Letters	ORGANIZATION	to
Emerson	LOCATION	, and whom I should not like to see going to his work with such an ' Animus ' toward his Fellow-Editor . ''

		The month following , Mr.
FitzGerald	PERSON	contin - ues : '' Yes ; you must read
Froude	PERSON	's
Carlyle	PERSON	above all things , and tell me if you do not feel as I do about it .

		Professor
Norton	PERSON	persists in it that I am proof against
Froude	PERSON	's invidious insinuations simply because of my having known
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		But how is it that I did not know , that
Carlyle	PERSON	was so good , grand , and even love - able , till I read the Letters which
Froude	PERSON	now edits ?

		I regret that I did not know what the Book tells us while

		I shall wait very patiently till

		Among the American authors alluded to here and there in the letters is Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	who '' may do , '' thinks the writer , '' for En - glish authors something as Ste.
Beuve	PERSON	has done for the French . ''

		Apropos of Mr.
Leslie Steph	PERSON	- en 's '' Hours in a Library , '' Mr.
FitzGerald	PERSON	says : '' Another book of the kind
Lowell	PERSON	's ' Among my Books ' is excellent also : perhaps with more Genius than
Stephen	PERSON	; but on the other hand not so temperate , judicious , or scholarly in taste . ''

		Mr.
FitzGerald	PERSON	is always refreshingly frank as to his own -LRB- sometimes a little whimsical -RRB- literary preferences .

		After bestowing a page of praise on a little street song , '' Le Bon Pasteur '' which he once heard sung in
Paris	LOCATION	to a barrel-organ accompaniment , and which he confesses '' touched me more than any of
Beranger	PERSON	's most beautiful things , '' he goes on to say : `` I have been trying again at another Great Artist 's work which I never could care for at all ,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's
Faust	LOCATION	, in
Hayward 's Prose Translation	ORGANIZATION	.

		Hayward quotes from Goethe himself , that , though of course much of a Poem must evaporate in a
Prose Translation	ORGANIZATION	, yet the Essence must remain .

		Well ; I distinguish as little of that
Essential Poetry	ORGANIZATION	in the
Faust	LOCATION	now as when I first read it longer ago than < Le
Bon Pasteur	LOCATION	, ' and in other subsequent attempts .

		I was tempted to think this was some Defect great Defect in myself : but a note at the end of the
Volume	ORGANIZATION	informs me that a much greater Wit than I was in the same plight even
Coleridge	PERSON	.

		... I find a great want of Invention and Imagination both in the Events and Characters . ''

		A comparison more flattering to
Beranger	PERSON	than the one above noted is made in a previous letter .

		On the question whether the French chansonnier or
Burns	PERSON	were the '' Greater Gen - ius , '' the writer concludes : '' I can ' t say ; but with all my Admiration for about a Score of the Frenchman 's almost perfect Songs , I would give all of them up for a Score of
Burns	ORGANIZATION	's Coup - lets , Stanzas , or single Lines scattered among those quite imperfect Lyrics of his .

		Be * ranger , no doubt , was The Artist ; which still is not the highest Genius wit - ness
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, ^ Eschylus ,
Calderon	PERSON	, to the contrary .

		Burns assuredly had more Passion than the Frenchman ; which is not Genius either , but a great Part of the Lyric Poet still .

		What Be * ranger might have been , if born and bred among Banks , Braes , and

		The writer 's love of fun peeps out pleasantly in most of the letters .

		An amusing personage , the low comedian of the book , one may say , is the small boy employed by Mr.
FitzGerald	PERSON	-LRB- his own eyesight failing -RRB- as '' reader . ''

		This liter - ary character seems to have been retained as a source of mirth rather than of instruction , for we read at the outset : '' Books you see I have nothing to say about .

		The Boy who came to read to me made such Blundering Work that I was forced to confine him to a Newspaper , where his Blunders were often as entertaining as the Text which he mistook .

		We had ' hangarues ' in the French Assembly , and , on one occasion , iron-clad laugh - ter from the Extreme Left . '

Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	ranks easily with the best half-dozen of our later letter-writers ; and the reader is not likely to regret anything in the present volume save its brevity .

		E. G. J. 176 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, OUR SHAKESPEARIAN SCHOLAR .

		* In one of the many semi-apochryphal con - versations with
Continental	ORGANIZATION	friends , which are reported by our wandering students on their return home , is the following passage : The German student to his American friend : But you can not have Universities in
America	LOCATION	, for you have no scholars .

		-LRB- American friend says , feebly , that we have scholars . -RRB-

		G. S. : But if you have scholars , where are their books ?

		Produce the books , I beg of you , produce the books .

		Although the challenge is based upon a con - ception of scholarship somewhat different from that which obtains generally among us , yet it has a certain sense of its own .

		Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's '' Variorum Shakespeare '' is one of the works to be produced upon such an occasion , and it is always with a mingling of pleasure and pride that it becomes a duty to chronicle the ap - pearance of one of its volumes in this case the tenth , containing '' A
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream . ''

		It is not , however , necessary to repeat here the congratulations which American schol - ars may justly exchange with each new volume of this edition .

		Everyone knows its general character , the excellence of its scholarship , and the value of its contents .

		Each volume of the '' Variorum '' is a mon - ument to the learning , the devotion , the acumen of the noble army of Shakespearian critics ; and also to the childishness , at times , and the pedantry , of at least some of them .

		We have in this volume of 350 large octavo pages the best of what the critics have said upon `` A
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream , '' and also a good deal else .

		To the Shakespearian student the value of the book is obvious enough ; but the intelligent , though general , reader may perhaps be excused if he look somewhat coldly at the unutterable deal of comment to the halfpenny - worth of text.f Would it not be more to his purpose to read the play by itself , to enjoy its living beauty , and to let the commentators struggle by themselves over the dry bones ?

		The generous stimulus of soul , the keen de - light at the reading of the play , is nowise in - creased by pausing on every line to consider opinions on a disputed reading or conjectures as to a difficult allusion .

		* A NEW VARIORUM EDITION OF SHAKESPEARE .

		Edited by
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	.

		Volume X. , A
MTDSOMMER NIGHT	ORGANIZATION	'S DREAME .


Philadelphia	LOCATION	:
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		t This may seem a low estimate of the value of a play of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's , but the allusion requires it , and when yon can get all the plays for a shilling , two farthings apiece is not so bad a price .

		The question is a perennial one ; it comes to mind with each new volume of the `` Variorum , '' and , indeed , is practically answered by each , the question of the value , or perhaps better , the place , of the immense amount of special scholar - ship which by this time surrounds every play of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's and many other masterpieces as well .

		There is always present in mind the conception , on the one hand , of the lover of literature who reads the plays , and the plays only , for pure delight in them ; and on the other hand , of the dryasdust who scents a crux in every misprint and indulges in arduous hair-splitting to account for every unimportant trifle .

		Between the two , Dr.
Furness	PERSON	has good right to act as mediator ; for he has done as much hard work , and dry work too , as the next man , and he takes as keen a pleasure in the plays , as such , as anyone else .

		One matter over which Shakespearian schol - arship never wearies , and at which the Shake - speare lover is apt to gird a bit , is that concern - ing the dates of the plays .

		On this subject Dr.
Furness	PERSON	has already expressed his opinion at the end of his discussion of the date of '' The Tempest , '' for instance ; and in this volume we have it again .

		In his few words -LRB- pp .

		xx. , xxi . -RRB-

		upon the matter , he calls attention to the opin - ion of those who deem speculations on the sub - ject '' of keen interest , and the source of what they thiuk is , in their own case , refined pleas - ure . ''

		Such students , however , he wishes would calmly '' ask themselves , what is the chief end of man in reading
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		I think they would discern that not by the discovery of the dates of these plays is it that fear or compassion , or the sense of humor , is awakened : the clearer vision would enable them , I trust , to separate the chaff from the wheat ; and that when , be - fore them , there pass scenes of breathing life , with the hot blood stirring , they would not seek after the date of the play , nor ask Shakespeare how old he was when he wrote it '' -LRB- p. xx . -RRB-

		.

		Doubtless everybody would agree with Dr.
Furness	PERSON	here , for there certainly is much empty pedantry in many such studies : it seems worth while , however , to look at the matter from a somewhat different point of view .

		As far as concerns refinement of intellectual pleasure for the individual , there will probably be little question between the man who is reading with delight for the first or the hundredth time '' A Midsummer Night 's Dream , '' and the one who is balancing evidence concerning the year the play was written , and therefore on the age of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	when he wrote it .

		As a play , it
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 177 would doubtless be delightful , if , as it stands now , it had been written by anyone and at any time .

		But it is by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, a very in - teresting man , as Mr.
Dowden	PERSON	and Mr.
Wen	PERSON	- dell and others have written books to testify .

		Now these books on the nature of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's genius , and the development of it , are well worthy of existence ; and , further , they are not only in themselves sources of refined pleasure , but they give us a certain increase of pleasure in reading the plays which is not to be obtained otherwise .

		* But in order that such books might be possible , it was necessary that a vast amount of guessing , criticizing , comparing , sift - ing , and theorizing should be done concerning the date of each particular play .

		It would not be enough that one scholar should study the matter ; the attention of many was necessary to secure the highest possible accuracy ; there needed many mistakes , many follies even , that the truth might be somewhat assured .

		A point here , a point there , were perhaps only curious speculations in themselves , but taken altogether the whole made up a fine piece of work , and one well worth the doing .

		It was hard work , and dry and stupid it seemed to many ; but it had to be done , and well done .

		And it had to be done by many , not merely by such as liked it ; it was work to which something was due from every scholar , if only for the honor of the guild ; for if left entirely to such as prized it above all other work , it was sure to be done well , perhaps not entirely as it might have been done .

		So , without placing the pleasure to be gained from a study of the dates of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays on a level with the pleasure to be gained from the plays themselves , we may see that such studies are important and honorable in their way , and indeed indispensable .

		And something of the same sort may be said as to some of the other directions in which Shake - spearian criticism has directed itself : the study of texts , for instance , the study of sources , and of what not else .

		If it were undone , we should have the plays themselves , and great pleasure should we get from them .

		But now that the work has been done , the student who has ac - quainted himself with a bit of it , and kept his head the while , finds the plays the source not * I can hardly say , with Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, that facts which are '' purely biographical '' have for me as much relevancy to the plays themselves as has '' a chemical analysis of the paper of the Folio or of the ink of the Quarto '' -LRB- p. xxi . -RRB-

		.

		For my own part , on appreciating its place in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's life , I read `` Hamlet '' with an increase of pleasure which could never be given me by the contemplation of a chemical formula .

		only of the simple appreciation of character and action and feeling , but of a hundred or a thousand new bits of thought and significance .

		Words and lines which before had no special importance come to be rich with emotion or weighted with meaning ; and although on a cursory reading such things may not , do not , intrude themselves on the attention , they are at least sub - consciously present , and give a body , an .

		atmosphere , which would otherwise be missing .

		It is , however , known to everyone that there is the temptation to be so carried away by the scholarship that Shakespeare himself becomes but a minor figure .

		But this is the abuse of what should be rightly used , and the remedy is temperance rather than total abstinence .

		And it is because anyone may find in this vol - ume of the '' Variorum '' a good example of the temperate scholarship which is a fine thing , rather than the pedantic abuse of it , that the above remarks have any pertinence here .

		A variorum edition consists of the notes and crit - icisms of many scholars ; but it is by no means a mere compilation .

		There is more even to be done than finding industriously and selecting carefully , and more and more as the present edition proceeded have its readers become ac - quainted with the editor .

		In the first volumes he was almost concealed behind the fruits of his industry ; in the present volume , as in the two or three before it , he takes more frequent occasion to mingle with the criticisms of others the result of his own ripened and seasoned judg - ment .

		Indeed , to the young student , as to the reader who has no desire to be a student at all , the great value of the present volume of the ''
Vari	PERSON	- orum '' is not so much in exhibiting the net result of Shakespearian scholarship as to '' A
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream '' as in its showing the use to be made of all this work and the temper in which it is to be regarded ; and this is something which can hardly be rated too highly .

		It is not necessary to point out that Dr. Fur - ness is widely read , learned , industrious , acute , and so on .

		It may , however , be worth while to remark that he is a critic eminently sane , temperate , appreciative , human , sympathetic .

		He is always ready with explanation of a diffi - culty or suggestion of a meaning ; but he has little patience with the mole - like burrower whose investigations are so deep that the life and beauty of the world above is lost to him .

		He patiently records the follies of too-zealous 178 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, theorists , but takes liberty to point out that no - body need be over-persuaded by them .

		He is careful to call attention to the knowledge which is good enough in itself , but lacks any real con - nection with the matter in hand .

		Nor is he so taken up with a sense of the dignity of his po - sition that he can not indulge himself and his readers in pleasing satire now and then , or lam - bent humor .

		In fact , he uses his great learn - ing for his own ends , and by no means allows himself to be abused by it .

		And as evidence of all this , might be cited from the volume in hand hundreds of examples of editorial com - ment if there were space for them .

		We must be content , however , to note merely some of the excellences of Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's temper as a scholar , which now he is more willing than for - merly to allow his readers to appreciate .

		And this , it would appear , is precisely what Dr.
Furness	PERSON	should do .

		It would be a pity , surely , if the first Shakespearian scholar of our country should content himself with a resume , no matter how carefully arranged , of the work of his predecessors .

		It is very fortunate that with the succeeding volumes of his edition he allows us to see more and more of the scholar himself , and to gain what we may from so ex - cellent an example .


EDWARD E. HALE	PERSON	, JR. .

		THE ALPS FROM END TO END .

		* It is writ in an ancient Hebrew book that on the day of his creation man was bid by his Creator to `` replenish the earth and subdue it . ''

		This task has now for many ages occupied man 's attention , but only of late has he attained any great mastery of nature and any true cos - mopolitanism .

		To-day , for the first time , he feels fairly at home on the earth .

		He sails every water , he sets foot on every land with confidence .

		He subdues even the pinnacles of the earth , making of the highest Alps a sum - mer playground , scaling Mount Blanc and even the dread Matterhorn with the same zest with which a schoolboy climbs an apple-tree .

		This sportive familiarity of the modern man with great mountains is well exemplified by Sir
William Martin Conway	PERSON	, as we learn from his latest book , '' The Alps from End to End . ''

		Here we have the journal of a three months ' * THE ALPS FBOM END TO END .

		By Sir
William Martin Conway	PERSON	.

		excursion , taking in the whole range of the Alps in their highest peaks , and covering a tramp and climb of one thousand miles , with a record of the ascent of twenty-one mountains and thirty-nine passes .

		The author strongly advises a long trip of this kind , as giving '' a knowledge of the Alps as a range or region of mountains , and not merely as a casual assem - blage of crags , affording gymnastic problems , '' and also as conveying '' a truer idea of any moun - tain region than can be yielded by a number of climbs , radiating from a centre . '' ''

		When , however , a man has traversed the depths of a mountain region on foot , and climbed a succes - sion of peaks and passes , beholding from each the others that are to come , or those more re - motely left behind , he has within him a scale whereby to measure the depth as well as the extent of a view .

		Mr.
Conway	PERSON	and party started from
Turin	LOCATION	,
June 2 , 1894	DATE	, and soon came to the first Alp ,
Rocca	ORGANIZATION	dell ` Abisso , '' a trifling hump , but being number one , we wanted to climb it . ''

		However , as it commanded the view of a number of forts , they were not allowed this privilege , and so passed on through the verdurous Italian land - scape , occasionally stopping for the view . ''

		We halted often , sitting on the grass amongst green lichen-covered rocks , with rock-walls about us , aval - anches booming , and a fresh air stroking our hot faces .

		Overhead was a blue sky , wherein the heavenly powers were spinning cirrus webs .

		Falling waters sang to us their eternal mountain song , how that all
winter	DATE	long frost had bound them in prison , but now the sun had come to set them free , and they were off to the sweet fields and bright villages , to
Venice	LOCATION	and the Sea . ''

		After sundry fortunes and misfortunes of no great consequence , the party came on to the Ruitor neve - , an immense field of glacier snow . ''

		Seldom have I been in lovelier surroundings than those afforded by the rippled neve and the glittering mist .

		The air was soft .

		A perfect silence reigned .

		Nothing in sight had aspect of solidity ; we seemed to be in a world of gossamer and fairy webs .

		Presently there came an indescribable movement and flickering above us , as though our bright chaos were taking form .

		Vague and changeful shapes trembled into view and disappeared .

		Low flowing light bands striped the white floor .

		Wisps of mist danced and eddied around .

		At last , to our dewildered delight , there spread before us in one long range the whole mass of Mont Blanc and the
Grandes Jorasses	PERSON	, a vision of sparkling beauty be - held through a faint veil , which imperceptibly dissolved and disappeared .

		I halted to gaze on the wondrous panorama , thus astonishingly revealed .

		Assuredly no - where else is Mont Blanc better seen than from this Ruitor neve .

		No foreground more admirably serves to set off its blue shadowing buttresses and cream-colored domes than the flat white area of this magnificent snow - field . ''

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 179 Shortly after this `` celestial vision , '' they made the first ascent of Mont Blanc for the year
1894	DATE	.

		The author 's description of the present appearance of the summit is interest - ing : '' It was just noon when we stood on the top , arriving there all together .

		The first thing we looked at was not
Europe	LOCATION	at our feet , but
M. Jansen	PERSON	's hut a dread - ful disfigurement .

		The last time I was here , the sur - face of the dome was one unbroken curve of snow , aloof from man .

		Now man has rooted the evidences of his activity deep into the icy mass and strewed its surface with shavings and paper , so frozen down that the storms of the whole year have not sufficed to remove them .

		I can not , however , say that we felt any resentment against the hut-builders , for we took shelter behind the observ - atory from the blasts of the cold gale . ''

		From this summit there was a magnificent panorama ; but the clouds were the most fas - cinating .

		Mr.
Con	PERSON	way is very much alive to the beauty of clouds , regarding them as '' every bit as beautiful as mountains , '' and he has much to say about them in this book .

		From Mont Blanc Mr.
Conway	PERSON	proceeded on through the
Bernese Oberland	LOCATION	and the
Tyrol	LOCATION	, and fin - ished his expedition by the ascent of the An - kogl , '' the last of the snowy Alps . ''

		Mr.
Conway	PERSON	, we note , is not one of those who abuse the mountain railways , which are becom - ing so common in the Alps .

		He regards them of distinct use to all , and as having a special value in keeping the crowd to a definite track , which the unconventional traveller can easily avoid . ''

		Every new hill railroad , every recog - nized lunching-place or Belvedere , becomes a further clamp that yet more irrevocably holds the crowd to its particular and narrow route . ''

		On this point , I observe that that excellent traveller Mr.
Finck	PERSON	, in a recent letter to '' The Nation , '' is of similar opinion , and he shows also that the railways need not deface the land - scape .

		There is , on the whole , some sense of disap - pointment in this book .

		It chronicles no great feats and no thrilling adventures , as does Mr.
Whymper	PERSON	in his '' Scrambles among the Alps '' or his '' Great Andes of the Equator , '' or as Mr.
Conway	PERSON	's own '' Climbing in the
Korako	LOCATION	- ram-Himalayas . ''

		This volume is too scrappy in contents and in style , and sometimes there is a suspicion of padding .

		In short , the book is not inevitable enough .

		It is interesting in parts , but its chief value is as a guide-book sup - plementary to
Baedeker	LOCATION	.

		This value is greatly increased by the last chapter , '' so kindly con - tributed by the Eev .


W. A. B. Coolidge	PERSON	, the most learned expert in Alpine topography that has ever lived . ''

		The volume sadly lacks a map , and a glossary of mountaineering terms would be very acceptable to most readers .

		The work is fully illustrated with drawings by Mr.
M'Cormick	PERSON	.

		These are soft and artistic , and the experienced Alpinist will find them highly interesting and suggestive ; but , for the most part , they will be '' caviare to the general . ''


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		THE HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY .

		* The anticipations awakened when it was an - nounced that Mr.
W. J. Courthope	PERSON	was en - gaged in the preparation of `` A History of English Poetry '' are now in a measure realized by the publication of the first volume of the work , accompanied by a promise that the re - maining volumes shall be forthcoming during the next few years .

		Such a history , which amounts to a history of our literature in the noblest and most significant of its forms , has long been awaited , and it is probable that no more competent hand for the work than that of Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	could be found among liv - ing English or American scholars .

		It is true that he is lacking in equipment for some parts of the work , and particularly for the treat - ment of the period discussed in this initial vol - ume ; but the most versatile student can hardly be expected , in these days of intensive inves - tigation , to do adequate justice to the great subject of our thousand years of poetical his - tory in all of its aspects .

		To elucidate En - glish poetry , as annalist , philologist , and met - rical specialist , as aesthetic critic and philosoph - ical historian , as student of its ethical and political bearings , of its manifold relations to the life of our race , this is a task not likely to come within the reach of any one man , how - ever great his will and his scholarly devotion .

		It is not in disparagement , then , but in recog - nition of the inevitable limitations of the indi - vidual , that we must set down Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's work as defective in some of these matters .

		Mere annalist he does not attempt to be , and he frankly confesses that he is not a philologist .

		As a metrist , he gives evidence of much spe - cial preparation , yet even here he is not always abreast of modern English scholarship .

		But For the other aspects of the work his equipment is substantial , and he has built upon a broad and deep foundation .

		* A HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY .

		By
W. J. Courthope	PERSON	,
Volume I. New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		180 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, , The underlying principle of Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's treatment of English poetry is found in his con - ception of the fundamental unity of the subject and of its solidarity with the other phases , artistic , social , and political , of English life . ''

		My aim has been , '' he says , '' to treat poetry as an expression of the imagination , not simply of the individual poet , but of the English peo - ple ; to use the facts of political and social his - tory as keys to the poet 's meaning , and to make poetry clothe with life and character the dry record of external facts . ''

		In this aim , we note , Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	is at one with
M. Jusserand	PERSON	, whose work we reviewed not long ago ; although the former writer keeps his extra-literary ma - terial more in the background than does the latter .

		To exhibit the principle of growth and movement in our poetry , to show that there are in its history no inexplicable phenomena , is set down by the author as a second primary aim , although , strictly considered , it is rather a corollary of the aim previously formulated .

		This principle is illustrated by the account of the Renaissance , in which he takes exception to the tendency of such men as
Symonds	PERSON	and Pater to regard that new birth of the spirit as '' a sudden and isolated movement of the hu - man mind , which can not be explained by the ordinary methods of historic investigation . ''

		In outlining his plan of treatment , Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	distinguishes '' from Chaucer downwards ... the confluence of three great streams of thought , which blend in a single channel without any of them ever quite losing its separate life and identity . ''

		These streams of thought are : -LRB- 1 -RRB- `` The genius of Race , the stream of
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	language , character , and custom , modi - fied by the influence of Scandinavian imagin - ation , as well as by all the impulses and ideas derived from the Latin nations through the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- The tradition of Ed - ucation systematized by the
Latin Church	ORGANIZATION	, many traces of which survive in the courses of our universities and public schools . ''

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- '' The tradition of Graeco - Roman Culture , carried through the barbarous ages in many slender ducts and channels , which , mingling the spirit of the ancient world with the infant civilization of
Europe	LOCATION	, prepared the way for the great re - vival of arts and letters commonly known as the Renaissance . ''

		This is admirably put , no doubt , and em - bodies a sound philosophy of the subject , but the words '' from Chaucer downwards '' are sig - nificant , and call attention to the feature of Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's treatment likely to provoke the largest measure of dissent .

		For he contra - venes his fundamental doctrine of unity by re - fusing to apply , except in a one-sided way , the method above outlined to the history of our poetry from
Caedmon	LOCATION	to
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	.

		He is very emphatic upon this point . ''

		Between the poetry produced in
England	LOCATION	before the
Norman Con	PERSON	- quest and the poetry of Chaucer there is abso - lutely no link of connection . ''

		To state his po - sition simply , it is that the antecedents of the Chaucerian and post-Chaucerian poetry are to be sought in '' the region of mixed culture pre - vailing among the nations of joint Latin and Teutonic descent . ''

		We are content to state Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's position , without arguing at length against it .

		To our mind , the opposed position , ` so well occupied and strongly defended by
Ten Brink	ORGANIZATION	,
M. Jusserand	PERSON	, and Mr.
Stop	PERSON	- ford
Brooke	PERSON	, is more tenable ; but the whole question is obviously one of balance between the three elements of the problem as already outlined .

		Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	magnifies the import - ance of the second and third at the expense of the first , that is all .

		Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	, on the other hand , has probably magnified unduly the first at the expense of the others .

		Both views de - part from the mean which here , as almost every - where else , is golden ; but Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's de - parture seems the wider and the less justifiable .

		The adequate classical equipment of the au - thor is doubtless responsible for the undue stress that he puts upon the classical and other non-racial influences in the development of our poetry .

		He is constantly seeking for classical parallels and illustrations , as when he calls
Langland	PERSON	the Naevius and Chaucer the Ennius of English poetry .

		He gives us a fine analysis of the decay of the classical spirit in European thought , and pictures with ample knowledge and insight the transition to medievalism .

		He assumes a corresponding sympathy and knowl - edge on the part of his readers when he prints without translation many of the Latin passages cited in the furtherance of his argument , al - though translations are given of the Italian and even of the Old English quotations .

		This classical bent , so characteristic of Mr.
Court	PERSON	- hope 's treatment throughout , seems on the whole fortunate -LRB- even if a little partial -RRB- , be - cause it does justice to a phase of the subject to which most historians have done something less than justice .

		We shall await with an in - terest even greater than occasioned in the pres - ent volume the applications of Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's classical scholarship to the later periods of our poetry , so rich in opportunities for the tracing

		THE DIAL 181 of classical parallels of expression and analo - gies of thought .

		A rapid commentary upon the successive chapters of this volume may now be given .

		Of the introductory chapters we have already dis - cussed the salient features .

		They are followed by one on Anglo-Saxon poetry , in the course of which three stages are indicated : -LRB- 1 -RRB- The primitive Teutonic pre-Christian compositions -LRB-
Beowulf	LOCATION	, etc. -RRB- .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Compositions in which the art of minstrelsy is applied to scriptural subjects -LRB- Czedmon -RRB- .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- Compositions dom - inated by the influence of Latin ecclesiastical education -LRB-
Cynewulf	ORGANIZATION	, etc. -RRB- .

		On the vexed question of the composition of '' Beowulf , '' Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	stands for unity of authorship .

		The chapter on Anglo-Norman poetry is crowded , and its treatment is less satisfactory than that of
M. Jusserand	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is followed by a chap - ter on the early Renaissance , in which space is found for rather lengthy consideration of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	,
Petrarch	ORGANIZATION	, and
Boccaccio	PERSON	, of the '' Ro - man de la Rose , '' and of
Laurence Minot	PERSON	and the political songs of his period .

		This episode brings us to
Langland	PERSON	and
Chaucer	PERSON	, who have chapters to themselves , about equal in length .

		They are , on the whole , perfunctory summaries , arranging in a fairly acceptable manner the materials collected by past scholarship .

		The most striking thing in the treatment of
Lang	PERSON	- land is the elaborate comparison of `` Piers Plowman '' and the '' Divine Comedy '' ; the dis - tinctive note of the chapter about
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	is its envisagement of the poet as a full realiza - tion of the ideals of the trouvere .

		A chapter upon
Gower	PERSON	,
Lydgate	PERSON	, and Occleve comes next , and informs us that
Gower	PERSON	's '' poetical qualities are of a high order , '' which does not exactly agree with
Lowell	PERSON	's opinion , and is not as likely to find acceptance .

		The recent dis - covery , by Mr.
Macaulay	PERSON	, of the lost ''
Specu	PERSON	- lum Meditantis , '' came too late to be mentioned in the present work .

		The various uses of alle - gory in the Middle Ages , with illustrations from
Henryson	LOCATION	,
Dunbar	PERSON	,
Douglas	PERSON	,
Hawes	PERSON	,
Skel	PERSON	- ton , and
Barclay	LOCATION	, is the subject of the next chapter , and leads up to an account of '' The Rise of the Drama in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Court	PERSON	- hope does not propose to treat of the drama at length , for reason of the histories already ex - isting , which does not seem to us an entirely adequate excuse for neglecting the greatest of English poetical forms . ''

		The Decay of En - glish Minstrelsy '' is the subject of a chapter which admirably illustrates the philosophical method of the whole work , a method that is constantly reverting to the origins of the move - ment or form under consideration , and deals with it from a historical and evolutionary stand - point .

		A brief '' Retrospect '' brings the vol - ume to its close .

		In conclusion , we will venture to express the hope that Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	may be permitted to complete the work he has so well begun .

		When we think of
Warton	ORGANIZATION	,
Morley	PERSON	, and
Ten Brink	PERSON	, to say nothing of the unrealized plans of Pope , Gray , and so many others , we can not fail to be impressed with the uncertainty of all such great intellectual undertakings as the present .

		We are comparatively rich in treatments of our poetical history in its beginnings , but from the Elizabethan period downwards , we have practically nothing continuous but the great work of
Taine	LOCATION	.

		Just now there are three men in the race , Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	, Mr.
Brooke	PERSON	, and
M. Jusserand	PERSON	.

		All three have started well , and we shall indeed have reasons for self-con - gratulation if all three live to carry out their plans .

		Of these three ambitious beginnings , that of Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	, in spite of the strictures that we have found it necessary to make , is on the whole the most promising .

		Completed in accordance with its present design , it will be such a monument of our poetical history as the scholarship of the twentieth century will not easily better , and such as few literary archi - tects will be found daring enough to attempt to rival .

		* The cataloguers in our public libraries , com - ing to the volume on '' The Teaching of English in American Universities , '' will doubtless enter it under the rubric '' Educational '' and justly so .

		Only as we have been shaking off pro- vincialism we have come to know that in the largest sense three-quarters of the world 's lit - erature is properly educational .

		The culture of the individual is the correlative of the rights of the individual , and civilization means pre - cisely the possibility of individual rights and individual culture .

Oct. 1	DATE	, civilization .

		The old order is breaking up , now as ever , and we desire to readjust our scheme of culture to a new order of ideas .

		We have thought too narrowly that education is mainly mental training .

		We are ambitious now to attempt to mould equally the physical form and the moral nature .

		It is true , of course , that intellectual training has always involved moral discipline as a sine qua non , but perhaps there are years in which the order should be reversed and the intellectual training should be incidental to the moral .

		And of course moral does not mean merely prudential or prudish .

		The literature of power appeals directly to the moral nature .

		Can we grade and present this literature in such a way as to make it a progressive curriculum of moral training ?

		Cer - tainly not after any half-hearted and mechan - ical system .

		But broadly and liberally yes .

		Let us begin our experiment , therefore , with the literature which offers the least impediment of mere scholasticism , which appeals the most directly to the moral mood and to sympathetic emotions .

		Let us take English literature , and make of it a means to direct training of facul - ties hitherto neglected in our imperfectly organ - ized modern educational system .

		Eeasoning of this sort , I take it , prompts the movement of which this book is the outcome and the expres - sion .

		As a book , it is both experimental and de - liberative .

		It is a record of experiments and attempts , a sort of cooperative stock-taking and balancing of accounts , together with delibera - tions and counsellings as to methods and theo - ries and beliefs .

		It is evident that the move - ment is still experimental , although the theory of it is becoming rapidly approved .

		English literature is to be taught as literature , with the full force and effect of the emotional and imag - inative meaning of each masterpiece considered , if in any way this can be managed .

		From Bos - ton to
Berkeley	LOCATION	, we agree upon this .

		The aim is to make great books speak loudly and thrill - m gty to the secret and primary consciousness of each pupil and neophyte , as they speak at their best to the chosen few .

		Then as we read in youth so will we read in age , and the springs of emotion will be stirred with formative and lofty ideals .

		But we must beware lest a separation , too early and too easy , be forced between what are at bottom but two aspects of one being , the moral nature and the intellectual nature .

		Both the intellect and the emotions are servants of the will , and must be trained together pari We must avoid scholasticism in liter - ary teaching , but we must beware equally of a de-intellectualized emotionalism and of hazy Hegelianisms fitted in as connotative interpre - tations .

		Simply because literature appeals more directly to the emotions and the will , it is not exempted from the tests and the discipline of logic .

		Again , we should remember that as all hu - man action in a wide prospect is of mixed moral worth , so even the greatest literature does not reflect perfect ideals .

		This is perhaps elementary , but it is mostly disregarded ; and consequently all art , from
Plato	LOCATION	to the Puritans , has been put on the defensive .

		And with the Philistines -LRB- who replenish the earth -RRB- it is a grave consideration .

		Wherefore logic and the sciences appear safer , while the emotional na - ture is restrained from generalizing into forms of art and is stifled at home and in school under the rule-of-thumb .

		A great deal can be said on this question .


Ruskin	PERSON	and the psycholo - gists are quite right in pointing out that the excitation of emotions which receive no vent in action -LRB- or even the similitude of action -RRB- is dan - gerous .

		The great aim of literature , however , is to excite the purely sympathetic emotions .

		Art does not excite the concupiscence of the individual .

		But what is the duty of the teacher of literature in these premises ?

		Shall he ster - ilize his text , and lift it out of the range of sympathy ?

		Or shall he gloze it and preach from it his own philosophy of life ?

		A short and straightforward answer is not easy .

		This volume is a compilation of papers that are for the most part already familiar to the readers of
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	.

		But their full value can be appreciated only when they are taken together .

		As they stand , they form an indis - pensable book of reference and vade mecum to all interested in the teaching and study of En - glish literature .

		The various reports from each college , which make up the body of the volume , form a record that is authoritative , and as ac - curate as may be under the circumstances .

		For purposes of exact comparison , however , an in - dependent general view by one impartial inves - tigator would be necessary .

		But the chief inter - est of the volume , after all , is in its discussions , and in what it reveals of motive , ideal , and theory .

		Much is suggested in this way , but much more remains to be worked out by con - ference and through experience .

		It is plain that the field of English teaching is still but poorly defined .

		The present state of the mat - ter is admirably summed up in Mr.
Payne	PERSON	's

		THE DIAL 183 general introduction to the volume .

		The best opinion , I believe , is all with him , both in his views as to secondary school and to the collegi - ate study of English .

		He stands for a sound and well-approved ideal of literature and of lit - erary training .

		It is a very vital matter this , whether the ideal of the best judges and lovers of literature , of men like
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	,
Coleridge	LOCATION	, Ste.
Beuve	PERSON	,
Ruskin	PERSON	, and
Lowell	PERSON	, is to be ac - cepted in our organized teaching of literature , or whether some narrower and more technical view of literary culture is to prevail .

		The intel - ligent and educated public is deeply interested in this question .

		This book is a landmark in a discussion which is not yet ended .

IVES CARPENTER	PERSON	.

		RECENT WORKS ON ETHICAL , THEOKY AND THE MORAL , The immortality which , as it would seem , has been vouchsafed to the '' Meditations '' of
Marcus Aure	PERSON	- lius , shows the existence of a constant and wide - spread interest in collections of moral aphorisms .

		To the great majority of the reading public , system - atic treatises on ethics are caviare ; but the writer who , without descending to argument or attempted demonstration , speaks straight to the moral con - sciousness , revealing to dull eyes the beauty of char - acter and the glory of service in the great cause , warming the heart with a sense of fellowship in well-doing or calling attention to duties hitherto un - perceived , such a writer is sure of a welcome from earnest men and women .

		It is a need of this kind that Dr.
Coit	PERSON	has sought to supply in the little book entitled `` The Message of Man . ''

		It is a well - selected collection of brief quotations representing the best thought on the problems of the moral life on the part of more than two hundred writers .

		At the same time , it is something better than a mere unorganized mass of disjointed quotations after the manner of
Bartlett	PERSON	's '' Dictionary . ''

		Each selection has been fitted to the next preceding with such ad - mirable skill that at least the main divisions of a chapter often read like continuous discourse , an effect which is rather heightened than otherwise by the division of the text into verses after the manner of the '' Imitation of Christ '' and the '' Meditations . ''

		The compiler has supplied two excellent indexes one by chapters , giving the source of each verse in * THE MESSAGE OF MAN : A Book of Ethical Scriptures .

		its order , the second giving the location in the book of all the selections from any one author . ''

		Ethical Addresses '' is a collection of lectures , originally prepared for delivery before the various societies for ethical culture in the
United States	LOCATION	.

		They deal for the most part , not with disputed points of the moral code , nor with the abstract the - ories of systematic ethics , but rather with certain phases and problems of that moral experience which is the common possession of humanity .

		What is implied in the deliberate choice of devotion to duty as the supreme principle of every-day life is impress - ively set forth in two lectures by Mr.
Salter	PERSON	.

		Dr.
Adler	PERSON	draws an exquisite picture of the modern saint , contrasting him with the mediaeval ideal of holiness on the one hand , and with the heroic type of character on the other .

		In the address on prayer and worship , Dr.
Adler	PERSON	asks the question : How can high ideals be maintained by those who find it im - possible to voice their aspirations for perfection either in private prayer or in the exercises of wor - ship as conducted in the churches ?

		Other subjects discussed are : The religion of ethical culture , true liberalism , what does it mean to be religious ?

		etc. .

		The opening pages are devoted to a paper written originally for '' The Forum , '' in which Dr.
Adler	PERSON	, the founder of the ethical movement , gives a clear and complete presentation of the aims and methods of the ethical societies .

		Although the papers thus brought together are without external marks of rela - tionship to each other , nevertheless a bond of union exists between them in the common spirit which per - vades them all .

		This finds expression in the con - viction that man has within himself the power to choose the right and to follow day by day its com - mands ; that to make him moral you need not ap - peal to the fear of future punishment , or even to the desire of divine approbation and favor ; you have but to open his eyes to the sacredness of duty , to the beauty of the perfected character , and to the claims of his fellow-men , who are his brethren .

		To some minds , such doctrines will appear strange , if not actually repugnant ; to others they are the very corner-stone of their life 's structure .

		To the former class , the moral strength and enthusiasm of these writers will come as the revelation of a new world .

		To many of the latter , these papers may serve as the formulation of ideals and principles of action for which they have long sought definite expression .

		To the earnest student of whatever creed , they are to be recommended as reflecting faithfully the spirit of one of the most significant movements of the present time . ''

		Institutional Ethics '' is a work dealing with the ethical aspects of the four great institutions of so - ciety , namely , the family , the school , the state , and the church .

		The detailed discussion of these topics is introduced by two chapters devoted to a statement of fundamental principles .

		We are bound to con - fess that a careful perusal of this book has failed to disclose anything either new or particularly val - 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, uable in its contents .

		To be sure , we have found some interesting quotations from Mr.
John Fiske	PERSON	,
J. R. Green	PERSON	, Prof.
H. K. Adams	PERSON	, and other sources , equally difficult of access , and , furthermore , we have observed that a few of the commonplaces of ethical science have been allowed to drift into the text ; but he who seeks for more than this is doomed to dis - appointment .

		The introductory chapters are steeped in the lore of Dr.
W. T. Harris	PERSON	.

		Possibly some readers may find them edifying ; personally , we could not , though that of course may be due to in - tellectual myopia combined with narrow sympathies .

		In connection with a definition of justice as '' the exaction of what is due to the self , '' we read -LRB- page 3 -RRB- : '' The return of the heavenly bodies unto their own places shows the phase of justice in the creative process , the unconscious claiming of that which is their own . ''

		When this interesting statement met our eye we prepared ourselves to be entertained , if nothing more .

		But even this hope failed .

		We have asserted that works on systematic eth - ics are likely to prove caviare to the average lay - man , but we must add that the last twenty-five years have witnessed a development in the methods and results of ethical investigation , sufficiently marked to be worthy of the attention of the outside public .

		No longer than a generation ago , the study of the subject resembled the performances of a de - bating society ; every man was in it to help his side win , and you would as soon expect to find an hon - est citizen who had voted with his party since Fre - mont was nominated admitting that the scales had fallen from his eyes at a democratic campaign meet - ing , as to find a participant in the great debate on morals who had allowed the arguments of his op - ponents to make any particular impression upon his mind .

		Perhaps the moralist of to-day has learned a thing or two from the struggles of the past , per - haps he is less interested in '' schools '' and more interested in facts than were his predecessors ; at all events , an unmistakable tendency towards a gen - eral agreement on a number of fundamental points is making itself felt for the first time in the history of ethics , a sign , as we take it , that we are ready to bid farewell to the days of blind partisanship and of the superficial dilettanteism with which , curiously enough , it was invariably accompanied .

		To the question , What makes any given action right ?

		a compact school of moralists have for a century or more insisted no answer could be given , except what an ungallant cynic has styled a '' woman 's answer , '' namely , '' It is so because it is so . ''

		To-day almost all the leading students of the subject are agreed that an ungrounded moral judgment is a moon made of green cheese ; that an action that is right is right for some reason , and this reason is found in the end which it subserves .

		Expressed in a bare formula , this end is the well-being of those in any way affected by the action .

		With regard to what constitutes well - being , there does indeed exist serious difference of opinion , one school holding that all its elements are ultimately reducible to happiness , the other claiming that it is rather to be identified with the perfection of our whole nature , more particularly of character .

		But much has certainly been accom - plished when a complex problem has been reduced to this simple form .

		Again , it is not many years since conscience was quite generally held to be an infallible guide .

		To - day it is seen that moral insight , like all other parts of knowledge , is subject to the laws of growth ; that as a result , there may be traced through the ages a progress in the apprehension of the nature of true well-being , an increasing display of intelligent care in the selection of the necessary means and a con - stant widening in the circle of those having ad - mitted claims upon our service .

		Formerly the same school held that conscience was a separate faculty dwelling apart by itself in the mental world ; to-day it is generally recognized as but the name for the varied and complicated processes which reveal to us what is contained in and what manner of life is re - quired by the moral ideal .

		At the same time , it must be admitted that the present state of ethical study leaves much to be de - sired , and the future will certainly see methods of investigation in common use of whose value few moralists of to-day seem to have any conception .

		The fundamental problems of ethics deal with judg - ments of approbation and reprobation upon con - duct .

		As yet , the great majority of moralists have contented themselves with resting the broadest gen - eralizations upon the testimony of their own narrow experience .

		As a result , the personal equation has played a role whose magnitude is not unfairly repre - sented by the number of conflicting statements as to matters of fact which may be found even in stand - ard modern treatises .

		Already , however , the way out of this labyrinth is beginning to dawn upon the minds of a few investigators .

		We must study with equal care and attention the moral judgments passed by ourselves and by others , by Americans and by Russians , by Europeans of the nineteenth century and those of the ninth , by the saint and the man of the world , by the child and by a Goethe , by the Australian savages and the cultured Athenians .

		All of these judgments , alike the commonplace , the exceptional , and the apparently absurd , must be described , analyzed , and explained , before any con elusions as to the principles underlying them are of much more value , as science , than the ipse dixit of our friends the Esoteric Buddhists .

		The ethics of the immediate future will profit also by the rapid advances which are being made in psychology .

		It has been in vain to discuss the differentia of delib - erate and instinctive action with an inadequate ac - quaintance with the phenomena of volition .

		The place of reason in the moral life might be debated forever if there were no prospect of obtaining a better insight into the true nature of the mental processes covered by this term .

		The now generally accepted doctrine of conscience is largely the fruit of the conquests of modern psychology .

		In its strength and in its weaknesses , Dr.
Hyslop	PERSON	's
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 185 f Elements of Ethics '' is a representative book of the period .

		Conduct is declared to be right or wrong according as it is calculated to promote or hinder the development of the capabilities of human nature .

		The fallibility of conscience is freely ad - mitted , and all that is insisted upon is its inviola - bility , i. e. , its right to uniform obedience from us , as the ultimate authority on the problems within its jurisdiction .

		Conscience itself is defined as the mind occupied with moral phenomena .

		These con - clusions bring the author in line with modern thought .

		On the other hand , he has transcended it neither in his methods nor his results .

		We find a greater show of precision and exhaustiveness in the analysis of phenomena under investigation , with - out being , as a matter of fact , brought much farther than previous writers have carried us .

		The extent to which the recent treatises in psychology have been studied appears to be meagre , and there is no trace of any conception of the rich harvest to be obtained by an objective study of the moral judg - ments as exhibited in others besides ourselves .

		Apart from an outline of the history of ethical thought , and chapters devoted respectively to a con - sideration of elementary principles , to the relation of religion and morality , and to the relation of rights and duties , the main body of the book is occupied with the discussion of two great problems : the con - ditions of moral judgment , i. e. , of the imputation of praise or blame , and the criterion of moral judg - ment .

		The answer given to the latter and , indeed , the positions taken throughout mark the author as a member of the school of the late Professor
T. H. Green	PERSON	.

		The conditions of moral judgment are held to be two in number : first , the possession of freedom in the sense of power to choose between alternatives ; and secondly , the possession of con - science , or the power to recognize moral distinctions .

		It can not be said that the discussion of these sub - jects brings out much that is absolutely new , but the author has stated more clearly than any other member of his school just what is essential to moral responsibility , and a matter of equal importance what is not .

		This portion of his book is worthy of careful study .

		The remainder will certainly re - pay the professional moralist for a rapid reading , but he will find , on the whole , considerably more desert than oasis .

		The college student for whom the work is in a manner especially prepared , and the general reader who happens to be hungering and thirsting after a knowledge of the principles of ethics , will be repelled , we fear , by the heavy style and the dreary length to which many of the discus - sions have been drawn out .

		They should be in - formed , however , that the former at least is a fail - ing common to ethical treatises .

		The teacher in search of a text-book will hardly find in this the realization of his ideals , and yet if two-thirds of the colleges in the country should adopt it in place of what they now use , the change would undoubtedly be to the advantage of all concerned .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		In the rambling Introduction to his .

		`` New Studies in Literature '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , Professor
Edward Dowden	PERSON	dis - cusses the influence of democracy upon genius , the hollowness of manufactured patriotism among Irish - men , the future of poetry , the modern school of historical writing , and a few other subjects .

		Upon the first theme he is mildly optimistic , and upon the second eminently sane ; toward the third his attitude is not very clearly defined -LRB- although he goes out of the way to gird at
Matthew Arnold	ORGANIZATION	's familiar prophecy -RRB- , and toward the fourth his atti - tude is one of semi-regretful acceptance .

		These dis - cursive remarks precede a group of essays in which we read , first , of the poetry of Mr.
George Mere	PERSON	- dith and Mr.
Robert Bridges	PERSON	, then of
John Donne	PERSON	, the good Dean of St.
Paul	PERSON	's , and then of the amours de voyage of
Fabre d' Eglantine	ORGANIZATION	.

		These essays lead us up to what we may call the core of the volume a series of chapters upon
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then follow papers upon
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Edmond Scherer	PERSON	, '' Liter - ary Criticism in
France	LOCATION	, '' and '' The Teaching of English Literature . ''

		The five chapters upon as many aspects of Goethe 's protean individuality dis - play the critical powers of the author at their best .

		While they hardly have the comprehensive vision of another English critic of Goethe the late Sir
John Seeley	PERSON	they exhibit acute penetration and unfailing sympathy , qualities not as common as they ought to be in English appreciations of the greatest of Germans .

		And it is precisely by this method of approaching Goethe from many special points of view that he is alone fully to be understood .

		In many respects the most interesting chapter of this volume is the closing one '' an introductory lec - ture to my college class '' on '' The Teaching of En - glish Literature . ''

		The writer makes a number of excellent points .

		In the first place , he insists that the general view shall not be dispensed with . ''

		A General Sketch of European Literature '' is neces - sary for the student , and he should be made to learn it .

		It should be a book of some three hundred pages . ''

		It would be possible by brute force to hammer the contents of this little book into a boy 's head in the course of a few weeks or months , and brute force could hardly be better employed .

		The young student of history would ever after be able to place things aright , and to understand how this thing is related to that .

		He might by-and-by pro- ceed to fill in one fragment of the great map with topographical details , nor rest until he had become intimate with every feature of his chosen province . ''

		In addition to this book there should be a similar manual of English literary history , likewise to be learned .

		But and the proviso is of the utmost importance no such history '' should be read until the student is made to perceive and feel what knowl - edge at first hand indeed is by being put to work on an actual text . ''

		What Professor
Dowden	PERSON	means by this kind of work he then proceeds to illustrate 186 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, by taking the play of '' Hamlet , '' and describing , in much detail , the way in which the student should set about its study , and , having mastered it , should pass to the study of its author , its period , and its relation to literature as a whole .

		Finally , there are the larger inductions that can alone give unity and meaning to the study of literature .

		Philosophical criticism is the ultimate aim , and the author speaks upon this point with no uncertain accent . ''

		That there are general laws or principles applying to the various forms of literature , in whatever age and in whatever clime produced , is certain . ''

		Subjective criticism gets no countenance from the writer of this sentence , and can get no countenance from any serious teacher of literature .

		Mr.
Willis J. Abbot	PERSON	's Life of Car - ter
Henry Harrison	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a sympathetic and creditable , though somewhat eulogistic , biography of a man whose career and personality may be taken as strik - ingly typical of a passing phase of national life and character .

		With certain familiar foibles and eccen - tricities , Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	was an estimable , and in some points even an admirable , man , a sturdy and characteristic product of American democracy , whose unwearied and often useful political activity was at least measurably motived by public spirit and an honest desire to serve the general welfare .

		Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's career was full of change and stir - ring incident , and Mr.
Abbot	PERSON	tells the story well , dwelling chiefly on the really essential and instruc - tive phases , and resisting the obvious temptation to exaggerate and over-color the more sensational epi - sodes .

		The narrative is freely sprinkled with quo - tations from Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's speeches and writings the latter naively frank and egotistical produc - tions , such as could scarcely have been written by other than an essentially honest man .

		An extract from a youthful journal describing the street scenes attending the third
Napoleon	PERSON	's coup d'etat , of which the writer , with
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	, was an eye-witness , shows some really good descriptive writing , terse , vivid , and dramatic , which will surprise those famil - iar with the rather inflated and wordy style usually affected by the '' World 's Fair Mayor . ''

		Says Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	: '' At one time I was in a pack at the mouth of
Rue Lafitte	ORGANIZATION	when some firing was heard up the boulevard ; we were ordered to disperse with an ' Allez-vous-en ! '

		We paid no attention to it .

		Then came a stern ' Va-fen ! '

		We knew that meant business , especially when a platoon of infan - try was seen rapidly approaching .

		I was open to the enemy .

		I ran , putting my hands in front of me , and then drawing them back , as if swimming .

		Each motion put two or three Frenchmen , not so strong as I , behind me .

		I thus made a living breast - work to my rear , of probably a hundred , when the crash of musketry was heard .

		There were screams .

		How many were hit I did not hear , but I soon saw two men on shutters borne up the street . ''

		Chica - goans will have no difficulty in picturing the stal - wart ex-mayor cleaving his way through the pack .

		Commenting on Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	's assassination , the author does not hesitate to lay a due share of the responsibility for that deplorable deed at the door of the
Chicago	LOCATION	press , which had , during the heated canvass shortly preceding the tragedy , heaped upon Mr.
Harrison	PERSON	the vilest and most unjustifiable abuse .

		While the murderer
Prendergast	PERSON	, a half - crazed place-hunter of the
Guiteau	PERSON	stamp , was mainly im - pelled to his crime by a fancied political slight , his conduct at the trial leaves no doubt that he believed to the last the public would justify him in ridding it of the vicious man and corrupt official depicted by the leading newspapers .

		In the light of such examples as that of Mr.
Garfield	PERSON	and Mr.
Harri	PERSON	- son , it is not too much to say that a man who braves newspaper calumny by becoming a candidate for election to a hotly-disputed office does so at peril not only of his good name , but of his life . ''

		A Sketch of the Life and Work of
Domenico Morelli	PERSON	, '' by Mr.
Ashton R. Willard	PERSON	, is issued in a very at - tractive volume by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.


Signor Morelli	PERSON	, the acknowledged present leader of Italian art , is a Neapolitan ; and it is largely to the stimulus of his example and influence that the current artistic ascendancy of his native city is due .

		The part played heretofore in the history of Italian painting by the southern capital has been relatively inferior ; and its contribution to the gen - eral product , even during the splendid efflorescence of the national art in the sixteenth century , is strangely insignificant in character and amount .

		Su - preme among the native cities in the beauty of her surroundings , in the natural motifs and scenic inspir - ations favorable to a rich and luxuriant artistic de - velopment ,
Naples	LOCATION	nevertheless produced in the past , near and remote , few men who are now re - membered , or who won even in their own day wide - spread recognition .

		It might seem as if the
Nea	ORGANIZATION	- politans , favored beyond other men by partial Nature , had been content to bask lazzaroni-like in the sunshine of her beauty , without rendering her the laborious homage of strenuous study and por - trayal .

		But
Naples	LOCATION	, stirred by the genius and ac - tivity of a gifted citizen ,
Domenico Morelli	PERSON	, has awakened from her long lethargy ; and it may be hoped that her awakening presages for
Italy	LOCATION	at least an afterglow of the past glories of her match - less art .


Signor Morelli	PERSON	is a born innovator one of those men , says Mr.
Willard	PERSON	, '' who arrive at new results , not by trying to be original , but by an inward compulsion which will not allow them to be other than original . ''

		His influence was felt at
Naples	LOCATION	as early as
1865	DATE	, lending a distinctive tone and tendency to the painters immediately about him .

		By
1875	DATE	the flocking of young men to his atelier for instruction surpassed anything that had been seen in
Italy	LOCATION	since
Canova	PERSON	's time ; and in
1880	DATE	an Italian jury awarded him a diploma pro- nouncing him the leader of Italian art a crucial
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 187 test of admitted supremacy in a land where pro- fessional jealousies still survive with mediaeval vir - ulence .

		Mr.
Willard	PERSON	gives an interesting account of
Signor Morelli	PERSON	's chequered , and at one time even stormy , career , of his up-hill fight against poverty , public indifference , and the academic narrowness of critics and juries .

		The criticisms and apprecia - tions are temperate and scholarly ; and the several fine plates with which the volume is enriched cer - tainly bear out Mr.
Willard	PERSON	's generous estimates .


Signor Morelli	PERSON	's themes are mostly Scriptural ; and one may almost fancy , in studying his ample and dignified compositions , that they are from the brush of some belated member of that noble company of bygone Italian masters whose works are at once the pride and the despair of their successors .

		A good volume of Mr - .

		Lewis E - of
Harvard Uni	ORGANIZATION	- prose selections from versity , has edited a volume of '' Se -
Cardinal Newman	PERSON	.

		l ect i ons f rom t h e Prose Writings of
John Henry Cardinal Newman	PERSON	'' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , and thereby placed in the hands of students of English a choice series of examples from one of the greatest masters of English prose .

		The selections are so arranged as '' to give something like a connected account in
Newman	PERSON	's own words of his theory of life and of his justification of it . ''

		The book has thus a two - fold value , in that it brings to the student of style a model and an exemplar particularly needful in this age of feverishly clever writing , and to the stu - dent of culture a bird 's - eye view of the work of one of the subtlest and most imaginative minds of the nineteenth century .

		The selections include many passages from the '' Idea of a
University	ORGANIZATION	, '' the '' Apologia , '' the novels , sermons , and controversial essays .

		We are particularly glad to find among the chapters the inimitable satire on '' Count Potem - kin and
John Bull	PERSON	, '' and a number of those passages in which
Newman	PERSON	, more eloquently perhaps than any of his contemporaries , pleaded for the higher aims of education and the nobler ideals of human - istic scholarship .

		And we are almost tempted to say that the introductory essay supplied by Mr.
Gates	PERSON	is as valuable as any of the remaining con - tents of the book .

		At least we should hardly know where else to look -LRB- unless possibly in Mr.
Hutton	PERSON	's pages -RRB- for so keenly analytical and warmly appre - ciative an estimate of the stylistic and rhetorical characteristics of
Newman	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		This essay is a masterpiece of criticism , and makes us await impa - tiently further work of the sort from Mr.
Gates	PERSON	.

		Excellent service has been done to the reading public by Mrs.
Millicent Garrett Fawcett	PERSON	in giving us a '' Life of Her Majesty Queen Victoria '' -LRB-
Roberts Bros.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a sympathetic and able biography of one who is at the same time a great ruler and a great woman .

		The idea is too common among Americans that the Queen is but a figure-head for the government , that she is without power or even much influence .

		This unpretending little book will correct that error in Syllabub for girls .

		the minds of all who read it .

		She is shown to be an exceedingly hard worker in public affairs , exer - cising constant supervision over the greater interests of the Kingdom , though taking the department of foreign affairs under her special superintendence .

		She is also shown to be a thoroughly trained states - man whose judgments deserve the respectful con - sideration of the ablest ministers .

		The woman as portrayed in this book deserves our admiration no less than the monarch .

		And her influence , with that of her noble husband , in raising the tone of so - cial life in
England	LOCATION	, can not be sufficiently praised .

		Mrs.
Fawcett	PERSON	has set forth the details of the train - ing of the Queen for her work , her accession and marriage , her beautiful domestic life , the character and influence of Prince
Alfred	PERSON	, her connection with the government , and the points where she has espe - cially touched public affairs , in such a way as to give a true and vivid picture of one of the world 's great rulers .

		In her `` Side Talks with Girls '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , ''
Ruth Ashmore	PERSON	'' offers herself as guide , philosopher , and friend in general , to the '' American Girl '' to whom her book is gushingly dedicated .

		We should be sorry to think that this production could be taken as a fair gauge of the culture and mental capacity of any large proportion of those to whom it is ad - dressed .

		The drift of the book is indicated in such chapter-headings as : `` The Social Life of a Girl , '' `` A Girl 's Religious Life , '' `` What Shall a Girl Read , '' `` The Girl Who Uses Slang , '' `` My Sweet - heart and I , '' and so on .

		We subjoin a specimen or so of the text : '' ... and then while your heart is full of the heroism of a man , you will elect to read a new and very full life of the martyrdom of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	. '' ''

		A book with pictures is always doubly interesting , and I fancy my girls are like me in that respect . '' ''

		... from the beginning of the world men have never loved the women who were slangy in their manners , but rather the woman who represents what a French writer calls the ' eter - nal feminine . ' '' ''

		Give -LSB- your sweetheart -RSB- plenty of the bread and butter of affectionate friendship , and every now and then add to it a spoonful of the marmalade of love . ''

		One tolerates , under protest , such sorry stuff as the foregoing in the newspapers and in ladies ' journals ; but its intrusion between book-covers should be resented .

		M. Saint-Amanda We take Pleasure in calling atten - accountofthe tion to a fresh volume , `` The Revo - Revoiution of
' 48	DATE	.

		lution o f 18 48 '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , from the unflagging pen of
M. Imbert de Saint	ORGANIZATION	-
Amand	LOCATION	.

		M. de
Saint-Amand	ORGANIZATION	's now cpmprehensive series of his - torical sketches are not only as pleasant reading as anything in their way we know of , but they render writers and special students the solid service of bringing handily within three feet or so of shelf - room the pith and marrow , the '' purple patches , '' so to speak , of the generally inaccessible mass of memoirs , diaries , letters , etc. , in which the period 188 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, treated by
M. de Saint-Amand	ORGANIZATION	especially abounds .

		The present volume is a readable one , full of anec - dote and portraiture , and re-telling with graphic effect the homely yet touching story of
Louis Phil	PERSON	- ippe 's abdication , how -LRB- to adopt the poet
Heine	PERSON	's version of the matter -RRB- the good old bourgeois king , finding that
France	LOCATION	did not want him , and resolutely refusing to fire on his unruly people , tucked his wife under one arm and his umbrella under the other , hailed a cab , and drove away from
Paris	LOCATION	, its mobs and its barricades , forever .

		It is needless to say that
M. Saint-Amand	PERSON	, a friend of the old regime , accords French royalty a more stately final exit .

		There are four portraits in the volume , which is admirably translated by
Elizabeth Gilbert Martin	PERSON	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		A new edition of Dr.
Dickson	PERSON	's translation of Momm - sen 's `` History of
Rome	LOCATION	'' is at hand -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The translation has been revised throughout , and thus brought into conformity with the latest -LRB- eighth -RRB- Ger - man edition . ''

		As compared with the first English edi - tion , '' says the translator , '' the more considerable alter - ations of addition , omission , or substitution amount , I should think , to well-nigh a hundred pages . ''

		The text has been broken up into paragraphs further than here - tofore , and provided with marginal headings .

		Last of all , we may note the greatly enlarged index .

		Among recent reprints of standard fiction we note the following : `` Two on a Tower , '' by Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	, with a preface , an etching , and a map of Wes - sex -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- ; `` Great Expectations '' and `` Hard Times , '' making a new volume in the '' dollar ''

Ritchie	PERSON	, and Marryat 's ''
Jacob Faith	PERSON	- ful , '' introduced by Mr.
David Hannay	PERSON	, both of these published in the
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	series of old-fashioned nov - els ; and the first two volumes of a neat new edition -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- of the works of
John Gait	PERSON	, containing '' Annals of the Parish '' and '' The Ayrshire Legatees , '' edited by Mr.
D. S. Meldrum	PERSON	, and introduced by Mr.
S. R. Crockett	PERSON	.

		A dissertation by Dr.
Edwin W. Bowen	PERSON	, offered for a degree at the
Johns Hopkins University	ORGANIZATION	, is entitled '' An Historical Study of the e-Vowel in Accented
Syl	PERSON	- lables in English . ''

		It is published by
Messrs. John Murphy & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Bowen	PERSON	has also re - printed in pamphlet form , from the ''
Virginia	LOCATION	School Journal , '' a paper on '' The Relics of Umlaut in Liv - ing English . ''

		Both of these studies are creditable illus - trations of the philological scholarship of our younger university men , and are examples of a class of publica - tions that have multiplied rapidly of late .

		From
Owens	PERSON	to
Passelewe	ORGANIZATION	is the range of the latest volume numbered forty - three , of the `` Dictionary of National Biography '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Most readers will turn quickly to Mr.

Stanley Lane Poole	PERSON	's article on

Charles Stewart Parnell	PERSON	-LRB- twenty pages -RRB- , and is unsigned .

		The statement is made that the ar - ticle is based in part upon private information .

		LITERARY NOTES .

		`` King
Henry VIII	PERSON	. ''

		and `` Hamlet '' have just been published in the `` Temple '' Shakespeare -LRB-

		The latter volume , with its 216 pages , is the thickest of the series .

Augustine Birrell	PERSON	, and soon published .

		The old rectory at
Grasmere	LOCATION	, where

		The building was more than t ^ o hundred years old .

		The new '' Eversley ''
Wordsworth	PERSON	, to be published by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, will devote eight volumes to the poems , three to the prose , three to the journals , and two to the biography fourteen in all . ''

		Fathers and Children , '' the most powerful , as dis - tinguished from the most artistically-perfect , of the novels of Tourgue ` nieff , has just been added to Mrs.
Gar	PERSON	- nett 's series of translations -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- with an intro - duction by Mr.
Edward Garnett	PERSON	. ''

		North American Shore Birds , '' by Professor
Daniel Giraud Elliot	PERSON	, Curator of Zoology in the
Field Museum	ORGANIZATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, illustrated with full - page plates drawn for this work by Mr.
Edwin Sheppard	PERSON	, is announced for early publication by Mr.
Francis P. Harper	PERSON	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		Those who recall
M. Daudet	PERSON	's '' Numa Roumestan '' will be interested in the announcement that the novel - ist 's forthcoming work , '' Soutien de Famille , '' will also have a political groundwork , it being a study of the po - litical life of
France	LOCATION	at the period of
Gambetta	PERSON	's as - cendancy .


Lafayette College	ORGANIZATION	will hold a celebration on
October 24	DATE	, in honor of Prof.
Francis A. March	PERSON	, L.H.D. , LL.D. , the distinguished philologist , who this Fall completes his seventieth year and forty years of service in the
College	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many of the most distinguished educators and scholars of the country will participate .

		The
Board of Regents of the University of California	ORGANIZATION	having decided that a location in the immediate vicinity of
San Francisco	LOCATION	is preferable to the
University	ORGANIZATION	's pres - ent home at
Berkeley	LOCATION	,
Mayor Sutro	ORGANIZATION	has presented to the
University	ORGANIZATION	a site of thirteen acres south of
Golden Gate Park	LOCATION	for the erection of the new college buildings .

		The following lines have been engraved upon
Hux	PERSON	- ley 's tombstone : '' And if there be no meeting past the grave , If all is darkness , silence , yet ' t is rest .

		Be not afraid , ye waiting hearts that weep !

		For God still giveth his beloved sleep .

		And if an endless sleep he wills , so best ! ''

		A ''
California Guild of Letters	ORGANIZATION	'' has been formed in
San Francisco	LOCATION	for the purpose of '' encouraging and aid -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 189 ing
California	LOCATION	authors in such practical ways as may be deemed most expedient . ''

		The first work undertaken by the
Guild	ORGANIZATION	will be the publication of the poems of Miss
Ina D. Coolbrith	ORGANIZATION	, which will be issued during the coming holiday season .

		A new play by ''
Michael	PERSON	Field '' will be entitled , `` At - tila , my Attila . ''

		It deals with the strange and despe - rate adventures of
Honoria	LOCATION	, daughter of the famous
Empress Galla Placidia	ORGANIZATION	.

		This young princess may reasonably be regarded as the New Woman of the fifth century , and it is from this point of view that
Michael Field	PERSON	has presented her audacities and their punishment .

		Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	is preparing an illustrated ar - ticle on '' The Home of the Gue ` rins , ''
Maurice	PERSON	and
Eugenie	PERSON	having lived and died in the part of
Langue	LOCATION	- doc where the Stantons have their
summer	DATE	home .

		Two female relatives of the Gue ` rins are still living at the Chateau du Cayla -LRB- described in
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	's `` Essays in Criticism '' -RRB- .

		Mr.
Stanton	PERSON	has met them both , and they have given him some interesting facts for use in his forthcoming article .

		Dr.
Elliott Coues	PERSON	has just completed his new edition of
Zebulon M. Pike	PERSON	's '' Explorations in the West and
Southwest	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In it he has gone in great detail into the '' Headwaters of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	'' question , and of the claims made by explorers of ancient and modern times .

		Those interested in
Western	LOCATION	history and discovery will await with interest the appearance of Dr.
Coues	PERSON	's work .

		He claims to have sifted every conceivable source of in - formation on the subject , and to have settled the Mis - sissippian question for all time .

		Mr.
Theodore Stanton	PERSON	writes to a friend in this coun - try : `` The venerable
M. Barthe	PERSON	` lemy Saint-Hilaire , the distinguished Life Member of the
French Senate	ORGANIZATION	, pre - sents a wonderful example of intellectual activity at an advanced age .

		In
August	DATE	he celebrated his ninetieth birthday .

		A few months before , he published a large three-volume ' Life of Victor Cousin , ' and a week ago he wrote me in a firm , legible hand : ' I can still work , I am thankful to say .

		I am busy at this moment on the second edition of Cousin 's '' Plato , '' and I hope to issue the first volume at the end of the year . ' '' ''

		The Harvard Graduates ' Magazine '' for
September	DATE	has for its leading feature Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	's great address on '' The Vocation of the Common Law , '' de - livered
last June	DATE	at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	.

		The report of the
Alumni Dinner	ORGANIZATION	, at which Professor
Norton	PERSON	presided , is also given , and proves extremely interesting reading .

		Among other festivities , there were speeches from the Chair - man , the President , Governor Greenhalge , Sir
Fred	PERSON	- erick
Pollock	PERSON	, Mr.
Charles Francis Adams	PERSON	, and Mr.
Joseph Jefferson	PERSON	, the latter three having been pre - viously made the recipients of honorary degrees .

		Pro- fessor
Norton	PERSON	was particularly happy when , introducing Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, he quoted the remarks of the
Principal of the University of Louvain	ORGANIZATION	, as reported in '' The Vicar of Wakefield . '' '' '

		You see me , young man , I never learned Greek , and I do n't find that I ever missed it .

		I have had a doctor 's cap and gown without Greek ; I have had ten thousand florins a year without Greek , and I can eat heartily without Greek ' ; in short , con - tinued he , ' as I do n't know Greek , I do not believe there is any use in it . ' ''

		Mr.
Adams	PERSON	, in the speech that followed , discreetly avoided making any allusion to so delicate a subject .

		Among the holiday books of last year was a hand - some one called '' Hoofs , Claws , and Antlers , '' issued in
Denver	LOCATION	, and containing a striking collection of pho - tographs of wild animals , purporting to have been taken in their native haunts among the trees and rocks , by an old hunter and his wife , one of them covering the wild creature with a rifle while the other got a '' snap shot '' with the camera .

		The volume contained portraits also of this enterprising couple , and had an enthusiastic Introduction by that experienced sportsman Mr.
Theo	PERSON	- dore
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		The book had a considerable vogue , and some of its pictures were reproduced in the pages of a popular
New York	LOCATION	magazine .

		It is now stated by a
Colorado	LOCATION	paper that the whole thing is a hoax a `` clever fake . ''

		The animals were not wild at all ; they were not even alive ; they were only stuffed specimens from the extensive collection of a
Denver	LOCATION	taxidermist , taken out into the plains and mountains and skilfully '' placed '' for the conniving photographer .

		Even the veteran hunter and his wife appear to have been stuffed ; and so too , according to the
Colorado	LOCATION	journal , was Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	thus writes in '' The Author '' of literary affairs in
Chicago	LOCATION	. ''

		A great novelist , accord - ing to the ' Times , ' has appeared in the city of
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		I am glad to hear it , because , two years ago , I pointed out without being believed that there exists in Chi - cago a society of literary students who are working seri - ously and earnestly with the ambition of producing something real .

		There is also at
Chicago	LOCATION	a rich and flourishing university , with a great many professors on a great many subjects , and a great many students .

		There are good schools in
Chicago	LOCATION	; there is a good literary paper in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		There are libraries , mu - seums , art collections , concerts , theatres , and , in fact , all the necessary aids to culture .

		When , in so great a city , we find a number of people steadily cultivating every form of art , it is pretty certain that , before long , one or more will come to the front .

		The man who has come is Mr.
Henry B. Fuller	PERSON	, and the name of his book is ' With the Procession . '

		My prophecy was held up to scorn at the time , especially by those who still think that
Chicago	LOCATION	is a small collection of log huts , with a saloon or two , populated by gaunt men with revolvers and bowie knives .

		I can only hope that the book is as good as the ' Times ' correspondent thinks . ''

		Seven new leaflets have just been added to the '' Old South '' series , all relating to English Puritanism and the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		They are numbered 58 to 64 , and are as follows : No. 58 ,
Hooper	PERSON	's Letters to
Bullinger	PERSON	; 59 , Sir
John Eliot	PERSON	's '' Apology for Socrates '' ; 60 , Ship - money Papers ; 61 ,
Pym	PERSON	's Speech against Strafford ; 62 ,
Cromwell	PERSON	's Second Speech ; 63 ,
Milton	PERSON	's '' Free Com - monwealth '' ; 64 , Sir
Henry Vane	PERSON	's
Defence	ORGANIZATION	.

		There are many earlier leaflets in the series relating to the same period , including Vane 's '' Healing Question , '' the Petition of Rights , the
Grand Remonstrance	LOCATION	, the Scot - tish
National Covenant	ORGANIZATION	, the Agreement of the People , the
Instrument of Government	ORGANIZATION	, and
Cromwell 's First Speech	ORGANIZATION	.

		With these Old South leaflets , which are sold for
five cents	MONEY	a copy , just enough to cover their cost , our students can come into immediate touch with the men of the English Commonwealth and the great scenes in which they acted .

		These men and events were as truly a part of American as of English history , as it has been a main object of the Old South lectures of the present year , on the Puritans in
Old England	LOCATION	, to point out .

		It is pleasant to know that these leaflets are com - ing into general use in the schools and being circulated throughout the country .

		223 A NEWSPAPER MYTH .

		A few months ago it was reported that a certain instructor in the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	was about to sever his connection with that in - stitution .

		Such incidents are a part of the normal life of every university , and this par - ticular incident did not seem to call for any comment on the part of the public .

		But a sec - tion of the newspaper press , that stern guar - dian of public morality , found in the matter the germ of a possible sensation , and by its familiar methods of innuendo , baseless asser - tion , and reckless reasoning , proceeded to ex - ploit the case .

		It so happened that the in - structor in question had been at work in the departments of economic and social science , and had in various ways brought himself before the public , outside of his university teaching , as a student of trusts , monopolies , and indus - trial combinations , and was credited with pro- nounced opinions upon those subjects .

		But sinister reflection the founder and chief benefactor of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	was a man firmly associated in public opinion with one of the most gigantic of industrial monopo - lies .

		Obviously , here were all the materials for a first-class sensation .

		To the limited sort of intelligence that presides over the average newspaper , a theory of the facts presented itself ready-made .

		Nothing could be clearer .

		The founder of the
University	ORGANIZATION	was also the head of a well-known trust ; others of its bene - factors were wealthy men and consequently in close sympathy with the plutocratic view of society ; here was an instructor , supported by their endowments , and expressing opinions that they must regard as peculiarly obnoxious ; it was a plain case of an attempt to throttle free thought and shape the teaching of a great pub - lic institution in accordance with the unholy views of those whose wealth had created it .

		This theory of the situation , reckless as it was , got considerable currency through the efforts of the newspapers that had given it the sanction of their prejudice .

		To an impar - tial outsider , knowing nothing of the spirit and organization of the university thus brought to the bar of journalistic opinion , it may have presented itself as one of the many possible 202 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, reasons why an educational institution should seek to dispense with the services of one of its instructors .

		To anyone at all familiar with the attitude of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	toward the general question of Lehrfreiheit , it was of all possible reasons the one least likely to be supported by the facts .

		Upon that great prin - ciple , the position of the
University	ORGANIZATION	has from the start been absolutely unequivocal .

		The character of its faculty , its courses , and its methods has been such as to preclude the notion that it aimed in its teaching at anything less than the fullest freedom of discussion and in - vestigation .

		Bigotry , partisanship , and secta - rianism have in vain sought to obtain a foot - hold within its quadrangles .

		Its theological school , indeed , teaches a particular form of theological dogmatism , frankly enough pro- claimed , and it is difficult to see how a theo - logical school could do otherwise .

		Even in
Germany	LOCATION	,
Lehrfreiheit	PERSON	does not go so far as to say that the theological faculties of the uni - versities shall not be distinctly Catholic or Protestant .

		But even the theological students at the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	get their Semitics , their classics , and their philosophy , for the most part , from the regular university depart - ments concerned with these subjects , depart - ments so liberally organized that it would be ridiculous to charge them with the least sec - tarian bias .

		All these facts , familiar as they are to those who have studied the organization and ob - served the workings of this newest of our great universities , are not sufficiently well known to the public intelligence to fortify it against such an appeal to prejudice as has recently been made .

		The newspaper myth which is the sub - ject of these remarks was given such currency , and found so wide an acceptance among peo - ple who are willing to let the newspapers do their thinking for them , that the President of the
University	ORGANIZATION	, at the
July Convocation	ORGANIZATION	, thought it best to recognize the myth in question to the extent of making a very distinct public state - ment that the
University	ORGANIZATION	had never sought to influence the teaching of its instructors or to abridge in any way their intellectual freedom .

		A statement of this sort should , of course , have put an end to the discussion of the matter ; but newspaper myths are not so easily discredited .

		The growth of such a myth offers an interest - ing subject for psychological study .

		Put forth at first as a plausible hypothesis , it speedily assumes the shape of an incontrovertible fact , and is taken as a new fixed basis for further reasoning .

		Many of our leading newspapers , East and West , taking for granted the suppres - sion of free discussion by the authorities of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, have been moralizing all
summer	DATE	long upon the awful consequences of a higher education controlled by class influ - ences , and indulging in dismal vaticinations of a time when our university faculties shall have become mere hirelings of an unscrupulous plu - tocracy .

		The peculiarly impudent feature of the whole discussion has been the frequently - reiterated assertion that the
University	ORGANIZATION	author - ities had made no reply to the charges brought against them .

		This assertion , which we have seen in a good many reputable newspapers dur - ing the past three months , must be accounted for in one of two ways .

		If made in actual ignorance of the explicit denial of
last July	DATE	, it must be taken as a fresh illustration of the dis - graceful recklessness characteristic of the edi - torial management of too many of our news - papers .

		If , on the other hand , it has been made with knowledge of the facts , it merely illustrates that cardinal maxim of journalistic ethics in accordance with which a newspaper , having once made itself responsible for a state - ment of any sort , is in self-respect bound to insist upon its truth , even if it be demonstra - bly false , unless there is too great a risk of being detected in the lie .

		Neither of these explanations , judged by other than journalistic standards , is very creditable ; but no third ex - planation is under the circumstances possible .

		It is always a serious question to determine to what extent popular clamor of this sort , directed against a public man or a public insti - tution , should be recognized by its object .

		Most of the anonymous scribbling upon such subjects in the public press is obviously undeserving of the slightest attention .

		Dignity and self-respect nearly always prompt one to ignore such at - tacks altogether .

		But there are cases in which , when all the circumstances are considered , it seems that some notice ought to be taken , even of a foolish popular opinion .

		At all events , the President of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	deemed it advisable , when the
University	ORGANIZATION	came to Convocation the first of the present month , to reiterate , with greater emphasis and ampli - tude , his declaration of three months before .

		He said : '' In view of the many incorrect and misleading utter - ances which have recently been published in reference to the policy of
the University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	in its rela - tion to its teaching staff , it seems wise to make the following statement : '' 1 .

		From the beginning
the University	ORGANIZATION	has believed
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 203 in the policy of appointing to positions in the same de - partment men who represent different points of view .

		It is evident , therefore , that no instructor in the univer - sity has been or will be asked to separate himself from the university because his views upon a particular ques - tion differ from those of another member of the same department . ''

		2 .

		From the beginning of the university there has never been an occasion for condemning the utterance of any professor upon any subject , nor has any objec - tion been taken in any case to the teachings of a pro- fessor . ''

		3 .

		The university has been , in a conspicuous way , the recipient of large gifts of money from wealthy men .

		In absolutely no single case has any man , who has given as much as one dollar to the university , sought by word or act , either directly or indirectly , to control or even to influence the policy of the university in reference to the teachings of its professors in the departments of political economy , history , political science or soci - ology .

		`` This public statement is made because the coun - ter statement has been published far and wide , and be - cause it is clear that a serious injury will be done the cause of higher education if the impression should pre - vail that in a university , as distinguished from a college , there is not the largest possible freedom of expression a freedom entirely unhampered by either theological or monetary considerations . ''

		This is , we should think , explicit enough , and may even be said to mark a noteworthy epoch in the history of American higher education .

		Does it dispose of the newspaper myth that we have been talking about ?

		Probably not ; peo - ple of intelligence did not believe in the myth anyhow , and most of those who did believe in it will never see the disclaimer .

		As for the newspapers , they may continue to assert that no denial of the charge has been made ; or they may change their tactics , and demand all the facts in the case , be they of public concern or not .

		Some of them , in fact , have already taken the latter course .

		Since the publication of the declaration above mentioned , the instructor about whom all this pother has been raised has supplied the news - papers with a statement of his position .

		We can not but regard this as an unwise proceeding , for the statement is not wholly ingenuous , and does not contravene in any essential respect the utterances of the President of the
University	ORGANIZATION	upon the principle of freedom in teaching .

		The public is nowise concerned with the reasons for which the retirement under discussion was made , as long as those reasons have nothing to do with
Lehrfreiheit	PERSON	.

		We are assured that this is the case by an emphatic and authorita - tive pronouncement , and there the question ends for all reasonable persons .

		To demand , as some newspapers still seem inclined to do , a statement of the specific reasons for which the retirement was made , is the sheerest impu - dence , and even to recognize such a demand would be a derogation from dignity with which the
University	ORGANIZATION	is not likely to become charge - able .

		Eeaders of THE DIAL do not need to be re - minded that we have always stood steadfast in defense of the freedom of
University	ORGANIZATION	teaching .

		That fact alone , to say nothing of the further fact that the instructor whose case has just been under discussion is a valued contributor to our review columns , would preclude any de - fense on our part of the university , were we not convinced that the principle of
Lehrfrei	LOCATION	- heit is fully recognized by that institution , and that it has not , in this case or in any other , been put in jeopardy .

		For the newspapers that have hatched and fed the mythical mon - ster now so desperately .

		wounded , no condem - nation can be too strong .

		They have given a fresh illustration of the apostolic apostrophe , '' Behold , how great a matter a little fire kin - dleth ! ''

		and as far as they have injured the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	in the eyes of those who should wish it well , they have no reason to be proud of their work .

		In the case of some of the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	papers , it has been only too evi - dent that jealousy of a Western institution was the prime motive of the attack ; in the case of the papers nearer home , a spirit of reckless sen - sationalism has mainly prompted the attitude assumed by them .

		In either case , the motive has been anything but creditable , and it is at least pleasant to think that the attack has been so obviously prejudiced , if not malicious , that it can not have had any serious influence upon public opinion , but has rather strengthened than weakened the
University	ORGANIZATION	with all judi - cious minds .

		RECENT PEA THS .


Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen	PERSON	died on the fourth of this month , at his residence in
New York	LOCATION	.

		His death was entirely unexpected , and came from an attack of acute rheumatism of the cardiac muscles .

		He was born
September 23 , 1848	DATE	, in
Frederiks	LOCATION	- vaern ,
Southern Norway	LOCATION	, and was educated at
Leip	PERSON	- zig and
Christiania	LOCATION	.

		Graduating from the latter university in
1868	DATE	, he came to
America	LOCATION	the year after , and settled for a while in
Chicago	LOCATION	, where he edited the Scandinavian paper '' Fremad . ''

		He later occupied academic posts at
Urbana	LOCATION	and
Cornell Universities	ORGANIZATION	, and at
Columbia College	ORGANIZATION	, with which latter institution he has been connected since
1880	DATE	.

		204 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, He early acquired a surprising knowledge of the English language , and his first publication in En - glish had few traces of foreign idiom .

		The list of his publications is a lengthy one , comprising twenty - one titles of books , besides many contributions to periodical literature .

		The books , with their dates , are `` Gunnar '' -LRB- 1874 -RRB- , `` A Norseman 's Pilgrim - age '' -LRB- 1875 -RRB- , `` Tales from Two Hemispheres '' -LRB- 1876 -RRB- , '' Falconberg '' and '' Goethe and Schiller '' -LRB- 1879 -RRB- , `` Queen Titania '' and ''
Ilka	PERSON	on the Hill - top '' -LRB- 1881 -RRB- , `` Idyls of
Norway	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1882 -RRB- , `` A Daughter of the Philistines '' -LRB- 1883 -RRB- , '' The Story of
Norway	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1886 -RRB- , `` The Modern Vikings '' -LRB- 1887 -RRB- , `` Vagabond Tales '' -LRB- 1889 -RRB- , '' Against Heavy Odds '' -LRB- 1890 -RRB- , `` The Mammon of Unrighteousness '' -LRB- 1891 -RRB- , `` Essays on German Literature , '' `` Boyhood in
Norway	LOCATION	, '' `` The Golden Calf '' -LRB- 1892 -RRB- , `` Social Stragglers '' -LRB- 1893 -RRB- , `` A Commentary on
Henrik Ibsen	PERSON	, '' `` Literary and Social Silhouettes '' -LRB- 1894 -RRB- , and `` Essays on Scandinavian Literature '' -LRB- 1895 -RRB- .

		Much of this work was pot-boiling , but the best of it was well worth doing .

		As a writer , he was robust rather than refined , and a vein of philistinism now and then cropped out in his pages .

		A certain cyni - cism , as far as women were concerned , marred some of his later books .

		But he was a remarkable writer , and all the more so from his use of a language not originally his own .

		Readers of THE DIAL will re - call his frequent contributions to its pages .


William Wetmore Story	PERSON	, who was born in
Salem	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	,
February 12 , 1819	DATE	, and who died in
Vallom	LOCATION	- brosa ,
Italy	LOCATION	, on the seventh of this month , was almost , if not quite , the dean of our American lit - erary guild .

		He was antedated only by Mrs.
Stowe	PERSON	-LRB- 1812 -RRB- , Mr.
Parke Godwin	PERSON	-LRB- 1816 -RRB- , and Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam
Ellery Channing	PERSON	the second -LRB-
1818	DATE	-RRB- , among those still living .

		The son of a distinguished law - yer , he was himself admitted to the bar , and worked at the law for ten years .

		Several volumes of legal writings remain to attest his industry in this field .

		But a passionate devotion to art led him , after this apprenticeship to an inartistic profession , to leave
America	LOCATION	for
Italy	LOCATION	in
1848	DATE	, and to devote his life thenceforth mainly to sculpture , in which field he achieved the most distinct of his successes .

		His literary work , which served him as a form of recrea - tion in his career as an artist , was varied and indi - cative of talent and the broadly-cultured mind hardly more than that .

		It comprises ''
Nero	PERSON	, '' a play ; three collections of poems ; ''
Roba di Roma	PERSON	, '' a series of '' walks and talks about
Rome	LOCATION	'' ; '' Graf - fiti d'ltalia '' ; '' He and She , '' a `` poet 's portfolio '' ; `` Fiametta . ''

		a graceful Italian idyl ; `` Conversa - tions in a Studio '' ; a series of '' Excursions in Art and Letters '' ; and the '' Life and Letters of
Joseph Story	PERSON	, '' his father .

		All of this work is pleasing in form , although it shows little critical penetration , and often displays an unsoundness of judgment that would have been impossible to a rigorously-trained intellect .

		But it gives to its author an honorable place in our literature , and will probably afford considerable pleasure to another generation or two of readers .

		Victor
Rydberg	PERSON	, who died
last month	DATE	, was prob - ably foremost among recent Swedish men of letters , with the possible exception of
Herr Topelius	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was born
December 18 , 1829	DATE	, in JonkSping .

		He was educated at
Wexio	LOCATION	and
Lund	PERSON	, and at the former place enjoyed the teaching and friendship of Teg - ne `` r. His first important work was the historical novel '' The Pirate of the Baltic '' -LRB- '' Fribytaren paa Oestersj5n '' -RRB- , published in
1858	DATE	.

		The following year produced the still more important work '' The Last Athenian '' -LRB- '' Den Siste Athenienser '' -RRB- .

		This work , with its liberal tendencies and its almost po - lemical attitude towards church authority , evoked much criticism , and led to the composition of '' Christ in the Bible '' -LRB- ''
Bibelns Lara	PERSON	om Kristus '' -RRB- , '' The Hebrew Worship of Jehovah '' -LRB- '' Jehovatjensten hos Hebreerna '' -RRB- , and '' The Magicians of the Mid - dle Ages '' -LRB- '' Medeltidens Magi '' -RRB- .

		A sojourn in
Rome	LOCATION	in
1873	DATE	74 was the inspiration of several thoughtful works .

		He also wrote lyrics , and made a highly successful translation of '' Faust . ''

		He was one of the eighteen members of the Swedish Academy , and a professor in the Superior School of
Stockholm	LOCATION	.

		THE RETROGRESSION IN ENGLISH . ''

		The restoration of English to much of its old - time valiency '' is ably , instructively , and entertain - ingly discussed in an article on '' The Renascence in English , '' in the
October	DATE	issue of '' The Forum . ''

		But while the writer , Mr.
Richard Burton	PERSON	, does not ignore the debt which English owes to other lan - guages for a large portion of its vocabulary , and acknowledges that '' the return to Old English ex - pression '' must always be '' within limits of com - mon sense and controlled by custom and conven - ience , '' yet it may well seem to some of his readers that he looks for too great an enrichment of our speech through a return to native English words and turns of expression which have long ago dem - onstrated their inferiority to foreign importations , and perhaps even their uncouth and unmanageable nature , by allowing themselves to be crowded out of the language by substitutes of greater flexibility or euphony .

		We are told by the writer that the German lan - guage , the historic cousin of the English , '' owing to its different history has kept its native powers in relative purity ; while English , subjected to more disturbing influences in the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	and the classic Renascence , has diverged far wider from its normal physiognomy and its original tenden - cies . ''

		As a result of these disturbing influences , we are subjected to the necessity of saying preface instead of foreword , unless we are willing to seem odd and affected , and we have domesticated '' such a repulsive foreign importation as massa ere .

		`` in stead
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 205 of enjoying the privilege of using the German com - pound , blood-bath -LRB- blutbad -RRB- .

		We are assured that '' had our tongue encountered a happier linguistic experience , '' we might now be using such expres - sive and self-explanatory , though uncouth and homely , words as the above .

		But let us look , in passing , at this '' repulsive for - eign importation , '' massacre .

		To be sure , its pres - ent form is French , and it points back to the mediae - val Latin mazacrium ; but its real origin is Teu - tonic , and not Latin , into which latter language it is an importation from northern
Europe	LOCATION	.

		It ap - pears in the German metzger , the provincial Ger - man metzgern and metzgen , the Old High German meizan , and the Gothic mditan .

		With a slightly altered spelling it would become an excellent En - glish word of purest lineage .

		Let us rather paraphrase the passage quoted above , and say that German , owing to its less for - tunate history , has retained all its provincialisms , while English , wrought upon by more wide-reaching influences in the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	and the classic Renascence , has freed itself of the purely insular and local in its vocabulary and structure , and be - come , in a sense true of no other tongue , a world - language .

		The Norman element in the English language gives it that power of precision which is so characteristic of the French , and which explains why the latter is so peculiarly fitted for the use of mathematicians and scientists , while , on the other hand , and as a necessary consequence , it is never less at home than in the flights of poetry or the pro- foundness of philosophy .

		From
northern Europe	LOCATION	we gain to use the words of Professor C. C. Ever - ett , in his '' Science of Thought '' '' the richness and fulness which
spring	DATE	from the vital presence of roots whose meaning is not yet exhausted but which are ever ready for new uses , and suggest more than they strictly express .

		Such language is fitted for poetry and philosophy and all the higher uses of the imagination . ''

		* This very opulence unfits the German language and the Germanic element in our own language for the strictness of science .

		Vague and sometimes ridiculous are the scientific terms of the Teuton : coal-stuff \ sour-stuff , water-stuff , and stifle-stuff sound queerly enough to any but a Ger - man chemist , however much poetry and philosophy may delight in such word-formation from within .

		The English language , occupying as it does , with respect to this power of word-formation , an inter - mediate position between the French , all of whose roots are as dead as so many dry sticks and as un - able to grow together , and the German , whose roots are still pulsating with life , possesses many of the advantages , while it avoids many of the defects , of each .

		The peculiar excellence and distinctive charac - teristic of our tongue is its wealth of vocabulary and the variety of its phraseology , its ability to assume at will the light graceful flow of the Romance lan - * '' The Science of Thought , '' p. 71 .

		guages , or the slower and heavier measure of the north-European tongues .

		It is a language most admirably adapted , from the very nature and his - tory of its formation , to voice our joyful moods and to express our more serious thoughts .

		In it the sunny South and the cloudy
Northland	ORGANIZATION	meet and unite .

		By all means cultivate the Old English ele - ment in our speech , and hold fast to what northern
Europe	LOCATION	has contributed to it ; but do not despise and allow to become obsolete all that lighter , more flexible and moi-e musical element which the south - ern races have given for our use .

		The writer of the article under discussion claims , and not without reason , that native English words and formations are more `` virile . ''

		-LRB- Why , then , not use the good Old English word manly f -RRB- He also maintains that they open to the poet `` larger possibilities for mel - ody and harmony . ''

		Without dwelling on the cu - rious fact that he has expressed these poetic possi - bilities in a string , of Latin and Greek derivatives , we may yet question whether any language , or ele - ment of a language , of north-European origin and growth , will prove its superiority , in point of mel - ody and harmony , to the south-European languages and the Romance element of our own English as spoken to-day .

		To turn to the modern developments of science , and the increasingly prominent part which scientific terms play , not only in our daily conversation and in our technical literature , but also in the imagery of our poetry and fiction , what could we do without the French and Latin and Greek words which we have made our own , and which have become almost as familiar and necessary as mother , father , hearth , and hornet Why , then , deplore the combination of these Romance with the older Teutonic elements in our language , a union which makes it superior to either French or German taken alone , and gives it no small degree of the power and usefulness of both taken together ?

		One might as reasonably ad - vocate the uprooting of those Old English radicals which , however admirably fitted for purposes of poetry and philosophy , are worse than useless when we turn our conversation to the telautograph , the kinetoscope , alternating currents , and electric mo - tors .

		The genius of a people portrays itself in the lan - guage spoken by that people ; and , conversely , a language tends to mould the character of those who speak it .

		As our tongue has drawn abundantly from all that northern and all that southern
Europe	LOCATION	has to offer , so it is spoken by a many-sided race , as able to conquer and colonize the habitable globe as its speech is to spread over large areas of both hemispheres .

		If in-breeding be injurious to ani - mals and plants , and sure to result at last in the ex - tinction of the in-bred species , why may it not be equally harmful for languages to depend , to any considerable extent , on growth from within ?

		In - stead of hoping for a renascence of a pure unmixed Old English , let us continue to engraft on the par - 206 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, ent stock all that is best in other tongues .

		It is thus that English has grown from the time of the
Norman Conquest	ORGANIZATION	, when it was spoken by a few thousand semi-barbarians , to the present time , when it is the language , or , at least , is understood by , nearly three hundred millions of people .

		It is its glory and charm that it has taken of the best that other languages had to give ; it has profited by their experience and adopted freely of their words and idioms , without surrendering anything of worth in its native growth .

		Let us examine some of the passages from mod - ern writers , quoted as illustrating this '' renascence in English . ''

		From Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	we read the fol - lowing : '' As he spoke the fog was blown into shreds , and we saw the sea , gray with mud , rolling on every side of us and empty of all life .

		Then in one spot it bubbled and became like the pot of ointment that the
Bible	LOCATION	speaks of .

		From that wide-ringed trouble a Thing came up a gray and red Thing with a neck a Thing that bellowed and writhed in pain . ''

		Is this style of composition any more '' virile , '' is its imagery more pleasing or more vivid , than that revealed in the works of some of the great earlier writers who knew nothing of this `` renascence '' ?

		Opening one of the
Waverley Novels	ORGANIZATION	at random , we hit upon the following bit of description : '' The path soon led deeper into the woodland , and crossed more than one brook , the approach to which was rendered perilous by the marshes through which it flowed ; but the stranger seemed to know , as if by instinct , the soundest ground and the safest points of passage , and by dint of caution and attention , brought the party safely into a wilder avenue than any they had yet seen ; and pointing to a large low irregular building at the upper extremity , he said to the Prior , ' Yonder is Rotherwood , the dwelling of Cedric the
Saxon	PERSON	' . ''

		Can we wish any alteration of even a word in this ?

		Is not the English of Addison as nearly perfect as we can conceive language to be , and the easy flow of
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's prose as faultless as it could well be made ?

		Even pedantic old
Johnson	PERSON	has plenty of the '' virile '' in his style , despite the scarcity of old English words , and there is grace and harmony and balance at the same time .

		Recall for a moment his well-known comparison of Pope and
Dryden	PERSON	, and see whether it could in any way be altered for the better : `` The style of Drydeu is capricious aud varied ; that of Pope is cautious and uniform .


Dryden	PERSON	obeys the motions of his own mind ; Pope constrains his mind to his own rules of composition .

		Dryden is sometimes vehement and rapid ; Pope is always smooth , uniform and gentle .


Dryden	PERSON	's page is a natural field , rising into inequalities , and diversified by the varied exuberance of abundant vegetation ; Pope 's is a velvet lawn , shaven by the scythe and levelled by the roller . ''

		The poetry of the first part of the century , of the Lake poets , is contrasted with that of the genera - tion subsequent to
William Morris	PERSON	and
Swinburne	PERSON	, and the reader is told that '' Compared with these men in their typical manner , the poetry of the great earlier men
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	, and
Shelley	PERSON	shows a startling differ - ence in regard to the relative prominence of native En - glish words and formations .

		They had not the advan - tage of the popularization of younger literature which has since transpired -LSB- sic -RSB- .

		And the latter-day bards , the generation subsequent to the Morris-Swinburne time , reveal this influence more and more , just in pro- portion as they are virile and awake to larger possibili - ties for melody aud harmony now open to English . ''

		Alas !

		poor
Wordsworth	PERSON	, poor
Coleridge !	ORGANIZATION

		They had to write the '' Lyrical Ballads '' without ever having seen one of the '' Barrack-Room Ballads . ''

		They had not the advantage of the popularization of younger literature .

		Probably the possibility of such lines as the following , quoted from Mr.
Kip	PERSON	- ling by the author of '' The Renascence in English , '' had never dawned upon them : '' Oh , was I born of womankind , and did I play alone ?

		For I have dreamed of playmates twain that bit me to the bone .

		And did I break the barley bread and steep it in the tyre ?

		For I have dreamed of a youngling kid new riven from the byre , An hour it lacks and an hour it lacks to the rising of the moon ; But I can see the black roof-beams as plain as it were noon . ''

		Our unfortunate
Wordsworth	PERSON	was forced to content himself with turning out such lines as the following , from
4i Tintern Abbey	ORGANIZATION	'' : '' The sounding cataract Haunted me like a passion ; the tall rock , The mountain , and the deep and gloomy wood , Their colours and their forms , were then to me An appetite , a feeling and a love , That had no need of a remoter charm By thoughts supplied , nor any interest Unborrowed from the eye .

		A sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused , Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns , And the round ocean and the living air And the blue sky , and in the mind of man , A motion and a spirit , that impels All thinking things , all objects of all thought , And rolls through all things . ''

		The following passage from
Marsh	ORGANIZATION	's '' Origin and History of the English Language '' may be of interest as touching on the causes which led to the adoption of foreign words : '' The birth or revival of a truly national and peculiar literature is generally contemporaneous with an enlarge - ment of the vocabulary , by foreign importation , or by the resuscitation of obsolete words of native growth .

		It is not always easy to say whether this extensiou of the means of expression is the cause or the consequence of the conception and familiarization of new ideas ; but , in any event , new thoughts and new words are neces - sarily connected , if not twin-born ... The want of a sufficient nomenclature and the convenience of rhyme and metre , as is very clearly seen in all the older En - glish versions , naturally led to the employment of many French words . ''

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 207 In view of this '' want of a sufficient nomencla - ture , '' what can it profit our language to cultivate a preference for old English terms whose inadequacy has been proved by centuries of experience ?

		What advantages of clearness or picturesqueness or even of strength did the historian
Freeman	PERSON	hope to gain by carrying his preference for native English words so far as to repeat the same substantive or verb or adjective again and again in the same passage , rather than use a synonym of foreign growth ?

		The conditions of early English life were too cramped and primitive to admit of the formation of a vocabulary at all adequate to our needs .

		The necessity which our literature felt for a proper medium of expression worked out its own relief by laying hold of words wherever they came most readily to hand , whether from without or from within .

		It was so in
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's time , and it will continue to be so as long as our language is spoken and written .

		Permit me to call your attention to the fact that '' The Journal of

		And , speaking of
Poe	PERSON	, your readers may be interested to know that the manuscript of '' The Bells , '' as finally sent by him to the printer , saving only the last four lines , is still in existence .

		It is in the form of his famous rolls , written on pale-blue paper , the fragments sheets and parts of sheets pasted together , end to end , and shows the printers ' thumbing .

		It is the more interest - ing , from the erasures , interlineations , and alterations of the author .

		Inasmuch as certain peculiar italicising in the manuscript does not appear in any printed copy I have ever seen , it is evident that
Poe	PERSON	continued to polish and refine the poem in the proofs .

		I am not sure that the poem gained by the omission of the italics in the line : '' What & world of merriment its melody foretells . ''

		There is an unusualness in that italicised word quite characteristic of

		`` THE DECADENCE OF A SCHOLAR . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have read with interest a cleverly written sally in your issue of
October 1	DATE	, entitled `` The Decadence of a Scholar . ''

		While there is a leaven of wholesome truth in the sketch , it seems to me nevertheless to contain an implication -LRB- perhaps unintended -RRB- not at all palatable or flattering to a considerable class of your readers and contributors .

		If the usual method of securing and hold - ing professorships in American colleges be really such as Mr.
Reeves	PERSON	intimates , then the plain inference is that our college professors are on the whole anything but the high-tninded and independent body of men we are accustomed to think them .

		For may we not infer from Mr.
Reeves	PERSON	's pathetic picture of the '' decadence '' of the once proud-spirited ''
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- whose '' scientific vigils '' in
Germany	LOCATION	, by-the-bye , would seem to have made him more or less of a prig -RRB- that in our country professorships , formerly '' plums , ready to fall into the hands of him who had most conscientiously prepared himself , '' are now the spoils of men who sink their re - spect for themselves and their calling by truckling to politicians , and making , not truth , but expediency and popularity , the rule of their teachings .

		Now I should be extremely sorry to think that even a small minority of the professors in our universities owe their positions to having '' cultivated
Wilcox	PERSON	, '' or hold them by the ignoble tenure of attuning their teachings to the cur - rent '' political timbre . ''

		The fact is , there is no consid - erable class or corps in this country -LRB- except perhaps the clergy -RRB- so widely and proverbially remote from the in - fluence and sphere of action of political Wilcoxes as the one impliedly touched by Mr.
Reeves	PERSON	; and the road to preferment taken by the hypothetical ''
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	'' is , I venture to say , in the region of fact quite as un - usual as it is abject .

		Self-satisfied and inexperienced young men like Mr. ''
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, '' who emerge from the universities with a blissful sense of their own compe - tency to lift up and enlighten an unregenerate world , are , it is true , usually obliged to dismount from their stilts and condescend to make some advances to people in a position to help them to the object of their wishes .

		But they need not , like Mr. ''
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, '' sacrifice their self-respect and mental independence in doing so .

CALIFORNIA	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		A paragraph has been going the rounds of the
East	LOCATION	- ern press , and found its way into the last issue of THE DIAL , to the effect that the Regents of the
University of California	ORGANIZATION	have decided to remove the home of the
University	ORGANIZATION	from
Berkeley	LOCATION	to
San Francisco	LOCATION	, and have accepted the offer of Mayor Sutro of thirteen acres of ground as a site for the new buildings .

		Permit me to say that this statement is incorrect .

		The
University of California	ORGANIZATION	consists of the
Colleges of General Culture	ORGANIZATION	, located in
Berkeley	LOCATION	; and the affiliated Colleges of Law , Medicine , Dentistry , Pharmacy , and Art , which have always been located in
Sail Francisco	LOCATION	.

		The Colleges of
General Culture	ORGANIZATION	have their home in half a dozen or more spacious buildings in
Berkeley	LOCATION	, the number of which is being constantly increased .

		The work of the affiliated colleges has heretofore been done in rented buildings .

		The last legislature appropriated
$ 250,000	MONEY	for the erection of buildings that should belong to the state , in which the work of these affiliated colleges should be done .

		The thirteen acres offered by
Mayor Sutro	ORGANIZATION	, and accepted by the
Board of Regents	ORGANIZATION	, are offered as a site for these new buildings , and have nothing to do with the location of the
University	ORGANIZATION	proper the Col - leges of

		FLAUBERT 'S JJIFE AND LETTERS .

		* The volume containing the life and letters of
Gustave Flaubert	PERSON	will come with a quicken - ing appeal to the average reader of French lit - erature , who may have pushed his way with deepening repugnance through ''
Madame Bo	PERSON	- vary , '' or been awe-stricken but fatal defect not interested by the piled-up erudition of '' Salammbo . ''

		This average reader , repre - sentative of the great middle-class which Flau - bert detested so cordially , will probably rise from the perusal of Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	's volume with the assurance that
Flaubert	PERSON	's life is more in - teresting than his writings .

		It was a life lived through the sixty years -LRB- 18211880 -RRB- which were the heart of the cen - tury .

		The Bourbons , the Republic , the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	, the Prussian invasion , the
Commune	ORGANIZATION	, the new Republic ,
Flaubert	PERSON	saw them all , and their effects on
France	LOCATION	; and his pictures from the comedie humaine are colored accordingly .

		Yet in itself , the current of his life ran smoothly enough .

		Possessed of a comfortable fortune , never marrying , a devoted son to his widowed mother in their peaceful
Norman	PERSON	home near
Rouen	LOCATION	, it is obvious that
Flaubert	PERSON	's fascination for us is one of personality , not of environment .

		Impetuous in his affections , sweeping in his judgments , boisterous even to horse-play in his humor , he was superlative in everything .

		This fluffy-haired giant could devote three hours to a practical joke on a friend , or six years to the production of a book .

		What extremes he was capable of may be illustrated by Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	's account of an inci - dent in
Flaubert	LOCATION	's Wanderjahre , when he and his friend
Maxime Ducamp	PERSON	were making a pedestrian tour through
Brittany	PERSON	. ''

		At a fair at Gue * rand the travelers came upon a man who was showing a monstrosity or a pair of monstros - ities for authorities differ on this point .

		According to Ducamp , the ' young phenomenon ' was a sheep with five legs and a stiff tail ; according to Flaubert there were two , a cow and a sheep , ' wearing one arm , four shoulders , ' as the showman stated .

		Flaubert fell in love with the ' young phenomenon , ' made much of the showman ; would have him to dine , when he got abom - inably drunk ; encouraged him to write to
King Louis Philippe	LOCATION	; declared that he would make his fortune .

		For days the joke lasted .

		He could talk of nothing but the ` young phenomenon ' ; would stop in the mid - dle of the road and exhibit poor Ducamp , in the style *
GUSTAVE FLAUBERT	PERSON	, AS SEEN IN HIS WORKS AND COR - RESPONDENCE .

		By
John Charles Tarver	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:

		of the showman , to the trees and hedges as ' the young phenomenon . '

		At
Brest	LOCATION	he encountered the ` young phenomenon ' again , who had united his , or their , forces with a dancing bear , some performing dogs , a donkey , and a pack of fighting mongrels .

		Again the hospitali - ties of Flaubert proved too much for the sobriety of the showman .

		A year later ,
Maxime Ducamp	PERSON	was lying ill at
Paris	LOCATION	, having been wounded in the tumults of '48 ; he was one day disturbed by hearing a strange confu - sion of sounds on his staircase , pushing , struggling , suppressed explosions .

		Suddenly the door flew open , and Flaubert appeared : ` Gentlemen , allow me to intro - duce to you the young phenomenon ; it is three years old , has been approved by the
Academy of Medicine	ORGANIZATION	, and been honored by the presence of several crowned heads . '

		Flaubert had discovered his old friend at a fair in some part of
Paris	LOCATION	, and spent a hundred francs for the pleasure of this private exhibition . ''

		Compare with this the following bit of ele - giac musing over
Chateaubriand	LOCATION	's tomb at
St. Malo	ORGANIZATION	, visited by the two friends a few days after their meeting with the '' young phenom - enon '' : '' There he will sleep , his head turned to the West , in the tomb built on a cliff , his immortality will be like his life , deserted of all and surrounded by storms .

		The waves with the centuries will long murmur round this great monument ; they will
spring	DATE	to his feet in the tempests , or in the
summer	DATE	mornings , when the white sails are spread and the swallow comes from beyond the seas , long and gentle , they will bring him the voluptu - ous melancholy of distances , and the caress of the open air .

		And the days thus slipping by , while the billows of his native beach shall be forever swinging between his birthplace and his tomb , the heart of Rend , cold at last , will slowly crumble into nothingness to the endless rhythm of that eternal music . ''

		Which seems to justify his friend Bouilhet in calling him a lyric poet , though he could not write a verse .

		Flaubert thus characterizes himself as a hater of the commonplace , and a lover of the beautiful : '' And now what I like above everything is form , pro- vided that it be beautiful , and nothing more ... For me there is nothing in the world except beautiful verses , well-turned , harmonious , resonant phrases , glorious sun - sets , moonlight , coloured paintings , antique marbles , and shapely heads .

		Beyond that , nothing .

		... In all pol - itics there is only one thing that I understand , revolt .

		Fatalist as a Turk , I believe that all that we may do for the progress of humanity , or anything else , comes to absolutely the same thing .

		As for this ' progress , ' my understanding is a bit obtuse for things that are not quite clear .

		All that has to do with that way of talk - ing fatigues me immeasurably . ''

		His genius ripened slowly into adequate ex - pression .

		At the age of twenty-eight , he had published nothing of importance , though the '' Temptation of St. Anthony '' had been com - pleted and read in MS. to his intimate friends Ducamp and Bouilhet .

		It is interesting to re - call the scene :
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 209 '' Early in the autumn -LRB- of
1849	DATE	-RRB- Flaubert wrote to Ducamp , ' the Temptation is finished , come ! '

		Dueamp started at once for Croisset ; found Bouilhet already established there ; and the reading began .

		It lasted four days ; eight hours a day ; from mid-day till four in the afternoon ; from eight in the
evening till midnight	TIME	.

		At the beginning ,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, waving the pages above his head , cried : ' If you do not utter howls of enthusiasm , the reason is that nothing is capable of moving you . '

		For two-and-thirty hours the friends listened in silence ; at the end of each reading Madame Flaubert -LRB- his mother -RRB- used to inquire ' Well ? '

		and they had no reply to make .

		Before the last sitting Ducamp and Bouilhet conferred privately ; they determined to give their opin - ion frankly , without reserve ; the question of
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's literary future was at stake . ''

		That evening , after the last reading , towards mid - night ,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	, tapping on the table , said : ' Now , it is with the three of us , tell me frankly what you think . '

		Bouilhet replied : We think you ought to throw it into the fire and never speak of , it again . '

		A conversation followed , which lasted till eight o'clock in the morning ; Flaubert at last , conquered rather than convinced , gave way . '

		St.
Anthony	PERSON	' was not burned but consigned to a drawer . '' ''

		Madame Bo vary '' is Flaubert 's best - known if not his greatest work .

		It is as dis - tinctive of him as '' Vanity Fair '' of Thack - eray or ''
Jane Eyre	PERSON	'' of
Miss Bronte	LOCATION	; and is simply unequalled as a searching and pitiless satire on provincial French life , which won for its author a place among the first literary names in
France	LOCATION	.

		It is impossible to reproduce here Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	's admirable summary of this Gallic '' Middlemarch '' ; nor is it desirable .

		The merits of the book are its penetration , its truth , its mastery of detail , not the sordid and repellant little lives and events transfixed for inspection , like an entomologist 's beetles .

		As to its '' realism '' much misunderstanding has been rife ; it is sufficient to accept Flaubert 's distinction -LRB- so often sharply insisted on by him -RRB- between the love of realism , and the love of the real : '' They think me in love with the real , whereas I ex - ecrate it : it is out of hatred of it that I have under - taken this book ... Do you really believe that this mean reality , whose reproduction disgusts you , does not make my gorge rise as much as yours ?

		If you knew me better , you would know that I hold the everyday life in detestation .

		Personally I have always kept myself as far away from it as I could .

		But aesthetically I wanted this time , and only this time , to exhaust it thoroughly . ''

		The success of '' Madame Bovary '' was too pronounced : its straightforward way of calling the French spade a spade was found by the
Government	ORGANIZATION	to be an outrage on morals and religion , and the author was prosecuted .

		On
January 23 , 1857	DATE	,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	writes to his old friend
Jules Cloquet	PERSON	: `` I beg to inform you that to-morrow , the twenty - fourth of
January	DATE	, I honor the criminals ' bench with my presence , sixth chamber of the executive police , at ten o'clock in the
morning	TIME	.

		Ladies are admitted ; cos - tumes must be decent and in good style . ''

		I do not count on any justice at all .

		I shall be condemned , and have to pay the highest possible fine perhaps ; a pleasant reward for my toils , noble encour - agement given to literature .

		But one thing consoles me for these stupidities ; it is that I have found so much sympathy with myself and my book .

		I count yours in the first rank , my dear friend .

		Now I defy the whole French magistracy , with its policemen , and the whole
Committee of Public Safety	ORGANIZATION	, including its spies , to write a novel which will please you as much as mine .

		These are the proud thoughts which I propose to cherish in my dungeon . ''

		The trial resulted in a sort of ambiguous ver - dict of '' Not guilty , but do n't do it again '' ; and the book was triumphantly advertised and widely sold .

		If Flaubert had kept to modern life in his next novel , we should have had a literary suc - cess instead of an antiquarian tour de force .

		But '' Salammbo '' called out certain qualities lavishly present in
Gustave Flaubert	PERSON	's make - up enormous industry , a relish of details , and a Victor Hugo-ish fondness for extravagant lists of recondite names and these fairly smother the story .

		Still ,
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	had felt that the book must be written , and fairly wreaked himself on it : we can only echo the wonder of
Henry James	PERSON	that '' a writer could spend such an infinity of talent in making himself unreadable . ''

		In the dark days of
1870	DATE	,
Flaubert	PERSON	was writing his '' Education Sentimentale , '' and incidentally girding at the fatuity of the '' mid - dle class people . ''

		The municipal council of
Rouen	LOCATION	had refused to allow space in the public square for a memorial to
Louis Bouilhet	LOCATION	,
Flau	PERSON	- bert 's poet-friend .

		This refusal drew from the novelist a slashing open letter , which con - cluded with the following vigorous indictment : `` There are seven hundred of you in the
National Assembly	ORGANIZATION	.

		How many of those are there who can tell the names of the principal treaties in our history , or the dates of six kings of
France	LOCATION	who know the first elements of political economy who have read even
Bastiat	PERSON	?

		The municipality of
Rouen	LOCATION	, which has denied as a body the merit of a poet , is possibly ignorant of the rules of versification .

		And it has no need to know them , so long as it does not meddle with verses .

		`` To be respected by what is below you , please to respect what is above you . ''

		Before sending the people to school , go there your - selves ! ''

		Enlightened classes , seek enlightenment ... Your whole intellectual effort consists in trembling before the future .

		Bethink yourselves of something else .

		Rouse yourselves , or
France	LOCATION	will soon sink deeper and deeper 210 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, into the gulf , between a hideous demagogy and a mind - less middle-class . ''

		To which Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	adds , not without mal - ice : '' Can this be that same French middle - class that Mr.
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	was wont to hold up to Englishmen as a brilliant example ? ''

		We must close this desultory notice with a few general remarks on this interesting pre - sentment of one of the most original and bril - liant of Frenchmen .

		Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	's aim , as announced in his preface , is to place the per - sonality of
Gustave Flaubert	PERSON	vividly before his readers .

		The book is essentially made up from the correspondence of Flaubert ; the edi - tor , with rare self-restraint , supplying only so much running comment and outline biography as will serve to make the letters intelligible and attractive .

		His work has been well done ; the apparently scrappy appearance of some of his interposed remarks is a necessary incident of his method .

		His comments on
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	's character and conduct , as well as his criticisms on the novels -LRB- full summaries of which are given -RRB- , seem , on the whole , eminently shrewd and just .

		His style is trenchant , almost epi - grammatic ; albeit disfigured for American eyes by the Briticism '' by way of '' -LRB- e. g. , '' Mile .

		Leroyer de Chantepie was by way of being an authoress , '' p. 228 -RRB- .

		The volume is handsomely printed and bound , contains two illustrations and a good index , and does credit to the publishers .

		Altogether , we may thank Mr.
Tarver	PERSON	for a distinct addi - tion to the literary biography of the century .

		has the publisher .

		A comparison of these three stately volumes with the plebeian single volume of the original edition of
1810	DATE	emphasizes the progress of book-making in the century .

		Dr.
Coues	PERSON	has appreciated the real function of ed - itorship in regard to such a work , and has cor - rected the misprints , solecisms , and faulty punctuation of the original .

		He has also re - constructed the arrangement .

		Pike 's hurriedly - made edition is composed of three parts -LRB- cor - responding to three stages of his travels -RRB- fol - lowed by three appendices in smaller type .

		As each of the parts is little more than a bare iter , and as the three appendices pertain re - spectively to these parts , adding to them much elaborative material of the nature of letters and reports , Dr.
Coues	PERSON	has placed each of them after its appropriate part , in uniform type , after arranging its documents in chronological order .

		The result is a well digested and most readable chronicle , instead of ill assorted bun - dles of information .

		To all the plates and maps of the first edition have been added an '' historico-geographical '' chart of the upper
Mississippi	LOCATION	, made under the direction of the editor , and a facsimile letter from
Pike	LOCATION	ac - knowledging to the Secretary of War his ap - pointment as major .

		The handwriting of this letter is admirable in its regularity .

		One looks for such a script from a clerk , but not from a soldier ; yet it is full of the forceful character of
Pike	LOCATION	.

		The editor passes from the lower to the higher elements of his work in an exhaustive name-index of one hundred pages , composing the third volume .

		The versatile editor must have been in one of his merriest moods when , in composing his preface , he characterized this index as '' exceptionally accurate , '' if accuracy includes arrangement as well as content and reference .

		In the two latter points , so far as ex - amination goes , it deserves the commendation ; but in the matter of arrangement it is cer - tainly most helpful when read straight through .

		`` Pike , Capt.

		R. , '' `` pike , a weapon , '' `` Pike bay . ''

		Yet , withal , this index is a most needful companion in searching among the riches accumulated in Dr.
Coues	PERSON	's notes .

		An important portion of the first volume is a biographical sketch of Pike , by Dr.
Coues	PERSON	, in which he says he has
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 211 used much hitherto unpublished documentary material , and other sources of information not before utilized ; and it is especially full in re - gard to the later years of Pike 's life .

		But it is sketchy and imperfect for the earlier life .

		On page 603 ,
Pike	PERSON	speaks of himself as '' hav - ing commanded for some time the post of Kas - kaskias . ''

		There is no mention of this fact in the biography .

		In fact , one can not there learn where he spent the first ten years of his mili - tary career with the exception of the years 1800-1801 .

		Nearly one-half of the text of these volumes is made up of critical and illustrative notes by the editor .

		Here is a great wealth of material geographical , topographical , ethnological , biographical , and linguistic , and here Dr.
Coues	PERSON	is a master .

		It is well known that
Pike	PERSON	's narrative covers two expeditions : one , by authority of the President , from
St. Louis	LOCATION	to the headwaters of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, in 1805-6 ; the other , under orders from General
Wilkin	PERSON	- son , the commander-in-chief , through
Louis	PERSON	- iana Territory to
Mexico	LOCATION	, in 1806-1807 .

		The first of these expeditions , as well as the con - temporaneous
Lewis	PERSON	and
Clark	PERSON	expedition , was part of a general plan of President
Jefferson	PERSON	, to take stock of his new purchase of half a continent ; and the second , although not or - dered by the President , was approved by him and had in the main the same object .

		The newly extended boundaries were to be brought out of the realm of conjecture into that of fact , and the Indian tribes were to be attached more closely to the national government .

		On the northern adventure , the British traders of the
Northwest Fur Company	ORGANIZATION	, who had entered into trade relations with our Indians and encroached somewhat upon our political prerogatives , were to be met ; in the
Southwest	LOCATION	, the Spaniards who were intriguing from
Santa	LOCATION	Fe were to be checkmated .

		Pike performed both missions with much intrepidity and tact , although the personal outcome of the first was more fortunate than of the second .

		In both cases , launching forth with a handful of soldiers into a practic - ally unknown wilderness , he endured physical ills as great as fall to the lot of most Arctic explorers .

		From the first journey he returned with laurels after eight months ; from the sec - ond he was sent back as a prisoner at the hands of the governor of
New Spain	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Coues	PERSON	, in the
summer of 1894	DATE	, in person retraced the entire boat - journey of Pike to the head waters of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, himself discovering the real sources ; and his voluminous notes cover nearly every acre of the route with the minutest de - tails of topography and previous visitations .

		Every collateral knowledge that in any wise may illustrate the main text is brought in ; and one leaves each stage for the next , feeling that nothing more could have been said .

		The jour - ney to the
Rio Grande	LOCATION	is handled in the same exhaustive way .

		The editor 's twenty years of army life on our western frontier enabled him at different times to visit nearly every portion of Pike 's route , and he has accumulated here also the same wealth of illustrative material .

		Not only has he shown a German industry in his commentary on his text , but he has shown the brilliancy of a Frenchman in his presenta - tion .

		His pathway sparkles with wit , and one follows him with unabated interest , and even ardor , to the end .

		Even the dreary wastes of an index are enlivened with such an explana - tory note as : '' The arrangement of the entries is intended to be strictly alphabetical , without regard to the logical order in which phrase - names and phrases would follow one another : thus ... various Sandy things interrupt the canon of Spanish saints whose names be - gin with San . ''

		One admirable note gives a complete history of the surveys in connection with the
Gadsden Purchase	LOCATION	boundary .

		Va - rious other notes are devoted to the linguistic and ethnic relations of our Indian tribes .

		No explorer has ever been more fully aided to ex - press himself through the ampler knowledges of the generations that come after him than in this case .

		It would be pleasant to end our review at this point .

		No allusion has yet been made to the spirit in which this critical work has been done ; and herein lies the deficiency of the edi - tor .

		Major Pike 's explorations bring one not merely into the fields of geography and ethnol - ogy , but are a part of the history of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		A critic who handles an historical theme , and deals with men and measures , should have the historical perception , as well as the ability to observe and relate natural phenomena .

		Yet there is no antinomy here .

		It is the true scientific vision that is needed in both cases the ability to see things in their relations .

		Dr.
Coues	PERSON	has established an international reputa - tion as a natural-science worker .

		Yet when he steps within the field of social phenomena , his manner is thoroughly unscientific .

		He does not seem to know that the idea of evolution , undoubtedly accepted by him in his own field of work , is also a fully accepted working prin - ciple in the social and historical field .

		His 212 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, special inability seems to be in the direction of an historic religion , and he is apparently unable to judge the religious perceptions of the sixteenth century
A.D.	LOCATION	, or of the sixteenth cen - tury
B.C.	LOCATION	, by any other standard than that of the latter part of the nineteenth century .

		Pike 's incidental remark that he is reading
Volney	PERSON	's '' Ruins '' is the occasion for half a page , in fine print , of atrabilious comment on the '' they '' who called Volney an infidel .

		Pike 's reference to '' a Reynard '' who professed not to believe in a hereafter brings out a page of abuse of the Hebrews , who '' invented very little except their precious
Jehovah	PERSON	, who was less polished and less agreeable a god than most of those who were elaborated by the more civilized tribes who surrounded and generally whipped the Jews . ''

		The `` Noachian narra - tion '' comes in for withering scorn , since '' the most credible items in this account are that the elephant took his trunk with him and stood behind it in the ark , but that the cock and the fox were worse off for baggage , having only a comb and a brush between them . ''

		There is a fling at '' the unisexual transports of the mor - bid imagination '' of the noble
Marquette	ORGANIZATION	whom the world will still continue to admire with the authority of Mr.
Parkman	PERSON	.

		In truth , in an - other note the whole effort of the
Roman Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	in behalf of the American Indian in
New Spain	LOCATION	, from
1537	DATE	to the present time , is brutually characterized as the work of '' the horde of corrupt , profligate and extortion - ate ecclesiastics who have cursed the country from that day to this . ''

		Poor Mr.
Schoolcraft	PERSON	is treated to two pages of belaboring , as '' a gentleman who was expert in expanding his own stock of information to the most volumin - ous proportions , and whose cacoethes scribendi , by dint of incessant scratching , finally devel - oped a case of pruritus senilis , marked by an acute mania for renaming things he had named years before , '' and who was true '' to the su - preme selfishness , inordinate vanity , vehement prejudices and conscientious narrow-minded - ness with which his all-wise and all-powerful Calvinistic creator had been graciously pleased to endow him . ''

		Dr.
Coues	PERSON	reminds one of
Carlyle	LOCATION	.

		He is fre - quently as brilliant , he is fully as prejudiced , and he is even more hopelessly dyspeptic .

		If he were content to gird only at those minds which to-day still trammel themselves with the limitations of Jahvism or of Calvinism , instead of accepting all the truth of God which our own favored age makes its own , we would pass him by silently .

		But as a visitor in the domain of history , he fails to grasp even a faint portion of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's wise words : '' Yet I doubt not thro ' the ages one increasing purpose runs .

		And the thoughts of men are widen 'd with the process of the suns . ''

		For he sins not only against the men who are the bystanders in his critical career through the ages : he sins against the hero of his tale as well .

		There is not a word , either in the text or in the critical notes , that bears any evidence to a fair mind of Pike 's knowledge of any nefarious scheme against
Mexico	LOCATION	on the part of his commanding officer .

		Yet the edi - tor assumes as fact what has never been proved although strongly suspected even of Wil - kinson ; and then carries over , by a sort of im - putation , the evil designs to the credit of Pike .

		There is again and again a disparagement of Pike by sinister interpretation , which is not justified by anything we know of him .

		In short , Dr.
Coues	PERSON	has laid down an admirable rule by which his critical estimates of men should have been and have not been guided , when he says , with the true scientific temper , in answer to aspersions upon
Beltrami	PERSON	's char - acter : '' With me the question is not one of
Beltrami	PERSON	's character , temperament , imagina - tion , sex-relations , etc. , but simply , What did he do about the
Mississippi	LOCATION	origines ? ''

		This work is one that we must ever prize highly as a treasury of multifarious knowledge , whilst we at the same time regret the limita - tions of the gifted editor .

		For a tolerant spirit , a disposition to entertain evidence for as well as against , and ability to discern the true grain amid the chaff and to recognize the achieve - ment of those who in earlier times without straw made the brick upon which we found , are essential qualifications of one who would really enter the field of historical criticism .

		THE DIAL 213 enthusiastic admirer of
Stambuloff	ORGANIZATION	's splendid fight against Russian influence , and of his con - structive work in building up a Bulgarian nation .

		The book is written with the sym - pathy necessary to a good biography , but the author 's admiration has not blinded him to the defects of his subject .

		The book is , from the English standpoint , and we believe from the world 's standpoint , a thoroughly good sketch of the political career of Stambuloff , and of the rise of independent
Bulgaria	LOCATION	.

		The life of Stambuloff was a stirring and a stormy one .

		Revolutionist at fourteen ,
Nihil	PERSON	- ist at eighteen and expelled from
Russia	LOCATION	, at twenty-one he was the life and centre of the revolutionary movement in
Bulgaria	LOCATION	against the oppression of the Turk .

		His whole time was spent in the work of organizing committees and planning futile risings , '' marked from the first by his imperious spirit and indomitable energy , as the natural champion of Bulgarian independence . ''

		The Russo-Turkish war of 1877-78 gave
Bulgaria	LOCATION	practical independence from
Turkey	LOCATION	, but she was sadly lacking in men with the requisite knowledge and training to manage her affairs .

		But this lack of experience in po - litical life only intensified political passion , and degraded party contests into personal and fac - tional strife .

		Two parties contested bitterly for supremacy , the
National	ORGANIZATION	and the
Russo	PERSON	- phile .

		In this contest ,
Stambuloff	PERSON	soon emerged as the National leader , as ardent an opponent of
Russia	LOCATION	, the new foe of Bulgarian indepen - dence , as he had been of
Turkey	LOCATION	in former days .

		From this time the history of
Bulgaria	LOCATION	cen - tres in him until his fall in
1894	DATE	.

		The Czar seemed to have the little state in his power , when he had punished Prince Alexander by forcing his abdication ; but he had not taken sufficient account of this young man , then only thirty-two years old .

		He was Regent during those critical and exciting days , and during the interregnum until Ferdinand was hunted up , elected , and invested with power .

		The course of
Russia	LOCATION	toward
Bulgaria	LOCATION	, her dog-in-the-man - ger policy , can never be anything but a dis - credit to the late Czar .

		The plots formed and attempts made to destroy the national govern - ment and crush the rising national spirit were unworthy of a civilized ruler .

		The thwarting of these , in addition to the government of the turbulent country , was a heavy task , and the splendid success attained will be
Stambuloff	ORGANIZATION	's permanent monument in history .

		Yet there is another side , and Mr.
Beaman	PERSON	does not attempt to hide it .

		Stambuloff was arbitrary , unwilling to yield in any point , but bound to override all opposition .

		No prince could long endure the masterful rule of such a premier , nor could associates who were un - willing to be mere clerks serve under him long .

		He was a patriot to the last drop of his blood , and had the insight of a real statesman .

		He would not yield , because he knew his policy to be the best for his country .

		Yet his rough disregard and insolent treatment of his col - leagues and his prince made enemies that fin - ally overthrew him , and wrecked , for a time at least , the policy his heart was set on .

		The persecution visited upon him when once his position had been undermined , and the subse - quent horrible assassination directly instigated by
Prince Ferdinand	LOCATION	, show this prince to be one of the meanest men that ever filled a throne .

		Nor can
Russia	LOCATION	be freed from the stain of complicity in ^ these base deeds .

		Though
Stambuloff	PERSON	was harsh in his treat - ment of opponents and arbitrary in his man - agement of the government , he must be judged , not by Western standards , but by his surround - ings as the head of a youthful nation just emerging from the despotism of the Turk into self-government and constitutional methods of political life .

		So judged , much that we con - demn in his course will disappear , while his achievements will deserve higher praise from the disadvantages under which he worked .

S. R. Driver	PERSON	,
D.D. New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		214 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, and simple ; if we render them in another and more authoritative form , as we deem it the proof be - comes much more complicated and difficult .

		The key to our exegesis and our evidences is one and the same : our notion of inspiration .

		If the inspira - tion we accept and enforce is one of authority in any degree beyond that which attaches to the Scrip - tural declarations themselves , then this authority , both as to its validity and its extent , puts us con - stantly in a defensive attitude , and becomes a very exacting element in our exegetical and in our his - torical rendering of religious truth .

		If , on the other hand , the Scriptures hold their moral proof and power within themselves , we at once attain freedom in our reconstruction of the events under which they have arisen .

		The mind and heart are simply dealing with their own in all Scriptural inquiry .

		The prevalent notion of inspiration has arisen chiefly in behalf of authority ; and yet the corrected view gives a far more stable and undeniable hold of the truth on the mind .

		We can neither palter with nor escape that which declares itself as light within our own spiritual consciousness .

		Between two spiritual summits , men ` have mistaken the lower one for the higher one .

		As their better measure - ments correct their error , they begin silently to for - sake the one and seek the other .

		That mind is in - spired which is acting with God , the medium of communication being simply the truth .

		We can not leave the question of inspiration with a vague an - swer , and then pass on to interpretation .

		We must know at the beginning of our exegesis what author - ity to attach to it . ''

		The Breath of God '' is a prolonged rhetorical rhapsody .

		This is a remark of description , not of censure .

		Those who wish an effusive and impres - sional statement of the Bible and its services will find it in this volume .

		The fact is sufficiently in - dicated by a portion of the titles of successive chap - ters : '' King Liber , '' '' His Courtiers , '' '' His Critics , '' '' His Blemishes , '' '' His Exaltation , '' '' His Power . '' ''

		Christian Evidences '' is a very concise presen - tation of the proofs of Christianity , and one at the same time comprehensive and discriminating .

		It rests upon lectures given by Dr.
Robinson	PERSON	as an instructor , and is rather a comprehensive statement of their substance than the full text .

		The stand - point of the author is that of liberal orthodoxy , and the weight of emphasis is laid on the completeness of Christian truth and its power to assert itself ; its power to master , guide , and build up the human spirit .

		The perennial vitality of Christian faith is the force of the volume . ''

		Religious Doubt '' is a kindly and painstaking book , and , from the author 's point of view , compre - hensive .

		Yet it is fitted to interest only a limited number who share the religious prepossessions on which it rests .

		There are two kinds of doubt : one arising from the strong independent action of the mind , and another due to its hesitancy and weak - ness .

		One is incident to growth , the other follows on the decay or perversion or misdirection of powers .

		It is the second of these that the author treats so fully .

		Doubt is with him much of the nature of disease ; and though he is tender and patient in its treatment , he does not see that we have no other designation than that of doubt for a most robust and profitable frame of mind .

		The philosophy of the author prepares the way for this restricted view .

		Faith is , with him , a special power transcending reason , and making its own revelations .

		Not to have this power , therefore , in full and fortunate ac - tion , is simply and necessarily an evil .

		The higher truths of religion are its proper objects , and the ac - ceptance of these truths is evidence of a vigorous fulfilment of its functions .

		To those who regard faith as one form or direction in which our intel - lectual powers find expression , and who think that this expression is sure to be inadequate and may be false , the whole question of doubt assumes wider scope and demands different treatment .

		We make haste to affirm the ability and insight of the author of '' Doctrine and Life . ''

		It is a book sure to receive and reward the diligent perusal of a large class of readers .

		We wish to secure , by this concession , a brief space for criticism .

		The title of the book , '' Doctrine and Life , '' the preface , and the first chapter prepared us to expect , in the discussion that was to follow , a close connection be - tween Christian doctrine and Christian life .

		The author disappointed us in this respect .

		We turned eagerly to such chapters as those on '' The Trinity , '' '' The Person of Christ , '' '' The Atonement , '' to see in what way these current dogmas now involved any refreshment to feeling and action .

		We found little in them beyond a softened and persuasive rep - resentation of the doctrines themselves .

		What we doubt is the present ministration of these dogmas to an enlarged spiritual life .

		This doubt the author leaves much as he finds it .

		He is disposed to waive any statement of the doctrine of inspiration , as a dogma that does not admit of any final determina - tion .

		In this he overlooks the fact that we can not so much as enter on interpretation till we know what is to be conceded to simple authority .

		The author thinks that Christian doctrine may be '' above and beyond reason . ''

		Now , if we mean by reason as we well may the entire hold of the mind on truth , then a dogma which transcends reason can not be nutritious in spiritual life .

		It is , in that very degree , unmanageable intellectually indigestible . ''

		Outlines of Social Theology '' is a work , in the purpose indicated , not unlike '' Doctrine and Life . '' ''

		This little book aims to point out the logical re - lations in which the doctrines of theology will stand to each other when the time shall come again for seeing Christian truth in the light of reason , and Christian life as the embodiment of love '' -LRB- Preface , page v. -RRB- .

		The difference between them lies in the fact that President
Hyde	PERSON	has thrown his full strength into the social force of religious truth , and so has wrought out a stirring exposition of the existing re -

		THE DIAL 215 lation of duty and belief .

		From our own point of view , we can but give the book a most cordial com - mendation .

		Our slight criticism would be that the author is anxious , too anxious , to impart the current cast of thought to the doctrine involved in his own presentation .

		The book is divided into three part : Theological , Anthropological , Sociological .

		Each of these again falls into three portions .

		The first , or theological part , involves the doctrine of the
Trinity	ORGANIZATION	in a somewhat fanciful way .

		Professor Ste - vens hardly reaches the urgent social life that is upon us .

		President
Hyde	PERSON	is unwilling to seem to leave behind him the .

		doctrinal life which has so stirred and ruled the world hitherto .

		Is not the real relation evolutionary ?

		Our acceptance of purer spiritual truth is not a desertion of dogma .

		It is allowing dogma to burst its integuments , and grow .

		We have no need to trouble ourselves about any identity in substance or in form between the seed and the plant which springs from it .

		The true de - pendence is that of genetic transition .

		The book is one of enthusiasms quite as much as of thoughts ; the author uses words freely , and gives the words he uses a wide range .

		Many practical questions as the unity of the church are treated very incis - ively .

		The entire temper of the volume is fitted to strengthen the mind and bear it forward .

		The three remaining volumes on our list are pri - marily exegetical .

		The first of the three , '' The Messiah of the Apostles , '' is present in completion of two previous works by Professor
Briggs	PERSON	, and gives the promise of two more volumes .

		The work of Professor
Briggs	PERSON	is so thorough and candid as to command at once respect and attention .

		The va - riety in the views entertained by the authors of the New Testament of the nature and office of Christ and of his character as the Messiah is fully brought out .

		The work also contains an interesting discussion of the Apocalypse of
John	PERSON	.

		The author accepts the theory that this is made up of different original documents , put together in the present form by a series of editors .

		It is resolved into six parts : the Apocalypse of the Beasts , of the
Dragon	ORGANIZATION	, of the Trumpets , of the Seals , of the Bowls , of the Epis - tles . ''

		St.
John	PERSON	's Gospel '' presents a large amount of matter in a clear , compact form , and in a discrim - inating way .

		The book is scholarly and earnest .

		It accepts the prevalent opinion as to the origin of the
Gospel	ORGANIZATION	.

		The first hundred and seventy-nine pages are occupied with a discussion of the authen - ticity and character of the Gospel .

		In these pages , the author reviews the objections to its authenticity and the proofs in its favor , and discusses at large the Gospel itself .

		The last seventy pages give the Greek text with a literal interlinear translation .

		The text of the authorized version is given in the mar - gin , and the various readings at the bottom of the page .

		The volume puts the reader in possession of a large amount of material .

		In `` The International Critical Commentary , ''
Deuteronomy	LOCATION	is the first of a series , whose an - nouncements already extend to twenty - eight vol - umes .

		The entire series will stand for an amount of labor and inquiry that is startling .

		The material is so abundant and varied in this first volume as to make the book one for protracted study , for refer - ence and consultation , rather than one for perusal .

		The minister must be well endowed who can make use of a fraction of what is here provided .

		The spirit is of the most catholic and liberal order , and aims to give all opinions due weight .

		Besides the Commentary of four hundred and twenty-seven pages , the volume contains an introductory discus - sion of
Deuteronomy	LOCATION	of ninety-five pages , treating in a very full manner its authorship , date , charac - ter .

		The purchaser of this volume is only too likely to be buried beneath the wealth of his reward .

		It was well that the Commentary on
Deuteronomy	LOCATION	should have been the first of the series to be issued , as it holds , perhaps more than any other book in the Old Testament , the key of interpretation , and determines later conclusions .

		The peerless manner in which Professor Driver has executed his work inspires some fear for those who are to follow him .

		JOHN BASCOM .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		So long as Mr.
Richard Harding Davis	PERSON	continues to produce such fresh and spirited work as his '' About Paris '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , his vogue will stand in little danger of abatement .

		Mr.
Davis	PERSON	is a wide - awake traveller , with a keen eye for the salient and the bizarre .

		He does not affect to resolve French humanity into its last elements , or to cut very deep into social metaphysics ; but he sets the outward and visible signs of things before us with much distinctness .

		Mr.
Davis	PERSON	is a comparatively young man , with a young man 's taste for novelty , and capacity of enjoyment .

		Even the worn attrac - tions of the cafes chantants , and the terpsichorean revels of the
Mabille	PERSON	and the
Moulin Rouge	LOCATION	, do not appear to strike him as yet with a sense of hollow - ness ; and the zest with which his scientific researches among still more risques haunts of pleasure-loving
Paris	LOCATION	have been pursued is happily reflected in his style .

		Mr.
Davis	PERSON	has a due sense of personal and national humors and oddities witness his English tourists dressed -LRB- for the boulevards -RRB- '' in flannel shirts and hunting-caps and knickerbockers , exactly as if they were penetrating the mountains of Af - ghanistan or the deserts of
Syria	LOCATION	'' ; the young man who objected to Casimir-Perier as a presidential candidate because he was rich , but who '' withdrew his objection when an older man in a blouse pointed out that Casimir-Perier would make an excellent appearance on horseback '' ; the Deputy -LRB- a belated Montagnard , evidently -RRB- who refused to announce his vote , on the roll-call , '' until he was addressed 216 -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, as ' citizen ' , and not as ' monsieur ' '' ; the budding connoisseur -LRB- supported at
Paris	LOCATION	by a fond aunt in
Kansas City	LOCATION	-RRB- who superbly damns a picture '' by waving his thumb in the air at it , and saying , ' it has a little too much of that , ' with a downward sweep of the thumb , ' and not enough of this , ' with an upward sweep . ''

		A capital story is that of
Pierre Loti	PERSON	's admission to the
Academy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The newly-elected Immortal , it seems , in his maiden address , '' instead of eulogizing the man whose place he had taken , lauded his own methods and style of composition so greatly that when the second member arose he prefaced his remarks by suggest - ing that '
M. Loti	PERSON	has said so much for himself that he has left me nothing to add . ' ''

		The contents of the volume are divided into five chapters : '' The Streets of
Paris	LOCATION	'' ; '' The Show Places of
Paris	LOCATION	'' ; ''
Paris	LOCATION	in Mourning '' ; '' The Grand Prix and Other Prizes '' ; '' Americans in
Paris	LOCATION	. ''

		The book is prettily bound , and passably illustrated by Mr.
C. D. Gibson	PERSON	.

		The Women of ''
Margaret Winthrop	PERSON	, '' a biograph - Coioniai and Revo - ical sketch of the estimable wife of Governor
John Winthrop	PERSON	of Mass - achusetts , is the initial volume of a promising series of portraits of distinguished '' Women of Colonial and Revolutionary Times , '' now issuing from the press of Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The book is from the accomplished pen of Mrs.
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	, who , we need not say , sets for the authors of the forthcoming volumes a desirable standard of form and quality .

		The object of the series is twofold : biographical and historical .

		Each volume , besides portraying the individual from whom it takes its title , is designed to serve as a study of the social life and customs of a special class , period , and geographical section .

		In Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	's work , for instance , we are shown , in the first half of the volume , the domestic manners of Puritan England under James I. -LRB- Mrs.
Winthrop	PERSON	not following her husband over seas until some years after his arrival in the
Colony	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , as exhibited in the home life of a country housewife and lady of the manor ; and , in the second half , the correspond - ing phase of life in early colonial
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Mrs.
Earle	PERSON	has done her work in her usual thorough way , sparing no pains in the way of research among the authorities , and freely interlarding her narrative with extracts from unfamiliar and out-of-the-way sources letters , journals , inventories , family ex - pense accounts , and what not .

		Outwardly , the volume -LRB- a shapely , well-printed duodecimo , prettily bound in crimson linen with plain gold lettering -RRB- is a model of taste ; and altogether the publishers are to be congratulated on the conception , and -LRB- thus far -RRB- the execution , of their venture .

		Each volume will contain either a frontispiece portrait , or , where no portrait is procurable , a facsimile reproduction .

		That Mrs.

		Mr.
Le	PERSON	- land 's book differs from the familiar works of such writers as Mr.
Hare	PERSON	, Mr.
Scaife	PERSON	, and the sisters
Horner	PERSON	, in that its contents are derived , not from authentic records , but from the people themselves the sole exceptions being certain racy anecdotes taken from antique jest-books , and the like bygone halfpenny literature of the people .

		The author or - iginally intended to include in the present work only the occulter sort of folk-lore of which his '' Etruscan-Roman Remains in Popular Tradition '' consists ; but finding himself , in the course of his labors , in danger of swamping amid an embarass - ment of riches in the way of the lighter , semi hu - morous local legends dear to the Florentine heart , he concluded to omit the graver matter , fol - lowing , we suppose , the rule of the illustrious Poggio that in a storm the heaviest things must go over - board first .

		Touching the more scientific aspect of his book , Mr.
Leland	PERSON	forestalls the possible stric - tures of those whom he ironically styles '' the second - rate folk-lorists , whose forte consists not in finding facts but faults , '' by cheerfully admitting that he has built up , on a plan suggested by the idea expede fferculem , certain tales from a very slight tradi - tional foundation .

		These instances , however , are the exceptions ; and we can answer for it that while Mr.
Leland	PERSON	has occasionally sacrificed sans merci the letter , he has throughout admirably preserved the spirit of truth .

		THE DIAL 217 ' '' Punch . ''

		Contrasting the dramas regularly ex - hibited before the Athenian or the Elizabethan com - monalty , with the nondescript medleys of horse - play , buffoonery , and scenic trickery most affected by modern popular audiences , it must be admitted that the advantage is not altogether with our own times .

		In his opening chapter Mr.
Robins	PERSON	discusses broadly , by way of prologue , the development of the British drama , from its sacerdotal original down to the day when its prosperity was temporarily dark - ened under the lowering sky of the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		The text is enlivened throughout with odds and ends of green-room gossip and anecdote ; and the au - thor has fished up from the recprds much that even those familiar with stage literature will find com - paratively fresh .

		Discussing
Garrick	PERSON	, Mr.
Robins	PERSON	is inclined to think -LRB- with excellent reason -RRB- that his Hamlet was a wide departure from accepted models something in the way , probably , of
M. Monnet	PERSON	- Sully 's romantic and picturesque , if very un-English impersonation .

		The strain of French blood in Gar - rick may partly account for the strain of French vivacity in his acting .

		How he appeared , at first blush , to his startled contemporaries may be gath - ered from Mr.
Richard Cumberland	PERSON	's graphic pen - picture : '' Heavens , what a transition !

		It seemed as if a whole century had been stepped over in a single scene old things were done away with , and a new order at once brought forward , light and lum - inous , and clearly destined to dispel the barbarisms and bigotry of a tasteless age , too long attached to the prejudices of custom , and superstitiously de - voted to the illusions of imposing declamation .

		One is glad to find throughout Mrs.
Claflin	PERSON	's pleasant pages a prevailing note of that kindly tact and refinement which is too often con - spicuously absent from books dealing in the ticklish matter of personal chat and reminiscence .

		It is so easy to compel a little notice for one 's self by say - ing sharp things of other people .

		A characteristic story is told of impulsive Professor
Agassiz	PERSON	.

		At an edu - cational meeting at
Boston	LOCATION	, an English gentleman , the speaker of the occasion and a man '' somewhat renowned as a practical educator in his own coun - try , '' shocked his democratic auditors by asking with unexpected candor : '' I do not understand how you conduct your public schools .

		How do you know that your child will not be obliged to sit by a wash-woman 's child or a blacksmith 's child ? ''

		Professor
Agassiz	PERSON	rose to the emergency : '' The glory of our country is that we have no wash - woman 's children or blacksmith 's children as such ; and all we have to fear is that the wash-woman 's child will go ahead of our children , and leave them in the background . ''

		Without doubting either the Professor 's sincerity or the theoretic democratism of his hearers , one would really like to know , as a matter of cold fact , just how many of the ladies and gentlemen present did not every day of their lives carry into practice in some way or degree the spirit underlying the query of the candid Briton .

		Mr.
Shearman	PERSON	on A little book by Mr.
Thomas G.	PERSON	the Single Tax .

		Shearman entitled '' Natural Taxa - tion '' has been added to the '' Ques - tions of the Day '' series -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The author is well known as the leading advocate of the `` sin - gle tax limited '' ; that is , the collection of all nec - essary revenues of government by the taxation of land values , without necessarily absorbing their en - tire amount .

		The single tax is sometimes opposed on the ground that economic rent , at least in new and poor communities , would not suffice to pay the expenses of government ; but Mr.
Shearman	PERSON	gives figures to show that , on the contrary , the necessary taxes would absorb less than one-half of the land - owners ' gains .

		The '' single tax limited '' accord - ing to this calculation would not destroy private property in land ; and Mr.
Shearman	PERSON	treats it rather as a method of tax reform than as a means of abol - ishing landlords .

		His point of departure is quite different from that of Mr.
Henry George	PERSON	and his disciples , and he is somewhat less extreme in his conclusions ; yet he claims many wonderful and de - sirable things as necessary results of the system he proposes .

		Perhaps the strongest part of his argu - ment is that in which he shows the weakness of ex - isting forms of taxation .

		He is particularly fero - cious in his attack upon import duties and other forms of indirect taxation , which he re - names '' crooked taxation , '' to make the designation as op - probious as possible .

		Four chapters are devoted to the failure of the general property tax , and to its disproportionate burden upon the rural population and upon widows and orphans .

		Mr.
Shearman	PERSON	calls his proposed system '' natural taxation , '' be - cause he looks upon ground rents as a kind of inev - itable tax , whether collected by the government or by the individual land-owner .

		The important place now held by mM ^ to date .

		Whist is no longer , as in the days of ''
Sarah Battle	PERSON	, '' the social bond and esoteric pas - time of a select few ; and the '' rigor of the game '' is now , even at comparatively lax tables , carried to a point that must not only have won the approval but 218 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, outrun the ideal of that '' gentlewoman born . ''

		In the little book before us , '' The Evolution of Whist '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , the eminent authority Mr.
William Pole	PERSON	traces the natural history of the game , from its small and obscure beginnings in the sixteenth century down to its present highly evolved form .

		While the work is primarily a careful scientific study stamped throughout with a proper sense of the dignity of its theme , it is by no means a mere curious collection of dry facts and dates .

		Unlike many scientific writers , Mr.
Pole	PERSON	is not above writ - ing down to the popular comprehension , and cloth - ing his serious theme and purpose in the attractive garb of an alluring and agreeable style .

		After an interesting general introduction , he proceeds to treat his subject under the four main heads : '' The Prim - itive Era '' -LRB- 1500-1730 -RRB- ; `` The Era of Hoyle '' -LRB- 1730-1860 -RRB- ; `` The Philosophical Era '' -LRB- from 1860 onwards -RRB- ; and '' Latter-Day Developments '' the last division embracing a critical review of modern changes and innovations , together with a complimentary chapter on whist in
America	LOCATION	.

		Touch - ing the status of the game in this country , the writer cites approvingly the statement of '' Cavendish '' -LRB- who visited us in
' 93	DATE	-RRB- that '' there is no sort of comparison to be made between the American and the European players the former possessing a general quality of excellence which is almost un - known here or which , at any rate , it has been the habit to attribute only to exceptional persons like
Deschapelles	PERSON	, appearing once in an age . ''

		This , like the approbation of Sir
Hubert Stanley	PERSON	, is '' praise indeed , '' and should serve as a lenitive to interna - tional smarts .

		Mr.
Pole	PERSON	's pleasantly written and neatly made little book ought to find its way into the hands of every whist-player desiring a critical knowledge of the game .

		ment Q f ^ author > 8 point of yiew and method , and of his success in adapting his work to the special audience he addresses .

		The Rev. Dr.
Clark	PERSON	is a hero-worshipper , and
Oliver Cromwell	PERSON	is his one hero .

		As his introducer says of the work , '' It is a book of enthusiasm , a warm-hearted vindi - cation of a great man ... written with fervor . ''

		The fervor shows itself in thickly sprinkled exclam - ation points and ejaculations of admiration called out by the hero 's acts or qualities .

		The audience addressed is a supposed general public whose idea of
Cromwell	LOCATION	, if it has any , has been gained from the hostile pages of
Hume	PERSON	.

		The book is written topically in ten chapters .

		The first , very good in its way , is a discussion of the defamatory writers who shaped the world 's opinion of Cromwell until recently ; the second treats of
Carlyle	LOCATION	's work ; the others speak of
Cromwell	PERSON	under the heads of '' Early Life . '' ''

		Farmer '' '' Warrior '' PaiOSomawf orJ Life , '' `` Farmer , '' `` Warrior , '' `` Parliament and Lectures on Political Obligations .

		seems very inadequate for a proper conception of his work .

		In this respect the book compares un - favorably with Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	's volume , which is of about the same size , but makes the statesman , the warrior , and the man stand before us clearly outlined .

		This lack of facts is not made good by the constant eulogy which every page fur - nishes .

		Cromwell 's character and deeds , properly presented , need no eulogy to convince men of their greatness .

		The late Professor
Thomas Hill Green	PERSON	was known at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	quite as much for his personal influence and his unselfish life of social service as for his scholarly philosophical work .

		To the general public he is less well known than he ought to be ; but many readers of ''
Robert Elsmere	PERSON	'' will remember that he was one of Mrs.
Ward	PERSON	's two friends to whose memory she dedicated the book .

		He was also the model from whom she drew the character of ''
Henry Grey	PERSON	. ''

		That portion of Professor Green 's philo - sophical works which treats of theories of the state has now been reprinted under the title '' Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation '' -LRB- Long - mans -RRB- .

		The subject is one in which the author ap - pears at his best , and upon which he is well entitled to be heard ; for he had an unusually acute sense of political duty .

		The volume contains his lectures upon such themes as the different senses of the term '' freedom , '' the grounds of political obligation , sovereignty , private rights , the rights of the state , etc. .

		The political theories of various earlier writ - ers are examined , but particular attention is paid to
Spinoza	LOCATION	,
Hobbes	LOCATION	,
Locke	PERSON	, and
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		The method of treatment is metaphysical for the most part , but is partly historical ; and in connection with the rights of the state in regard to property , morality , and the family , certain very practical questions are considered .

		The considerable gaps in the manu - script as left by the author have been in part bridged by passages quoted from his '' Story of Sicily '' ; but his own narrative , so far as completed , had been written with much care , and well merited publica - tion .

Oct. 1 , 1892	DATE	, pp. 214-15 -RRB- .

		This book is edited by Professor
Freeman	PERSON	's son-in-law , the well known archaeologist at the
Ashmolean Museum	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Arthur J. Evans	PERSON	.

		To him are due many notes and several valuable supplements to the three chap - ters , of which the latter in particular quite offset his modest disclaimer in the preface regarding his fitness for the task laid upon him by force of cir - cumstances ; the first supplement , on the tyranny of Dionysius , is in breadth of view and political

		THE DIAL 219 ' insight quite worthy of
Freeman	PERSON	himself .

		The ser - vices of archaeology as '' the handmaid of historical investigation '' are well illustrated in the later sup - plements on the coinage of Dionysius ,
Timoleon	PERSON	, and Agathocles , as casting light on the events with which their names are associated .

		The volume is illustrated with four excellent maps and a numis - matic plate .

		It is difficult to discover enough that is new concerning Louis XIV .

		to change the judgment of history in regard to him .

		Mr.
Arthur Hassall	PERSON	would proba - bly be the last to claim the discovery of new facts for his work , ''
Louis	PERSON	XIV .

		and the
Zenith	ORGANIZATION	of the French Monarchy '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The interesting feature of the book is its point of view .

		The writ - ing of history sometimes moves in a circle .

		Time was when
Louis	PERSON	XIV .

		was f ulsomely praised ; this was while he was yet alive .

		When he died , the
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	annulled his will ; cries of joy greeted the news of his decease ; history has singled him out as the real author of the French Revolution .

		Of late , however , criticism has swung around to the original point ; and Mr.
Hassall	PERSON	's work represents this atti - tude .

		But the attitude is an unfortunate one .

		The book is a study in hero-worship , and in so far it conforms to the spirit of the series -LRB- '' Heroes of the Nations '' -RRB- in which it appears ; but sober history suffers in the process .

		In his zeal to make Louis XIV .

		a hero , the author tells us that ''
Louis	PERSON	has certainly as great a claim as
Napoleon	LOCATION	to be consid - ered a Hero '' ; he characterizes
Louis	PERSON	as the '' most hard-working , pains-taking , and on the whole suc - cessful ruler ''
France	LOCATION	has had ; and finally declares that ''
Louis	PERSON	's reign , as far as military glory was concerned , is the most glorious in the annals of French history '' -LRB- pp. 2-4 -RRB- .

		This calm disparage - ment of Bonaparte surely will be a death-blow to the prevailing Napoleonic revival .

		From these opinions , the character of the book may be inferred .

		In a pretty booklet of some two hun - dred and fifty diminutive pages , en - titled '' The Flower of
England	LOCATION	's Face '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mrs.
Julia C. R. Dorr	PERSON	de - scribes in her cheery way some of the more notable places visited by her during a recent trip to En - gland .

		Mrs.
Dorr	PERSON	's sketches are ranged under such pleasantly suggestive titles as '' A Week in
Wales	LOCATION	, '' `` In the Forest of Arden , '' `` At
Haworth	PERSON	, '' `` To Cawdor Castle and
Culloden	LOCATION	Moor , '' '' From the Border to
Inverness	LOCATION	, '' etc. ; and we need scarcely say that the little bits of scenery and genre are touched in with a dainty and sympathetic hand .

		A pilgrimage to the Bronte '' country resulted in a sheaf of interesting anecdotes and impressions of the gifted sisters .

		One elderly witness who had known the Bronte '' family well , `` saw Miss
Charlotte	LOCATION	very often , almost every day .

		She wor nothing to look at .

		She wor a little thing , little and shy .

		She did not lift up her eyes .

		She wor quiet , and kept out o ' the way .

		They wor all great all great , every one of them .

		But , you see , we did not know it till they wor dead . ''

Charles E. L. Wingate	PERSON	's ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's Heroines on the Stage '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		While Mr.
Wingate	PERSON	's work is largely based on researches in the regions of moth and dust and documental chaos , the depressing nature of his preliminary labors has left no regrettable traces on his style .

		The book is piquant and chatty , descrip - tive and anecdotal rather than critical , yet critical enough to convey a fair impression of the distinctive qualities and merits of its heroines .

		Its point is fairly expressed in the title , the author 's aim being to present , briefly and vividly , critical pen-portraits of those famous actresses , past and present , most worth - ily identified with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's women .

		Thus , in the chapter headed '' Juliet '' are grouped Mrs. Bel - lamy , Mrs.
Gibber	PERSON	,
Miss O'Neill	PERSON	,
Miss Cushman	LOCATION	,
Mary Anderson	PERSON	, Mrs.
Duff	PERSON	, Mrs.
Mowatt	PERSON	, etc. .

		A feature of the book is the illustrations , which , rang - ing from the days of '' Peg '' Woffington and the saucy
Clive	PERSON	, down to the notable Juliets ,
Rosalinds	PERSON	, Ophelias , and Lady Macbeths of our times , form a veritable gallery of players .

High School	ORGANIZATION	has been gaining ground that the Classical Library , standards of classical education can only be raised by helping the teachers to do better work ; and that while something may be said about method , it is scholarship that counts in the long run .

		American high schools and the same is true of most small colleges are notoriously deficient in the appliances of classical teaching , whether in the way of books or of illustrative material .

		With a view to remedying this unfortunate condition , the
Michigan Schoolmasters ' Club	ORGANIZATION	in
1894	DATE	appointed a committee to make a select bibliography of the classical books most essential to high school and pre - paratory work .

		The committee succeeded in inter - esting a score of the leading classical men in various parts , who contributed suggestions and criticisms .

		The `` List of Books Recommended for a High School Classical Library , '' now published by the com - mittee , contains 480 titles , carefully classified , with precise information regarding editions , publishers , and prices .

		This list will be found invaluable by teachers who wish to strengthen their work in the ancient languages and ancient history .

Ellen Marriage	PERSON	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has just appeared in Mr.
Saints	PERSON	- bury 's edition of the novelist .


Richard Jones	PERSON	on `` Peasant Rents '' -LRB- 1831 -RRB- is the latest of Professor Ashley 's '' Economic Classics '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- , and will soon be followed by Professor
Schmol	PERSON	- ler 's essay on '' The Mercantile System . ''

		A new translation of Count Tolstoy 's '' Master and Man , '' by Messrs.
S. Rapoport	PERSON	and
John C. Kenworthy	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		This is the third version that has come to our table . ''

		The Union , '' described as '' a semi-monthly journal for English and Americans in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' is a sprightly little paper that comes to us from
Wiesbaden	LOCATION	, with Miss
Linda M. Prussing	PERSON	, of
Chicago	LOCATION	, as '' responsible editor . ''

		An '' Index Antiphonteus , '' prepared by Dr.
Frank Louis Van Cleef	PERSON	, is the latest issue of the '' Cornell Studies in Classical Philology '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- .

		It makes a volume of 173 pages , and is printed entirely in Greek and Latin . ''

		The Boy in
Grey	LOCATION	, '' the closing volume of Messrs.
Ward	PERSON	,
Lock & Bowden	ORGANIZATION	's edition of the novels of
Henry Kingsley	PERSON	, will soon be issued , and will contain an illus - trated biographical sketch of the author , by his nephew , Mr.
Maurice Kingsley	PERSON	.

		The Rev.
Stephen D. Peet	PERSON	, editor of `` The American Antiquarian and Oriental Journal '' -LRB- just beginning its eighteenth volume , by the way -RRB- , is about to publish a work entitled '' Prehistoric America . ''

		The address of Dr.
Peet	PERSON	is Good Hope ,
Illinois	LOCATION	.


Robert Beverly Hale	PERSON	, the youngest son of the Rev.
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	, died on the sixth of this month .

		He was only twenty-five years of age , but had become somewhat known as a writer for the magazines , and was a young man of considerable literary promise .

		Mrs.
Clara Doty Bates	PERSON	, the well known writer of stories for the young,-died at her home in
Chicago	LOCATION	, Oc - tober 14 .

		She was born in
Michigan	LOCATION	in
1838	DATE	.

		Her works include many volumes of juveniles , and a volume of verse .

		She was a frequent contributor to the pe - riodicals for the young .

		Miss
Maud Wilder Goodwin	PERSON	's '' The Colonial Cava - lier , '' reviewed by us last
March	DATE	, has come into the hands of Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	, who republish it in handsome holiday form , with many illustrations by Mr.
Harry Edwards	PERSON	.

		It is an excellent book , and de - serves to become widely known .

		The
University and Normal School of North Dakota	ORGANIZATION	having been closed , owing to the neglect of a recalci - trant legislature to make the appropriations necessary for their support , a private movement has been started to provide for their expenses by a series of popular lec - tures , concerts , and other entertainments .

		We wish the movement all success , and understand that it has already done much toward the accomplishment of its purpose .

		Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	has written to an American friend that , although he is sure the project will at first meet with derision , he intends , as soon as he can conveniently do so , to agitate the subject of another Authors ' Con - gress , to be held in his country .

		He believes that the recent Authors ' .


Congress	ORGANIZATION	at
Chicago	LOCATION	was `` as impor - tant to the future of literature and the rights of au - thors as the
Bering Sea Arbitration	LOCATION	or the
Monetary Conference	ORGANIZATION	were to the commercial interests of nations . ''

		Mr.
W. L. Phelps	PERSON	is giving a course in modern fiction at
Yale	ORGANIZATION	, and the novels to be taken up before
Christ	LOCATION	- mas are the following ten : ''
Lorna Doone	PERSON	, '' ''
Marcella	PERSON	, '' '' A Modern Instance , '' ''
Esther Waters	PERSON	, '' '' A Gentle - man of
France	LOCATION	, '' '' Treasure Island , '' '' Trilby , '' and vol - umes of short stories by Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	, Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, and
Professor Henry Beers	ORGANIZATION	.

		The latter name doubt - less appears in deference to local sentiment .

		It would hardly have been thought of anywhere but in
New Haven	LOCATION	.

		Following Mr.
T. Fisher Unwin	PERSON	's retirement from the
London	LOCATION	agency of the `` Century Magazine , '' we have the announcement of a new monthly magazine to be launched by him with the new year , to be called '' Cosinopolis , '' and to appear contemporaneously in
London	LOCATION	,
Berlin	LOCATION	, and
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It will contain original articles in English , French , and German ; while a special feature will be chronicles of the literary , political , and theatrical occurrences of the month in
Germany	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
England	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
F. J. Furnivall	PERSON	, writing about the neglect of En - glish in common school education , shows by a quotation from the statutes of
Brunton Grammar School	ORGANIZATION	, dated
1519	DATE	, that the evil is of ancient date .

		The Statutes say that the '' maister shall not teche his scolers song , nor other petite lerninge , as the
Crosse Rewe	ORGANIZATION	, redyng of the Mateyns , or of the Psalter , or such other small thyngs , nether redyng of Englissh , butt such as shall con - cerne lernynge of gramer For the Founders of the said scole intend , with our lordes mercy , only to have the grammer of Latyn tongue so sufficiently taught , that the scolers , of the same profityng and provyng , shall in tyme to come forever be , after their capacities perfight Latyn men . ''

		We learn from the '' Athenaeum '' that the French government has sent out invitations to a conference to those states which joined in
1886	DATE	the Literary Conven - tion of
Berne	LOCATION	.

		According to a special stipulation , a conference was to have been summoned by
France	LOCATION	after a lapse of four or six years from that date for the purpose of revising the convention , but hitherto 222 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, the government of
France	LOCATION	has not considered it oppor - tune to take any steps in the matter .

		It has done so now , fixing
April 15 , 1896	DATE	, as the date for another conference , with the intention of submitting for discus - sion a programme based on the result of the investiga - tions carried on since
1886	DATE	, both by the French Gov - ernment and the
Berne Bureau	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is to be hoped that those states which have not yet joined the
Berne Con	ORGANIZATION	- vention will also be invited to send representatives to the next conference , in order to induce them to join it .

		The increasing vogue of
Omar Khayyam	PERSON	is evidenced by the announcement -LRB- by the
Joseph Knight Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- of a variorum edition of the '' Rubaiyat . ''

		The standard is the fourth edition of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's version ; this is fol - lowed , quatrain by quatrain , by
M. Nicolas	PERSON	's French prose translation ; Mr.
Justin Huntley McCarthy	PERSON	's En - glish prose version ; the Whinfield translation of
1889	DATE	-LRB- with the variants of the translation of
1882	DATE	-RRB- ; several representative versions from Mr.
John Leslie Garner	PERSON	's
Milwaukee	LOCATION	edition ; then the German versions of
Boden	PERSON	- stedt and
Graf von Schack	PERSON	.

		Appendices will contain full notes , a considerable number of additional
Rubai	PERSON	- yat illustrating GitzGerald 's translation or specially characteristic of the Persian poet .

		The volume will contain nearly everything that throws any light on his life and genius
Gautier	PERSON	's appreciation , Dean Plum - tre 's interesting comparison between Omar and
Eccles	PERSON	- iastes , a sketch of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's life , and a full biblio - graphy .

		The
Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	now uses the famous
Oxford India	ORGANIZATION	paper for more than 160 different pub - lications .

		This paper , of which the secret is carefully guarded , is unequalled for thinness combined with opa - city and strength .

		It is stated in '' Book Reviews '' that at the
Paris	LOCATION	Exhibition '' volumes of
1500	DATE	pages were seen suspended during the whole period of the
Exhibi	PERSON	- tion by a single leaf , opaque , although as thin as tissue ; and when , at the close of the Exhibition , they were taken down and examined , the leaf that had sustained the weight had not started , the paper had not stretched , and the solid gilt edge of the volume when closed re - vealed no mark to show where the strain had been applied .

		The paper when subjected to severe rubbing , instead of breaking into holes , assumed a texture re - sembling chamois leather , and a strip only three inches wide was found able to support a quarter of a hundred - weight without yielding . ''

		One can get editions of Bibles , Prayer-books ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Dante	PERSON	, and
Virgil	PERSON	, j printed upon this paper , and all are marvels of compact bookmaking .

		The first number , dated
October	DATE	, of '' The American Historical Review '' has just made its appearance , and adds one more to the lengthening list of our serious and scholarly periodicals .

		It will probably share the fate j of its fellows in respect of public support , for it is much too good to be likely to find any considerable number of subscribers outside the narrow circle of historical students .

		Its expenses are , we understand , met by the universities under whose auspices it appears .

		Its
Board of Editors	ORGANIZATION	is made up of six men , all of the highest standing , and they have shown the best of judgment in selecting Professor
J. F. Jameson	PERSON	as their managing editor .

		The issue before us is a stately octavo of 208 pages , about one-half of which are filled with special articles and newly-printed documents , while the other half are devoted to reviews and miscellaneous matter .

		Our only criticism upon the number shall be an expres - sion of our amazement upon discovering that the sheets were fastened together by wires , instead of being de - cently sewn .

		The imprint of
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		should have made that offence impossible .

		Mr.
R. H. Sherard	PERSON	, writing from
Paris	LOCATION	to '' The Au - thor , '' discourses amusingly of what he calls '' literary blacklegs . ''

		In
Paris	LOCATION	, he says , '' no successful author would read the manuscript of another author for a pub - lisher ; in
Paris	LOCATION	no successful author would write , other - wise than under his own signature , a criticism on an - other author 's book ; in
Paris	LOCATION	no author would espouse the cause of the publisher who , qua publisher , is the au - thor 's antagonist .

		In
London	LOCATION	a number of blacklegs Do you know them ?

		Yes , I do are doing this daily , hourly , minutely , and , like sheep before the shearers , we are dumb .

		We even invite them , some to a drink , some to a week in our country-houses .

		Let us , for our protection , form a Vehmgericht , or since in this age we must be practical , let us have a black book , privately printed and privately circulated , in which the blacklegs or black sheep in our midst are denotated and set down ; a waistcoat pocket booklet with their names and ad - dresses ; so that when we meet the literary blackleg we may show him the fall of our coats , velvet or shoddy , over the shoulders , and waist , and beyond . ''

		This is hard , to say the least , on such publishers ' readers as Mr.
George Meredith	PERSON	, and the distinguished critics who contribute literary reviews to the anonymous English press .

		It is unnecessary to say anything in praise of Mr.

		In this volume , Professor
Ferri	PERSON	, a distinguished member of the Italian Parliament , deals with the conditions which produce the crim - nal population , and with the methods by which this anti-social section of the community may be diminished .

		His view is that the true remedy against crime is to remove individual defects and social disadvantages where it is possible to remove them .

		He shows that punishment has comparatively little effect in this direction , and is apt to direct atten - tion from the true remedy the individual and social amelioration of the population as a whole .

		It is believed that this work will supply a special want .

		There is no subject taught in the elementary schools that taxes the teacher 's re - sources as to methods and devices to a greater extent than arithmetic , and none that is more dangerous to the pupil in the way of deadening his mind and arresting its development , if bad methods are used .

		The authors of this book have presented in an admirable manner the psy - chological view of number , and shown its applications to the correct methods of teaching the several arithmetical processes .

		262 THE VICTORIAN GARDEN OF SONG .

		It is always difficult to fix the limits of a literary period .

		Such terms as the Age of Pericles , the Augustan Age -LRB- Roman or En - glish -RRB- , and the Elizabethan Age stand , indeed , for fairly definite concepts ; we recognize the fact that a certain unity of spirit and aspira - tion in the writers who made them famous jus - tifies their employment as counters in the game of literary history ; yet scientific precision of statement is obviously out of the question where they are concerned .

		We are reminded , some - how , of the decorative swirl wherewith , in Mr.
Vedder	PERSON	's designs for the quatrains of Omar , we find symbolized the convergence of all the forces and influences that meet in the hour of our conscious existence , only to diverge once more from that focus , that they may enter into other and we know not what combinations .

		Thus it is with the Victorian Age in our liter - ature : we know that it has been the outcome of the past ; we know , likewise , that its scat - tered elements will enter into the spiritual syn - thesis of the future ; but to us , whose lives have been shaped by its ideals , the immediate fact of its nearness to us is all-important , and the impulse to regard it as a concrete is well - nigh irresistible .

		When Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	published his ''
Victo	PERSON	- rian Poets , '' in
1875	DATE	, he brought abundant and convincing logic to the support of the faith that was in us of the belief that we were near - ing the close of a literary epoch as well-marked and as distinctly characterized as any that had preceded it in our history .

		Now , at a date twenty years removed , the same skilful hand gives us a '' Victorian Anthology '' which con - firms the earlier impression , and leaves us with a deepened sense of the richness in poetical material and inspiration of the period in which our fortunate lot has been cast .

		That the end has been now reached is by no means certain , and the transition to the poetry of the coming century will , no doubt , be made easy by many connecting links of melodious utterance , just as the poetry of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Landor	PERSON	did much to save from abruptness the passage from the glorious period of
Shelley	LOCATION	,
Keats	PERSON	, 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, and
Coleridge	PERSON	, to the no less glorious period of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	,
Browning	PERSON	, and Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	.

		Yet the signs of a closing epoch are , on the whole , clearer in
1895	DATE	than they were twenty years ago , and Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's prognostica - tion has not been flouted by the emergence of any new and distinctive poetical force .

		It was made at a time when six great poets of English speech wore the laurel upon living brows ; since it was made , four of the six have gone '' where Orpheus and where Homer are , '' and no new altar-fires have sprung up to dim the light of the two singers who still happily re - main with us .

		We can not , in the nature of things , hope for an extension of the Victorian name far over the years to come , and no twen - tieth century compiler of a Victorian anthol - ogy will be likely much to exceed the scope of Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's collection .

		The octogenarian of to-day whose years have run parallel with those of
England	LOCATION	's Queen , and who has been all his life a lover of poetry , has had many things for which to be thankful , many sensations of the rarer and more exqui - site sort .

		To such a person , coming to man - hood , let us say , in the very year of the Queen 's accession , the deaths of Shelley and
Keats	PERSON	were but childish memories , while the deaths of
Scott	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	doubtless seemed to ring the knell of creative poetry .

		Yet he may have been old enough to be captivated by the first poems of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and to detect in them the new note which even then set the key in which the swelling harmonies of the coming age were destined to be scored .

		Possibly , also , he may have strayed , at the verge of manhood , upon '' Pauline '' and ''
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	, '' and wondered at their strange cadences and virile strength .

		His first genuine sensation , however , must have been delayed until
1842	DATE	, when the possibilities of
Tennyson	LOCATION	's genius were first fully revealed .

		The middle of the century found our lover of song in possession of '' The Princess '' and '' In Memoriam , '' and of a series of
Browning	PERSON	vol - umes numerous and distinctive enough to put beyond question the fact that this poet also must be reckoned with .

		If , moreover , he had lent an attentive ear to the new voices about him , he could not have failed to be impressed by the quality of a thin volume , published in
1848	DATE	, and entitled The Strayed Keveller and Other Poems . ''

		At least , the appearance of '' Empedocles on
Etna	ORGANIZATION	and Other Poems , '' in
1853	DATE	, must have made it clear that a third great poet had arisen in
Victorian England	LOCATION	.

		The year
1855	DATE	, when the subject of our imaginary biography had just turned the forties , must still be remembered by him as an annus mirdbilis , for it brought the '' Poems '' of
Arnold	LOCATION	, Ten - nyson 's ''
Maud	PERSON	, '' and the '' Men and Women '' of
Browning	PERSON	.

		Some ten years were to elapse before another sensation of the first class was possible .

		The first series of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's '' Poems and Ballads '' appeared in
1866	DATE	, and even our hypo - thetical octogenarian , who then had a half cen - tury to his credit , would probably subscribe to the opinion of Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	-LRB- a much younger man -RRB- , when he says : '' I do not suppose that anybody now alive -LRB- I speak of lovers of poetry -RRB- who was not alive in
1832	DATE	and old enough then to enjoy the first perfect work of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, has had such a sensation as that which was ex - perienced in the autumn of
1866	DATE	by readers of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	's ' Poems and Ballads . '

		And I am sure that no one in
England	LOCATION	has had any such sensation since . ''

		Our reader may , how - ever , have been in a measure prepared for the experience by getting hold of the '' Atalanta '' in
1864	DATE	, of the '' Chastelard '' in
1865	DATE	, and even of '' The Queen Mother '' and ''
Rosa	PERSON	- mond '' in
1861	DATE	.

		He may also have recognized the possibilities of still another poet , who put forth '' The Defence of Guenevere '' as early as
1858	DATE	.

		At all events , he can have had no doubt of the appearance of a fifth great Victorian poet when the year
1867	DATE	brought '' The Life and Death of
Jason	PERSON	, '' and the following year the beginnings of '' The Earthly Paradise . ''

		En - gland might now proudly boast of five great poets among the living ; would there be a sixth ?

		The question was soon answered .

		It was in
1870	DATE	that the friends of
Rossetti	PERSON	persuaded him to exhume the manuscript collection of verse that had , in a passion of unassuageable grief , been consigned to the grave with the body of his wife , and to give it to the world .

		The publication of this volume gave to our lover of poetry the last distinctive sensation that he was to know .

		The quarter-century that has elapsed since
1870	DATE	has brought him no exper - ience comparable with this , and his pleasures have been limited to the retrospective enjoy - ment of a rich past , and delight in the later productions of the six great poets whose fame was so long ago so surely established .

		Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's '' Victorian Anthology '' fills six hundred and seventy-six compact double - columned pages , eighty-seven of which are de - voted to the six Victorian master singers .

		No other poets are illustrated at similar length , with the exception of Landor , who stands in
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 239 the forefront of the epoch , and , more than any other poet , serves to link it with the age of Shelley .

		Examples are given us of no less than three hundred and forty-three poets , thirty-six of whom belong to
Australasia	LOCATION	and
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The three hundred and seven En - glish -LRB- as distinguished from Colonial -RRB- poets are grouped in three great divisions , corre - sponding to the beginning , the middle , and the close of the reign .

		In each of these divi - sions , subdivisions are formed , and the fine critical sense of the editor is displayed in the felicitous names that he has given to these lesser groups .

		Nothing could be happier , for example , than to classify Barham ,
Maginn	PERSON	, and
Mahony	PERSON	as `` The Roisterers '' ;
Barnes	PERSON	,
Waugh	PERSON	, and
Laycock	PERSON	under the style of '' The Oaten Flute , '' or Locker-Lampson ,
Calverley	PERSON	, and Sir
Frederick Pollock	PERSON	as writers of '' Ele - gantiae . ''

		This carefully-considered classifica - tion is in itself a great help to the student , and often suggests affinities that would other - wise be likely to escape his notice .

		Nothing is lacking to make this great anthology all that could be desired .

		Besides the features of the work that have already been mentioned , there is such an introductory essay as Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	alone could write , a section devoted to biographical notes , and indexes of first lines , titles , and poets .

		By way of adornment , to say nothing of such unfailingly tasteful me - chanical features as we have learned to expect from
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin	LOCATION	,
& Company	ORGANIZATION	, the book has two appropriate illustrations in photogravure the `` Poet 's Corner '' in the
Abbey	LOCATION	where so many of
England	LOCATION	's poets lie buried , and the Queen whose name will always be as firmly associated with that of
Tennyson	PERSON	as the name of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	is associated with that of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		No less noticeable than the fine critical taste displayed by Mr.
Sted	PERSON	- man in making his selections is the conscien - tiousness which has gone into every detail of his work .

		It would be difficult to imagine a better-made anthology , or one more likely to take a permanent place among standard works of reference .

		It belongs to the small class which includes Mr.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	's '' En - glish Poets '' and Professor
Palgrave	PERSON	's '' Golden Treasury , '' and hardly any other collections of English verse .

		We may well be proud as a nation that such a work for English poetry should have been left for an American to per - form .

		The book is one that will prove simply indispensable to students of poetry and culti - vated readers alike .

		THE REAL AND THE IDEAL .

		A HINT FROM NATURE .

		To
Walter Pater	PERSON	's question , '' Is poetry , the lit - erary beauty , the poetical ideal , always but a bor - rowed light upon man 's actual life ? ''

		I think an affirmative answer must be given .

		The poetry is from within ; it is the light that never was upon sea or land ; and this light is upon the past more than upon the present .

		The present moment is always prosy and commonplace .

		The grandeur and sig - nificance of our own day are very apt to be hidden from us .

		Hence to wed poetry and modernity is always a difficult task .

		It is easier to charm us with the imaginary than with the real .

		I think un - doubtedly
Hawthorne	PERSON	had an easier task than has Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, Balzac than Zola .

		The latter is some - times overpowered and hampered by the reality as in '' Lourdes . ''

		All true art is interpretative .

		The great realist , like
Tolstoi	PERSON	, interprets life .

		If he were merely to copy it , we should tire even of him .

		To interpret it is not to improve upon it ; it is to draw it out , set it off , and make us see it through a new medium and as a whole .

		The true historian interprets his - tory , shows us what probably the actors themselves did not know .

		The value of any writer 's or artist 's interpretation of life is in proportion as it is vivid and large and true .

		Did not
Carlyle	PERSON	interpret
Cromwell	PERSON	to his countrymen ?

		In art , facts are to be digested , made fluid , and informed with life .

		In science , they are to be left as facts .

		If I go out and name every bird I see , and describe its color and ways give a lot of facts about the bird my reader is not interested .

		But if I relate the bird in some way to human life , to my own life , show what it is to me and what it is in the landscape or the season , speak of it in terms of general human experience , then is the reader interested .

		Only so do I give him a live bird .

		To cast an air of ro - mance , of adventure , of the new and untried , over common facts and common life to infuse the ideal into the real that is the secret .

		The best analogy I know of in Nature of the re - lation of the artist to his environment is furnished by the honey-bee .

		The bee is both realist and ideal - ist .

		Her product reflects her environment , and it reflects that which her environment knows not of .

		Most persons think the bee gets her honey from the flowers .

		But she does not ; honey is the product of the bee it is the nectar of the flower with the bee added .

		What the bee gets from the flower is sweet water ; this she brings home in her honey bag : she meditates upon it as it were ; she puts it through a process of her own ; she reduces the wa - ter and adds a minute drop of formic acid , secreted by her own body .

		It is this minute drop which gives honey its delicious sting , like the works of genius , and makes it differ from all other sweets in the world .

		Nothing is better , nothing is more indispensable 240 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, in a novel or other imaginative work , than local color , local flavor , the atmosphere of the time and place ; but these things must all have been supple - mented , and in a measure changed , by the genius of the artist .

		We shall detect
New York	LOCATION	, or
New England	LOCATION	, or
California	LOCATION	, or the South , in his work , only as we detect the local flora in the product of the bee .

		The honey of Hymettus is not like that of
Pentelicon	LOCATION	; the honey of
California	LOCATION	is not like that of
Michigan	LOCATION	or
Florida	LOCATION	, yet all kinds agree in being honey and not merely nectar .

		You can taste the flowers in each one of them the clover , the orange blossom , the thyme , the linden , the sumac ; but to the nectar of each the bee has imparted her own peculiar and transforming quality .

		A recent
London	LOCATION	writer argues against realism in fiction , because , he says , '' In human life there are no facts ... Life is in the eye of the observer .

		The humor or the pity of it belongs entirely to the spectator , and depends upon the gift of vision he brings . ''

		Still there are facts in life facts of race , of country , of time , of conditions ; and the work of the true realist reflects them .


New England	LOCATION	life , old
England	LOCATION	life , life in
Texas	LOCATION	or
Iowa	LOCATION	or Massa - chusetts , here are facts that must modify the work of the novelist who finds the materials of his story in any of these countries .

		One might as well say there are no facts in Na - ture no facts anywhere .

		True , all depends upon the eye that sees , upon its interpretative power ; but the facts the types , the conditions must be there to start with .

		We do not want a barren real - ism , as I suspect we sometimes get in
Zola	LOCATION	; we do not want merely the raw sweet water of the facts : we want soul and personality added ; we want the amber liquid with the delicious sting in which the nectar of fact has been transmuted into something higher and finer .

		I suspect that all Mr.
Garland	PERSON	really demands in that suggestive little volume of his called '' Crumbling Idols '' is that Western bees shall make honey from Western flowers though he may err a little in thinking this honey will be better than any ever made before .

		THE DECADENT ''
THOMSON	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Since reading THE DIAL of
October 1	DATE	, I have been racking my brains for a satisfactory estimate of ''
Thom	PERSON	- son , '' the decadent scholar ; but with no adequate results .

		One feels a slight uncertainty whether his biographer really intends him to be taken seriously .

		There is an indescribable air about the story which is not inconsist - ent with the theory that the writer holds a '' retainer '' from that commanding portion of the American public which is represented as in deadly hostility to the '' un - bias '' -LRB- here my dictionary is left behind -RRB- of the Ger - man university .

		But granted that he wishes ''
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	'' to be taken seriously : is the fate of the latter , after all , of such a nature as to claim any large amount of our sympathy , at a time when the Cubans and Armenians and Vene - zuelans have so nearly exhausted that emotion in the American breast ?

		One might easily lash himself into indignation , like Homer 's lion , at the thought of such a genius as ''
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, '' compelled , in a college '' narrow and closely sectarian , '' to teach Presbyterian Physics , or the Baptist theory of Taxation , or
Methodist Chemistry	ORGANIZATION	, or any of the other well-known requirements of our sectarian schools ; but the troublesome question will come to the front , Did not
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	fall too easily ?

		Since when has it been absolutely necessary to the in - tegrity of a great man 's devotion to Truth that he be furnished with a good professorship , a regular salary , and an ample supply of '' elbow-room '' ?

		Why should a few years of unappreciated endeavor have made the descent into the Avernian regions of learned decadence so easy ?

		Why was the brain of this all too faithless devotee to truth fired by no prophetic vision of '' Seven cities claiming 1
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	dead , Through which the living
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	begged his bread ? ''

		No , men of ''
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	's '' fibre will not do .

		In mak - ing up the army of reformers which is to bring light where '' ignorance and all uncharitableness '' have been , all such as he must be firmly rejected if the recruiting officers are to do their duty .

		We want no one in the ranks who is liable to desert when supplies run short .

		But , as I said at the start , I am not clear in my own conceptions as to ''
Thomson	ORGANIZATION	, '' and I do not want to go so far as to accuse him of personal moral turpitude .

		I surrender him to the psychiatrist , who may detect some lesion of the brain ; or to the student of heredity , who may find that the seeds of his decadence were born in him .

		In taking leave of him , my mind is in - clined to settle down into an attitude of thankfulness that he was not elevated to any really important edu - cational position before his inevitable tendency to de - cadence was made manifest .

		MORE BOOKS ABOUT Just now there seem to be indications that the waning '' Napoleonic revival '' is going to be followed , in this country at least , by a whole - some corrective in the shape of a Lincoln re - vival .

		Hero-worship is harmless and even prof - itable , if only the object of one 's cult be wisely chosen .


Napoleon Bonaparte	PERSON	was as unques - tionably the hero of his epoch , as Satan is the hero of
Milton	LOCATION	's poem ; and it is pretty diffi - cult to settle the balance of iniquity between them .

		But
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	was a hero of another type .

		The painters of great men , from Plutarch down , have shown us none worthier the esteem of a democratic age than the homely figure whose progress , chiefly through the force of high personal qualities , from the settler 's cabin to the
White House	ORGANIZATION	, may well strengthen the faith of those who believe that '' govern - ment of the people , by the people , and for the people , shall not perish from the earth . ''

		None of the volumes before us is or pre - tends to be very critical , or at all exhaustive .

		Loosely coherent collections , mainly , of per - sonal reminiscences , they call for little in the way of general comment , and may best be allowed , so far as possible , to speak for them - selves .

		Mr.
Noah Brooks	PERSON	's ''
Washington	LOCATION	in Lin - coln 's Time '' is a graphic , if rather fragment - ary , volume of pen-sketches of war-time scenes and celebrities , interesting mainly for what the author tells us of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, whom he saw often and knew intimately .

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	went to
Washington	LOCATION	in
1862	DATE	as a newspaper cor - respondent , and remained there up to
John	PERSON	- son 's administration ; and he now gives us the pith of what he observed and wrote during that time .

		His pictures of the then chaotic condi - tion of the federal capital are fresh and full of interest .

		ton was the focus where all that was peculiar to the times seemed to gather and concentrate .

		There , as perhaps nowhere else in the North , home-keeping citizens realized the war , its ex - citements , anxieties , and horrors .

		For months the flag of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	floating over the Capitol had been challenged by the stars and bars vis - ible on the other side of the
Potomac	LOCATION	; and later in the war Early brought the defiant colors once more within view from the city walls .

		Scenes of pathos and pity were not wanting .

		After the great battles that were fought near at hand , like
Fredericksburg	LOCATION	and
Chancellorsville	LOCATION	, the way to
Washington	LOCATION	be - came a via dolorosa , along which streamed the dejected tide of fugitives returning from the front .

		Says Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	: '' They arrived in squads of a hundred or more , ban - daged and limping , ragged and dishevelled , blackened with smoke and powder , and drooping with weakness .

		They came groping and faltering , so faint and so long - ing for rest that one 's heart bled at the piteous sight .

		Here and there were men left to make their way as best they could to the hospitals , and who were leaning on the iron railings or sitting wearily on the curbstones ; but it was noticeable that all maintained the genuine American pluck in the midst of their suffering . ''

		Hardly less moving than the plight of these directer victims of war was that of the anx - ious-faced strangers from the North who flocked to the city close upon the tidings of the great battles , in quest of friends or of news of friends who had been at the front .

		It was easy , says the author , '' to recognize them by their dis - tressed faces , their strangeness in the city , and their inquiries for hospitals or for the shortest routes to scenes made celebrated by some life - destroying fight . ''

		Close to the seat of war , the capital became a city of hospitals , one of the most unique of which was that improvised in the
Patent Office	ORGANIZATION	museum .

		The author gives an amusing story of a visit he once made to this place with Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	.

		In making the round of the cots they paused beside a badly - wounded soldier who was apparently nearing the end of his pilgrimage , and to whom a be - nevolent lady had just then thoughtfully pre - sented a tract . ''

		After she had gone , the patient picked up with lan - guid hand the leaflet dropped upon his cot , and , glanc - ing at the title , began to laugh .

		When we reached him , the President said : ` My good fellow , the lady doubt - less means well , and it is hardly fair for you to laugh at her gift . ' '

		Well , Mr.
President	PERSON	, ' said the soldier , how can I help laughing a little ?

		She has given me a tract on the '' Sin of Dancing , '' and both of my legs are shot off . ' ''

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	had a great relish for the rough 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, wit of the soldiers , and met it cordially enough , as in the following encounter with a profane mule-driver , whose unusually picturesque oaths had attracted his attention : '' Finally Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, leaning forward , touched the man on the shoulder , and said : ' Excuse me , my friend , are you an Episcopalian ? '

		The man , greatly startled , looked round and replied : ' No , Mr. President ; I am a Methodist . ' '

		Well , ' said
Lincoln	LOCATION	, < I thought you must be an Episcopalian , because you swear just like Governor
Seward	PERSON	, who is a church-warden . '

		The driver swore no more .

		Besides his
Washington	LOCATION	pictures , and stories illustrative of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's private life and character , Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	gives a brief account of two war-time National Conventions the one at
Baltimore	LOCATION	, which renominated Lincoln , and that at
Chicago	LOCATION	, which nominated
McClellan	PERSON	.

		There is a good deal of interspersed political comment and gossip ; and while some of Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's stories strike us as being old acquaint - ances , the book is entertaining on the whole , and repays reading .

		A well-edited and fairly continuous little volume of Lincoln reminiscences is ''
Recol	PERSON	- lections of Abraham Lincoln '' -LRB- 1847-65 -RRB- , compiled from various letters , memoranda , and published articles of Mr.
Ward Hill Lamon	PERSON	, by his daughter ,
Miss Dorothy Lamon	PERSON	.

		As Mr.
Lamon	PERSON	published , many years ago , a biog - raphy of
Lincoln	LOCATION	, it is presumed that these are additional reminiscences , found among his pa - pers .

		We need scarcely say that Mr.
Lamon	PERSON	was a competent witness in the premises .

		He was for years Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's law partner and confidential friend ; and when Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	went to
Washington	LOCATION	for his inauguration in
1861	DATE	he accompanied him , pursuant to the following characteristic summons : '' Hill , on the llth I go to
Washington	LOCATION	, and I want you to go along with me .

		Our friends have already asked me to send you as Consul to
Paris	LOCATION	.

		You know I would cheerfully give you anything for which our friends may ask or which you may desire , but it looks as if we might have war .

		In that case I want you with me .

		In fact I must have you .

		So get yourself ready and come along .

		It will be handy to have you around .

		If there is to be a fight , I want you to help me do my share of it , as you have done in times past . ''

		There was no beating about the diplomatic bush then , nor was there a month or so later , when Mr.
Lamon	PERSON	was sent on a pacificatory mission to Governor
Pickens	PERSON	of
South Caro	LOCATION	- lina .

		Secretary
Seward	PERSON	opposed the mission which certainly looked risky enough for Mr.
Lamon	PERSON	, in view of the then disposition of the
Carolinians	LOCATION	towards '' Lincoln hirelings . ''

		The President , however , at once clinched the matter : '' Mr. Secretary , I have known
Lamon	PERSON	to be in many a close place , and he has never been in one that he did n't get out of .

		By
Jing !	PERSON

		I '11 risk him .

		Go ,
Lamon	PERSON	, and God bless you !

		Bring back a Palmetto branch , if you ca n't bring us good news . ''

		Mr.
Lamon	PERSON	went ; and it is needless to say that it was the palmetto , and not an olive branch , that he brought back from
Charleston	LOCATION	.

		As we have said , the editor of this volume has succeeded in reducing her material to a fairly continuous narrative .

		It opens with an interesting chapter on Mr.
Lamon	PERSON	's early asso - ciation with Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, first at
Danville	LOCATION	, then at
Bloomington	LOCATION	, and on the circuit ; and thence passes on to the journey from
Spring	DATE	- field to
Washington	LOCATION	, the inauguration , and so on through the two administrations down to the assassination , at which time the Marshal was journeying to
Richmond	LOCATION	on probably the last passport ever issued by Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	.

		On the eve of his departure Mr.
Lamon	PERSON	, scenting danger , urged the President , in the presence of Secretary Usher , to go out as little as possible after nightfall , and on no account to go to the theatre .

		Turning to Mr.
Usher	PERSON	, Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	said : '' Usher , this boy is a monomaniac on the subject of my safety .

		I can hear him , or hear of his being around , at all hours of the
night	TIME	, to prevent somebody from murdering me .

		He thinks I shall be killed ; and we think he is going crazy .

		What does anyone want to assassinate me for ?

		If any one wants to do so , he can do it any day or night , if he is ready to give his life for mine .

		It is nonsense . ''

		Three nights later the speaker was shot , at pre - cisely the place against which he had been warned by his Marshal .

		Like many men of strictly practical training , Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	had a strain of superstition in his nature that contrasted oddly with his common views and practice .

		The very genius of strong sense and plain dealing in everyday matters , he set great store by dreams and omens , and seems to have long had a presentiment of his coming fate that amounted to certainty .

		A singular incident that greatly affected him oc - curred just after his election in
1860	DATE	. ''

		It was the double image of himself in a looking - glass , which he saw while lying on a lounge in his own chamber at
Springfield	LOCATION	.

		There was
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	's face reflecting the full glow of health and hopeful life ; and in the same mirror , at the same moment , was the face of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	showing a ghostly paleness .

		On trying the experiment at other times , as confirm - atory tests , the illusion reappeared , and then vanished as before ... To his mind the illusion was a sign , the life-like image betokening a safe passage through his first term as President ; the ghostly one , that death would overtake him before the close of the second . ''

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 243 The most startling incident of the kind was a dream Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	had just before his assassi - nation ; and however we may interpret the phenomenon as related to its sequel , the coin - cidence was certainly striking enough .

		De - scribing his dream to his wife , who had noted his disturbed appearance , Mr , Lincoln con - cluded : '' ... Determined to find the cause of a state of things so mysterious , I kept on until I arrived at the
East Room	LOCATION	, which I entered .

		There I met with a sickening surprise .

		Before me was a catafalque , on which rested a corpse wrapped in funeral vestments .

		Around it were stationed soldiers who were acting as guards ; and there was a throng of people , some gazing mournfully upon the corpse , whose face was covered , others weeping pitifully .

		Who is dead in the
White House	ORGANIZATION	? '

		I asked one of the soldiers . '

		The President , ' was his answer ; ' he was killed by an assassin . '

		Then came a loud burst of grief from the crowd , which awoke me from my dream .

		I slept no more that night ; and although it was only a dream , I have been strangely annoyed by it ever since . ''

		The volume contains a plentiful crop of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's quaint stories ; and these , Mr.
La	PERSON	- mon is careful to say , were usually told with a definite purpose often a very serious one .

		It is pretty difficult nowadays to realize that
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, the very soul of earnestness , sincerity , and public zeal , the man who per - haps above all others was penetrated with a realizing sense of the tragedy of his time and wrung by the spectacle of its blood and tears , was once freely denounced from press and platform as a vulgar jester , a '' buffoon , '' who , while driving over the corpse-strewn field of
Antietam	LOCATION	, was heartless enough to call on a companion for a comic song .

		The Antietam story ran the rounds of the press , and '' was repeated in the
New York	LOCATION	* World ' almost daily for three months . ''

		Marshal
Lamon	PERSON	was the '' companion '' in question ; and he devotes a chapter to clearing up the charge which was , of course , only a newspaper '' yarn '' of rather more than the usual degree of mendac - ity .

		Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	himself used to style his stories ' labor-saving contrivances '' ; which was a fair way of putting it .

		When he wished to light up a principle , or expose a fallacy , or re - duce the proposals of a long-winded meddler to absurdity , all in the shortest possible order , he simply told a story in point , to the great saving of his own time and the nation 's .

		The office-seeker was truly Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's bete-noire .

		While the fate of the country was trembling in the balance , he was constantly being called on to solve some squabble over patronage , to put good men in office , while heeding at the same time what he called '' the shrieks of locality . ''

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	, we remember , tells how a man , meeting Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	on the streets of Wash - ington and noting with alarm his unusually worried and abstracted look , asked anxiously : '' What is the matter , Mr.
President	PERSON	has any - thing serious happened at the front ? '' ''

		No , '' replied Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, wearily , '' it is n't the war ; it 's that post-office at
Brownsville	LOCATION	,
Missouri	LOCATION	. ''

		Very humorous , if summary , was his disposal of a delegation that once called on him to solicit a place as commissioner to the
Sandwich Islands	LOCATION	for a friend whose chief stated qualification for the post was that he was in poor health and needed a balmy climate . ''

		Gentlemen , '' said Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, kindly but firmly , '' I am sorry to say that there are eight other applicants for that place , and they are all sicker than your man . ''

		Second only to the office-seekers in vex - atious persistency were the well-meaning med - dlers who swarmed to the capital to tender their '' views '' to the President .

		Like sorrows , they came in battalions scarcely a day pass - ing without several delegations , loaded and primed for the edification or discomfiture of the
Administration	ORGANIZATION	, presenting themselves at the
White House	ORGANIZATION	.

		Some of them were com - mittees of clergymen , who came to offer their strategical views , and to propose sweeping changes in the conduct of the war .

		Mr.
Lin	PERSON	- coln listened courteously to all ; and once , when his patience was sorely tried by the cavils of some reverend gentleman from the West , he made the following notable reply : `` Gentlemen , suppose all the property you possess were in gold , and you had placed it in the hands of Blondin to carry across the
Niagara	LOCATION	river on a rope .

		With slow , cautious , steady step he walks the rope , bearing your all .

		Would you shake the cable , and keep shouting to him , Blondin !

		stand up a little straighter !

		Blondin !

		stoop a little more ; go a little faster ; lean more to the south !

		Now lean a little more to the north ! '

		would that be your behavior in such an emergency ?

		... This government , gentle - men , is carrying an immense weight ; untold treasures are in its hands .

		The persons managing the ship of state in this storm are doing the best they can .

		Do n't worry them with needless warnings and complaints .

		Keep silence , be patient , and we will get you safe across .

		Good day , gentlemen .

		I have other duties pressing upon me that must be attended to . ''

		Miss
Lamon	PERSON	's volume contains two portraits of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, one after a painting by
Healy	PERSON	done in
1868	DATE	, and one after a photograph of ten years earlier , together with several inter - esting documents in facsimile .

		Mr.
L. E. Chittenden	PERSON	's compact edition of ''
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	's Speeches '' is a useful 244 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, publication the first attempt , we believe , at a handy separately-issued volume of selections from Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's works .

		All of the speeches are worth reading , some are worth pondering , and one of them , certainly , ought to be en - graved on the memory of every American who cares for his country and has faith in the theory and the future of popular government .

		Compared with the
Gettysburg Address	ORGANIZATION	, half the '' famous speeches '' in the anthologies savor of fustian .

		Mr.
Chittenden	PERSON	's book is small , but it is representative , and contains enough to convey a just idea of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's style and powers , as well as of his views on the great issues of the period .

		The selections range , in time , from
1832	DATE	to
1865	DATE	; in quality , from the plain sense and homespun diction of his early speeches , to the condensed power and classic purity of the
Gettysburg Address	ORGANIZATION	.

		The editor has furnished a brief biographical intro - duction , and there is a good frontispiece por - trait .

		It may be remembered that on the thirtieth anniversary of the death of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	-LRB-
April 4 , 1895	DATE	-RRB- the publishers of the
New York	LOCATION	'' In - dependent '' issued a '' Lincoln number '' of their journal , containing some forty brief pa - pers on the Martyr President , by men who had known him , or had seen him under interesting conditions .

		This matter has since been pub - lished in book form , with the title ''
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	, Tributes and Reminiscences from his Associates , '' and it forms an acceptable and informing memorial volume .

		The Introduc - tion is by Dr.
Ward	PERSON	, editor of the `` Inde - pendent . ''

		The papers are critical , eulogistic , or anecdotal , according to the bents and stand - points of the respective authors .

		Among these we note Mr.
George S. Boutwell	PERSON	, Dr.
Henry M. Field	PERSON	, Mr.
Daniel D. Bidwell	PERSON	,
Senator Dawes	PERSON	, Dr.
Theodore Cuyler	PERSON	, Hon.
L. E. Chit	PERSON	- tenden , General
Neal Dow	PERSON	,
Grace Greenwood	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .

		Senator
Morgan	PERSON	of
Alabama	LOCATION	, once a gen - eral in the Confederate service , pays a thought - ful tribute to Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	, finding that his most conspicuous virtue as Commander-in-Chief of the Federal forces '' was the absence of a spirit of resentment or oppression toward the enemy , and the self-imposed restraint under which he exercised the really absolute powers within his grasp . ''

		It is related that President
Lincoln	PERSON	once said , in his quaint way , when about to sign the pardon of a man condemned to be shot for some breach of duty , that he did n't '' be - lieve shooting was going to do him any good . ''

		Nor did he believe harsh treatment was going to do the South any good ; and it is a common - place of history that the bullet of the wretched Booth deprived the South of its best friend , and put back substantial reconstruction a de - cade or more .

		We are glad to note that it is the serious and grandly humane , rather than the humorous , side of Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's character that stands out most prominently in this vol - ume , which is a very acceptable addition to Lincoln literature .

COLERIDGE	PERSON	'S NOTE-BOOKS .

		* Following almost immediately upon the pub - lication of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's Letters -LRB- reviewed in THE DIAL of
June 1 , 1895	DATE	-RRB- , and the renewed interest in the poet 's personality and writings which that work has awakened , the appear - ance of the '' Anima Poetse '' is most timely .

		The present volume is a '' collection of hitherto unpublished aphorisms , reflections , confessions , and soliloquies , '' made up from the note-books and pocket-books which
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	himself in - forms us were at times his '' only confidants . ''

		More than fifty of these noteworthy books have been preserved , dating from as early as
1795	DATE	down to the poet 's death in
1834	DATE	; and although occasional extracts from these copy-books had been published , there yet remained a vast quan - tity of literary material of which no use had been made .

		It is from this source that Mr.
Ernest Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	, the poet 's grandson , has brought together a volume of prose selec - tions , arranged as far as possible in chrono - logical order , and extending nearly from the beginning of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's literary career down to the
summer of 1828	DATE	.

		The note-books be - longing to the succeeding years -LRB- 1828-34 -RRB- , the editor states , are devoted too largely to theological and metaphysical disquisition to be of any great interest to the general reader .

		Among the five or six hundred topics touched upon in this book , ranging in length anywhere from a single line to four pages , that delight - ful confusion of subject prevails which gives a work of this sort its greatest charm .

		One finds here allusions and figures , a sentence or a paragraph , which the poet stowed away for future use in some lecture , essay , or poem ; brief passages on the more interesting of his daily experiences ; estimates of the characters of his literary friends ; thoughts on friendship , * ANIMA POET.E : Selections from the unpublished Note - Books of

		THE DIAL 245 love , and marriage , subjects that deeply moved
Coleridge	PERSON	's affectionate nature ; bits of criti - cism of contemporary criticism , interlarded with statements of more general import ; quo - tations from Greek ,
Latin	LOCATION	, German , Italian , and English classics , with either critical or in - terpretive comment ; suggestions for unwritten poems , nestling in among weightier and vaster metaphysical observations ; the strangest of fancies beside the most prosaic of practical admonitions ; and all these thoughts and fan - cies crowding each other to death , as
Cole	PERSON	- ridge observes was always characteristic of his thoughts , thrown off in his most impassioned moments before the glow of the poet 's imagin - ation was cooled by the pruning care of the artist .

		The intimacy which one can have with one 's note-book , but not at all times with one 's friends , is felt on every page ; and it is this , together with that subtle fineness of the breath and spirit of poetry , which is not sel - dom lost , or at any rate changed into a fine - ness of a different kind that often resolves itself into a classic coldness when put into more polished forms of verse and prose , that gives the work its unique value .

		The poet is not posing here : '' ... What I have seen and what I have thought , with a little of what I have felt , in the words in which I told and talked them to my pocket-books , the con - fidants who have not betrayed me , the friends whose silence was not detraction , and the inmates before whom I was not ashamed to complain , to yearn , to weep , or even to pray ! ''

		One may dip into the '' Anima Poeta3 '' almost at random , and come upon striking passages .

		Not a few may be found to illus - trate
Coleridge	PERSON	's intercourse with his friends ; take as an example this afterthought in which he records
Hazlitt	PERSON	's anger on the occasion of an animated argument and then proceeds to protest against
Wordsworth	PERSON	's nature-worship : '' A most unpleasant dispute with
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Hazlitt	PERSON	.

		I spoke , I fear , too contemptuously ; but they spoke so irreverently , so malignantly of the Divine Wisdom that it overset me .


Hazlitt	PERSON	, how easily raised to rage and hatred self-projected !

		but who shall find the force that can drag him out of the depths into one expression of kindness , into the showing of one gleam of the light of love on his countenance ?

		Peace be with him !

		... But , surely , always to look at the superficies of objects for the purpose of taking delight in their beauty , and sympathy with their real or imagined life , is as deleterious to the health and manhood of intellect as always to be peering and unravelling contrivance may be to the simplicity of the affection and the grandeur and unity of the imagination .

		dearest
William !	PERSON

		would Roy or
Durham	LOCATION	have spoken of God as you spoke of Nature ? ''

		Coleridge was at all times devoutly religious , and his faith , even when protesting against dogma , was pervaded by a gracious tender - ness .

		It was , however , as a conversationalist , or rather as a monologuist entirely monopolizing the talk , that
Coleridge	PERSON	exerted his greatest influence upon the men and literature of his time . ''

		No talk , '' says
Carlyle	PERSON	, '' in his cen - tury or in any other , could be more surprising , '' and though he adds that it more often speeded '' everywhither '' rather than '' anywhither , '' these discourses must have possessed an inim - itable eloquence , flooded as they were by that wealth of intellectual light and drawn from those immense stores of information always at
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	's command .

		Much of this marvel - lous power was necessarily fleeting , and to all except a few it is even now become , like the voice and personality of a great actor who is of the past only , a mere tradition .

		But judged by the standards of the ordinary conversation , there was a certain inappropriateness about these talks , of which even
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	himself at odd moments was conscious , though he urges a nimeity of ideas , not of words : '' There are two sorts of talkative fellows ... The first sort is of those who use five hundred words more than needs to express an idea that is not my case ... The second sort is of those who use five hundred more ideas , images , reasons , etc. , than there is any need of to arrive at their object , till the only object arrived at is that the mind 's eye of the bystander is dazzled with colors succeeding so rapidly as to leave one vague im - pression that there has been a great blaze of colors all about something .

		Now this is my case , and a grievous fault it is .

		My illustrations swallow up my thesis .

		I feel too intensely the omni-presence of all in each , pla - tonically speaking ; or , psychologically , my brain-fibres , or the spiritual light which abides in the brain-marrow , as visible light appears to do in sundry rotten mackerel and other smashy matters , is of too general an affinity with all things , and though it perceives the difference of things , yet is eternally pursuing the likenesses , or , rather , that which is common -LSB- between them -RSB- . ''

		He elsewhere in less serious vein hints that his conversation was not always adapted to his listeners : `` Coleridge !

		Coleridge !

		will you never learn to ap - propriate your conversation to your company !

		Is it not desecration , indelicacy , and a proof of great weakness and even vanity , to talk to , etc. , etc. , as if you -LSB- were talking to -RSB-
Wordsworth	PERSON	or Sir
G. Beaumont	PERSON	? ''

		Another noteworthy feature of the book is the descriptive portion .

		Coleridge was not the close observer of nature that
Wordsworth	PERSON	was , yet that association with the latter brought the former into a closer communion with nature is no more to be doubted than that the imagina - 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, tion of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	had , in turn , just as percepti - ble an effect upon the poetry of
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		On the whole , it was the right side of nature of which the poet was fondest , the grander and sublimer rather than the simpler things of na - ture ; but here , on the other hand , are two descriptive sentences quite in
Wordsworth	LOCATION	's own manner : '' The beards of thistle and dandelions flying about the lonely mountain like life , and I saw them through the trees skimming the lake like swallows . '' ''

		The old stump of the tree , with briar-roses and bramble leaves wreathed round and round a bramble arch a foxglove in the centre . ''

		The Wordsworthian will at once compare the former of these with those lines in the poem '' On the Naming of Point Rash-Judgment '' : '' And , in our vacant mood Not seldom did we stop to watch some tuft Of dandelion seed or thistle 's beard That skimmed the surface of the dead calm lake . ''

		Add to these passages one on the voice of winter : '' Now the breeze through the stiff and brittle-becom - ing foliage of the trees counterfeits the sound of a rush - ing stream or water-flood suddenly sweeping by .

		The sigh , the modulated continuousness of the murmur , is exchanged for the confusion of overtaking sounds the self-evolution of the One for the clash or stroke of ever-commencing contact of the multitudinous , with - out interspace , by confusion .

		The short gusts rustle , and the ear feels the unlithesome dryness before the eye detects the coarser , duller , though deeper green , deadened and not -LSB- yet -RSB- awakened into the hues of de - cay echoes of
spring	DATE	from the sepulchral vault of win - ter .

		The aged year , conversant with the forms of its youth and forgetting all the intervals , feebly repro - * duces them , -LSB- as it were , from -RSB- memory . ''

		It is too ambitious to hope for the '' Anhna Poetffi '' any such popularity as that accorded to the '' Table Talk , '' which in some particu - lars it closely resembles ; but the book is justly entitled to a place among
Coleridge	PERSON	's works , for it is here , above all , as its editor suggests , that the reader will be enabled '' to form some estimate of those strange self-communings to which
Coleridge	PERSON	devoted so much of his intel - lectual energies , and by means of which he hoped to pass through the mists and shadows of words and thoughts to a steadier contempla - tion , to the apprehension if not the compre - hension , of the mysteries of Truth and Being . ''

		The student of

		THE PROGRESS OF GLACIAL GEOLOGY .

		* The progress of glacial geology has been so great since the publication of the earlier edi - tions of Professor
Geikie	PERSON	's `` The Great Ice Age '' that in the revision it has been found necessary to rewrite most of the volume .

		Even those parts which are not wholly rewritten are so modified that they read as if now written for the first time .

		Apart from the alterations which the studies of recent years have made necessary , the general scope of the volume has been enlarged and somewhat changed .

		Many of the minor changes in the volume are of much interest to geologists .

		While these need not be here detailed , they are of general interest be - cause they furnish unmistakable proof that European and American interpretations of the phenomena of the glacial period are steadily approaching each other .

		The parts of the volume which will prove to be of most interest outside of geological circles are those which deal with the question of the recurrence of glacial epochs , the cause of the glacial period , and the existence of man dring the glacial period .

		According to the author , the sequence of events during the glacial period of
Europe	LOCATION	is as follows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- A glacial epoch , preceded by a period of increasing cold .

		At this time the ice filled the basin of the Baltic .

		The Alpine lands were swathed in snow and ice , and great glaciers came out from the moun - tains , making moraines on the low ground at their bases .

		The mountain regions of
Britain	LOCATION	were probably ice-clad , though of this there is no direct evidence .

		In
France	LOCATION	there were gla - ciers from the volcanic cones of
Auvergne	LOCATION	and Cantal , which descended so as to deploy upon the plateaus .

		-LRB- 2 -RRB- Then followed the first in - terglacial epoch .

		The southern part of the
North Sea	LOCATION	became land , and a temperate flora , comparable to that of
England	LOCATION	to-day , covered corresponding latitudes .

		A luxuriant decidu - ous flora occupied the valleys of the Alps , and * THE GREAT ICE AGE .

		1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 247 flourished at heights which it no longer reaches .

		-LRB- 3 -RRB- The first interglacial epoch was succeeded by a second glacial epoch .

		During this time the northern mer de glace reached its greatest extent .

		At the same time , the Alpine glaciers reached their greatest development ; while in the other mountains of
Europe	LOCATION	, snow fields and glaciers came into being .

		-LRB- 4 -RRB- The dissolution of this ice sheet was followed by a second inter - glacial epoch .

		The climate of Northern and
Central Europe	LOCATION	again became temperate , a tem - perate flora and fauna replacing the arctic forms which first occupied the land after the ice disappeared .

		The plants which occupied
Germany	LOCATION	and the central plains of
Russia	LOCATION	at this time indicate a climate less extreme than that which now affects these regions .

		Toward the close of this epoch the climate became more rigorous .

		The amount of river erosion accom - plished during this second interglacial interval was such as to testify to its great duration .

		-LRB- 5 -RRB- The diminution in temperature noted above culminated in the third glacial epoch , during which the development of ice was less exten - sive than in the second .

		The ice sheet of this epoch overwhelmed a large part of the British Islands , and spread itself widely upon the con - tinent .

		As in the preceding epoch , the Scan - dinavian and British ice sheets were confluent .

		From the Alps great glaciers descended to the lowlands .

		-LRB- 6 -RRB- Eventually the ice of the third epoch disappeared , and temperate conditions succeeded .

		Of this change , the best evidence is furnished by the younger interglacial beds of the Baltic coast-lands .

		-LRB- 7 -RRB- The fourth gla - cial epoch succeeded the third interglacial .

		During this epoch the
Lowlands of Scotland	LOCATION	were submerged to a depth of a hundred feet .

		The Highlands of
Scotland	LOCATION	had their glaciers , which in places reached the sea .

		The Alpine glaciers flowed for long distances down the great valleys , but fell far short of the dimen - sions reached by those of the earlier epochs .

		From
Scandinavia	LOCATION	, the ice moved out , filling the Baltic sea , and extending south to the Bal - tic ridge of northern
Germany	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- 8 -RRB- Follow - ing the fourth glacial epoch there was a fourth interglacial epoch , when deciduous trees spread far north into regions where their congeners no longer flourish .

		At this time the Baltic was converted into a great lake .

		Submergence fol - lowed , and the Baltic became an arm of the sea , with a fauna indicative of a climate warmer than the present .

		-LRB- 9 -RRB- Climate conditions again became more severe , resulting in the fifth gla - cial epoch .

		During this epoch there were local valley glaciers in the
British Isles	LOCATION	, the position of which shows that the snow-line in
Scotland	LOCATION	had an average height of 2500 feet .

		At this time ,
Scotland	LOCATION	was about fifty feet lower than now .

		In the Alps , the fifth glacial epoch is recorded in the moraines of the second so-called '' post-glacial '' stage .

		-LRB- 10 -RRB- The fifth intergla - cial epoch was marked by the reemergence of the land , and the retreat of the valley glaciers .


Britain	LOCATION	's area became wider than at present , but it is not known that connection was made with the continent .

		-LRB- 11 -RRB- During the sixth glacial epoch ,
Scotland	LOCATION	was submerged twenty or thirty feet more than at present .

		The snow - line then stood at an elevation of something like 3500 feet in
Scotland	LOCATION	, and a few small glaciers existed in the more lofty mountains .

		Several maps are given , showing the extent of the ice during the second , third , and fourth glacial epochs .

		During the second the ice reached its greatest extension .

		At this time ,
Ireland	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	were com - pletely covered by the glacier ice , which reached essentially to the valley of the Thames in En - gland .

		The ice of
Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	was con - fluent with that of the continent .

		On the con - tinent the ice covered all of
Holland	LOCATION	, part of
Belgium	LOCATION	, all the lowlands of
Germany	LOCATION	, and a large part of
Russia	LOCATION	.

		It reached its most south - ern extension in the valley of the Dnieper , somewhat below latitude 50 .

		Much of the evidence on which the distinct - ness of so many glacial epochs is based is some - what technical .

		Without discussing the evi - dence , the conclusions reached by its perusal may be stated .

		There would seem to be no question as to the distinctness of the two epochs which are designated as first and second gla - cial .

		The only question which could arise in this connection is concerning the glacial char - acter of the deposits which are referred to the first epoch .

		In favor of their reference to a glacial epoch , Professor Geikie seems to make a strong case .

		Between the deposits of the second and third glacial epochs , the '' lower '' and '' upper '' bowlder clays of
England	LOCATION	, there is a well-marked interglacial horizon .

		This ho - rizon represents an interval during which the land surface of
England	LOCATION	was free from ice , and very considerably elevated .

		During the eleva - tion , the climate changed from arctic to tem - perate , and the land surface became clothed with vegetation .

		Following this condition of elevation , and of climatic amelioration , there was a submergence of European lands to a lim - ited extent , during which , or accompanying 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, which , the climate changed from cold temper - ate to warm temperate , and then to arctic .

		The arctic conditions finally brought on the second great ice sheet .

		Thus , a very considerable in - terval of time intervened between the '' lower '' drift of
Britain	LOCATION	and the '' upper , '' and during this interval northern
Europe	LOCATION	experienced pro- found changes of climate and its lands suffered considerable changes of level .

		It is just such events as these , and especially the association of such events , which serve to differentiate epochs in geological chronology .

		The conclu - sions to which the evidence drawn from
Great Britain	LOCATION	leads are found to be as true for the continent as for the island , and to be based on an almost identical series of facts .

		So far as
Britain	LOCATION	is concerned , the evidence on which the third glacial epoch is separated from the fourth seems to be much less conclu - sive .

		The evidence for the separation of the corresponding formations on the continent is stronger .

		On the continent , the third glacial epoch was separated from the fourth by a very considerable interval of time , during which the ice disappeared entirely from
Germany	LOCATION	, though it may have lingered in the Scandinavian moun - tains .

		Like its predecessor , this interglacial interval is marked by old soils and peat bogs now occupying the horizon between the depos - its of the preceding and succeeding ice sheets .

		It is in these soils and peat bogs that remains of plants are found , which tell of temperate climate .

		The interglacial horizon is also marked by marine and fresh-water deposits , which were made after the deposition of the drift of the preceding ice sheet , and before the develop - ment of the next .

		The position of these beds shows that considerable changes of level took place during this interglacial interval , while their fossils indicate the non-glacial condition of the region at the time they were deposited .

		There is reason to believe that this interglacial interval was long , not only because the changes in climate and in the altitude of the land de - mand such a conclusion , but because there is specific evidence that the amount of river erosion accomplished after the preceding and before the following glaciation was great .

		The evidence of three glacial epochs in north - ern
Europe	LOCATION	is not limited to the two lines noted above .

		The several sheets of ` drift , the sec - ond of which overlies the first , and the third of which overlies the second , are different in phy - sical and lithological constitution .

		The differ - ent materials must have been gathered from different sources .

		This implies a difference in the direction of the ice movements which formed the several beds of drift .

		The differences in di - rection indicated are very considerable great enough to indicate that the centres of ice dis - persion must have been very different at dif - ferent stages of the ice period .

		On the whole , the evidence seems strong for the separation of the second glacial epoch from the third , and of the third from the fourth , in
Britain	LOCATION	, in
northern Europe	LOCATION	, and in
Switzer	PERSON	- land .

		We are not prepared to follow Professor
Geikie	PERSON	in the separation of the fifth glacial epoch from the fourth , and the sixth from the fifth .

		This separation is based on evidence which is far from convincing , if the word '' epoch '' is to retain the meaning which has been attached to it in this country .

		From the written page it does not appear that the fifth and sixth glacial epochs of
Europe	LOCATION	necessarily amount to more than considerable recrudes - cences of the ice which had been temporarily re - treating .

		But even if these so-called epochs rep - resent no more than minor advances of the ice , their recognition is a matter of some import - ance .

		It helps to emphasize what seems to be the fact in
America	LOCATION	as well as in
Europe	LOCATION	, that the glacial period was long and extremely com - plex .

		This is the conclusion to which detailed work on both continents seems to be surely leading .

		The chapters of this work which deal with the drift of
North America	LOCATION	were contributed by Professor
T. C. Chamberlin	PERSON	.

		They embody much that is new in the way of suggestion and classification .

		In these chapters Professor
Chamberlin	PERSON	directs attention to the fact that the recorded history of glaciation must really begin with the records left by the ice during its maximum extension , for at `` that time the records of all preceding glacial history were largely destroyed or obscured .

		Any minor gla - cial epochs that may have antedated the great - est extension of the ice could hardly be expected to have left decisive records of themselves .

		After the maximum extension of the ice in
North America	LOCATION	, it is found that there was an interval when the ice retreated to a great but undetermined extent .

		Subsequently the ice advanced again , but reached a position less advanced than during the preceding epoch .

		While the great body of the first sheet of drift was either covered or worn away by the ice of the second advance , its outer margin was left uncovered .

		After the second advance , the ice was melted back again for a great but unknown distance .

		Subsequently it advanced a third
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 249 time , but again failed to reach the limit which it had attained in the preceding advance .

		Thus the margin of the second sheet of drift remained uncovered by the drift of the third advance .

		Professor
Chamberlin	PERSON	has proposed to name these several sheets of drift as other geological formations are named .

		Thus , the oldest sheet of drift , which is the only one present in
Kan	LOCATION	- sas , is to be known as the Kansan formation ; the second as the
East	LOCATION	lowan formation ; and the third as the
East Wisconsin	LOCATION	formation .

		As now exposed , the Kansan formation occupies a belt of variable width along the outermost bor - der of the drift .

		Theoretically , it should only fail where the ice of the second advance reached its earlier limit , or where it has been removed by erosion .

		The Kansan formation should un - derlie the East lowan formation to the north , except where it was destroyed by the ice of the East lowan -LRB- or some later -RRB- stage of glacial his - tory .

		The exposed part of the East lowan formation , so named because it is well developed in
Eastern Iowa	LOCATION	, and because it has been care - fully studied in that region , occupies a belt north of the exposed edge of the Kausan for - mation ; while the
East Wisconsin	LOCATION	formation lies still further to the north , sustaining the same general relation to the East lowan forma - tion that this does to the Kansan .

		Because of the controversy which has arisen in
America	LOCATION	concerning the distinctness of gla - cial epochs , Professor
Chamberlin	PERSON	judiciously refrains from all assertion concerning the de - gree of distinctness of these several forma - tions .

		He does not even insist that they be referred to separate glacial epochs , but simply that these several formations be looked upon as marking distinct stages in the history of the ice period .

		These names may therefore be used , for the present , without raising the question of multiplicity of ice epochs .

		Whether these several formations represent distinct glacial epochs , or whether they represent sub-epochs only , must turn upon the meaning which at - taches to the term epoch .

		Until geologists have agreed upon the exact meaning of this term , as applied to glacial history , there is likely to be no harmony of opinion concerning the ques - tion of one or many glacial epochs .

		In this connection , Professor
Chamberlin	PERSON	says : '' If the ice age consisted of distinct glaciations sep - arated by climatic conditions as genial as those of to - day , they might as properly be called periods as epochs of glaciation .

		If the intervals of ice retreat , whether they amounted to complete disappearances or not , were comparable to the post-glacial period in duration , in the amount of erosion , weathering , soil production , vegetal accumulation , orographic movement , or other work done , or in the geniality of climate or the character of their life , they are surely entitled to be recognized as mark - ing epochs .

		If the intervals fall notably short of this , it is doubtless best to regard them as marking episodes , rather than epochs .

		The need for recognizing them would still remain , however , if we are to decipher and delineate the intimate history of the Ice Age . ''

		We suspect that many glacialists would not be willing to follow the above suggession in full .

		We suspect that many of them would hold that an interval of deglaciation might fall '' nota - bly '' short of the post-glacial interval , and still the re-advance of the ice constitute a separate glacial epoch , especially if the retreat and the subsequent re-advance of the ice were very con - siderable , and accompanied by climatic and orographic changes .

		If , for example , the ice retreated so far from its extreme position as to free the territory of the
United States	LOCATION	, and if , during this retreat , the region freed became temperate , a subsequent advance of the ice to the limit of the East lowan formation might perhaps not improperly be regarded as a dis - tinct glacial epoch , even if the deglaciation interval were notably shorter than the post - glacial epoch .

		Especially would this be true if the ice remained long in retreat , and if other events , such as changes of continental attitude , intervened .

		Even on the basis which Professor
Chamberlin	PERSON	has proposed , there is in the minds of many geologists no doubt that at least two , and very likely three , distinct glacial epochs have affected the North American continent .

		A judicious reading between the lines makes it clear that this is Professor
Chamberlin	PERSON	's own belief .

		Concerning the cause of the glacial period , Professor Geikie appears to have changed his opinion since the earlier edition of his work appeared .

		In that edition
Croll	PERSON	's astronomical hypothesis was advocated with apparently little hesitancy .

		In the present edition the discus - sion of the cause of the glacial period has been relegated to the end of the volume .

		This ar - rangement makes the chapter much less than heretofore an organic part of the volume , and it is distinctly pointed out that the general facts and relations of the drift are not depend - ent on any particular theory of glacial climate .

		While Professor
Geikie	PERSON	still believes that
Croll	PERSON	's hypothesis probably '' contains a large element of truth , '' he does not regard it as a full solution of the vexed question .

		He further indicates that the complex drift phenomena of
Europe	LOCATION	'' are evidence of a succession of changes too manifold , and perhaps occupying 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, too short a space of time , to be accounted for by the cause to which
Croll	PERSON	appealed . ''

		Pro- fessor
Geikie	ORGANIZATION	's final conclusion concerning the question , as expressed in his own words , is as follows : '' The primary cause of those remark - able changes is thus an extremely perplexing question , and it must be confessed that a com - plete solution of the problem has not yet been found . ''

		Concerning the relation of man to the gla - cial period , the conclusions of the volume have a special interest , since they represent a late view of the geological evidence relating to the antiquity of man .

		Professor
Geikie	PERSON	's interpre - tation of the English cave deposits is as fol - lows : -LRB- 1 -RRB- That man , and certain locally or altogether extinct animals , co-existed in En - gland at some period of time ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- that this period was of long duration ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- that after oc - cupying the caves for untold ages , the paleo - lithic man disappeared forever ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- that the second or neolithic period of human occupancy is wholly distinct from the paleolithic ; it is widely separated in time and culture , and is accompanied by a distinct fauna and flora ; -LRB- 5 -RRB- that , in general terms , continental cave de - posits yield a body of evidence of a closely sim - ilar character .

		He finds , further , citing much evidence , that the cave deposits , the valley drift , and the glacial and interglacial gravels pertain to one and the same general period , and con - cludes that that period lies between the culmi - nation of the second and third ice invasions .

		ANOTHER SHORT HISTORY OF
ENGLAND	LOCATION	.

		* Among the numerous histories of
England	LOCATION	that are constantly appearing , a work by Pro- fessor
Ransome	PERSON	demands more than passing attention .

		The author has already written '' An Elementary History of
England	LOCATION	, '' '' A Short History of
England	LOCATION	, '' and a series of lectures upon '' The Rise of Constitutional Government in
England	LOCATION	. ''

		In addition , he is joint author with the Hon.
A. H. Dyke Acland	PERSON	,
M.P.	LOCATION	, of a very valuable handbook of English history .

		In view of the ambitious work before us , these writings may be regarded as preliminary stud - ies .

		There is a vast extent of history compressed * AN ADVANCED HISTORY OF
ENGLAND	LOCATION	, from the
Earliest Times	ORGANIZATION	to the Present Day .

		By
Cyril Ransome	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	, Pro- fessor of Modern History in
Yorkshire College	LOCATION	,
Victoria Uni	LOCATION	- versity .


New York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		between the covers of this volume , for palaeo - lithic man in
Britain	LOCATION	and the fall of Lord Rose - berry are its terminal pages .

		The whole field is divided by dynasties , into eight periods .

		According to the preface , the author aims to meet the wants of four classes of readers : -LRB- 1 -RRB- those wishing '' to study in greater detail '' special phases of English history ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- teach - ers who may wish '' a fuller and more devel - oped treatment of events '' ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- university stu - dents ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- the general public '' who wish to have in their hands a handy but fairly full his - tory to which they may turn for ready infor - mation or the historical points that crop up day by day in politics or conversation . ''

		We surmise that of these classes of readers , the first will be sadly disappointed ; for the arrange - ment being chronological , one has to hunt from page to page in order to follow any special line of thought .

		This calls attention to the main defect of the book , which is that it lacks con - tinuity ; so much detail being thrown in , that the philosophy of the political development of a period is obscured .

		The history of
England	LOCATION	from
Henry II	ORGANIZATION	.

		to
Edward I.	ORGANIZATION	covers essentially a constitutional period that of the so-called '' Winning of the Charters '' ; but Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	dwells upon events of that time with so much minuteness that the great generic causes and the large lines then laid are lost sight of .

		From an institutional point of view , Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	's treatment of English history is very defective .

		The steady development of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	is not discernible throughout the period of its forma - tion .

		The Star Chamber suddenly appears under
Charles I.	PERSON	, but no allusion makes us ac - quainted with its origin ; and the same obser - vation is true of the
Privy Council	ORGANIZATION	.

		This fail - ure to treat constitutional Tiistory as a thing apart from minor matters is a cardinal defect ; for subjects like these are more likely to be the '' special phases '' of interest to most readers .

		Naturally in so condensed a work , political history must occupy the largest space .

		Only where literature bears a close relation to poli - tics , is it more than incidentally dealt with ; and the same rule applies to manners and cus - toms .

		In this way the author has secured more space than Mr.
Gardiner	PERSON	, in his well-known handbook .

		This is increased by omitting illus - trations also , much of the space thus saved being given and more profitably to maps -LRB- 38 -RRB- and genealogical tables -LRB- 21 -RRB- .

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	is a very positive Englishman .

		For example , we are told that '' probably the greatest event in modern history is the devel -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 251 opment of the British colonial empire '' -LRB- p. vii . -RRB-

		.

		Unless he dates modern history from
1815	DATE	, he will hardly be believed .

		The French Revolution , in comparison with this imperial fact , is styled '' one of the epoch-making inci - dents of the world 's history '' -LRB- p. 855 -RRB- .

		If Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	is right in his view of the importance of the British colonial empire , there is a poor outlook for the future , for it is asserted that '' even now , with all our facilities of steam and electricity , a real knowledge of the wants and conditions of the colonies is rare '' -LRB- p. 823 -RRB- .

		Some portions of the '' History of
England	LOCATION	'' are fuller and better than others .

		The account of the Roman occupation of
Britain	LOCATION	-LRB- pp. 15-16 -RRB- implies too much to square with the subsequent account regarding Christianity in
Britain	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 26 -RRB- .

		The way in which the complete displace - ment of the Keltic-Roman inhabitants is ac - counted for is very novel : '' So ruiuous had been the long struggle that the Celts could no longer occupy their former possessions , so that the laud lay desolate .

		This last statement of Gildas supplies the key to much that has hitherto appeared obscure ; for if the settlements of the English were made not in lands from which the Britons had just been driven , but in districts which had for some time lain waste , then the disappearance of the British race , with its language , customs , and religion , and its complete replacement by the English race , becomes perfectly in - telligible and in strict accord with the only contempo - rary narrative that has come down to us '' -LRB- pp. 22-3 -RRB- .

		But there are two defects in this view : In the first place , Gildas is a most unreliable author - ity ; and , secondly , the evidence of topography and archaeology are ignored .

		Moreover , if the struggle had been so ruinous '' that the Celts could no longer occupy their former posses - sions , so that the land lay desolate , '' how does Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	account for the exceedingly slow progress of the English conquest ?

		And , obiter dicta , why does he prefer the word '' Saxon '' to the more general term '' English '' ?

		On pp.
1089	DATE	the reader is disappointed to meet with the usual account of the causes and results of the Crusades .

		It is the rankest sort of writing of history , to say , in this day , that the Crusades began in
1096	DATE	, and that
Peter	PERSON	the Hermit was the genius of the movement .

		When Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	is writing narrative , he is at his best .

		The account of the preliminaries to the Hundred Years ' War is excellent , though it is much too much to speak of that war as '' an utterly unnatural feeling of hereditary hatred between the two countries '' -LRB- p. 246 -RRB- .

		Exception might be taken , too , to the state - ment that ''
Henry Fifth	ORGANIZATION	himself believed thor - oughly in the propriety of his demand '' for the French crown -LRB- p. 316 -RRB- .

		It is more than likely that
Henry	PERSON	was desirous of a pretext for foreign war in order that he might secure him - self more firmly in the hearts of the English people , for the title of the house of Lancaster to the throne was by no means clear .

		In dwell - ing upon the Hundred Years ' War , it would be refreshing if English historians were less insular in their thinking .

		In English writings , the work of
Bedford	LOCATION	, since it lay in
France	LOCATION	, is assumed to have had slight influence upon En - gland .

		Yet the reforms of
Bedford	ORGANIZATION	in
France	LOCATION	, when regent for the infant Henry VI. , are largely accountable for Charles VII .

		's sudden awakening ; he realized that if he were to re - cover
France	LOCATION	he must do so by counter-means of the same sort , which resulted in the French people rallying to the support of the crown , and the consequent expulsion of the English .

		French historians , although somewhat dazzled by the bright figure of
Jeanne Dare	PERSON	, are better than English in appreciating the reciprocal in - fluence of
Bedford	LOCATION	's reforms upon those of Charles VII .

		Here and there a failure to be acquainted with late researches is betrayed in Mr.
Ran	PERSON	- some 's work .

		The paragraph -LRB- pp. 225-6 -RRB- devoted to
William Wallace	PERSON	represents him as a hero of Scottish independence , and not a rebellious feudal vassal , as Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	has shown .

		Again , we are told , in speaking of early English local government , that '' a group of townships formed the hundred .

		... In the south , ' hundred ' was the term usually em - ployed ; in the east
Midlands	LOCATION	and in
Yorkshire	LOCATION	, ' wapentake ' '' -LRB- p. 43 -RRB- .

		Yet in
1888	DATE
Canon Taylor	ORGANIZATION	showed that the evidence of Domesday goes to show , if it does not prove , that the wap - entake was an administrative division compris - ing three '' hundreds . ''

		Similarly , Mr.
Ran	PERSON	- some seems to be unaware -LRB- p. 400 -RRB- that late research has shown that
Clement	PERSON	VII .

		actually granted a bull of divorce between
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		and
Katherine	PERSON	.

		It may be unfair to judge a writer in a field in which his rival is the master , but the
Puri	PERSON	- tan Revolution is very unsatisfactorily treated when compared with the account of Mr.
Gardi	PERSON	- ner .

		There is next to nothing said of
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's government ; nothing at all of his major-gen - erals ; the massacre of
Drogheda	LOCATION	is slighted , and
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	's continental and commercial policy resolves itself into the deeds of one man
Blake	PERSON	.

		The author ventures to disagree with
Ranke	PERSON	in respect of the character of
Charles I.	PERSON	; while
Charles II.	PERSON	, on the other 252 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, hand , is said to have been '' a man of consum - mate ability '' -LRB- p. 642 -RRB- .

		Some other judgments may be questioned , e. g. , Dunstan is pro- nounced '' the most remarkable English sub - ject who lived before the Norman Conquest '' -LRB- p. 65 -RRB- .

		How about Godwine ?

		John is said to have been well-read , though his learning rests on the statement that he once borrowed a book from the abbot of
St. Alban	ORGANIZATION	's , which
Stubbs	PERSON	thinks of slender authority -LRB- p. 168 -RRB- .

		Shakespeare 's delineation of
Richard III	ORGANIZATION	.

		is accepted -LRB- p. 299 -RRB- .

		On p. 540 occurs the statement that ''
Pym	PERSON	was quite of opinion that Laud and Strafford had been engaged in a sys - tematic plot , the one to overthrow Protestant - ism , the other parliamentary government ... This is now known to be a caricature of
Straf	LOCATION	- forcTs real position . ''

		Are we , then , to believe that Laud seriously intended to overthrow Prot - estantism ?

		The loss of
Waterloo	LOCATION	is attributed directly to
Napoleon	PERSON	-LRB- p. 908 -RRB- .

		And , speaking of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, is there not a touch of irony in the allusion to the '' beautiful and healthy '' island of
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- p. 910 -RRB- ?

		The statement has the sound of an Englishman 's hereditary hatred of
Bonaparte	ORGANIZATION	.

		So , also , Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	's estimates of Castlereigh and
Canning	ORGANIZATION	have a Tory ring -LRB- pp. 912 , 936 -RRB- .

		E'it criticism to be just must be relative , not absolute .

		The exceptions taken above have been in matters where there is room for honest doubt ; and a good author always has preposses - sions in his favor .

		Moreover , they are few in number compared with the amount of matter presented ; the defects indicated represent pro- protionately a slight percentage of the narra - tive .

		For a book of information , presenting a clear , succinct narrative , Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	's '' His - tory of
England	LOCATION	'' will take rank with the best handbooks .

		To the public at large who wish to have a ready source of information as to facts and facts are the body of history it will commend itself .

		The correlation of these facts , what
Guizot	PERSON	called the physiology of his - tory , is less evident , and perhaps was not in - tended .

		The thoughtful reader in this case will dwell upon what he here reads ; while in the case of the university and college student , the very absence of this element allows room for original force and suggestion ; he must think for himself if he would understand .

		At times , however , even in the domain of facts , Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	is manifestly wrong .

		The most obvious example of this , to an American reader , at least , is the statement that '' In
1861	DATE	a war broke out between the northern and southern sections of the
United States	LOCATION	... The slave - owning States of the South viewed with apprehension the rise of an Abolitionist party in the North , and when
Abraham Lin	PERSON	- coln , an Abolitionist -LSB- ! -RSB-

		was elected president , they declared their intention of seceding from the union '' -LRB- p. 999 -RRB- .

		If a second edition of the '' History of
England	LOCATION	'' is called for , it is to be hoped that Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	will first read the platform of the
Chicago	LOCATION	Republican Conven - tion , and also Lincoln 's first Inaugural .

		More - over , he has yet to learn that the negroes were not freed , and could not be enfranchised , by an act of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- p. 1000 -RRB- .

		A few minor errors may be pointed out , which are doubtless due to oversight : The peace of
Wedmore	LOCATION	was in 879 , not 886 -LRB- p. 55 -RRB- ; Cnut , not
Harold	PERSON	, became king in
1017	DATE	-LRB- p. 75 -RRB- ; Americans , at least , speak of Bunker Hill , not
Bunker	ORGANIZATION	's Hill -LRB- p. 824 -RRB- ;
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		was executed
Jan. 21 , 1793	DATE	, not in
February	DATE	of that year -LRB- p. 860 -RRB- ; the French Empire was declared in
May	DATE	, not
December , 1804	DATE	.

		In style the narrative is plain and unvar - nished , to the point of tediousness ; it is hard reading ; yet that , perhaps , is to be expected in a work of such condensation .

		But at times the language is careless .

		The average reader would infer an old English township and a bor - ough to be governmentally wholly distinct from one another , owing to omission of the word `` or '' in the last paragraph on p. 41 .

		Again : '' When Tacitus wrote , few German tribes were ruled by kings , but kingship was universal among the En - glish who had settled in
Britain	LOCATION	'' -LRB- `` p. 46 -RRB- .

		One would infer that the English , when on the con - tinent , were of two sorts those who had kings and those who had not .

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	's think - ing is not always clear .

		We are told -LRB- p. 854 -RRB- that from one point of view the French Revo - lution was '' the abolition of mediaeval feudal - ism '' ; from another , '' the abolition of privi - lege , '' whereas the essence of feudalism was privilege .

		So , again , in the account of the States General of
1789	DATE	, there is lack of defin - iteness of statement -LRB- p. 858 -RRB- ; and on p. 866 the Spanish and Dutch fleets , in
1795	DATE	, are sud - denly found cooperating with
France	LOCATION	, though no reason is given for the fact .

		Perhaps , though , more has already been required than it is right to expect from an author seeking to compress the enormous space of two thousand years into a thousand pages .

		THE DIAL 253 A NEW ARCTIC BOOK .

		* If the reader will look to his map of
Europe	LOCATION	, he will find lying off the far northwestern out - skirts of
Russia	LOCATION	, in the Arctic Ocean , a con - siderable island named Kolguev .

		This Kol - guev -LRB- pronounced Kol-gwev -RRB- is so little known that the adventurous soul of Mr.
Trevor-Bat	PERSON	- tye , an English traveller of some experience , was drawn toward it with a view to exploration . ''

		Whether those were right who had main - tained that we should find it quite impossible to land at all ; whether , if we did succeed in landing , we should discover a harbor where the
Saxon	PERSON	might be secure ; what birds , flow - ers , and mammals we should chance upon ; whether we should find people there , or only a desolate and barren land , in a word , the idea of the unknown , this it was which really at - tracted me , as it has attracted many before . ''

		This ignorance was , however , in a degree unnecessary .

		If the author had taken down so common a reference book as '' Chambers 's Encyclopaedia , '' he would have read under `` Kolguef '' : '' It is visited in
summer	DATE	by fur - hunters , and fowlers , who capture eider-ducks , swans , and other sea-birds that yield down .

		The only permanent inhabitants are a few Samoyedes . ''

		While
Kolguev	PERSON	is not quite the terra incognita that Mr.
Trevor-Battye	PERSON	would have us believe , yet it is sufficiently unknown to justify such an expedition as he undertook .

		On the second of
June , 1894	DATE	, our author left
Peterhead	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, on the steam yacht ''
Saxon	PERSON	. ''

		The rather commonplace voyage is described in Chapters I.-V. , which might easily have been omitted .

		In Chapter II .

		he puts this curious preface to his three-page de - scription of Tromso : '' Many of my readers will know
Tromso	LOCATION	and its surroundings far better than I , and can skip this next bit , which I simply take straight out of my journal as it stands . ''

		Surely what most readers would skip is just the thing to omit .

		The book-mak - ing traveller is often tempted to pad .

		The reader will , then , miss nothing by waiv - ing unimportant preliminaries , and begin with Chapter VI. , where our author is set down on the lonely isle , and his real adventures begin .

		After six days of tramping , he succeeded in finding some of the native Samoyeds , and he lived with or near them for the next three * ICE-BOUND ON KOLGUEV .

		months .

		These people moved from pasture to pasture with their herds of reindeer , which subsisted chiefly upon lichens .

		When a party once stopped to bait the deer , he found that in ten minutes they ate '' the lichen which lay around them without moving from where they stood . ''

		Although snow lay in patches all
summer	DATE	, yet flies and mosquitoes were some - times very troublesome .

		Under record of
July 19	DATE	, he says : '' The mosquitoes were bad to - day , and gnats were in clouds .

		I think the Samoyed name for mosquito is so good 4 nyanink ' they call it , from the noise and its stab . '

		Nya ' is its singing , and then * nink , ' and in goes its horrid stab . ''

		The staple food of the
Kolguev Samoyeds	PERSON	is the wild goose .

		Mr.
Trevor-Battye	PERSON	gives a very interesting description of a '' goosing . ''

		Thou - sands of wild geese were driven into a trap , and there despatched with clubs .

		They then hid them under fresh turf for a few days , and afterward prepared them for winter 's use .

		Mr.
Trevor-Battye	PERSON	learned many Sarnoyedic prac - tices , but he never mastered their method of eating . ''

		The Samoyeds held the food between their teeth , and with the other end in their left hand cut quickly upwards , with the knife close to their noses .

		We tried this , but not success - fully .

		It requires much practice , because of your nose . ''

		Our author got on very well with his Samoyed acquaintance .

		He even succeeded in obtaining some of their idols , or bolvans , which they usually conceal with great care .

		But one of his successes was so discreditable that we wonder he records it .

		On his ex - ploration of their Holy Hill , he was accom - panied by a guide who kept sharp watch on his visitor . ''

		I felt he had his eye on me all the while , for whenever I moved a hand towards the bolvans he turned quickly around with a cunning intelligence on his face .

		But I was one too many for him .

		For I offered him a cigarette which I had made from a leaf of my note-book .

		And while he was stooping down to light this , I managed to slip a small bolvan and the spoon into my pocket unperceived . ''

		Mr.
Trevor-Battye	PERSON	's description of the
Sam	PERSON	- oyeds is fuller and closer than Mr.
Jackson	PERSON	's account in '' The Great Frozen Land , '' recently reviewed in THE DIAL -LRB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, ' 95 -RRB- , but on the whole they confirm each other .

		He finds the Samoyeds a simple , friendly people , of much ability in certain ways , and he resents the con - trary imputations of other writers . ''

		Why , '' he asks , '' does Nordenskiold put these
Samoy	PERSON	- eds at the bottom of the
Arctic Mongol	ORGANIZATION	group ?

		254 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, He makes them the lowest .

		And why does
Carlyle	PERSON	, casting about for an instance of hope - less barbarity , pitch on the poor Samoyed ?

		This book , if it shows anything , will surely reveal the Samoyed as an extremely intelligent man , far and away more so than the Red In - dian . ''

		The main part of this book may be cordially recommended to the general reader as an en - tertaining narrative of varied adventures and experiences .

		The style , as is apparent from our quotations , is very lively , but sometimes becomes careless and slangy .

		The book is pro- vided with maps and scientific appendices , and is fully illustrated with interesting drawings by various artists .


HIRAM M. STANLEY	PERSON	.

		RECENT ENGLISH NOVELS .

		* It must be admitted , curious as is the fact , that there are hardly half a dozen English novelists now living and to the manner born , whose work is as acceptable and as deserving of praise as that of a Dutchman of letters who has chosen to use the En - glish language rather than his native idiom , and has learned to use it so effectively that he must be reckoned to all intents and purposes an English novelist .

		Those who indulge in dreams of a time when English shall have become the universal lan - guage may well find a happy omen in the fact that a foreigner , who might easily occupy the foremost place among his contemporaries in his own country , should be found willing to relinquish such an honor for the sake of enrolment in the English literary guild , and for the sake of the larger audience that he is thus enabled to reach .

		came so completely naturalized in
Germany	LOCATION	or
France	LOCATION	, respectively , as ''
Maarten Maartens	PERSON	'' has become in the republic of English letters .

		It is in - teresting to note , in this connection , the recent re - port that Sig .

		d'Annunzio has decided henceforth to write primarily for French rather than for Italian readers .

		Such cases , however , must at the best be sporadic ; it will not frequently happen that writ - ers of one country will have both the inclination and the ability to make of the idiom of another the chief medium of their expression . ''

		My Lady Nobody , '' the latest novel of our Anglicized Dutch - man , is one of the strongest novels of the season , although we are inclined to rank it a little below God 's Fool '' and '' The Greater Glory . ''

		It is without the thin veil of poetical allegory that gives so great a charm to those two books , although it is quite their equal in shrewd observation , genial humor , and sane envisagement of the relations of everyday life .

		The characters do not seem quite as sharply realized as they might have been at least , some of them do not and an uncertainty in the use of English idiom is now and then noticeable .

		But the book is a very human document , after all for Dutch humanity is very much the same as any other and does equal honor to the head and the heart of the writer .

		Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	, doubtless , would wish his latest work of fiction to be described as '' a human docu - ment , '' and , indeed , he gave that very title to one of its predecessors .

		But the claim may be made for '' The Heart of Life '' only with some qualifi - cation .

		It is not so much essential humanity with which Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	deals as humanity of exotic or morbid type .

		This , at least , must be said of the three or four characters upon which he has spent the most pains .

		And there is throughout the work a disagreeable streak of perverted feeling , an envis - agement of the ethical problems of sex , that needs so ugly a word as '' nasty '' to give it adequate expres - sion , and that vitiates the atmosphere of the entire book .

		This is no new thing with Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	, as readers of his earlier books do not need to be told .

		Having lodged this needed caveat , we will hasten to do justice to the better qualities of the novel in question .

		So careful a work , written in so graceful and cultured a style , is calculated to give consider - able pleasure to readers of taste , in spite of the subtle immoralities of its conception .

		There is a well-bred air about it all , and a command of felicit - ous phrase , that bespeak attention and interest .

		Particularly in the delineation of the
Countess Shimna	PERSON	does the writer display his best literary qualities .

		She is one of those fascinating foreign women in whom he delights , and she is presented with a poetical investiture that completely capti - vates the on-looker and wins for her his instant sympathies .

		The character of Pole , likewise , is built up from within rather than from without , and wins respectful sympathy .

		Into this latter charac - ter Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	has put no little of himself a
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 255 remark suggested not so much by Pole 's specific attitude toward socialism as by the whole tenor of his life and mental habit .

		As for Pansy the other woman who plays ducks and drakes with his heart we must give her up as quite unintelligible .

		Mr.
R. S. Hichens	PERSON	, whose amusing skit '' The Green Carnation '' stirred up the menagerie of the decadents a few months ago , has now .

		produced a serious piece of fiction . ''

		An Imaginative Man '' may be described as a study in morbid psychology that ends in nothing less than insanity .

		The hero is a man of high-strung and sensitive nature , self - centred and cynical , who , married to a pretty and commonplace woman , takes her to
Egypt	LOCATION	for a win - ter vacation .

		He sees the Sphinx for the first time in his life , and is thereby inspired with an absorb - ing passion .

		He can not tear himself away from the fascinating presence of the mysterious statue , and finally , in a mad ecstasy , dashes out his brains against its base .

		The story sounds bald , and even ludi - crous , in this outline , but it is not so in the reality .

		The steady encroachment of madness upon his in - tellect is subtly worked out , and a sombre poetry invests the successive scenes of the drama , inviting to anything rather than mirth .

		We must say , how - ever , that about the minor episodes of the story there is something repulsive , in spite of the imaginative quality of it all ; and that the night scene in
Cairo	LOCATION	, with all its force and vividness , is a thing that could have no place in a work of serious and wholesome art .

		Careful characterization without which no work of fiction can expect to be taken seriously has not usually been looked for in Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	's novels .

		In this respect , `` Joan Haste '' is a marked advance upon any of its predecessors , for it intro - duces us to three or four characters which are de - lineated with fairly satisfactory art .

		This is par - ticularly true of Sir
Richard Graves	PERSON	, of whom we receive a really vivid impression , and who thinks and acts in a consistent way throughout .

		The new novel has nothing to do with strange scenes or peoples ; it gets along without the accessories of mystery and carnage in which the author has been wont to delight ; it is simply an English story , deal - ing in semi-melodramatic fashion with a few hack - neyed themes .

		It does not prepossess one in its favor to learn that it turns upon the betrayal of a young girl by an English nobleman , upon the self-sacrifice of the girl Camille-f ashion at the instance of an agonized parent 's pleadings , and upon the dis - covery when too late that she is the heiress to a great property .

		Yet it is undeniable that Mr.
Hag	PERSON	- gard has made an interesting tale out of these sit - uations , and that we forget at the time of reading how utterly hackneyed they are .

		The story loses in vigor and reality toward the end , and the wind - ing up of its complications is excessively bald and unconvincing .

		Nor are the characters all well done , for that of
Samuel Rock	ORGANIZATION	is about as grotesque and unreal as any that is ever met with in the most pre - posterous sort of fiction . ''

		The Emancipated , '' although just published in the
United States	LOCATION	, is not , we understand , Mr.
Giss	PERSON	- ing 's latest novel .

		We are happy to say that the unqualified condemnation we felt bound to bestow not long ago upon a recent production of that writer is by no means to be dealt out to the volume now before us , which impresses us as the best of Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	's novels that we have read .

		It is certainly untainted by the vulgarity characteristic of so much of his work , and contains studies of a number of men and women in whose company it is pleasant to be .

		Then there is the background of
Southern Italy	LOCATION	to cast a sort of glamour over the pages .

		It would be a poor book indeed that could not attract by the frequent use of such magic names as
Capri	LOCATION	, Paes - tum , and
Amalfi	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Gissing	PERSON	presents us with several types , or rather degrees , of intellectual emancipation , and his moral appears to be that such a thing as too much freedom is quite possible .

		An undercurrent of rather bitter feeling about English Puritanism runs through the book , and the author seems to out -
Arnold Arnold	LOCATION	upon this subject .

		The best character-study is that of the woman who out - grows the Puritan environment of her early years , and discovers that the world offers a larger air and a freer view than may be found in the dissenting society of a stagnant English town .

		The lady who writes over the signature of '' Tasma '' is usually entertaining , although her work never rises far above the plane of mediocrity .

		There is considerable variety of character and incident in '' Not Counting the Cost , '' and a somewhat ques - tionable moral .

		The heroine , that is , does not ac - tually violate the conventional code , but is saved from so doing by a series of fortunate accidents , rather than by a resurgence of principle strong enough to defy temptation .

		We are somehow left with the impression that it would not have been very wrong for her to assure her family a comfort - able existence at the cost of her own honor .

		The story of this little group of Tasmanians , self-exiled in
Paris	LOCATION	, and struggling against heavy odds for a subsistence , has much pathetic verisimilitude , and seems to be told from first-hand knowledge of the main conditions .

		The title of Mr.
Frank Barrett	PERSON	's latest novel will best illustrate how wide a departure has been taken from the conventional lines of even the romance of adventure .

		It runs as follows : '' A Set of Rogues ; to-wit :
Christopher Sutton	PERSON	,
John Dawson	PERSON	, the
Seftor Don Sanchez del Castillo de Castellafta	ORGANIZATION	, and
Moll Dawson	PERSON	, their wicked conspiracy , and a true ac - count of their travels and adventures , together with many other surprising things , now disclosed for the first time , as the faithful confession of
Christopher Sutton	PERSON	. ''

		In other words , Mr.
Barrett	PERSON	has given us a very good imitation of the picaresque fiction of the seventeenth century , with a suitable archaism of diction , and a fine sense of the appeal of mere reckless adventure to the unsophisticated imagina - tion .

		We read this story , just as we read its pro- 256 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, totypes of two centuries ago , with sheer interest in the doings of the persons concerned , and with little care for the morality of their actions .

		They start out to gain fraudulent possession of an estate , and we can not help hoping that they will succeed , so un - moral is the atmosphere of the tale .

		When they do eventually accomplish their purpose , we rather ap - plaud them , and are reduced to so wicked a frame of mind that we hope they will not be found out .

		Later in the narrative , they exhibit marked com - punctions of conscience , by no means in keeping with their characters , and we can not but think that the intrusion of this note is an artistic error .

		Lamb 's well-known theory of the conventional character of the Restoration drama applies equally to works of this class , and is one of the profoundest truths to which that great critic ever gave expression .

		Eth - ical motive has no place in a story like this , and one may rejoice in the turpitude of such a '' set of rogues '' without the slightest danger of falling out of moral equilibrium .

		We have in this book one of the best stories of adventure that recent years have brought to our reach . ''

		When Charles the First Was King '' is a his - torical novel in the manner of Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	's ''
Micah Clarke	PERSON	, '' but rather more artificial and laborious than that striking work of fiction .

		It is told in the first person by an eye-witness of some of the stir - ring events that led up to the
Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	, and its incidents are seen in the retrospect of old age .

		The narrator was not a soldier , except for a brief time and as it were by accident , but he was mixed up in the great fight at
Marston Moor	ORGANIZATION	, and met
Cromwell	ORGANIZATION	face to face .

		Historical study of the period and a close familiarity with the
Yorkshire	LOCATION	country have stood him in good stead , and his story , if not wildly exhilarating , is at least well - planned and interestingly told .

		Dr.
Conan Doyle	PERSON	's latest publication will not add to his reputation .

		It is in form a series of letters addressed by a young English surgeon to a friend in
America	LOCATION	, descriptive of the struggles of the for - mer to gain a professional foothold and to attain mental equilibrium in matters of philosophical and religious concern .

		This double motive is at work in every chapter of the correspondence , and the juxtaposition is utterly incongruous .

		Most readers will skip the moralizing -LRB- which is of a rather callow sort -RRB- and fix their attention upon the very slender thread of the story , only to be disappointed in the pettiness and poverty of the narrative .

		The one seri - ous attempt at characterization is the singular Cul - lingworth , whose preposterous antics may be found amusing , but who is no more a real living figure than any wooden puppet worked by strings .

		If Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	cares anything for his literary standing , he will abandon the sort of pot-boiling of which this book is a flagrant example , and will seek to regain public confidence by means of the historical novel , of which he is an undoubted master .

		Mr.
Weyman	PERSON	is better advised in this respect than Dr.
Doyle	PERSON	, and does not stray from the field in which he has won a well-deserved success .

		His passages `` From the Memoirs of a Minister of
France	LOCATION	'' are a series of imaginary episodes in the life of the
Due de Sully	ORGANIZATION	, running from about the period when his royal master had concluded that
Paris	LOCATION	was worth a mass , to the inception of the Great Design , and the foul crime that left that gigantic plan only a dream .

		These chapters dis - play inventive powers of a high order , and show their author 's remarkable insight into his chosen period of history .

		Each of them is a story com - plete in itself , yet the character of the great Min - ister links them together into one chain .

		They are more than interesting ; they are true to the essen - tial facts of history , without for a moment becoming dull or pedantic .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Early in the seventies , a familiar % ure at the
New York Union Club	ORGANIZATION	was a stately , well-mannered , neatly - dressed gentleman of seventy odd years , pleasantly known to younger habitues as the '' Old Tycoon . ''

		This gentleman who -LRB- to quote his nephew , Pro- fessor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	-RRB- '' disliking the noisy , fast , stock-exchange element of the club , '' chose to pass his time '' talking sense '' at one end of the room with the few , while the many '' talked dollars '' at the other was
Townsend Harris	PERSON	,
America	LOCATION	's first Envoy to
Japan	LOCATION	, a man who did perhaps as much as any individual toward unsealing the Her - mit Kingdom to the commerce and ideas of the
West	LOCATION	.

		Among the foreign diplomatists who assisted in that work , it is Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's distinction to have left by far the kindliest impression on the minds of the Japanese .

		He is remembered by them to-day as '' the nation 's friend . ''

		Says the native writer ,
Nitobe	PERSON	' : u The mission of
Perry	PERSON	was that of a pion - eer ; that of
Harris	PERSON	, a sower .

		The duty of one was to force a barred door open ; that of the other was to keep it open .

		... If an ambassador , according to
Wotton	PERSON	's definition , ' is an honest man sent abroad to lie for his commonwealth , '
Harris	PERSON	was no diplo - matist .

		If , on the contrary , an American minister to an Oriental court is a representative of the moral principles of the great
Christian Republic	ORGANIZATION	,
Harris	PERSON	deserves the name in its best sense . ''

		The volume before us , ''
Townsend Harris	PERSON	,
First American En	ORGANIZATION	- voy to

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Mr.
Wm. Elliot Griffis	PERSON	, consisting of Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's Japanese diary , together with some complementary biographical and historical chapters by Mr.
Griffis	PERSON	, is a very timely and acceptable book .

		Since the outbreak of the late war in the
East	LOCATION	, competent writers have shown us in ample detail the
New Japan	LOCATION	, politically a modern power , and fast outgrowing her period of tutelage ; but the
New Japan	LOCATION	can not be understood , still less the nation 's long and heroic effort in thfr

		THE DIAL 257 way of self-transformation be appreciated , without attaining a notion of what
Japan	LOCATION	was at the time the process of change began .

		To this end , readers will find the present work decidedly helpful .

		The journal extends from
August 21 , 1856	DATE	-LRB- the date of Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's landing as Envoy at
Shimoda	LOCATION	-RRB- , to
February 27 , 1858	DATE	, when the hard-won treaty open - ing the Japanese ports was ratified .

		The obstacles he encountered in the way of native insularism , and official duplicity and obstruction , seem almost in - credible in view of the Japanese character of to-day .

		The journal is largely a record of a long and exas - perating contest with native officialdom a process of alternate wheedling and '' bluffing '' on the part of the Envoy against a race of '' diplomatists '' who for '' ways that are dark and tricks that are vain '' showed themselves no whit behind their Chinese counterparts , and would have easily distanced the comparatively ingenuous Talleyrands and
Metter	PERSON	- nichs of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Once , the badgered Envoy writes plumply , '' They are the greatest liars on earth '' a statement somewhat modified later on .

		It was not until
September 25 , 1857	DATE	, that Mr.
Harris	PERSON	re - ceived permission to go to Yedo to present the Pres - ident 's letter to the
Mikado	LOCATION	in person a prelim - inary step to a second stage of tedious diplomatic fencing with the experts of the native
Circumlocu	PERSON	- tion Office .

		The battle , however , was finally won ; and in
1859	DATE	Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's services were rewarded by the appointment , on President
Buchanan	PERSON	's nom - ination , as Minister Resident of the
United States	LOCATION	to
Japan	LOCATION	.

		He resigned in
1861	DATE	, reaching
America	LOCATION	to find the nation he had served so well rent by civil war .

		Says Mr.
Griffis	PERSON	: '' It was while returning home , in an agony of fear for the safety of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, that the loyal American ,
Townsend Harris	PERSON	, was directly and personally insulted by the Captain of a British mail steamer flying the Confederate flag .

		Englishmen often wonder whether Americans ' hate ' them , and why . ''

		Perhaps the captain thought reprisals were in order for our usual ante-election performances in regard to the Irish Question .

Harris	PERSON	's diary forms an interesting and valuable document , and the editor has put it in excellent shape for the use of general readers .

Japan	LOCATION	as a clever child mimicking the ways of its elders , and amusing itself for a space with its toy army , toy fleet , toy railroads , telegraph , etc. , is out of the question since Yalu and Port
Arthur	PERSON	.


Japan	LOCATION	her - self has all along resented the unflattering flattery ladled out to her by amiable visitors like Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	; and it is now plain that what may be termed the globe-trotter view of her must be re - placed by something more actual and prosaic .

		To this end we know of no book at once more concise , practical , and comprehensive than Mr.
J. Morris	PERSON	's '' Advance
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The author was long connected with the
Tokio Department of Pub	ORGANIZATION	- lic Works , and his pages have naturally a slightly statistical flavor .

		He aims to call attention to the more serious side of the Japanese , to their solid qualities of perseverance and ambition of excelling , and particularly to the strong mechanical bent which has contributed largely to raise them to their present position .

		He endeavors to show that the Japanese , so far from being , as popularly supposed , essentially a race of clever copyists with '' a genius for assimilating , '' have a marked turn for initiative ; and that they are already inventing and developing from their acquired standpoint on lines peculiarly their own .

		To select a striking if rather question - able example , the
Murata	ORGANIZATION	rifle used by the
Japan	LOCATION	- ese forces , and one of the most destructive and efficient weapons extant , is a native invention .

		An idea of the staple matter of the volume may be gathered from such chapter-headings as '' Admin - istration , '' '' Natural History , '' '' Dress , Diet , and Manners , '' '' Mines and Minerals , '' '' Armaments , '' '' War with
China	LOCATION	, '' '' Colonization and Trade , '' '' The Future of
Japan	LOCATION	. ''

		Each chapter is a com - pact summary of its subject-matter , from a point of view intimated in the rather flamboyant title of the volume .

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	is a decided Japanophile ; and while his facts are undoubtedly accurate , we think it is to be regretted that he has not toned down his somewhat optimistic views and forecasts with a tincture of the frank criticism and admoni - tion that
Japan	LOCATION	just now peculiarly needs .

		She has had applause and flattery enough to spoil a less practical people .

		Carlyle , we remember , getting impatient of the prolonged chorus in praise of
George Washington	LOCATION	, once grimly announced his intention '' to take
George	PERSON	down a peg '' ; and there is possibly a growing number of those who await with interest the candid soul who shall do the like by
Japan	LOCATION	.

		As to the late war , it is quite true that , as Mr.
Morris	PERSON	says ,
Japan	LOCATION	'' thrashed her enemy within an inch of her life '' ; but the exploit would seem to be , on her friends ' showing , largely exag - gerated .

		It does not seem to occur to the recent writers who , on one page , hold up the Chinese army to scorn as an '' unorganized mob , '' and laud the Japanese army as a '' magnificent fighting - machine '' on the next , that they are thereby show - ing their idol 's victory to have been a hollow affair relatively , and a poor criterion of what
Japan	LOCATION	might be expected to do if confronted in the field by a '' fighting-machine '' on a footing with her own .

		Mr.
Morris	PERSON	has something to say of
Japan	LOCATION	's past history ; and he sensibly scouts the popular error that she has put on Western civilization like a garment miraculously transforming herself , as it were , overnight , on the French plan in
' 89	DATE	.

		As the French Revolution smouldered for a century before breaking into flame , so
Japan	LOCATION	's startling changes in 1867-8 were due to the final upheaval of a political system long undermined by natural agencies .


Japan	LOCATION	too had , if on a narrower and 258 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, more local scale of doctrine , her philosophes , her volunteers of the pen , her Rousseaus , Diderots , and Condorcets , who riddled the time-worn fabric of feudalism with solid bolts of fact and reason , as it tottered to its
fall	DATE	.

		The present volume contains a number of plates , including some interesting charts and cuts of naval and military engagements in the late war .

		Dr.
Edward S. Holden	PERSON	's informing book n '' The M S ul Emperors of Hindustan '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- may be gen - erally described as a mosaic of well-chosen extracts from the best native and foreign authorities .

		The author 's own rather slender contribution to the text is creditable and scholarly , and serves to give it some degree of narrative consistency .

		The chief authorities consulted are the Memoirs of the em - perors themselves , which are freely quoted ; the standard histories of
Elphinstone	LOCATION	,
Malcolm	LOCATION	, Ers - kine , Price ,
Hunter	PERSON	, and
Howorth	PERSON	; the records of early missions and voyages ; the translations of the native historians , by Sir
Henry Elliot	PERSON	, Professor
Dowson	PERSON	, and Professor
Blochmann	PERSON	.

		Chapter VIII. , on '' The Ruin of Aurangzeb , '' is a reprint of Sir
William Hunter	PERSON	's fine sketch of the downfall of the last great Mogul emperors .

		The present author has not essayed to give the history , or even a continuous historical study , of the reigns in question , but rather , as he says , '' to present such views of the personages involved as an intelligent reader of the histories themselves might wish to carry away . ''

		This aim seems to us to be amply fulfilled .

		The work opens with a concise account of
Tamerlane	LOCATION	-LRB- in which it is made clear that
Marlowe	PERSON	knew little beyond the truculent side of his Scythian Shepherd 's nature -RRB- , thence passes on to the reigns of
Babar	LOCATION	,
Humayun	PERSON	,
Akbar	LOCATION	,
Jahangir	PERSON	, the
Empress Nur-Mahal	ORGANIZATION	,
Shah Jahan	PERSON	and
Aurangzeb	PERSON	, and closes with an
Appen	PERSON	- dix comprising a list of the various conquests of
India	LOCATION	, beginning with
Alexander	PERSON	's , and ending with
Babar	PERSON	's , in
1525	DATE	.

		There is also a useful chrono - logical and genealogical table .

		There are a number of curious illustrations , mainly portraits of the Mo - gul rulers , many of them from the originals in the British Museum , and a few from miniatures belong - ing to the author .

		By thus selecting and putting together in compact shape information hitherto so widely dispersed and difficult of access , Dr.
Holden	PERSON	has done general readers a real service .

		French royalty Miss
Anna L. Bicknell	PERSON	's graphic t the days of the papers in '' The Century Magazine '' Second Empire .

		^ Qn L j fe j n ^ Tuilerieg under the Second Empire '' have been issued , by the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in a handsome volume .

		Miss BickneJl was the English governess of the daughters of the
Duchesse de Tascher de la Pagerie	ORGANIZATION	, the daughter - in-law of the Empress
Josephine	PERSON	's first cousin who was installed with his household in the imperial residence throughout the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the friendliest terms with the family of her charges ,
Miss Bicknell	PERSON	was an actual inmate of the Tuileries , seeing the Emperor and
Empress	ORGANIZATION	almost daily , and meeting familiarly the members of their immediate entourage .

		She is thus enabled to paint for us in minute and familiar detail royalty minus its state robes and formalities .

		A warm admirer of the Emperor , she dwells on his unaffected gentleness and amiability , his unfailing courtesy to all , from minister to lackey , giving many anecdotes illustra - tive of these traits .

		Toward Euge ` nie she is less friendly ; the estimate of her , as of her husband , tallying closely with that of
M. Paul de Lano	PERSON	, whose opinion we have just cited .

		Portraiture and anecdote form the staple of the volume , which is well written and commendably free from question - able gossip and '' revelations '' of the baser sort .

		Of the little Prince Imperial , '' a pale , grave child , '' yet with his due share of a boy 's turn for mischief , some humorous stories are told none so humor - ous , however , as an accompanying portrait , repre - senting him -LRB- at about five -RRB- clad in the uniform of the Old Guard , and nearly extinguished by a bear - skin shako that might have adorned one of his grand-uncle 's grognards .

		Alas , the brief humors of the ill-starred Prince 's childhood merge into pa - thos when one thinks of the boyish figure , a few years later , stretched cold and stark on the turf of distant Zulu-land the terrible assegai wounds all in front , for he died facing his foes , as became a scion of the great Emperor . ''

		When he saw , '' said the Zulus who had slain him , '' that he was for - saken and could not escape , he turned on us like a young lion '' ; and an eye-witness thus describes the finding of the body : '' He was lying on his back .

		His head was so bent to the right , that the cheek touched the sward .

		His hacked arms were lightly crossed over his lacerated chest , and his face , the features of which were nowise distorted , but wore a faint smile that slightly parted the lips , was marred by the destruction of the right eye from an assegai stab . ''

		M.
Pierre de Lano	PERSON	's ''
Napoleon IIL	PERSON	'' the second volume in the Se - cret of an Empire '' series -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , shows an advance in serious historical and personal interest over its rather gossipy and sensational predecessor .

		The author is as favorably disposed toward the Emperor as he was unfavorably toward his wife who , supposing M. de
Lano	PERSON	's ac - count of her to be measurably true , was not only a cold wife and mother , a fickle friend , and a par - venue , but -LRB- as the instigator and fomenter of the German war -RRB- a grave state criminal as well .

		M. de
Lano	PERSON	's portrait of
Napoleon III	ORGANIZATION	.

		is pathetic and engaging .

		In his pardonable admiration for the Emperor 's private character , he endeavors , with some plausibility , to show that the iniquitous Coup d'Etat of
1851	DATE	was virtually a revolution , in which its reputed author is to be regarded rather as a semi-passive protagonist , who , the sport of destiny , was borne resistlessly on by the current of events ,
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 259 and partly forced to enact his questionable role .

		The plea seems to us decidedly more ingenious than convincing .

		The volume closes with a spir - ited account , the details of which will be new to most readers , of
Eugenie	ORGANIZATION	's flight from
Paris	LOCATION	after Sedan , under the protection of the American den - tist , Dr.
Evans	PERSON	.

		The affair throughout strikingly recalls the historic flight to
Varennes	LOCATION	, the Doctor 's too-sumptuous carriage taking the place of the ill - starred berline , and the little town of
Evreux	LOCATION	, where the fugitives were recognized and stopped by a mob , only lacking a Drouet and a Mayor Sausse to have fairly completed the parallel .

		The book is graphic and piquant , and repays reading .

		An attractive volume entitled '' Na - P leon ' s Last Voyages ' ; -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- comprises the diaries , first of Admiral Sir
Thomas Ussher	PERSON	, who conveyed Bona - parte to
Elba	PERSON	on board the . ''

		Undaunted , '' and , secondly , of
John R. Glover	PERSON	, Secretary of Rear - Admiral
Cockburn	PERSON	, who conveyed him to
St. Helena	ORGANIZATION	on board the ``
Northumberland	LOCATION	. ''

		We suppose these documents are authentic ; but it is to be re - gretted that the editor has left us in the dark as to their history , and as to whether they have or have not been before published , entire or in part .

		There is a note , however , appended by Mr.
Glover	PERSON	to his diary , stating that the same was kept for his own gratification , and particularly requesting that anyone into whose hands it may fall shall not copy or print it .

		How long this request was obeyed , we are not told .

		The editor 's contribution to the volume con - sists of a few not indispensable notes , and some rather superfluous facts as to Admiral
Ussher	PERSON	, whose portrait is also thrown in .

		The journals themselves , especially Mr.
Glover	PERSON	's , are very inter - esting .

		On the voyage to
St. Helena	LOCATION	,
Napoleon	PERSON	seems to have conversed about himself , his past , his friends , and his rivals , with astonishing freedom ; and Mr.
Glover	PERSON	's notes on the habits and appear - ance of the royal captive are fresh and graphic .

		An interesting feature of the volume is the portraits of the Emperor chance sketches , several of them , showing him as he appeared at the time , and in characteristic attitudes .

		Syrian history , Dr -
William Wright	PERSON	's comely volume archaeology , entitled ''
Palmyra	LOCATION	and Zenobia '' and travel * .

		-LRB-
Thomas Nelson & Sons	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is about evenly compounded of history , archaeology , and travels .

		In the way of history , the author naturally does not attempt to add much to what the early historians have told us of
Zenobia	LOCATION	's disastrous con - flict with the Romans ; but he has nevertheless availed himself to some extent of current popular traditions , a source to which he inclines to ascribe more weight than his predecessors have done . ''

		In a bookless land , '' he says , '' traditions are carefully preserved among a people who talk and listen , but do not read , and the wonderful story of the
Sitt Zeinab	PERSON	-LRB- or Lady Zenobia -RRB- is scarcely more myth - ical on the lips of the Palmyrans and
Bedawin	PERSON	, than is that of
Zenobia Augusta	PERSON	in the pages of
Trebellius Pollio	PERSON	,
Zosimus	PERSON	, and Vopiscus . ''

		The ex - plorations and incidents recorded are the fruit of a nine years ' sojourn in
Syria	LOCATION	; and as the writing was done on the spot , partly in the saddle and partly in the tent , it is unusually fresh , crisp , and full of local color .

		Half the volume is devoted to the ruins of
Palmyra	LOCATION	and the story of
Zenobia	LOCATION	, and the remainder to travels and adventures in
Bashan	LOCATION	and the desert .

		The illustrations are profuse , and of much archaeological interest .

		Sheridan as a '' Great Commander . ''

		The latest volume in the '' Great Commanders '' series -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a life of General
Sheridan	PERSON	, which was completed by the late General
Henry E. Davies	PERSON	only a month before his death .

		The author served under
Sheridan	PERSON	during the whole of his
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	command , and admires him most heartily ; but the book has little of the vivacity that personal acquaint - ance and experience might have given it .

		From the number of its details , it fails to make upon the reader the impression that a more artistic grouping of the wonderfully interesting facts of
Sheridan	ORGANIZATION	's career might make exceedingly vivid .

		It is a solid piece of work , showing painstaking labor , and may be relied on as a history of that part of the war in which
Sheridan	PERSON	was engaged .

		The special interest lies in the chapters describing
Sheridan	PERSON	's reorgani - zation of the cavalry forces of the army of the Po - tomac against the strenuous opposition of General
Meade	PERSON	, his brilliant campaign in the
Shenandoah Valley	LOCATION	, and his even more brilliant work in head - ing off Lee 's army and making its capture inev - itable .

		This brief narrative shows that
Sheridan	PERSON	's success was not merely that of a dashing trooper , but that he possessed the solid qualities of a great military leader , caution , power of combination , quickness in seeing and seizing an advantage , per - sonal attractiveness , and power of winning the con - fidence of his troops .

		Lord
Nelson	PERSON	's career and character .

		The
Life of Nelson	ORGANIZATION	written for the `` English Men of Action '' series -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- by Mr.
J. K. Laughton	PERSON	is a straightforward narrative of the career of En - gland 's brilliant naval hero .

		The author indulges in no fine writing , and the first half of the book is a little heavy ; but when the story of
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's achievements in the wars of the French Revolution is reached , there is no lack of life , for the events described are such as turn the current of history and change the destinies of nations .

		The tone of the book is sympathetic yet judicial .

		While the greatness of
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's deeds is acknowledged , and the lovable qualities of the man and officer , and his genius as a naval commander , are fully described , the other side of the hero 's character is not hidden .

		His disgraceful relations with
Lady Hamilton	PERSON	, his vanity and jealousy and insubordination , are set forth fully enough to give a true portrait .

		260 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Mr.
M. J. Knight	PERSON	has prepared , in two volumes , '' A Selection of Passages from Plato for English Readers '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The selections are from
Jowett	PERSON	's trans - lation , and the work carries out an expressed wish of the late Master of Balliol .

		In fact , the selection was made in large part by
Jowett	PERSON	himself , having in mind the needs of the
University Extension	ORGANIZATION	student and of the general reader .

		`` The metaphysical part of Plato 's philosophy has been kept in the background , attention being drawn especially to the political and ethical ideals which form a great part of his teaching , and which , like the simple truths of religion , have a peculiar and un - dying attraction for ourselves . ''

		Each extract has a brief introduction by Mr.
Knight	PERSON	, and the work is fur - nished with a good index .

		The revival of interest in the popular fiction of a past generation has brought us many reprints of old favor - ites , and it has been clearly only a question of time when the romancer of the solitary horseman should have his turn .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons now issue , in what they call the ''
Fontainebleau Edition	ORGANIZATION	, '' the '' Richelieu '' of

		If this is the fore - runner of a complete edition of James , the publishers have before them a task of no little magnitude .

		ProfessorC .


Horstman	PERSON	, late of the
University of Ber	ORGANIZATION	- lin , has edited for the '' Library of Early English Writ - ers '' the works of
Richard Rolle	PERSON	of Hampole and his followers -LRB-

		The volume is the first to be issued in the series to which it belongs , and contains no less than 442 closely-printed pages .

		There is no index , or even conspectus of the contents of any sort , and the Introduction , written in ponderous Teutonic style , gives practically no clue to the contents of the work .

		This introduction , we are informed , is `` to be continued , '' but as to when , where , or why , the bewildered student gets no intimation .

		We are , of course , thankful for the bare text , but we should be doubly thankful were it accompanied by a modicum of useful apparatus .

		Messrs.
Curtis & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
Boston	LOCATION	, publish a '' Hand - book of the New Public Library in

		It is mainly devoted to the artistic features of the building the architecture and the painting all of which are described at length , and well illustrated by photographic reproductions .

		The history of the library is not , however , wholly neglected , nor its special collections and other bibliographical features .


Boston	LOCATION	may take a just pride in such an incorporation of the higher civic ideals as this noble building with its con - tents embody , and visitors to the institution will do well to provide themselves with the pamphlet which has oc - casioned this note .

Herrick	PERSON	's best poems ; but I have also , by including some that are by no means his best , aimed at giving an idea of his work that would be fairly accurate as well as pleasing . ''

		The editor 's introduction , which extends to some sixty pages , is a critical and biographical study that exhibits high qualities of scholarship and discern - ing taste .

Roland	PERSON	is ware of the hand of death ; with such might as he may He upriseth , and rallieth his strength O me , but his face is grey !

		He hath grasped sword Durendal bared ; before him a brown rock rose ; In sorrow and wrath he smiteth thereon ten giant blows . ''

		One can get a very fair idea of the substance and spirit of the great epic from this little volume .

		The next publication of the
Grolier Club of New York	ORGANIZATION	will be an edition of the Poems of Dr.
John Donne	PERSON	, reprinted from the edition of
1633	DATE	, revised by
James Russell Lowell	PERSON	, with the various readings of the other editions of the seventeenth century , and with a preface , an introduction , and notes by Professor
Norton	PERSON	.

		The edition will be in two sixteenmo volumes , printed from new Scotch type on German hand-made paper , and will contain portraits of Dr.
Donne	PERSON	, and other embel - lishments .

		The work is expected to appear in
Novem	DATE	- ber .

		It is interesting to note , in this connection , that the new
Caxton Club of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, an organization some - what similar to the
Grolier	ORGANIZATION	, contemplates reproducing , as its first publication ,
Franklin	PERSON	's edition , issued in
Phil	LOCATION	- adelphia in
1744	DATE	, of
Cicero	LOCATION	's ''
Cato Major	PERSON	, or Discourse of Old Age . ''

		The translation is one made for Frank - lin 's edition by Judge
Logan	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	; and in the reprint it is intended to reproduce , so far as prac - ticable , the characteristic features of
Franklin	PERSON	's typo - graphy .

		296 THE TEACHER AS AN INDIVIDUAL .

		Those with whom biography , and particu - larly autobiography , is a favorite form of read - ing , often have occasion to note the influence exerted by teachers of strong personality upon men who have afterwards attained sufficient distinction to make the story of their lives worth reading about .

		The literature of auto - biography is full of tributes appreciative , affectionate , grateful , and reverent to the memory of the men who , at the impressionable age of the writers ' lives , gave to them the bent that was to remain characteristic , inculcated the ideals of learning or of conduct that were thereafter to be pursued .

		The affection of Mar - cus
Aurelius	PERSON	for Fronto , of Xenophon and Plato for
Socrates	LOCATION	, are classical instances that at once rise in the memory .

		The tribute of the Florentine to his teacher , met upon the Fiery Plain of the
Seventh Circle	ORGANIZATION	, and reminded of `` La cara e buona imagine pater n a Di voi , quando nel mondo ad ora ad ora M'insegnavate come 1 ` uom s ` eterna , '' has been repeated , with every possible shade of tender expression , by all sorts and conditions of men of the modern world , down to the pupils of Arnold at Rugby , and of other teachers of our own day .

		The name of many a faithful teacher has been rescued from the oblivion that else awaited it by some such tribute as that of Dante to
Brunetto	LOCATION	, uttered by some voice that has compelled the world 's attention , and many a reader of such utterances has felt a responsive thrill of gratitude as he has recalled the devoted ministrations and sympathetic guid - ance of some teacher of his own youth .

		It is to be noted that in nearly all cases of the class now under discussion , the teacher is remembered as an individual , a distinctly - marked character , a personal influence for good ; rarely , if ever , as the representative of a system or the exponent of a method .

		Stress is laid upon the fruitful contact of soul with soul , not upon the workings of the educational machinery , however nice the adjustment of its parts .

		Nor is the teacher thus held in grate - ful remembrance because of his success in cram - ming the student with facts , or because of his skill as a disciplinarian .

		Success of this sort may be accounted highly by administrative educational bodies , but is as nothing in the 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, afterglow of the student 's recollection , unless associated with success of a very different kind .

		It is wisdom rather than knowledge , sympa - thetic insight rather than mere strength of will , that makes upon the student a lasting impres - sion and leaves him with an abiding sense of deep obligation to his mentor .

		However com - pletely a teacher may achieve the lower aims of educational work the aims that are tested by examinations , and theses , and the observa - tion of official visitors a student will feel but slight personal indebtedness if the higher aims have not at the same time been sought after with equal strenuousness .

		It is in the realiza - tion of these higher aims that the pith of the matter is found , and school inspectors -LRB- unless they be men of the
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	type -RRB- can know next to nothing of the degree to which they have been realized .

		Many wise writers upon education have sought to set forth the really vital aims of the art pedagogic ; none , perhaps , more success - fully than Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	.

		He says : '' There appear to be three dominant states of mind , with groups of faculties associated with each of them , which it is the business of the instructor firmly to es - tablish in the character of the future man .

		The first is a resolute and unflinching respect for Truth ; for the conclusions , that is to say , of the scientific reason , com - prehending also a constant anxiety to take all possible pains that such conclusions shall be rightly drawn .

		Connected with this is the discipline of the whole range of intellectual faculties , from the simple habit of cor - rect observation , down to the highly complex habit of weighing and testing the value of evidence .

		The second fundamental state in a rightly formed character is a deep feeling for things of the spirit which are unknown and incommeasurable ; a sense of awe , mystery , sub - limity , and the fateful bounds of life at its beginning and its end .

		The third state , which is at least as diffi - cult to bring to healthy perfection as either of the other two , is a passion for
Justice	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Here is a programme indeed , one not embodied in any official document , and quite irreducible to the neat formulas of methodology , yet more or less distinctly present in the consciousness of every true educator , and the object of his most earnest desire .

		Such were the aims of
Socrates	LOCATION	, as far as we may disentangle them from the iridescent web of Platonic expression ; such have been the aims of the inspired teach - ers of all generations since .

		What , it may well be asked , is the bearing of these extremely abstract considerations upon the actual problems of the present educational day ?

		To us the reply seems very obvious .

		Such aims as we believe to be the most essen - tial of all in education are not easy of attain - ment at best , and whatever tends to repress the individuality of the teacher tends also to make impossible the attainment of these aims .

		Most teachers , in most civilized countries to-day , are so cabined , cribbed , and confined , by admin - istrative prescription , that they are not free to be individuals at all ; they are only cog-wheels in the machinery .

		What we are sometimes tempted to call the curse of centralization has so fallen upon most of our educational or - ganizations that the very word '' system '' has come to have the connotations of lifelessness , and inadequacy , and dull uniformity .

		The higher education has generally learned the lesson that system , although an excellent ser - vant , is a poor master , but the lower education everywhere calls loudly for emancipation .

		The teacher in a German Gymnasium , a French lycee , an English board school , or the school of an American city , is so hampered by need - less regulations and requirements , by the drudg - ery of unnecessary bookkeeping and prescribed written work , by the exigencies of over-de - tailed courses of instruction and ill-chosen text - books to say nothing of the negative embar - rassment resulting from a sadly deficient school equipment that he becomes utterly disheart - ened at the thought of doing good work under so great a variety of adverse conditions , and can only resign himself to his fate .

		Take the matter of text-books alone : a text - book is a tool , and its chief excellence is in being fitted to the hand that must use it .

		There is no more reason why a teacher should have forced upon him a text-book that he does not like than there is for denying a cabinet-maker the right to select his own tools .

		It is irra - tionally urged that a school system must be based upon the use of uniform school manuals ; whereas uniformity in such a matter is not even desirable , let alone being necessary .

		In our own country , we act for the most part upon the crude theory that administrative boards may properly select the text-books to be used by teachers , and the patent evils for which this notion is responsible are counted as nothing in comparison with the blessings of uniformity .

		The simple truth is that uniformity in this and many similar matters is the veriest bugbear , and that what is needed more than anything else is the reduction of prescriptive uniformity to the barest minimum .

		In fact , the attitude of the educator towards this subject should be that every sort of uniform regulation must give indubitable proof of its necessity before it has any right to exist ; the prevalent attitude being , we need hardly say , that the presumption is in
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 277 favor of the uniform rule .

		Local option is as essential to educational as to political vitality , and it should be extended not merely to every school , but to every individual teacher , in every case possible .

		!

		* ?

		The urgent plea , heard at all educational gatherings , and voiced in all educational jour - nals , that we need better teachers in our schools , is doubtless the one to be kept most prominent in current discussions , and can hardly be re - peated too persistently .

		But when the ques - tion of ways and means comes up , there are opportunities for a wide divergence of opinion .

		What we most need is pedagogical training , says one ; another rides the hobby of increased superintendence ; a third finds in higher sal - aries and permanent tenure a sovereign remedy for the evil of inefficient teaching .

		All these opinions have their weight ; and , doubtless , our teachers would be better as a class if more of them were first professionally trained , then wisely guided during the early years of their work , and all the time assured of advancement in proportion to the development of their ability , and of a compensation befitting the high char - acter of their calling , and the social status which should of right be theirs .

		But , excellent as all these things are , we venture to think a still worthier aim that of making the profession of teaching attractive by making it one that may be pursued without the loss of self-respect .

		We do not get the best kind of men and women in our schoolrooms , mainly because we make it only too evident that we do not want them .

		The kind of person who ought to be there is the kind of person who is not likely to be will - ing to submit to the petty regulations with which most of our teachers are hedged about .

		Too many of our public school systems have as their basis distrust of the teacher 's ability , and even of his honesty .

		Then , when it is sug - gested that such and such matters may very suitably be left to the discretion of the indi - vidual teacher , we are informed that he can not be trusted to deal properly with them .

		There never was a more vicious circle of reasoning .

		The formula seems to be : first , to eliminate from the schools all persons likely to have and to exercise good individual judgment ; second , to complain that those who are left can not be trusted to think for themselves , but must have their work laid out for them on the most rigid lines .

		We firmly believe that this deliberate suppression of the teacher 's individualism is one of the greatest evils that now exists in our pub - lic education , and that it offers a field for the reformer quite as promising as that which is offered by the question of superintendence , the question of professional training , or the ques - tion of compensation and tenure .

		THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH AND THE MAKING OF WRITERS .

		The recent volume on the teaching of English , made up of the papers contributed to THE DIAL during the past year by sundry college professors , suggests a train of thought to the literary worker , the main points of which may herewith be set down .

		Anyone who takes the trouble to examine the book , and who knows the earlier conditions of En - glish culture in our institutions of learning , must perforce testify to the betterment of the situation chronicled therein .

		In half a dozen or more places in this country , the student may now , instead of the vague , aimless aesthetico-critical smattering that did service aforetime , receive a symmetrical and catho - lic training in the linguistic , historical , comparative and purely literary aspects of a study which is com - ing properly to be recognized as a natural culture - centre for men and women of our speech .

		By adopt - ing the German method and taking advantage of the specific courses at several colleges , a post-grad - uate scholar can get a broad training such as was not dreamed of a generation ago .

		But conceding this improved situation , a question of paramount importance to the embryo litterateur arises : to-wit , Under present conditions may one wishing to fit himself for the career of letters take , with the best results , the modern course in English offered by a progressive university or college ?

		The latter-day tendency , increasingly , is to emphasize the philological side of English study ; this being a reaction from the previous too exclusive devotion to aesthetics , and a natural result of the wonderful development in the vigorous young science of lan - guage .

		Like all reactions , in some quarters it has gone too far , so that occasionally a thinker like Pro- fessor
Corson	PERSON	sounds a note of warning .

		Young men have forgotten literature in a still-hunt after the umlaut ; they have failed to see the forest for the leaves .

		But while the attention to philology , as such , may be prosecuted with a zeal which for - gets that at least for the future literator it is but a means to an end , it is quite true that a thorough grounding in historic English , enabling the student to trace steadily the evolution of both language and literature from the beginnings , makes the best pos - sible basis for all other exercise in the use of the mother-tongue for purposes of literary creation .

		He who has traced organically English literature from the start , who knows not only his Chaucer and
Shakespeare	PERSON	, but his Beowulf and Caedmon as well , may be trusted to have a sense of English as an instrument of expression and a medium of thought such as one not so thoroughly indoctrinated could 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, not command .

		If the initial severe linguistic drill be not allowed to swamp -LCB- esthetic taste and inter - est , he who undertakes it will rejoice thereat for the rest of his literary life .

		It is further to be said that he who now essays to study English , looking eventually to literary work , gains much from the fact that the subject can be pursued in its historic associations , atmos - pherically : in other words , English can be investi - gated as one of the allied groups of Germanic tongues .

		The English scholar of the present day makes the acquaintance not only of Old English , but of the German , Dutch , and Scandinavian lan - guages , and he gets in this way a comparative sur - vey of the speech and literature of a number of important and richly productive tongues bound by blood-ties to his own .

		The immense advantage to literary culture of attention to the classics has been insisted upon , time out of mind : a similar drill , and a similar , though perhaps not equal , enrichment is won from a knowledge of these linguistic first and second cousins of English .

		Thus , to indoctrinate the English-speaking and English-reading person for purposes of culture is surely quite as well as to steep him in the classic lore traditionally regarded as the beginning of philological and other wisdom .

		By this collateral study , as we might call it , a grip on the mother-tongue , an insight into her idioms and thought-modes and modes of expression , to - gether with a comprehension of those qualities she shares with her sister-languages , may be gained , such as shall prove invaluable to the writer .

		At the same time , he acquires the elements of com - parative criticism and is in a position to go on and get all the more from the wider linguistic and aesthetic experience of Greek and Latin .

		This pos - sibility of beginning language and literature study at home , with the native tongue , and working out therefrom by way of the germane tongues , the im - proved methods now obtaining have put within the reach of all .

		And the literary worker in posse has , too , the vantage-ground of some sort of organized treatment of the several departments of English whether philological , critical , or aesthetic .

		The curricula outlined by the teachers in the book suggesting these reflections showed plainly enough such a recognition .

		Doubtless the articulation of the parts will be clearer in time to come : it may well be that , sometime , the scientific historical study of the drama , the essay , fiction , and poetry , in their gen - era and species , will be pursued in some such fash - ion as was adumbrated by a DIAL correspondent months ago and great were the gain thereof .

		But the student can now at least elect courses in the historic development of language and literature , in the dynamics as well as statics of the subject , with a proper culmination in the spiritual philoso - phy underlying more technical and material phases of his work , which should furnish forth a writer well-equipped and in the best sense informed with a true culture .

		The individual literary forms , then , are begin - ning to be studied in what may be called , with no unpleasant implication , the scientific spirit , which is just the way to help the writer to the technique of his craft .

		In fine , the present hopeful status is expressed when we say that the teaching of English to-day , in the enlightened centres , puts the student in the way of mastering the rationale and the tech - nique of his work ; thereby restraining and mould - ing to the best and highest uses the fund of aesthetic appreciation which , if it be in him by birthright , will be fostered , not killed , by this broad , stern , wholesome discipline .

		And this , English instruction can now claim to do for anyone who undertakes the study with the intention of adopting literature as a life-work .

		The writer of this article -LRB- if he may be pardoned a personal reference which illustrates his point -RRB- subjected himself for a term of years to a strict philological training , with the expectation of taking up work which would be a natural sequella to such study .

		And although he has deflected into journalistic and general literary work , he wishes to testify that he would exchange for no other drill , extending over the same time , the familiarity with the organism of language and literature derived from that close and on occasion dry experience with English in its past and present story .

		It is an ex - perience needed to place the worker on easy terms with his tools ; it is an influence which should do much to remove the taint of Bohemianism which from time immemorial has been detected in the works and ways of Buckthorne and his friends .

		RICHARD
BURTON	PERSON	.

		E UGENE FIELD .

		The sudden death of
Eugene Field	PERSON	, on the fourth of this month , removed a conspicuous figure from the small group of literary people who make
Chicago	LOCATION	their home .

		He was probably the most widely known of them all , for his ten years ' unbroken connection with a local newspaper had wrought for his reputation the usual cumulative effect ; he was , besides , a familiar figure on the platform , and , as a reader of his own verses , had become known to many thousands of hear - ers .

		Born in
1850	DATE	, he was in the prime of life at the time of his taking-off , and his later work gave evidence of progress towards a riper culture than he had , for the most part , displayed in his earlier writings .

		His talent deserved a better fate than that of lifelong service to journalism , the taskmaster that impelled him to many a hasty and unconsidered utterance .

		Time will sift the meritorious things in his work from the heap of unsightly scoria in which they are embedded , and is likely to preserve the better among his lyrics .

		His life was lighted by 44 The loveliest lamp for earthly feet , The light of little children , and their love , '' and it is as a poet of childhood that he will be chiefly remembered .

		His published writings consist mainly of two books of prose tales , two books of verse , and a paraphrase of

		THE DIAL 279 PATER 'S LAST VOLUME .

		* This second posthumous collection of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's essays , of '' miscellaneous studies , '' has probably been expectantly waited for by a larger number than greeted any of the books published during his lifetime .

		Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's reputation extended but slowly .

		There must have been many readers of Mr.
Mallock	PERSON	's '' New Republic '' twenty years ago who won - dered somewhat at that singular and disagree - able Mr.
Rose	PERSON	.

		Who was it that could be put in along with
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	and
John Ruskin	PERSON	?

		At that time Mr.
Pater	PERSON	was gen - erally known only by his studies in '' The Renaissance . ''

		To-day it is not so unnatural to think of him as one of the chief critics of art and literature of our day .

		His seven vol - umes are well-known , and he is well or ill thought of by many .

		Different people value him for different things .

		For my part , on reading this last book of his , I think mostly of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's ideal of a way of life , of the group of some half-dozen very distinctive characters which he created , and of his rather singular style .

		A style Mr.
Pater	PERSON	certainly had , although there exists no very valuable characterization of it . ''

		Long-drawn music '' it is called by one , and '' whipt cream '' by another ; but more definite views are somewhat to seek .

		It is an interest - ing style , however , and one which rather chal - lenges a man to define it .

		One thing obvious enough is that in the course of the thirty years in which his work was published , his style underwent a great change .

		Certain enduring qualities his writing always possessed , it was always scholarly , always harmonious , always subtle , and there were also certain constant minor habits , but in his later years his style had undergone so great a change that many ad - mirers of '' The Renaissance '' must have been out of patience with '' Plato and Platonism . ''

		The reader of this posthumous volume will be interested in looking first at '' Diaphaneite , '' the earliest piece of his work that we have , and then at ''
Pascal	PERSON	, '' the last .

		In a greater de - gree he will experience what he may have re - marked in reading the essay on
Coleridge	PERSON	in `` Appreciations , '' the first half of which ap - peared in
1866	DATE	and the second in
1880	DATE	.

		difference wrought by fourteen years is not quite so marked as that wrought by thirty , but still it is not very hard to perceive it .

		In '' Diaphaneite '' he writes ; '' Simplicity in purpose and act is a kind of deter - minate expression in dexterous outline of one 's person - ality .

		It is a kind of moral expressiveness ; there is an intellectual triumph implied in it .

		Such a simplicity is characteristic of the repose of perfect intellectual culture .

		The artist and he who has treated life in the spirit of art desires only to be shown to the world as he really is ; as he comes nearer and nearer to perfec - tion , the veil of an outer life not simply expressive of an inward becomes thinner and thinner .

		This intel - lectual throne is rarely won .

		Like the religious life , it is a paradox in the world , denying the first conditions of man 's ordinary existence , cutting obliquely the spon - taneous order of things . ''

		-LRB- P. 217 . -RRB-

		In '' Pascal '' : '' There are moments of one 's own life , aspects of the life of others , of which the conclusion that the will is free seems to be the only is the natural or reason - able account .

		Yet those very moments on reflexion , on second thoughts , present themselves again , as but links in a chain , in an all-embracing network of chains .

		In all education we assume , in some inexplicable com - bination , at once the freedom and the necessity of the subject of it .

		And who on a survey of life from out - side would willingly lose the dramatic contrasts , the alternating interests , for which the opposed ideas of freedom and necessity are our respective points of view ?

		How significant become the details we might other - wise pass by almost unobserved , but to which we are put on the alert by the abstract query whether a man be indeed a freeman or a slave , as we watch from aside his devious course , his struggles , his final tragedy or triumph .

		So much value at least there may be in prob - lems insoluble in themselves , such as that great con - troversy of
Pascal	PERSON	's day between Jesuit and Jansenist . ''

		-LRB- Pp. 55 , 56 . -RRB-

		The difference between these two extracts may in varying degree be perceived between all Pater 's earlier work and the greater part at least of his later .

		It is an interesting differ - ence .

		It is not merely that in his early work the sentences are shorter , although this is doubt - less on the whole the case .

		Nor is it that the sentences are less complicated , or that there is more predication , although this also I suppose to be the case .

		The difference is probably as much in the thinking as in the writing .

		In the early passage we have a number of direct statements , carefully modified and limited it is true , but quite clear-cut and authoritative .

		Half a dozen generalizations are presented to the reader ; each of independent interest , although of course they are closely connected .

		But the later passage offers nothing of the sort .

		We have approximations to the right idea , second thoughts , assumptions , queries rather than ques - tions , personal experience , remarks , the whole 280 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, aiming to leave us in a state , not of certainty , but of prepossession .

		This is persuasion ; com - pared with this the early manner seems trench - ant .

		Certainly that little Oxford essay seems crude to those who have learned to like Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's later writing .

		Its serried phalanx of sen - tences , each one stiff and rigid , sharp and pol - ished , like a spear stuck up in the air , strikes us a little harshly .

		And yet , although it may be crude , it is not so very different from a much finer and more familiar piece of work which came not so long afterward , the Conclusion * to '' The Renaissance . ''

		The style there is very definite and direct , one reason why people remember it better than Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's later ut - terances . ''

		Not the fruit of experience , but experience itself , is the end . '' ''

		To burn always with this hard gem-like flame , to maintain this ecstasy , is success in life . '' ''

		Not to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in those about us ... is , in this short day of frost and sun , to sleep before evening . ''

		Compare such convictions with the '' Essay on Style , '' fifteen years later : `` In
Pascal	PERSON	, for instance , in the persuasive writers generally , how difficult to define the point where , from time to time , argument which , if it is to be worth any - thing at all , must consist of facts or groups of facts , be - comes a pleading a theorem no longer , but essentially an appeal to the reader to catch the writer 's spirit , to think with him , if one can or will an expression no longer of fact but of his sense of it , his peculiar in - tuition of a world prospective , or discerned below the faulty conditions of the present , in either case changed somewhat from the actual world . ''

		Such a change in the mode of expression might very possibly indicate nothing more than a change of intention , a desire to get closer to the real current of our thought , to approxi - mate more nearly to the actual forms of our speech .

		Such doubtless it was , there are many evidences of the endeavor , too many to cite here , but comparing it with some other considerations , it seems as though this change in the mode of expression must have been the outward indication of a change in the way of thinking .

		A change in a man 's way of think - ing , of looking at things , is nothing extraordi - nary ; it is , on the other hand , almost a neces - sity , especially in the case in question .

		Mr.
Pater	PERSON	never acquiesced , to put it as he put it himself , in a facile orthodoxy of his own .

		A * Mr
Louis Dyer	PERSON	in '' The Nation '' for
August 23 , 1894	DATE	-LRB- p. 138 -RRB- , says it was written in
1868	DATE	.

		Mr.
Shadwell	PERSON	, in the biblio - graphy prefixed to '' Miscellaneous Studies , '' makes no men - tion of the fact , if it be such .

		But there are one or two minor errors in that bibliography , and it may be that the '' Conclusion '' was written some years before publishing .

		writer in '' The Quarterly Review '' for last
July	DATE	spends some time in commenting on Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's '' recantation , '' as he calls it ; and cer - tainly the tone of ''
Marius	PERSON	'' is not the tone of the conclusion to '' The Renaissance . ''

		It is hardly right to speak here of recantation ; some years after writing '' Marius '' Mr.
Pater	PERSON	re - stored the omitted conclusion to its former place .

		But although he desired to stand to his old views , there need be no doubt that the '' Conclusion '' did not fully express his then position ; one sees readily enough , on reading it along with the chapters in ''
Marius	PERSON	'' which express the same matter -LRB- chapters viii. , ix . -RRB-

		, that there has been a change .

		The same sources , the same ideas , the same conclusions ; and yet the temper is wholly different .

		Whatever ideal of a way of life is put forward in that '' Con - clusion '' had evidently , by the time of '' Ma - rius , '' been , not rejected probably , but left be - hind .

		Mr.
Pater	PERSON	, never holding that any con - viction was ultimate , had got beyond his earlier view .

		He had doubtless developed somewhat in ten years ; strange if he had not .

		As to where he found himself , there is a little evidence , though not of the most definite char - acter .

		The development of the thinking and feeling of
Marius	PERSON	is something of an indication .

		But if we pass by for the moment the possibil - ity of deductions from this particular piece of fiction , and look about us for other evidence of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's ideas at this time , we come at once to the '' Imaginary Portraits . ''

		Of these , four were published not long after ''
Marius	PERSON	'' ; the present volume gives us three more .

		One of these last was written in
1878	DATE	, the two others much later .

		Of all seven , none bear the stamp of autobiographic feeling more than do '' The Child in the
House	ORGANIZATION	'' and ``
Sebastian van Storck	PERSON	, '' of which the latter is more to our present purpose .

		In ''
Sebastian van Storck	PERSON	'' we have a young man who , by hard thinking , had carefully elaborated a way of life for him - self , and was come finally to an attempt to put it in practice .

		We need not suppose that the particular line of thought in question had ever been Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's own -LRB- although there is a far - away echo in '' Emerald Uthwart '' -RRB- , but we may perhaps believe that there was something reminiscent in the general situation .

		To think out carefully a way of life , and to try to walk in it , this is the story of
Sebastian	PERSON	, and of
Marius	PERSON	, and possibly enough of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	him - self .

		But then , in the case of Sebastian we have the sudden sweeping on of a logic beyond the timid assurances of reason , and the man is
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 281 hurried out of his carefully arranged life into an act of self-sacrifice which brings about his death .

		It was something that he had not fore - seen , had not deduced from his premises ; and yet it was harmonious , almost syllogistic , right .

		So also was it with
Marius	PERSON	.

		Prepared as he was for Christianity , by many thoughts and infinite feeling , it needed the pressure of ex - ternal events to carry him out of his own circle of reasoning into the self-sacrifice which left him dead with those who had long been his brothers in the spirit and his sisters .

		It would be hardly right to attempt to go further , but all reading of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's later work tends to make one believe that he was himself advanc - ing from the ground on which he had once felt secure , advancing cautiously , slowly , always testing his foothold , and yet always with a presentment that there might at any time , and that suddenly , come to pass something that should knock from his hand the staff with which he groped and snatch him swiftly into the splendor of convincing and glorious light .

		The particular point which he had reached is as well indicated as we need expect in some of his later writings let us say , in the first and last chapters of `` Plato and Platonism . ''

		In this last volume there are slight hints in the essay on
Pascal	LOCATION	.

		Such as it may have been this conception of a way of life , of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's later thought we are always feeling ourselves near it when we turn to the group of distinguished and im - aginative characters which form so attractive a part of his later work .

		These young men ,
Marius	PERSON	,
Hippolytus	LOCATION	,
Duke Carl	PERSON	,
Emerald Uth	ORGANIZATION	- wart , and the others , have not a few points in common which readers of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	will easily think of ; but perhaps especially this , that each one was something of a stranger to the world he lived in , separated from it invisibly , though effectively , by the veil-like cloud of his own eager or intense feeling and thinking .

		Each one was influenced by surroundings , but the vital principle was always within .

		Of some of the '' Imaginary Portraits '' can this be said less properly than of others , quite properly , however , of
Emerald Uthwart	ORGANIZATION	, whose story now appears for the first time in book form .

		It has almost as much charm of circumstance as Denys 1 ` Auxerrois .

		The curiously unreal story is told with such a certainty of human touch that one lingers in the exquisite surroundings , to the neg - lect at first of the character itself .

		And yet just now it is of the boy Emerald himself that one would think the ideal of the pure , beautiful youth which Mr.
Pater	PERSON	loved , which he has by other ways than by direct portrait presented to us ; and the early life , the school life , of
Emer	PERSON	- ald is quite representative of the moods , the temper , that we have in mind .

		Deprived some - how of the natural , the hereditary freedom that seemed his right , he honestly , even submis - sively , gave himself up to the influences and requirements of his school-days ; the result be - ing , as with
Marius	PERSON	or Hippolytus , a life of happy , loyal , and unconscious preparation for an unknown end , which when it came was un - expected , at first incomprehensible , and always wholly noble .

		A sort of cultivation ascesis , as he so often called it submissive , self-re - strained , open to all good impressions , such , so far as we can judge from the matter as well as the manner of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's more recent work , was the result into which the Epicureanism of the '' Conclusion '' might very possibly have de - veloped .

		By no means self-indulgence , not even self-cultivation merely : it was rather a kind of expectant self-development , a recognition of duty , of responsibility , a feeling of the need of preparation ; of preparation for what we are nowhere informed , and it would be almost a mean curiosity for us to inquire .

		If Mr.
Pater	PERSON	had written an autobiography , we might doubt - less know .

		As he has reserved his opinions on the matter , we may well enough be content with the assurance of our own .

		In reading a book like this , published after the death of an author one values , one is tempted to think more of the man himself than of these particular pieces of his work .

		And so I have been led to neglect the two reminis - cences of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's earlier work the papers on
Raphael	PERSON	and Art in
Northern Italy	LOCATION	; as well as the beginning of a new vein the studies of the
Cathedral of Amiens	ORGANIZATION	and the monastic church of
Vezelay	LOCATION	.

		There is also the lecture on Merimee , besides the others I have noted , all making up a collection , miscellaneous cer - tainly , as in the painfully prosaic name -LRB- which we may hope is due to Mr.
Shadwell	PERSON	-RRB- , but as certainly representative .

		It is hardly to be thought that the book will much enhance the reputation of its author , but it will make evi - dent once again that nothing of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	's fell much under his best .

		It needs no com - ment nor praise ; it is ripe and beautiful work , and with '' Greek Studies '' offers a fitting ex - ample of the range and quality of one who has for some time been recognized as among the most distinguished and characteristic men of letters of our day .

		282 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, A NEW HISTORY or EDUCATION .

		* No man who uses the English language as a medium of thought has done more to give education a definite status as a science and an art , and particularly as a university study , than Professor
Laurie	PERSON	of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	.

		To justify this opinion , it is sufficient on his side to mention his '' Institutes of Education , '' '' Occasional Addresses on Educational Subjects , '' '' Life of Comenius , '' `` Training of the Teacher , '' '' Eise and Early Constitution of Universities , '' '' Pri - mary Instruction , '' '' Teacher 's Guild Ad - dresses , '' `` Language and Linguistic Method , '' and the present '' Historical Survey of Pre -
Christian Education	ORGANIZATION	, '' which is much the most valuable , as it is much the largest and most pretentious , work of all .

		We do not , in fact , recall a single writer of this class who can point to a series of equally valuable pedagogical writ - ings .

		His inaugural address on the '' Training of Teachers '' still remains the best vindication of the
Chair of Education	ORGANIZATION	.

		Before the philosophical student of educa - tion has finished the Introduction -LRB- pp. 8 -RRB- of '' Pre-Christian Education , '' he discovers that its author has seized the right point of view .

		Education is not a fact to be studied by itself .

		It does not stand apart , separate , unrelated , and alone .

		It is an outgrowth of ideas , phil - osophies , religions , and institutions .

		It is re - lated to race and national character , and to the spirit of the time .

		It is an integral part of the surrounding civilization .

		The education that is furnished in the schools of any country at any time may profoundly affect the culture , the sentiments , the institutions , the learning , the mental and moral character , of ensuing gen - erations ; but is itself shaped and inspired by the existing factors that fall into these several categories .

		Hence , such education may be con - ceived under two aspects : As a result or pro- duct of the past or existing culture , and as a factor or cause of the coming culture .

		Human history is continuous , human society homogen - eous ; and no characteristic social fact relig - ion , government , or education can be under - stood if torn away from its connections .

		It must be studied in situ .

		Such fact is part and parcel of the whole life of the people .

		Edu - cational facts and ideas , therefore , must be taken along with philosophical , social , religious , * HISTORICAL SURVEY OF PRE-CHRISTIAN EDUCATION .

		By
S. S. Laurie	PERSON	,
A.M.	LOCATION	, LL.D. , Professor of the
Institutes and History of Education	ORGANIZATION	in the
University of Edinburgh	ORGANIZATION	, etc. .


New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		industrial , scientific , and political facts and ideas .

		They all sustain to one another the re - lation of mutual cause and effect .

		Hence no intelligent student of the history of education will take up the education of any age or coun - try as a separate or distinct subject .

		He will search out its antecedents will inquire into what soil of culture it strikes its roots .

		And this last is what Professor
Laurie	PERSON	does .

		He begins with telling us that '' the history of education is involved in the general history of the world .

		No adequate survey of it is possi - ble which does not presume a considerable ac - quaintance with the history of the leading races which have occupied and subdued the earth , and formed themselves into civilized societies . ''

		This is raising the history of education at once to the rank and dignity of philosophy ; it is spreading it over a large part of the territory to which the phrase '' History of Civilization '' is ordinarily applied .

		But , lest his theme es - cape him , owing to its very vastness , he limits its field , as follows : '' For by education , even in the narrow sense in which the word must be employed here , I understand the means which a nation , with more or less consciousness , takes for bringing up its citizens to maintain the tradi - tion of national character , and for promoting the wel - fare of the whole as an organized ethical community .

		It is essential , therefore , that we should understand the objects which the nation , as such , desired to secure ; in brief , its own more or less conscious ideal of national and civic life , of personal character , and political jus - tice .

		If we can ascertain this by the study of its highest products in men , deeds , and arts , we have made a great step towards interpreting the course of training through which it would naturally endeavor to subject its youth by means of its laws and institutions . ''

		Starting from this base - line , Professor
Laurie	PERSON	divides his subject into four grand divisions : The Hamitic race , confined wholly to
Egypt	LOCATION	-LRB- pp. 37 -RRB- ; the Semitic races , Arabs ,
Babylonians	LOCATION	, Assyrians , Phoenicians , and He - brews -LRB- pp. 50 -RRB- ; the Uro - Altaic or Turanian races , limited to
China	LOCATION	-LRB- pp. 52 -RRB- ; the Aryan or Indo-European races , embracing
India	LOCATION	and the Hindus , the Medo-Persians , the Hellenic peoples , and the Romans -LRB- pp. 271 -RRB- .

		Again in the last division 230 pages are assigned to the Greeks and Romans alone ; and when we re - flect oh the fuller educational development of these people , the far richer literary memorials they left behind them , and the transcendent influence they have exerted upon subsequent history , we can not say this assignment is dis - proportionate .

		So far from slighting the peo - ples of
Egypt	LOCATION	and
Asia	LOCATION	, Professor
Laurie	PERSON	has rather sought to do them fullest justice ; and ,
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 283 in a sense , the most interesting and valuable parts of his books are the parts in which he has described their education .

		The educations of
Greece	LOCATION	and of
Rome	LOCATION	have been the not un - frequent themes of able writers ;
Israel	LOCATION	and
China	LOCATION	also have received considerable atten - tion ; but the educations of
Egypt	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, the Arabs ,
Babylonians	LOCATION	, Assyrians , and
Phreni	PERSON	- cians have been obscure topics , and informa - tion could only be picked up , at least by En - glish readers , here and there .

		Professor
Laurie	PERSON	has made diligent search for material in pre - paring these sections of his work , and if he has found little , the reason is that there is little to find .

		Such as exists he has brought together and presented in a clear and interesting man - ner , not failing to connect the outward facts with some of the inner ideas from which they have sprung .

		The accounts of the Hebrew and Chinese educations also are well done .

		We could , indeed , criticise the handling of all the Oriental educations in one important feature .

		The writer has not sought , as he might have done , for the grand underlying Oriental ideas , as repose , conservatism , love of decoration , ceremony , and propension to '' wisdom , '' which have given to these educations a certain unmis - takable cast , making them non-scientific , but lit - erary , religious , and rich in prudential teaching .

		For the field that it covers , the work is far more satisfactory in treatment than any other with which we are acquainted ; and we are glad to recommend it strongly , not merely to teachers and students of education , but to scholars and cultivated men generally .

		We have noticed no indication of a purpose on the part of the author to carry his work farther .

		The contact of Christianity and the Grseco-Roman education , involving the obscurantist tendencies of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, the appearance of the first Christian schools , and the final establishment of an equi - librium between the new religion and mental cultivation , is a great theme that still awaits a competent writer to handle it .

		Before he sends out a second edition of the present work , Dr.
Laurie	PERSON	will no doubt reconstruct this sentence : '' In the Egyptians this race of mankind -LSB- the Hamitic -RSB- found the highest expression of its capacity for civilized life , as did the Hebrews among the Semites , the Chinese among the Uro - Altaic -LRB- Turanian -RRB- , and the Greeks among the Aryans .

		THE STORY OF SIR SAMUEL ,
BAKER	PERSON	.

		* The conditions which developed in Sir
Sam	PERSON	- uel
Baker	PERSON	the restless energy of the explorer are readily recognized .

		The old Saxon wander - love had made many generations of the Bakers sea-rovers like
Hawkins	PERSON	and
Frobisher	PERSON	, owning and fighting their ships : his father had , as a privateersman , won a gallant victory against the French in his own sloop , the '' Ca3sar . ''

		He came to his majority with a fair education , a liberal inheritance which relieved him from any claims of business , and an engrossing spirit of adventure .

		After an early and a happy marriage , he went first to the
Mauritius	LOCATION	to look after some pater - nal estates , and , following a brief sojourn there , to
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	for the sport of shooting the big game then abundant on that island .

		Here he became so fascinated with the beauty of the scenery , and .

		so impressed with the alluring opportunities offered to the settler , that he founded a sort of feudal colony , at a place called
Newera Eliya	ORGANIZATION	, rather more than a hundred miles from
Colombo	LOCATION	.

		The enterprise was suc - cessful , but after a term of years inroads upon his health compelled
Baker	PERSON	to return to En - gland .

		An account of this enterprise , under the title '' Eight Years ' Wanderings in
Ceylon	ORGANIZATION	, '' was published in
1855	DATE	.

		In
1861	DATE	Baker was inspired with the pur - pose of exploring the sources of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		The geography of
Equatorial Africa	LOCATION	had already been attacked from several quarters .

		The prob - lem of the
Niger	LOCATION	had been solved .

		The tradi - tions concerning a vast interior lake had been more than verified , as two great lakes had been determined .

		Speke and
Grant	PERSON	were already prosecuting the journey which would demon - strate the
Victoria Nyanza	LOCATION	to be the reservoir of the
White Nile	LOCATION	; while
Livingstone	PERSON	was at work upon the territory farther south and east .

		The
Blue Nile	ORGANIZATION	was known ; that the
White Nile	ORGANIZATION	was the outlet of the
Victoria Nyanza	PERSON	was an accepted theory rather than a demonstrated fact , the objective of expeditions already afield .

		The sources of the western tributaries of the great river had not yet been determined , and to these points
Baker	PERSON	addressed himself .

		His first essay was an exploration of terri - tory already fairly known , where he carefully mapped the Nile tributaries of
Abyssinia	LOCATION	, and served his apprenticeship for severer labors .

		In the
last month of 1862	DATE	he left Khartum for * SIR

Nov. 16	DATE	, an exploration of the upper
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		After two months he met Speke and
Grant	PERSON	, who were tracing northward the outlet of the
Nyanza	LOCATION	, and so much of the determination was com - pleted .

		Pushing his own expedition still far - ther to the southward , he broke into new terri - tory which he traversed under great difficulties , until after the toil of a year he was rewarded by the discovery of the
Albert Nyanza	PERSON	, then believed to be second of the great Nile reser - voirs .

		The subsequent discovery by
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	of the
Albert Edward Nyanza	PERSON	, a smaller body of water at a greater elevation , whose waters flow through the
Albert	PERSON	lake , has recognized in the more elevated lake the second source of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		With the finding of the
Albert Ny	PERSON	- anza ,
Baker	PERSON	's labors as a discoverer were sub - stantially closed .

		The second great enterprise undertaken by Sir
Samuel Baker	PERSON	was at the instance of
Ismail Pasha	PERSON	, the Khedive of
Egypt	LOCATION	, and with the au - thority of the Egyptian government ; it was the herculean task of suppressing the slave-trade within the jurisdiction of
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		The year
1869	DATE	saw the inauguration of the
Suez Canal	ORGANIZATION	, and the high tide of apparent Egyptian prosperity .

		The eyes of the world were upon the rejuvenated kingdom of the Pharaohs .

		The Khedive , dazzled by the achieve - ment , aspired to be an independent ruler , to obtain command of all the territory tributary to the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	, and to acquire a place in the charmed circle of European rulers .

		He leaned upon the strong arm of
England	LOCATION	; and to secure the sym - pathy of that mighty power , he proposed to destroy the trade in slaves in all his realm .

		As a step toward the accomplishment of these pur - poses , in
May , 1869	DATE	, he issued a firman in which he proposed to subdue the countries about the great Equatorial lakes , to suppress the slave - trade , and to introduce a system of commerce and the navigation of the lakes .

		The enter - prise was entrusted to Sir
Samuel Baker	PERSON	for four years ; he was made a
Pasha	LOCATION	, given the rank of Major-General , and was clothed with supreme and absolute power , including that of death , over all connected with his expedition .

		Like every other scheme for real progress , proposed by Egyptian or Turk , the only val - idity of these propositions lay in their paper announcements .

		Men and materials were want - ing either in quantity or quality suited to the enterprise .

		The real question was how not to do it .

		The slave-trade was to be suppressed , but the slave-trader , and his powerful and sub - sidized friends at court , were not to be hurt .

		The land was a land of paradox , and the labor was the task of Sisyphus .

		With such means as he could get ,
Baker	PERSON	moved to the scene of operations .

		He occupied
Gondokoro	PERSON	, the farthest important point toward the south , and made it his capital and base of operations , with the new name
Ismailia	LOCATION	.

		He made friends with some of the chiefs in the country beyond ; others he coerced into a pre - tense of friendship .

		Then he fought his way southward , and after a continuous and harrass - ing campaign he placed under subjection the whole territory assigned as the theatre of his operations .

		By then the period named in his commission had expired , and he returned to
Cairo	LOCATION	, where he transferred his command to one whom he himself had named as his suc - cessor , that remarkable figure in modern En - glish history ,
Colonel Gordon	PERSON	, of Chinese and afterward of Egyptian fame .

		In the
four years of Baker	DATE	's administration of the Equatorial provinces he had accom - plished scarcely more than to lay the founda - tions of Egyptian authority , with the subjec - tion of the native tribes .

		Commerce , except the united movement of ivory and slaves , could follow only a more advanced civilization .

		The slave-trade was a disease of the social system , as fixed and as fatal as the leprosy which has once fastened its fangs upon the human frame .

		None of these objects assigned to his enterprise could be established in the brief period of four years , even under favorable auspices .

		Could his strong hand and vigorous intellect have ruled during a period of longer duration , the result would have been more nearly commen - surate with the effort .

		Baker 's commission expired in
1873	DATE	; Gor - don 's followed in
1874	DATE	, and lasted until
1879	DATE	.

		During that period , great changes occurred in
Egypt	LOCATION	.

		The golden era of Ismail passed , and
Tewfik	PERSON	followed his deposed father .

		War pitted the Russian against the Turk .

		England came to the succor of the '' sick man , '' taking Cyprus for a doctor 's fee , and postponing all dreams of Egyptian independence .

		To secure the debts incurred by
Ismail	ORGANIZATION	's extravagance ,
Egypt	LOCATION	passed under the dual control of the English and French ; Arabi revolted ; the bombard - ment of
Alexandria	LOCATION	was followed by the cam - paign in the desert , and the victory at Tel-el -
Kebir	PERSON	.

		The fanaticism of the Moslem and the Bedouin was aroused , and an insurrection under the leadership of a self-styled prophet , the
Mahdi	PERSON	, spread like a pestilence until it had involved the whole of Soudan and of the

Egypt	LOCATION	and abandoned by Eng - land , in
1885	DATE	he sealed with his life a devo - tion which was ill compensated by the bronze effigy quickly placed in
St. Paul	LOCATION	's to typify a nation 's contrition .

		During these stirring times , Sir
Samuel Baker	PERSON	was rather a looker-on than an active participant .

		His comments upon the affairs of
Egypt	LOCATION	and the
East	LOCATION	, based upon the full familiarity of long experience , were more fre - quently words of criticism than of approval .

		He passed away in
January of 1894	DATE	.

		THE CONCLUSION OF
BAIRD	PERSON	'S HISTORY OF THE HUGUENOTS .

		* In his two volumes on '' The Huguenots and the Revocation of the Edict of
Nantes	LOCATION	, '' Pro- fessor
Baird	PERSON	has drawn up a severe indictment of
France	LOCATION	for her dealings with the
Hugue	ORGANIZATION	- nots during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries .

		There is no sin of the Gallican church or of the Bourbon monarchy which is not adequately stated and the degree of its enormity marked by an appropriate adjective .

		The conclusion is inevitable that the French clergy were largely engaged in the despicable business of hounding Louis XIV .

		on to the destruction of thousands of his most loyal and industrious subjects , and that by yielding to their solicitations he proved himself to be an igno - ble , if not a stupid , tyrant .

		This has long been the Protestant , and , with certain modifications , the general view of the matter .

		Professor
Baird	PERSON	has , however , elaborated it in greater detail and with more ample scholarship .

		The story which he tells is at times sombre , and even a little dreary , as all recitals of hapless struggle against injustice , oppression , and hypocrisy must be .

		It is not until the period of the Camisard War and the Church of the Desert * THE HUGUENOTS AND THE REVOCATION OF THE EDICT OF

		is reached that one is reminded of his books on the brighter fortunes of the Huguenot move - ment in the sixteenth century .

		Professor
Baird	PERSON	would have made these ca - lamitous chapters of French history more intel - ligible had he looked at them in a more philo - sophic spirit and less as the special advocate of the Huguenot party .

		Even the bigotry which in our eyes cursed the later administration of the Great King was not as mean as an unsym - pathetic chronicle would make it appear .

		Its principal consequence was the persecution of the Huguenots , and this was neither wholly
Louis	PERSON	's work nor the work of his clergy .

		Sainte -
Beuve	PERSON	told at least a part of the truth when , long ago , he declared that the King was insen - sibly urged on to this terrible blunder by a complicity almost universal .

		It is idle to deny this when we know that an overwhelming ma - jority of the French people believed that the
Cal	LOCATION	- vinistic heresy not merely imperilled the eter - nal salvation of those who cherished it , but also endangered by its contagion every community in
France	LOCATION	.

		Had the religious leaders of
France	LOCATION	acquiesced in the schism legalized by the Edict of
Nantes	LOCATION	, their conduct would have seemed to us incredible , or at least very puzzling .

		The seventeenth century produced few such un - timely prophets of forbearance .

		In the Pala - tinate , a near neighbor of
France	LOCATION	, twice within sixty years the inhabitants had been forced to embrace the doctrines of Luther , and twice to give them up for those of
Calvin	LOCATION	, in obedience to that holy principle of the Religious Peace of
Augsburg	LOCATION	, cujus regio , ejus religio .

		England was driving the '' Papists '' to despair and Gun - powder plots by her Recusancy laws , the most genial of which provided that Catholics who re - fused to go to church should pay a fine of X20 a month .

		Necessitous Protestant gentlemen of a sensitive piety found some temporal advan - tage in this particular statute , as , for exam - ple , Lord Hay , who received fi-om the govern - ment a grant of all he could get over 240 from one of the Recusants .

		In comparison with her neighbors ,
France	LOCATION	was until past the middle of the century a land of '' sweetness and light . ''

		What the
King	PERSON	and his ecclesiastical councillors did after
1656	DATE	is not surprising , although it may fill the modern man with an - ger and disgust .

		But if he be a historian he sacrifices the true interests of his readers when he leaves the bench and assumes the role of prosecuting attorney to plead against one cul - prit after another , not forgetting men like Bos - suet and
Fenelon	ORGANIZATION	.

		286 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, The Edict of
Nantes	LOCATION	had been a glorious achievement in spite of the fact that it did not embody a policy of toleration of the modern sort , but was rather the recognition of privi - leges , half religious and half political , won in battle .

		It was not a stable peace , and conse - quently , although it was ostensibly '' irrevoca - ble '' and needed no confirming ,
Louis	LOCATION	XIII .

		and
Louis	PERSON	XIV .

		repeatedly confirmed it .

		One of these confirmations , which occurred in
1629	DATE	and has been called the Edict of
Grace	ORGANIZATION	, came nearer to a true toleration than did the Edict of
Nantes	LOCATION	itself , for it was granted after the political defeat of the Huguenots and the fall of La Rochelle , the last of their great strongholds when , therefore , no serious threat of insur - rection held the government to its pledges .

		From this time to
1656	DATE	, and perhaps a few years later , the Huguenots throve , protected by the wise statesmanship of Richelieu and
Mazarin	PERSON	.

		Their constant troubles before
1629	DATE	were quite as much due to the abnormal posi - tion like a state within a state which the original Edict had given them , as to any hos - tile intentions on the part of the Regent or Louis XIII .

		The possession of one hundred and fifty fortified places was , indeed , less a guarantee of the good faith of the government than an evidence of its weakness , the result of the disastrous civil wars , when feudalism sought to rebuild its fortresses and when the mediaeval spirit of local independence threat - ened the disintegration of
France	LOCATION	.

		But the royal power was to triumph , and with its triumph the exceptional position of the Hugue - nots shared the fate of the new feudalism .

		If we forget the political aspect of the affair , it is hard to understand why the Huguenot lead - ers enlisted Catholic soldiers , who were cer - tainly strange partners in the defense of lib - erty of conscience for heretics ; or why that '' unfortunate convocation , '' to use Professor
Baird	PERSON	's phrase , the
Assembly of La Rochelle	ORGANIZATION	in
1621	DATE	, carried its factiousness so far as to give its adherents an organization which might easily have passed for that of a new Protest - ant state modelled after the Dutch Republic .

		Up to
1629	DATE	the situation is so complex , there - fore , that the issue is not clearly between op - pressor and oppressed , and the story must be read with divided sympathies .

		It was a great misfortune that the Edict of Nantes proved to be only a little more irrevo - cable than the '' perpetual and irrevocable '' edict of Queen
Jeanne d'Albret	PERSON	in
1563	DATE	, granting toleration in
Beam	LOCATION	to Catholics , which `` perpetual '' edict lasted eight years .

		For
two decades before 1685	DATE	, when the Revo - cation came , the spirit of the great edict had been disobeyed , its letter misinterpreted , and its object thwarted by the wholesale destruc - tion of churches , by the '' conversion fund , '' the suppression of Huguenot representation on the bench , and by the infamous Dragonnades .

		Indeed ,
Louis	PERSON	XIV .

		seems to have thought that the formal Revocation was simply the fit - ting conclusion to a noble work of Christian reunion , already practically complete .

		Professor
Baird	PERSON	has one or two interesting passages describing the exemplary morals of the murderous Camisards . ''

		No quarrels , en - mity , calumny , or thieving was heard among us , '' says one of their leaders ,
Cavalier	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` All swearing , cursing , and obscene words were quite banished out of our society .

		Happy time !

		had it lasted forever . ''

		But it is not strange , perhaps , considering the horrible cruelties that were practiced upon them , that their experi - ence made the naive combination of these minor virtues with the most pitiless butcheries .

		It would have been not out of place had Professor
Baird	PERSON	given us a fuller description of the fortunes of the Church of the Desert and its pastors during the storms of the Revo - lution .

		In what he writes , however , about the Triumph of Atheism , he falls into the error of saying that the Convention ordered the sup - pression of all religious worship .

		The day be - fore
Gobel	PERSON	's abdication , the Convention had , it is true , voted that communes could suppress their parishes if they desired , subject to the approval of the departments in which they were situated .

		Nine days later it added the pro- vision that the suppressed churches or their income be used for hospitals or for public in - struction .

		It never went so far as to sepa - rate church from state , or to render worship illegal .

		Even if Professor
Baird	PERSON	's attitude toward the French clergy in urging the Revocation be open to just criticism , the careful scholarship and ripe learning , of which all his pages give evidence , make these volumes a fitting conclu - sion to the great work on Huguenot history to which he has devoted the thirty best years of his life -

		THE DIAL 287 THE CHAUTAUQUA BOOKS .

		* The reading required of Chautauquans for the coming year consists of five books , two of them , at least , being departures from the con - ventional lines upon which the preceding series of manuals have been planned .

		Experimental psychology and anthropology are , to say the least , novel elements in a scheme of popular instruction , but the growing importance of both sciences seems to justify their inclusion .

		The remaining books are devoted to American po - litical and industrial history , and to American letters .

		As all these books are sure of a wide circulation and a considerable degree of influ - ence , they call for a somewhat closer scrutiny than their intrinsic importance might warrant .

		Professor
E. W. Scripture	PERSON	's work on '' Think - ing , Feeling , Doing '' for thus he entitles his popular treatise on the psychology of the lab - oratory is an interesting and unusually read - able volume , and the author does not , perhaps , claim too much for it when he calls it '' the first book on the new , or experimental , psy - chology written in the English language . ''

		To the reader who knows something of psychology , but who has failed to keep up with the modern developments of the science in its narrow lab - oratory aspect , the book can not fail to prove helpful and instructive .

		To the beginner , on the other hand , who is without the psycholog - ical standards necessary for comparison and evaluation , it is sure to prove misleading and mischievous in effect .

		Its main contention is the foolish one that psychology is essentially a science of quantitative experiment , and that its modern laboratory wing is the only part of the structure deserving of serious considera - tion .

		In many insidious ways is this impres - sion made and deepened , while the writer misses no opportunity to allude in terms of dis - paragement to the psychology of introspection .

		To anyone who knows what the science of psy - chology is , and how little of real value has thus far been contributed to its development by lab - oratory methods , who knows how tentative and imperfectly formulated those methods are , the attitude of the present writer will be merely amusing ; but most of his readers , unfortu - nately , will be found among a class of people little disposed to be critical , and unable to see * THINKING , FEELING , DOING .

		how shallow are the pretensions he sets forth .

		A typical illustration of Professor Scripture 's attitude is provided by the following note : '' There are so-called ' qualitative sciences ' that have no methods of measurement or statistics .

		These are the demireps of the scientific world with whom we must put up because we have n't more respectable members of society to take their places . ''

		It is easy to dispose of ethical , economical , political , and social science to say nothing of the greater part of psychology in this airy way , but it is also cheap , and not exactly creditable to a thinker who wants to be taken seriously .

		Professor Scripture 's book is , for the most part , a description of experiments , some of which are well-fitted for the kindergarten , while others call for such adjuncts as sesthesiometers , olf acto - meters , and sphygmographs .

		It is sprightly in style , and abundantly supplied with illustrative cuts .

		An example of the experiments may be given . ''

		With the thumb-and-finger-grip the greatest pressure I can exert during silence is eight pounds .

		When someone plays the giants ' motive from the Rheingold my grip shows eight and three-fourths pounds .

		The slumber motive from the Walkiire reduces the power to seven and one-half pounds . ''

		This description is illus - trated by cuts of the two motives in musical notation .

		What we would say of this experi - ment , and of all experiments of its general class , is simply that the quantitative fact which to the author is the fact of most import - ance is in reality of trifling value , and that the only fact of real significance is the qualita - tive one of increased or decreased stimulation with the change in tempo and tone-color .

		We do not wish to minify the value of exact meas - urements in any department of investigation , but we do claim that in a case like this the general statement made long before psycho - logical laboratories were invented is of far greater importance to the science of psychology .

		Professor Scripture , on the other hand , seems to regard the determination of his own thumb - and-finger-grip , or , at any rate , of an average from a number of cases , as more important than the general law of stimulation , qualita - tively stated .

		In his closing chapter , on '' The New Psy - chology , '' the author takes a final whack at the '' vague observation , endless speculation , and flimsy guesswork '' of such duffers as
Locke	PERSON	and
Hamilton	PERSON	.

		He tells us how the new order of things was started in
Germany	LOCATION	by
Herbart	LOCATION	, continued by
Fechner	PERSON	,
Weber	PERSON	, and
Helmholtz	PERSON	, 288 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, and made triumphant by
Herr Wundt	PERSON	, '' the greatest of psychologists . ''

		He tells us how psychology has at last been rescued from '' the lingering clutch of philosophy , '' which has '' contributed nothing but stumbling-blocks '' in aid of the new emancipated science .

		All of this is so entertaining that we owe its author a final word of thanks .

		In a more serious sense , we may be thankful to him for the pronounce - ment that '' hypnotic exhibitions , '' '' thought - transference follies , '' and '' the so-called psy - chical research experiments '' are '' as unrelated to scientific experiments , as clairvoyant healing or faith-cure to the science of medicine . ''

		His suggestions for an improved musical notation are also of value , and deserve to be taken into practical consideration .

		A curious error -LRB- page 72 -RRB- gives a certain angle as 325 instead of 315 , and is repeated no less than five times .

		A quotation of several pages from
Herr Wundt	PERSON	is , we believe , taken from a recent English translation , but no credit is given , which is a transaction not entirely creditable to the bor - rower .

		The anthropological volume in this Chau - tauqua series is by Professor
Frederick Starr	PERSON	, and is modestly entitled '' Some
First Steps in Human Progress	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Strictly speaking , it is a resume of culture-history rather than of the larger science of anthropology , and , considered in relation to its restricted scope , is an admir - able piece of work .

		Indeed , we know of no other book which brings together , in a way both popular and accurate , the leading facts of culture-history , about which recent investiga - tion has disclosed so much , and recent theory done so much to coordinate .

		Among the many subjects pleasantly discussed in this element - ary treatise are fire-making , pottery , hunting , the domestication of animals and the cultiva - tion of plants , the life of the stone age , metal - working , weapons , gesture and speech , the be - ginnings of writing , marriage , and primitive religious observances .

		We have noted a few points that seem to call for criticism .

		To char - acterize the Japanese as '' highly immoral and immodest '' is a very daring thing to do , and we do not believe that the facts , broadly viewed , will bear out the opinion .

		The beginning of agriculture , which offers one of the great prob - lems of culture-history , is so discussed as to convey the idea that no problem worth speak - ing of exists .

		The common origin of peach and almond -LRB- considered as produced by human agency from a single stock -RRB- is at least ques - tionable , the weight of evidence being rather against such an hypothesis .

		Perhaps the most important criticism of the work to be made is that it does not , except by implication , em - phasize the great principle of uniformity of development in the different branches of the human family , the most salient general prin - ciple that has emerged from recent anthropo - logical study .

		Of .

		this principle , Professor
Brinton	PERSON	, in his
September	DATE	address before the
American Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Springfield	LOCATION	, spoke in emphatic terms , characterizing it as '' a dis - covery little less than marvellous , the most pregnant of all that anthropology has yet of - fered , not yet appreciated even by the learned .

		The discovery is that of the psychical unity of man , the parallelism of his development every - where and in all time ; nay , more , the nigh ab - solute uniformity of his thoughts and actions , his aims and methods , when in the same de - gree of development , no matter where he is , or in what epoch living . ''

		So important a matter as this should occupy a conspicuous place in even the most elementary of works upon cul - ture-history .

		But these few criticisms are not intended to produce the impression that Pro- fessor
Starr	PERSON	has made an unsatisfactory book .

		On the contrary , it is a strikingly satisfactory effort , considering its limitations , and is not only instructive but made entertaining by many bits of anecdote and folk-lore , to say nothing of such felicitous phrases as that which speaks of '' the wild and unhappy disposition of the cat . ''

		The beginner in anthropology could not easily have a better introduction to that deeply interesting science .

		The third of the Chautauqua books is a his - tory of '' The Industrial Evolution of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Carroll D. Wright	PERSON	, probably the most competent of all authorities on the sub - ject .

		It is an admirable book , packed with fig - ures and graphic presentments , yet highly read - able .

		It considers the colonial period of our industries at much length , then discusses the industrial evolution of our first century of na - tional existence , then presents a history of the labor movement , with special chapters on '' La - bor Legislation '' and '' Historic Strikes , '' and finally reviews the influence of machinery on labor .

		The scientific aspects of the subject are set forth with fulness of knowledge , while the controversial aspects are discussed with sobri - ety and fairness to all sides .

		It would be dif - ficult to make a better book of its size upon this vastly important subject , or one more likely to conduce to clear thinking upon the indus - trial problems of the day .

		THE DIAL 289 Professor
Harry Pratt Judson	PERSON	, in attempt - ing to sketch `` The Growth of the American Nation '' for this series of manuals , has had a task at once easy and difficult : easy , in that the task has called for no special investiga - tions , but merely for the marshalling of the undisputed elementary facts of our political his - tory ; difficult , in that so many other sketches of the sort have been written that it must have seemed almost hopeless to justify the existence of a new one .

		It is , however , justified , and amply , we should say , by the judicious selec - tion and arrangement of the materials , and by the breezy and attractive manner of the nar - rative .

		Breeziness , of course , sometimes leads to off-hand judgments that a close analysis would not support , and to turns of expression that a careful stylist would reject .

		These are the defects of the book 's quality , which do not , however , much impair its usefulness for the class of readers to which it is addressed .

		The strength of the book is in its dealing with the period lying between our two great wars , the preceding and subsequent periods being accorded a relatively cursory treatment .

		The last of this set of books , and the least valuable , is by Professor
Henry A. Beers	PERSON	, is called '' Initial Studies in American Letters , '' and is the revised edition of `` An Outline Sketch of American Literature , '' first pub - lished in
1887	DATE	, and reissued under the present title in
1891	DATE	.

		The author 's judgment and sense of perspective may be illustrated by his coupling of '' The
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' with ''
Lippin	PERSON	- cott 's '' as '' no unworthy competitors '' with the popular picture-monthlies for public favor , or by his giving to Mr.
James Whitcomb Riley	PERSON	six times the amount of space given to
Sidney Lanier	PERSON	.

		The former bard , we are told , '' has recently attained the rank of a really national poet . ''

		In trying to illustrate
Ameri	PERSON	- can literature by a fifty-page appendix of ex - tracts , Professor Beers attempts what is sim - ply impossible .

		INDIAN RELIGIONS .

		* Controversialist , popularizer , and scientific spe - cialist find the field of Indian religions attractive and productive enough to invite their activity and to warrant their putting forth books intended for the wider circle of intelligent readers .

		Mr.
Maurice Phillips	PERSON	, author of '' The Teaching of the Vedas , '' is a missionary of the
London Mission	LOCATION	,
Madras	LOCATION	, and his book presents and defends a thesis .

		He pro- pounds two questions : '' -LRB- 1 -RRB- What is the funda - mental teaching of the Vedas ?

		and -LRB- 2 -RRB- What light does that teaching throw on the origin and develop - ment of religion ? ''

		And the answer is : `` The theory of a primitive Divine Revelation alone is capable of explaining all the religious ideas of the Vedas . ' '

		Therefore Religion originated in a '' Primi - tive Divine Revelation . ''

		The book shows the de - fects of its motive .

		There may be an honest search for truth , but the spectacles of the `` P. D. R. '' aforesaid color all the endeavor .

		Vedic religion ia interpreted , not in its own light , but in that of or - thodox Christian theology .

		Professor
Hopkins	PERSON	, in his bibliography , calls it `` the work of a charlatan . ''

		This is hardly just .

		But Mr.
Phillips	PERSON	is certainly an ignoramus in his facts and a partisan in his judgments .

		The book will enlighten nobody . ''

		The Story of
Vedic India	LOCATION	'' is from the hand of a skilful popularizer of somewhat recondite sub - jects .

		Mme.
Ragozin	PERSON	's books on
Chaldea	LOCATION	,
Assyria	LOCATION	, and Media , in this same series , are useful compends of modern scholarship in the field of Oriental his - tory .


India	LOCATION	, as it is revealed in the
Vedas	LOCATION	, affords another excellent subject for her easy and graceful pen .

		The knowledge is reasonably exact and the picture fairly accurate .

		The writer claims nothing more than a wide and careful reading of good authorities .

		The average of errors committed by second-hand learning is always large , but the scholar at first-hand is not faultless .

		The book will serve the larger public by its vivid style , and by a kind of spirit and enthusiasm in the presentation which carry the reader along .

		The difficulties inherent in the subject are well illustrated in the admirable volume of Professor
Hopkins	PERSON	on '' The Religions of
India	LOCATION	. ''

		It is the first of a series of '' Handbooks on the History of Religions , '' edited by Professor
Morris Jastrow	PERSON	.

		The entire religious development of
India	LOCATION	is traced in these six hundred large and closely printed pages , by a scholar amply fitted for his task by philolog - ical training and knowledge of original authorities .

		290 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Vedic Gods nature deities or deified ancestors ?

		Is the Kig Veda poetry of a primitive age , or is it sat - urated with sacerdotalism ?

		Shall we interpret it according to the traditions of native commentators , in the light of Iranian and other kindred heliefs , or by itself , on the basis of modern scientific philol - ogy ?

		Such are the questions involving fundamen - tal points in but one age of Indian religion ; and they are samples of what meets the student at every stage of this religious development .


India	LOCATION	has no historical sense .

		Chronology is un - known .

		Literature is anonymous .

		The only pro- gress is in thought , if indeed progress can be traced even there .

		The student of religion in
India	LOCATION	must be philologian , philosopher , theologian , dreamer , lit - erary critic , man of insight and of common sense , if he would solve the puzzle of myth , ritual , poetry , symbolism , and speculation there presented .

		In view of this , it is hardly necessary to add that the ideal historian of
India	LOCATION	's religions will be a long time in coming .

		Meanwhile we have Professor
Hopkins	PERSON	, and are grateful .

		For he has scholarship and common sense at any rate , and he has used these admirable qual - ities admirably .

		His book will be a classic .

		It will mould and stimulate study in this field .

		The pre - face modestly disclaims any purpose of instructing the professional indologist , but the best - trained scholars will find the book helpful .

		In general , it will bring to them the observations of a critical and full mind upon the present condition of studies in Indian religion .

		In particular , its contributions to the religious characteristics of the Epics will be en - lightening to them .

		The author has evidently made a special study of these writings .

		The general reader will , we fear , find Mr.
Hop	PERSON	- kins a hard task-master .

		He takes too much for granted in the way of knowledge on the part of readers .

		There is too much allusion to recondite matters .

		The course of thought is often very ob - scure .

		Sentences are inverted ; parentheses are inserted with well-nigh unlimited freedom ; con - structions are loose , and expressions as undignified as they are forcible not infrequently appear .

		The author claims to improve upon Earth 's classic vol - ume on '' The Religions of
India	LOCATION	, '' because , while the latter tells us all about these religions , our au - thor has sought to make the reader know these re - ligions themselves by presenting ample illustrative material .

		True , but the average reader will read
Barth	PERSON	through with interest as well as profit , while , we fear , only a sense of duty will carry him to the end of this book .

		He will be fully repaid for the effort , however , and we only - regret that it is toward the end of his task that he will come upon the following admirable statement , which should have been placed at the beginning .

		It will give a good idea of the writer 's insight and sanity . ''

		In what , from a wider point of view , lies the im - portance of the study of Hindu religions ?

		Not , we venture to think , in their face value for the religious or philosophical life of the Occident , but in the revelation , which is made by this study , of the origin and growth of theistic ideas in one land ; in the light these cast by analogy on the origin of such ideas elsewhere ; iu the prodigious significance of the religious factor in the de - velopment of a race , as exhibited in this instance ; in the inspiring review of that development as it is seen through successive ages in the loftiest aspirations of a great people ; and finally in the lesson taught by the intellectual and religious fate of them among that peo - ple that have substituted , like the Brahman ritualist , form for spirit ; like the Vedantist , ideas for ideals ; like the sectary , emotion for morality .

		But greatest , if woeful , is the lesson taught by that phase of Bud - dhism which has developed into Lamaism and its kin - dred cults .

		For here one learns how few are they that can endure to be wise , how inaccessible to the masses is the height on which sits the sage , how unpalatable to the vulgar is a religion without credulity . ''


G. S. GOODSPEED	PERSON	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The best way to learn who were Pro- poet < taiaiiusion .

		m etheus and Hercules and Wotan and
Siegfried	PERSON	, and other persons whom poets and painters are apt to deal with , is always to have known ; but there are a good many people who have not had this privilege .

		For such are provided an ever-increasing number of books , beginning with the works of the excellent
Bullfinch	LOCATION	, and ending up , at present , with
Guerber	PERSON	's '' Myths of Northern Lands '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- and
Mooney	PERSON	's '' Foundation Studies in Literature '' -LRB- Sil - ver ,
Burdett , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		These books are somewhat different in character as well as in subject-matter .

		The latter is a collection of modern poems contain - ing allusions to classical mythology or mediaeval legend , or else on subjects from those sources , with some explanation of the allusions , legends , and myths .

		It is a book which will be of use to those who have nothing better , but it is to be regretted that it gives no very definite notion of the subject which it treats .

		Greek mythology is not a very simple matter , and our generally learning to know it through the Latin and in
Latin	LOCATION	form does not make it simpler .

		A great help in writing about it is an acquaintance with the classical authors in the original .

		Such an acquaintance
Miss Mooney	PERSON	may possess : it has not kept her , however , from such inaccuracies and confusions as giving Nox or Nyx as alternative Latin forms -LRB- p. 11 -RRB- , writing
Selene	PERSON	without mention of the name
Artemis	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- p. 33 -RRB- , writ - ing in the same legend Japetus -LRB- p. 61 -RRB- and Okeanos -LRB- p. 64 -RRB- , and other such things .

		Rather quaint than otherwise is the idea of naming a consideration of
Tennyson	PERSON	's '' Dream of Fair Women '' '' The
Origi	PERSON	- nal Sources of an Historical Poem , '' and the inser - tion of the poem between some remarks upon
Ari	PERSON	- adne and others upon the days of the week .

		Mr.
Guerber	PERSON	's book is of a much higher character , both in plan and execution .

		Having already published a volume in classic mythology , he has now turned
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 291 to the Teutonic myths , and has produced a very good popular handbook .

		He , too , offers illustra - tions from literature and art where they are to be found , but there are not enough allusions to the
Norse	ORGANIZATION	in English literature to swamp him , so that the result is very satisfactory ; the work seems to be much more than a mere compilation .

		We pre - sume that the author would have something to say on the matter , but it appears unfortunate that no effort is made to clear the confusion which may well exist in the mind of the reader as to the Ger - man and
Norse	ORGANIZATION	forms of the same story , and espe - cially of the same name , particularly as the stories in this book are usually from the Norse , while the pictures are apt to illustrate German forms .

		It would not have been difficult to explain the connec - tion between the names
Odin	PERSON	,
Woden	LOCATION	, and Wuotan -LRB- p. 23 -RRB- , to which Wotan might well have been add - ed .

		The hearer of
Wagner	ORGANIZATION	's operas or the reader of the Nibelungenlied might be expected to know that
Sigurd	PERSON	is a corresponding form to Siegfried , but he might be puzzled about
Gunnar	PERSON	, HOgni ,
Atli	ORGANIZATION	, and others .

		On page 260 the mention of
Sigurd	PERSON	and
Ermenrich	PERSON	within a few lines brings the mat - ter to an inconsistency .

		The same uncertainty may oppress the reader of another book by the same author , `` The Legends of the Rhine '' -LRB-
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- where the German names predominate .

		This book follows the Rhine from the
North Sea	LOCATION	to the Alps , and gathers together a great number of the legends of the places on the river .

		It is meant for travellers and for those who desire to secure the ad - vantages of travel without leaving home , and will be convenient for both classes of readers as well as for those who like legend and folk-lore .

		All three books are illustrated , the last profusely with good reproductions of paintings and photographs .

		In '' The Spirit of Judaism '' -LRB-

Mead & Co	ORGANIZATION	x Migs j osep hi n e Laza - of Judaism .

		, ' .

		JT `` 7 V , , rus comprises a series of five thought - ful , eloquently written papers , the general tenor of which is indicated in their collective title .

		The author treats her theme from a broadly humani - tarian standpoint , urging upon her Jewish readers the need of giving heed to the promptings of that larger impulse by virtue of which the prophets and leaders of
Israel	LOCATION	, from
Abraham	LOCATION	to Saint
Paul	PERSON	, ris - ing above the narrow sects of Scribes and
Phari	PERSON	- sees dwelling within the lifeless body of the law , broke the bondage of the letter while saving and renovating the spirit ; and urging upon her
Chris	PERSON	- tian readers the duty of self-consistency , of ap - proaching the Jewish Question from a Christian standpoint , and importing into their opinions and practice some tincture of the sublime doctrine of the Sermon on the Mount .

		Dwelling thus upon those broader and deeper phases of her subject which tend to stir the more generous emotions and quicken the sense of abstract right and justice ,
Miss Laza	LOCATION	- rus touches but lightly and incidently on its more specific , acute , and , one may say , prosaic aspects .

		To the practical mind there seems to be little need of seeking for occult and profound causes for the plain fact that the Jew , wherever he goes or stays , becomes and remains in some degree an object of antipathy to his neighbors .

		His racial isolation is primarily bound up with his own fatal tenet that he is one of a
Chosen People	ORGANIZATION	, a being apart and peculiarly sanctified in the eyes of the Maker of all , and hence religiously bound to abstain from mingling too intimately with the unclean tide of Gentile humanity .

		So long as he clings to this es - timate of himself as compared with other nations , it is not strange that his appeals to the world 's tol - erance and enlightenment should have a ring of unreason in
Gentile	LOCATION	ears .

		That everybody ought to harbor and tolerate the Jew , while the Jew ought to harbor and tolerate nobody , is a proposition not likely to find either logical or practical acceptance .

		A most discouraging feature of the Jewish Ques - tion is the fact that centuries of discord between Jew and
Gentile	PERSON	have bred a mutual instinctive dis - like , not founded in reason and not to be reasoned away ; of secular growth , and not to be effaced by the effort and generous impulse of a generation .

		While we believe that the initiative toward a better and more rational state of things lies with the Jew himself , it seems clear enough that no final solution of the Jewish Question can be looked for without a large decrease in the world 's general stock of ignorance and fanaticism .

		We commend Miss Laz - arus 's book as an earnest and liberal discussion of the higher moral issues of a subject which she be - lieves to be '' confronted with every great question of the day social , political , financial , humanita - rian , national , and religious . ''

		is to Rus - sia .

		From his vast collection of folk - lore ,
Ralston	ORGANIZATION	drew his `` Russian Folk Tales . ''

		From the same great storehouse ,
Polevoi	PERSON	drew his collection of Mdhrchen , published at
St. Petersburg	LOCATION	in
1874	DATE	.

		Two dozen of
Polevoi	ORGANIZATION	's stories , happily done into English by Mr.
R. Nisbet Bain	PERSON	, appear in a volume of '' Russian Fairy Tales '' -LRB-
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		There is a directness , a simplicity , a quaintness about these tales that is quite delicious .

		The themes are few and common to European folk - tales generally , but they have a local and ethnic flavor , as told by the Russian , that is attractive .

		The favorite plot presents the searcher , who for love of a beautiful lady journeys the wide world through to accomplish the supposedly impossible ; kindness to all sorts of apparently worthless vagabonds and beasts gains its reward in needed help at the crisis ; of course success always crowns the effort .

		Not only is the same theme found in tale after tale , but the same quaint expressions and combinations of words .

		Thus , of the hero , when commanded to perform some difficult feat , it is repeatedly affirmed that `` his impetuous head hung lower than his shoulders . ''

		To him , in this sad plight , his dear 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, love usually says , '' Lie down and rest , the morn - ing is better than the evening . ''

		At many places in these stories there are pretty hints of ancient life , custom , or belief , as where at a critical mo - ment the hero turns '' to all four points of the com - pass . ''

		Quite surely there is here a hit of ancient religion .

		One very quaint common conception is the rotating hut .

		The hero is being directed by a magic ball : '' it rolled a long way , and at last it came to a miserable hut ; the hut was standing on hen 's legs and turning round and round . ''

		Ad - dressed , it halts , and the visitor entering encounters a hag .

		In the story '' Verlioka '' we have one of the most original and curious of the many European variants of the ''
Bremen	LOCATION	Town Musicians . ''

		We have said enough to show that in this collection a child will find amusement , and the more serious student a delightful rendering of some good speci - mens of the peculiar Russian type of familiar Mdhrchen .

		A practical ^ r -
Horace Fletcher	PERSON	's little book en - Mark Tapieyian titled '' Menticulture '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- philosopher .

		is os tensibly '' a Kindergarten pre - sentation of a theory of menticulture through the elimination of the germs of the evil passions . ''

		We may describe it generally as a bacteriological doc - trine of morals , the main thesis being that mental disease , like physical , may be done away with by the process of discovering and killing the germs .

		Do not parley with the enemy or temporize with him , but lay the axe at once to the root , is Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	's governing maxim . ''

		Anger and Worry , '' he holds , are the twin radical germs of all our men - tal ailments and disquietudes ; whence it follows that if you once eradicate these germs you become , ipso facto , once and for all , a sound and happy man .

		Divested of metaphor , all this seems to amount to the easy proposition that if you do n't get angiy and worry , you will save yourself a great amount of worry and anger attendant evils of course in - cluded .

		The proposal is sound enough logically ; but , as a practical measure , it look very like humor - ously telling a man to lift himself out of the mire by his boot-straps , or to jump away from his own shadow .

		Mr.
Fletcher	PERSON	, however , has , contrary to the usage of the healing faculty , tried his own rem - edy , and with the happiest results .

		Since it first occurred to him to degerminate himself , he has been , as we gather from his narrative , uniformly the very pink of amiability and soul of the kindlier virtues absolutely bomb-proof , so to speak , against the provocations of the ''
Pullman	PERSON	porter , conduc - tor , hotel waiter , peddler , book-agent , cabman , '' and other bacteria infesting the social body .

		He is , in fact , a veritable

Stevenson	PERSON	's writings , very attractive in execution and moderate in cost .

		Eleven volumes are devoted to the novels , four to the essays and books of travel , while one is found sufficient for the contents of
Stevenson	PERSON	's three collections of verse .

		Each volume has a photogravure or etched frontis - piece , by such artists as Mr. Low , Mr.
Blashfield	PERSON	, and Mr.
Walter Crane	PERSON	.

		There are also two por - traits of the author .

		A number of things not here - tofore printed in the regular editions appear in this one , among which we may mention '' The
Misad	PERSON	- ventures of
John Nicholson	PERSON	, '' '' The Story of a Lie , '' '' Father
Damien	PERSON	, '' '' The Body Snatcher , '' and a number of essays . ''

		Treasure Island , '' which is volume two of the new edition , is accompanied by the author 's account of how the book came to be written .

		The volumes are from new plates made at the De Vinne press , and are neatly bound .

		We gave brief mention , in a recent issue , to the opening volumes of the series of annotated '' English Class - ics '' planned by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A new volume in that series ,
Scott	PERSON	's ''
Woodstock	LOCATION	, '' edited by Professor
Bliss Perry	PERSON	, deepens the im - pression made by the earlier number that this series is one of unusual excellence in the editing , and will prove a valuable auxiliary in the reform of English teaching now generally in progress .

		The following extract from the publishers ' announcement indicates the method of treatment aimed at in these books , and we would add that the volumes now published amply bear out the claim advanced . ''

		The works prescribed for reading are treated , in every case , as literature , not as texts for narrow linguistic study , and edited with a view to interesting the student in the book in question , both in itself and as repre - sentative of a literary type or of a period of litera - ture , and of leading him on to read other standard works of the same age or kind understandingly and appreciatively . ''

		In the ''
Woodstock	LOCATION	, '' for exam - ple , we have , in addition to the unabridged text of the novel , a careful editorial introduction ; the au - thor 's introduction , preface , and notes ; a reprint of '' The Just Devil of
Woodstock	LOCATION	'' ; and such foot - notes as the student will need as he turns from page to page .

		Besides all this apparatus , many of the chapters have appended a few suggestive hints for character-study , collateral reading , and discussions of the art of fiction .

		All this matter is so skilfully distributed that it does not weigh upon the con - science , and is not likely to make the student for - get that he is , after all , reading a novel chiefly for the pleasure it affords .

		The entire aim of this vol - ume and its companions is literary , rather than his - torical or linguistic , and in this fact their chief value is to be found .

		THE DIAL 293 A manual of ^ one wno * 8 acquainted with Pro- educationai thoughts fessor
Daniel Putnam	PERSON	, the veteran and methods .

		instructor in psychology and peda - gogy in the
Michigan State Normal School	ORGANIZATION	, would expect him to introduce startling novelties , or what is called '' advanced thinking , '' into a pedagogical treatise .

		One would , rather , expect him to produce a body of wisely selected educational thoughts and methods , which had been tried in the fires of theo - retical criticism and practical experience , the whole well thought out , carefully arranged , well illustrated , and offered to the reader in well-chosen language .

		And this is just what he has done in his book en - titled `` A Manual of Pedagogy '' -LRB- Silver ,
Burdett , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		For the common teacher seeking intelli - gent guidance in his work by private reading , for the reading circle , for the teacher 's class in the high school or the normal class in pedagogics , we do not now recall a book that is better worthy of being recommended .

		Two chapters of forty-five pages are devoted to the study of children , which is quite disproportionate .

		It is assumed -LRB- page 83 -RRB- that there is a '' moral perception '' which '' examines and decides questions '' of right and wrong , which is not '' moral judgment . ''

		No doubt Professor
Putnam	PERSON	will admit that the only difference between what he calls '' moral perception '' and '' moral judgment '' is the greater or less degree of com - plexity of the process .

		Whenever perception passes upon a moral question , saying , '' This is right '' or '' That is wrong , '' it utters a judgment .

		We are glad to see that the author bestows reasonable at - tention upon the active principles of human nature , the feelings and the will ; not falling into the too common mistake of supposing that education is an affair of the intellect merely .

		It is a defect of the book that there are no references to the numerous quotations .

		The six articles that make up Pro- fessor
Albert Bushnell Hart	PERSON	's new volume , '' Studies in American Edu - cation '' -LRB- Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , appeared in the years 18871893 in well-known magazines and re - views .

		As qualification for writing them , the author adds to general scholarship and successful exper - ience in teaching , a special interest in the subject of education , and particularly American education .

		Moreover , he has won a good degree by services in the
Cambridge School Committee	ORGANIZATION	, where , it is un - derstood , he has been influential in causing the new four years ' course of study to be introduced into the grammar schools of that city .

		His studies have a decidedly practical tendency , and together consti - tute an addition to our steadily growing stock of good educational literature .

		There may be differ - ences of opinion as to which of the studies is the most valuable , but students of American education are likely to find the first one , entitled '' Has the Teacher a Profession ? ''

		the most readable .

		Pro- fessor
Hart	PERSON	's remarks on the prevailing popular dis - trust of experts , and the low estimate in which real Studies in American education .

		A practical German grammar .

		learning is held , are both interesting and humiliat - ing .

		That a foreign domestic established in an American professor 's kitchen should ask her mis - tress whether the head of the house '' had any real profession , '' is not surprising ; but to find the wife of a member of the academical staff at
Cambridge	LOCATION	observing that '' she could never see what President
Eliot	PERSON	could find to do , '' is , to put it mildly , depres - sing .

		Book titles are often misleading , but such is not the case with Professor
Thomas	PERSON	's '' Practical German Gram - mar '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , for the book is thoroughly practical .

		One of its especial features is the treatment of pro- nunciation .

		Some elementary phonetic principles are very simply illustrated and used as a basis in describing the various sounds .

		The student learns to produce the sounds , not to imitate what he un - derstands the teacher to say .

		The connected exer - cises beginning with the fourth lesson are a distinct advance over anything that has yet appeared in that line .

		An American boy describes in letters his experiences in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		Incidentally they serve to arouse interest in German life and customs , and are accompanied by notes that explain unfamiliar matters , idioms , etc. .

		The chapters on Syntax pre - sent the facts clearly , and illustrate with aptly - chosen examples that are in every instance carefully translated .

		In the arrangement and treatment of this part of the book , the influence of
Brandt	PERSON	's Grammar is very evident , but the statements are fuller and clearer .

		The appendix contains some remarks on orthography , and an excellent treat - ment of cognates .

		The colloquies and exercises fur - nish sufficient practice , so that no reader is needed ; and after finishing Part I. the student is prepared to read any one of the numerous short stories that have been annotated and edited for school use .

		The book is a distinct advance upon anything at present in the market , and will doubtless prove not only a valuable and useful text-book but will contribute toward a better preparation on the part of students who present German as an entrance subject in col - lege . ''

		The Principles of Rhetoric '' -LRB- Har - P er -RRB- ' b y Professor
A. S. Hill	PERSON	, is an example of the best sort of text-book .

		Based , in its earlier editions , upon wide scholarship and sound principles , it now adds to these substan - tial foundations a superstructure of illustration and suggestion derived from the reading of many years , and from the experience that results from inter - course with many classes of college students .

		In its present revised and enlarged form , it is easily the best manual for instruction in rhetoric now ob - tainable by American teachers .

		Its method is pre - eminently that of teaching by example ; its formu - lations of doctrine , clear and concise , in every case lead up to an ample series of illustrative extracts , ranging all the way from Shakespeare to the Amer - ican newspaper the latter introduced mainly for 294 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, reproof .

		So aptly-chosen are these extracts , and so interesting in themselves , that the study of rhetoric , pursued with their aid , is in no danger of suffering from the reproach of arid technicality , and ought to become a delight to the right-minded student .

		We may mention in this connection , as in a way supplementary to Professor Hill 's book , the admir - able series of `` Specimens '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , of which we have previously mentioned the volumes devoted to '' Argumentation '' and '' Exposition , '' and which is now completed by the publication of Dr.
C. S. Bald	PERSON	- win 's '' Specimens of Prose Description , '' and Mr.
W. T. Brewster	PERSON	's '' Specimens of Narration . ''

		These little books are carefully edited , and teachers will find them exceedingly helpful .

		It required no little planning to con - ^ , .

		dense `` The Complete Poetic and Dramatic Works of
Robert Brown	PERSON	- ing '' within the limits of a single volume , but
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have accomplished the difficult task , and made a book that is at once attractive and readable .

		They have even done more than was promised , for they have added the essay on
Shelley	ORGANIZATION	, heretofore practically inaccessible to the general reader , and highly valuable both in - trinsically and as the most important example of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	's prose .

		This '' Cambridge Edition '' of
Browning	ORGANIZATION	extends to 1033 double-columned pages , has a fine portrait and an engraved vignette view of Asolo , a biographical introduction by Mr.
Horace E. Scudder	PERSON	, indexes of titles and first lines , and all the notes that an intelligent reader ought to ask for .

		The book , with its '' infinite riches in a -LSB- compara - tively -RSB- little room , '' is really a marvel of careful editing and mechanical design , and deserves high praise from every standpoint .

		Is it too much to hope that we may sometime have a similar edition of the poetical works of Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	?

		Ideals of modern education .

		Mr.
James P. Monroe	PERSON	, formerly of the
Massachusetts Institute of Tech	ORGANIZATION	- nology , in '' The Educational Ideal , an Outline of Its Growth in Modern Times '' -LRB- Heath -RRB- , has done a decidedly creditable piece of pedagogical work .

		He assumes that since the days of the schoolmen the most advanced nations have been steadily working out a common conception or ideal of child-training ; and this he at once proves and explains by passing in review the principal con - tributors and contributions to the work .

		It can not be claimed that these characterizations of the edu - cational reformers fully describe in all cases the work they have done ; nor are we sure that the particular phase of the reformer 's influence hit upon is in every case the characteristic one , as , for example , in the case of Comenius .

		Still , Mr.
Monroe	PERSON	has gone carefully over his field ; he has brought together the most valuable educational ideas of the men whom he passes in review ; and , if his interpretations may sometimes be objected to , the value of his contribution to the history of modern education will not be questioned by those who are capable of passing upon the matter .

		The book is an authoritative exposition of its subject .

		The learned editor says that while it does not make all hard things easy , it has certainly rendered it possible for the thoughtful reader to make a profitable begin - ning of the Herbartian pedagogy , of course . ''

		It has been the bridge , '' he says , '' over which thou - sands of teachers have passed to independent study and research . ''

		Its object is wholly practical : '' To stim - ulate patriotism and to promote good citizenship . ''

		Its plan can be stated in few words . ''

		Patriotism '' is the first of the seventeen topics that are treated .

		The author asks , '' What is Patriotism ? ''

		and he answers in a sentence his own question .

		Then fol - low brief quotations from
Goldsmith	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Noah Webster	PERSON	,
Burke	PERSON	, and others .

		The questions , '' Why should we love our native land ? '' ''

		Is Patriotism merely a personal or local attachment to one 's home ? ''

		and many more , are treated in the same manner .

		The other general topics , as `` The Flag , '' `` The Revolution , '' `` The War for the
Union	ORGANIZATION	, '' follow in order .

		The author shows a good knowledge of the literature of his subjects , and good judgment in making his selections .

		teaching feels that he must prove his quality by promptly coming before the public as an editor of some text .

		Fortunately , there are several enterprising publishing firms ready to accept this sort of literary product as fast as it is offered , and the modern teacher of French or German is happy in finding to his hand so wide a choice of texts as to prove almost embarrassing .

		Only those who have been at the work for twenty years can fully appreciate the difference between present and ear - lier conditions in this respect .

		Mr.
John R. Effinger , Jr.	PERSON	, seeking to pay his maiden tribute to pedagogy , has had the happy inspiration to select for an - notation a group of '' Selected Essays from
Sainte	LOCATION	- Beuve '' -LRB- Ginn -RRB- , than which he could have made no better choice .

		These special studies are followed by a tabular presentation of the results , and a highly valuable synthetic discussion of the subject of the thesis .

		This monograph is distinguished not only by schol - arship , but by a well-balanced and finished literary style .

Copeland	PERSON	& Day have issued , autobiography of in a limited edition upon hand-made Waiter Pater .

Walter Pater	PERSON	.

		The booklet makes but forty-three small pages , but every one of them is a joy .

		The test of such a study as this aside from the purely liter - ary tests is , of course , the fidelity with which it seizes the moods and fancies that all children have at some time dimly experienced , and gives to them truthful and permanent expression .

		This test is triumphantly met , while the beauty of the style is such as to set the study above the reach of praise .

		It is a miniature classic , if there ever was one .

Harvard	LOCATION	,
Yale	ORGANIZATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	,
Toronto	LOCATION	,
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, and many other higher institutions of learn - ing . ''

		This statement calls forth letters from Profes - sor James of
Harvard	LOCATION	,
Professor Ladd of Yale	ORGANIZATION	, Profes - sor
Baldwin	PERSON	, formerly of
Toronto	LOCATION	, and Professor Cat - tell , formerly of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, and now of
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	.

		Each of these gentlemen is very distinctly under the impression that he himself founded the department of experimental psychology in the university with which he is , or was , connected , and that neither President

		Like Coriolanus , they cry : '' Alone I did it .

		THE DIAL 303 GRAND WINTER CRUISES BY THE MAGNIFICENT TWIN-SCREW EXPRESS STEAMERS OF THE if -LSB- HAMBURG-AMERICAN LINE .

		FOR several years past the Hamburg-American Line lias arranged excursions at certain seasons , placing at the disposal of travellers one of its floating palaces , and affording them all the comforts and luxuries of modern life .

		These cruises have become so popular with the American travelling public that the Company has made them a permanent feature of its service .

		_ THE FIRST CRUISE will be by the Twin -
Screw Express Steamer FURST	ORGANIZATION

New York	LOCATION	.

		The cruise from
New York	LOCATION	to the Orient and return to
New York	LOCATION	will occupy about ten weeks .

		Pas - sengers desiring to prolong their stay in
Europe	LOCATION	before returning to
America	LOCATION	may leave the excursion upon touching at
Genoa	LOCATION	the second time and take any one of the Hamburg-American Line 's Express Steamers from
Hamburg	LOCATION	,
Southampton	LOCATION	, or
Cherbourg	LOCATION	, to
New York	LOCATION	, up to
August 1 , 1896	DATE	.

		Ever since the childhood of the human race the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	coasts have played the most important part in the history of advancing civilization .


Greece	LOCATION	has bequeathed to us her precious legacy of art and poetry ,
Rome	LOCATION	has given us her grand representatives of patriotism and statecraft ,
Egypt	LOCATION	has filled our souls with thrills of awe and wonderment , the Holy Land has inspired us with lofty sentiments and relig - ious fervor .

		All along the blue
Mediterranean Sea	LOCATION	we find the indelible imprints of man 's past , the glo - rious monuments of antiquity .

		The whole scenery of ancient history unrolls before our eyes , not in artistic reproduction , but in all its realistic grandeur and glory .

		The memories of such a trip , the sights of the scenery of the most remarkable events of man 's history , will remain for a lifetime in the soul of every beholder .

		_ THE SECOND CRUISE will be by the Twin -
Screw Express Steamer COLUMBIA	ORGANIZATION	, Cap - tain Vogelgesang , sailing from
New York	LOCATION
January 25 , 1896	DATE	, to the WEST INDIES and the SPANISH MAIN .

		The Itinerary will include the following ports : Port au Prince -LRB-

Caracas	LOCATION	-RRB- and Puerto Cabello -LRB-
Venezuela	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Kingston	LOCATION	-LRB-
Jamaica	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Havana	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	.

		This tour lasts about four and a half weeks , and offers American tourists a most attractive and com - fortable means of escaping the bitter blasts of our rigorous Northern winters .

		A glance at the itinerary suggests at once tales of romance and adventure , recalling many a famous exploit of dead-and-gone worthies .

		But it also presents to the mind a vista of smooth seas and lovely palm-covered beaches , of beautiful scenery and strange peoples , offering an ever-varying and inexhaustible fund of novelty to divert the mind and charm the senses .

		In cruising from port to port in these en - chanted seas , among verdant and flower-clothed islands , nature is seen in her brightest and most beautiful mood , and life in the tropics at its best .

		It would be difficult , indeed , to imagine any attribute of an ideal winter resort not found among these '' Fortunate Isles . ''

		TIME AT EACH PORT IS AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO VISIT ALL PLACES OF INTEREST .

		-LRB- ^ NE hundred and thirty-one full - page photogravure reproductions of S ^ Mr.
ABBEY	PERSON	'S drawings illustrate this edition of THE COMEDIES OF SHAKESPEARE .

		The text is that of the folio of
1623	DATE	, with obvious errors corrected and the orthography modernized , and the retention of passages which occur in the folio , but which many editors have omitted , will be noted with interest .

		These volumes should be welcomed equally by the student and reader of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and the lover of artistic illustration .

		As the basis of the process of photogravure by which these copper - plate pictures are made is photographic , all forms in the original draw - ings are perfectly retained , and the qualities faithfully rendered , so far as the translatable portions of these superb drawings can be reproduced .

		Museums were ransacked for the costumes and armor of the periods , and almost forgotten bits were brought to light by the diligent search of the enthusiastic artist .

		Old hangings and cabinets , that may have been a part of the surroundings of the dramatis personce , have been skilfully used as decorative backgrounds , and form no small part of these charming com - positions .

		These drawings are the result of many years of careful thought .

		Months were spent in the study of the scenery and accessories of each play , and the student and the antiquary will find much in these illustra - tions to delight his eye .

		No other illustrator has got so near to the heart of the immortal bard .

		The text and illustrations of these unique volumes will average about 3 ^ 0 pages each .

		`` Mr.
Apthorp	PERSON	has translated them superbly with a frank and intimate sympathy that is almost genius . ''


New York	LOCATION	Commercial Advertiser . '' '


Jacques Damour	PERSON	' is one of the strongest of Zola 's tales , and it is not unlikely that by his short stories he will be best remembered ... If the English volume shows the savage strength of the industrious Frenchman , it also reveals in that most laughable ' Cocqueville Spree ' the humor of the man ... The English reader who hitherto has unfortunately only known Zola by the unfavorable reports of those who either can - not or will not understand him , as he shakes over Mr.
Apthorp	PERSON	's sympathetic Englishing , will rub his eyes and say : ' Why , this Zola is , after all , intensely human . ' ''

		Boston Journal . ''

		Instantly , if there be a bit of critical sense in any reader , the art , the tremendous compelling power of Zola , seizes the mind , and compels the flippant provincial estimate of French work as merely Gallic to cease its effort for preeminence . ''


Boston Transcript	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` With a single stroke of his pen M. Zola gives life and fullness to his characters , of whom all are natural and true to their environment .

		349 WA GNER IN
CHICAGO	LOCATION	.

		The two weeks ' season of German opera , under the effective leadership of Mr.
Walter Damrosch	PERSON	, just ended in
Chicago	LOCATION	, has been peculiarly satisfying to lovers of music , both on account of the even excellence of the whole series of performances , and because of the evi - dence it has supplied of a genuine public taste for the greatest masterpieces of the lyric stage .

		The performances have mainly been devoted to the works of
Richard Wagner	PERSON	, the only non-Wagnerian productions having been the '' Freischiitz '' of
Weber	PERSON	, and the '' Fidelio '' of Beethoven two operas so closely akin to '' Tristan '' and '' Die Walkiire '' that the as - sociation was both fit and salutary .

		The au - diences have been large and appreciative , dis - playing a subdued but stern enthusiasm as far as possible removed from the noisy ebullition of feeling usually evoked by works of the bar - rel-organ type .

		The best evidence that the performances have been taken as seriously as they deserve is to be found in the fact that large numbers of people have sought to prepare themselves for the works by some preliminary study of their structure .

		Not only have the expository morning lectures of Mr.
Damrosch	PERSON	attracted crowds of listeners , but a number of local musicians as well have addressed large audiences of students eager to equip themselves 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, with the knowledge necessary for a comprehen - sion of the interwoven harmonies of the ''
Nib	ORGANIZATION	- el ungen '' tetralogy .

		Of course the
Philistine	LOCATION	, after the manner of his kind , jeers at this sort of thing , as he would jeer at anyone who should attend a course of lectures on Shakespeare in anticipation of a season of Mr.
Irving	PERSON	, or as he has recently been jeering , in his favorite role of newspaper critic of music , at the extremely helpful analytical programmes this year for the first time pro- vided for the concerts of the
Chicago Orchestra	ORGANIZATION	.

		In his view , works of dramatic and musical art are for the amusement of mankind , not for their instruction or ethical discipline , and , in the depths of his vulgar ignorance , he resents as a personal affront the suggestion that they may have for others any deeper meaning than they have for him .

		As a monumental illustration of the incapacity of such critics , we may in - stance the argument , which we have come across more than once in the public print , that `` Die Walkiire '' is to be condemned upon moral grounds because it depicts the love of Siegmund and
Sieglinde	PERSON	.

		One might say to such a critic , '' I thank thee , Jew , for teaching me that word , '' for at least it consigns
Wagner	PERSON	and ^ Eschylus to a common infamy , and the most fervent apostle of the German composer would hardly venture , unprompted , to pedestal him beside the Greek tragic poet .

		The inep - titude which makes possible such an amazing verdict as we have above recorded does not , of course , deserve serious notice , but it does excite some curiosity to feel the bumps of the man who was capable of expressing such an opinion .

		The history of Wagnerian music in
Chicago	LOCATION	covers a score of years .

		It is difficult now to think of the '' Tannhauser '' overture and the '' Lohengrin '' nuptial chorus as novelties , but a quarter of a century ago it required confi - dence and even daring to include them in a popular concert programme .

		Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	, fortunately , was equal to the occasion , and his Wagnerian propaganda was begun in
Chicago	LOCATION	with two or three numbers of this sort as long ago as before the Great Fire , of which we read in our ancient history .

		It was a little over twenty years ago that the first performance of a Wagner opera was heard in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The work was '' Lohengrin , '' and
Madame Albani	PERSON	sang the part of the heroine .

		Two or three years later came the '' Dutchman , '' with
Miss Kellogg	PERSON	in the character of Senta . ''

		Tann - hauser '' came next , then ''
Kienzi	PERSON	. ''

		About a dozen years ago
Chicago	LOCATION	got '' Die Walkiire '' as a first instalment of the Nibelungen tetral - ogy .

		At about this time the late Dr.
Damrosch	PERSON	gave us the first performance of the ''
Parsi	PERSON	- fal ''
Vorspiel	PERSON	.

		Not long after , the entire series of the '' Ring der Nibelungen '' was given , and this work was soon followed by the ''
Meister	PERSON	- singer van Niirnberg . '' ''

		Tristan and Isolde '' had its first production in
Chicago	LOCATION	in the
spring	DATE	of the present year , and completed the list of the Wagnerian music-dramas , with the single exception of '' Parsifal , '' which , we need hardly say , has not yet been given -LRB- as a stage per - formance -RRB- anywhere in
America	LOCATION	.

		And during all these years , Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	has so persistently included Wagnerian selections in his orchestral programmes that many of them have become as familiar as were the ''
William Tell	PERSON	'' and '' Freischiitz '' overtures m the old pre - Wag - nerian days .

		The importance of the educational work done in this direction by our veteran conductor can hardly be over-estimated .

		He has done more than anyone else to make the music of the fu - ture the music of the present , to confound the rage of the heathen , and to confute the vain imaginings of old-fogyism .

		We understand that it has always been rather against the per - sonal inclinations of Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	that he has given so disproportionate an amount of atten - tion to the works of a single modern composer , that he would much have preferred to play
Beethoven	PERSON	and
Mozart	PERSON	, but that he at first rec - ognized the necessity of combating the strength of ignorant anti- Wagnerian prejudice , and af - terwards found that so irresistible a popular demand for
Wagner	PERSON	had been created in the music-loving public of this city that he could not do otherwise than satisfy it , seeing that the de - mand had been so largely of his own creating .

		A word should also be said of the work done dur - ing these years by the most influential and schol - arly musical critic in
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Upton	PERSON	's long and honorable connection with journalism in this city has been noteworthy in many ways , but in none more so than in the zeal and sym - pathy which it has brought to all the attempts made by Mr.
Thomas	PERSON	and others to make of the music of
Eichard Wagner	ORGANIZATION	an integral and intimate part of the musical consciousness of
Chicago	LOCATION	audiences .

		Those of us who have been watching for years sometimes hopefully , sometimes despond - ently , and always eagerly for signs of the de - velopment of this great city upon its spiritual side have derived more satisfaction from the progress of musical culture than from any other
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 323 single source .

		While painting and sculpture and architecture have at times seemed to be making no headway at all , while educational and literary ideals have lagged far behind the march of material prosperity , while true civic feeling has seemed to be forgotten in the all-absorbing passion for money - getting , the growth of culture in music , the most ideal of the arts , has been gratifying in the extreme .

		At the present day , music is probably the larg - est factor in the spiritual life of this commun - ity , and few communities anywhere offer such opportunities for musical culture .

		The most important serious musical review published in
America	LOCATION	is produced in
Chicago	LOCATION	; one of the three or four best orchestras in the world may be heard here in weekly concerts ; the two great operatic organizations that occupy the field this year give
Chicago	LOCATION	a large share of their attention ; we are having more good cham - ber music than ever before ; the great soloists of the concert-stage all find here a cordial wel - come , while one of them , at least , makes this city her home ; and when we look beyond these conspicuous features of our musical life , into the work of the societies , and the schools , and the private teachers with their individual fol - lowing , we find an activity that is more than hopeful , a state of things that comes near to realizing the best that it is reasonable to ex - pect of any American community , a f ermentive influence at work that is leavening for good the whole heterogenous human mass .

		IN GRATITUDE TO PROFESSOR BOYESEN .

		The late Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	, like most persons of in - terest , was a bundle of contradictions ; and to estimate his influence , or even trace his manner of thought , one must begin and end with the cherished notion that in - consistency , not consistency , is the proverbial jewel , if indeed the latter is not a bugbear of weak minds .

		An illustration of his delightfully human obliquity , and at the same time perhaps of his childlike naivete , is afforded by the circumstances of the following letter , confided to me by a young man who was at the crossways of jour - nalism and teaching when recently he sought the genial professor 's advice .

		It is a dilemma so frequently con - fronting college-bred men of literary tastes , and Pro- fessor
Boyesen	ORGANIZATION	's words are so pertinent and character - istic , that I venture , with ''
Nicodemus	PERSON	's '' permission , to reproduce them .


NEW YORK	LOCATION	,
May 29 , 1894	DATE	.

		MY DEAR MR. : ... Will you pardon me if I say that I think you are very sanguine , and take rather unwarrantable risks , in giving up a safe and sure position as a teacher for the very uncertain chance of making a success in journalism , at a time when there are a hundred applicants -LRB- so often very able ones -RRB- for every position .

		I have seen so much misery this winter among young educated men , who had done the very thing that you propose to do , that I can not refrain from warning you .

		In
1880	DATE	I gave up my
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	professorship for the very same reason that you adduce ; and I was very glad to resume the professorial harness at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	in
1881	DATE	, and I have never since contemplated the possibility of getting rid of it .

		Will you permit me to call your attention to a short story of mine called `` Liberty 's Victim '' -LRB- in the volume , `` Vaga - bond Tales '' -RRB- , which preaches a pointed practical moral on this subject .

		I remain , with kind regards and good wishes , very sincerely yours ,
H. H. BOYESEN	PERSON	.

		With his usual frankness and cordiality , he here re - ferred '' Nicodemus '' to a story -LRB- the volume underlined , N. laughingly insists upon my mentioning , in an en - closed price-list of his '' works '' -RRB- of dismally blighted literary hopes , which he wrote presumably after he had experimented with hack-work as a sole means of sup - port , and had known its trials .

		Not so , however . ''


Vag	ORGANIZATION	- abond Tales , '' which were published in
1889	DATE	, were writ - ten , Mr.
Barry	PERSON	informs us , while
Boyesen	PERSON	was yet pro- fessor at
Cornell	LOCATION	; so that '' Liberty 's Victim , '' if indeed we do not entirely mistake its personal ring , proceeded from anxious anticipation , not the actual experiment , of burning his ships behind him .

		Voila .

		He expected a novice to profit from advice he had once given him - self and refused to follow . ''

		Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable , '' as he must have done on the occa - sion in question , it does not detract from the sanity and wholesomeness of his judgment , in helping young men to find themselves .

		It only proves that he knew the futility of all advice ; opus est , enim , ad notitiam sui , experimento .

		Nor could he have overlooked the fine humor of the situation .

		As advice goes , however , whole oceans of which va - porize into nothing , Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	's to young men was uncommonly potential , because it was generally the outgrowth of experience rather than observation .

		la his childhood he was prompted by an inordinate curi - osity to put his finger into a lawn-mower , to see how it worked .

		When he , in turn , transmitted to his own boys the parental injunction , '' Do n't get caught in the ma - chinery , '' blue eyes and flaxen curls must have reluc - tantly acquiesced .

		He left many nuts , too , for boys of the quill to crack .

		The literary novice may well pon - der the facts of Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	's Sturm und Drang period .

		Frankness was the atmosphere of his life .

		Yet he was rarely blunt or curt , nor did he appear to carry his heart on his sleeve .

		That he was self-sufficient , and transmuted his wide observations into a microcosm of his own , denotes virility , not egotism .

		He lived his own life , in the Goethean , not the Emersonian , sense , assi - milating vitalizing materials from each new environ - ment .

		He was self-centred , as every artist must be , yet not insulated .

		He followed the shrewd counsel dropped by the Merry -
Andrew	PERSON	in the prelude of Faust : '' Reach deep and widely into human life , Every one lives it , few know it , '' and found , to judge from his tireless enthusiasm , '' Wherever you put in your trowel , there it is interesting . ''

		He projected his life on a large scale ; and why not , when his zest for living was so keen ?

		In
1889	DATE	, his forty-first year , he published an essay on the '' Meridian of Life , '' striking a mock-elegiac strain . ''

		There is a touch of exquisitely cruel regret , '' he said , `` in the thought that I am henceforth no more to be numbered among that happy throng to whom folly is becoming and permissible . ''

		Then he quoted
Browning	PERSON	: 324 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, '' Grow old along with me I The best is yet to be , The last of life for which the first was made . ''

		Cheerily hoping the full human allotment of years , at the half-way point he could talk exuberantly of the compensations of middle-life .

		Few men could so engage the popular attention with the exposition of their own daily emotions .

		This very note of frankness , his willingness to be subjectively committal , was a barrier to preeminent success in story - telling .

		As he confessed , he wrote his stories with his '' heart-blood . ''

		They read so .

		One feels that , with the possible exception of ``
Gunnar	PERSON	, '' his one romance , they are too individualistic , we had almost said too personal , too roughly distilled in the alembic of his imagination .

		Like most men of affairs , he could not get far enough away from his subject to see it impassively , and , in the truest sense , mirror nature .

		The essay and discussion , rather , were his forte .

		When editor of '' Framerd '' in
Chicago	LOCATION	, in those early courageous days , he devoted himself '' chiefly to denouncing denominational schools among the Norwegians , '' in which '' crusade '' he took '' a great deal of pleasure . ''

		He was a born controver - sialist , who loved to startle his opponents by occasion - ally overstating his position , a species of criticism which , however entertaining , never fails to rouse sympathy for the cause against which one is pleading .

		Call Professor
Boyesen	PERSON	`` sensational , '' `` cynical , '' if you will : by his pleasing sophistries he often helped others , on the re - bound , to find truth ; and he was never , never stupid .

		His '' Commentary on Ibsen , '' which , one might imagine from its name , would be loaded down with exegetical minutiae , is as readable as the happy little bundle of es - says entitled '' Social Silhouettes . ''

		True , one may take exception to some portion of everything he wrote .

		He dealt inadequately , perhaps , with the ethics of
Robert Browning	PERSON	, and he characterized Messrs.
Crawford	PERSON	and
Weyman	PERSON	as `` mere purveyors of amusement . ''

		But this is simply saying that he had the defects of his qualities , among which were an intense interest in every social and literary problem ; his contemporaneity ; and a Ma - caulayan love of warm color and startling paradox .

		That he could daily rise so heroically above the '' drudg - ery of the desk 's dead wood '' -LRB- I sometimes think Lamb by these words characterized the recitation-room as well as he did the counting-house -RRB- , and , between lectures at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	, turn out , in wondrous succession and with apparent ease , essays , translations , poems , causerie , and even stories , crudely realistic as they may be , evinces a rare versatility and fecundity .

		Amidst all this activity , wearing ever so lightly the '' professorial harness , '' he was glad to see his friends , and even the chance visitor who had a congenial errand .

		He was of kind service to many , especially of a younger generation , in admitting them to his refreshing com - panionship , just as he had himself been inspired by personal contact with
Turgenieff	PERSON	,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	, and
Bjornsen	PERSON	.

		He would smilingly suspend his work , and show you his rare editions of ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' or of old Norse Sagas , ac - cording to your taste , with a running commentary of gossip and reminiscence , which , for fluency and good cheer , equalled any of his writings .

		On the wall facing his desk at
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	were pinned as many as a hundred pictures of literary folk , from magazines and periodi - cals .

		To his American and European contemporaries he would point with an amused air , saying he could work better , '' compassed about with so greaVa cloud of witnesses . ''

		THE OBSTACLES TO INDIVIDUALITY IN TEACHING .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As a reader who for many years has tried to be a teacher in the highest sense of the word , and one who has had experience in the schools of several states , I wish to express the gratitude that all teachers must feel for the recognition so ably accorded by THE DIAL of the influence of Individualism in teaching , and its plea for wider scope in that direction .

		I firmly believe , how - ever , that the average superintendent and board of education are not only willing to allow , but wish to en - courage , capable teachers to exert their individuality .

		The trouble is that there are so few teachers who are '' capable '' in this direction ; and for this the conditions , not the teachers or the superintendents , are usually to blame .

		Owing to many things , chiefly the foreign influx and the mania of foreigners for placing their daughters above manual work , and above all the despicable poli - tical spoils system , there has been a lamentable defi - ciency in the quality of teachers , at least below the high school .

		The scholarship requirements have been of such a nature that any person with an average in - tellect could learn the necessary facts for examination and certificate purposes .

		Given a certificate and a '' political pull , '' and the rest has been easy .

		Under existing conditions , how can persons of marked individuality be expected to choose the profession of teaching , or to remain in it ?

		No teacher can retain self-respect who is continually hampered by the trials incident to frequent changes , or whose salary is inade - quate to maintain herself and insure the means of in - creasing her general and special culture .

		In most of the states , the teacher below the high school rarely re - ceives , outside the largest cities , a higher salary than
$ 450	MONEY	a year , and it is more often
$ 360	MONEY	.

		If she is self - supporting , her living expenses will exhaust at least
$ 270	MONEY	for the school year , clothing will consume -LRB- in - cluding shoes , gloves , and hats -RRB- another
$ 100	MONEY	; travel - ling expenses , books and periodicals -LRB- and if she is re - quired to attend teachers ' institutes this amount will be inadequate -RRB- ,
$ 50	MONEY	.

		Although these are very low esti - mates , and no provision has been made for incidentals ,
$ 420	MONEY	is needed to cover them .

		How-shall the teacher plan who receives but the
$ 360	MONEY	as salary , and must live through the vacations ?

		How can the teacher , however high her ideals , however fitted she may be for social pleasures and mental improvement , avail herself of the opportunities that may offer if any extra expense is entailed in the way of dress , books , or tickets ?

		Is not the young woman who has a good home and good education , but finds a little extra money desirable for dress or the future trousseau , the real enemy of the ideal teacher ?

		This young woman does not expect to make teaching a life-work , hence she lowers the standard of the profession .

		Her father , perhaps , holds political in - fluence in the district , and says , '' What is the use of sending away for a teacher ?

		My daughter will take the school for less money than a stranger . ''

		This is especially true in rural schools .

		As objectionable as is the habit of text-book reliance , I believe most sensible people would prefer to have such teachers bound to it rather than to exercise their individuality on their children .

		THE DIAL 325 Itfefo SHERMAN 'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY .

		* The two ponderous volumes of
John Sher	PERSON	- man 's autobiography are before us .

		The bur - den of the work is a very skilful and elaborate presentation of Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's leadership in dealing with the finances of the
Government	ORGANIZATION	during his extended public service ; but other questions of interest receive due attention , and the reader is thus abundantly supplied with the material for a just estimate of the man .

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	was one of eleven children , and was born at
Lancaster	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, on the
10th day of May , 1823	DATE	.

		A particular account of his ancestors is given in his first chapter , but he says he can not claim for them superior rank or wealth or ability , but that they were men of useful and honorable lives , of untarnished rep - utation , thorough republicans in the best sense of that word , and always for their country in every contest for the right .

		In dealing with his school days and early life , Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	is singularly frank .

		He says he was regarded as a wild reckless boy and eager to fight , and that he frequently quarrelled and fought with one of his schoolmates .

		He had numerous controversies with his teachers , and was some - times punished with the ferrule and the switch .

		He was often more or less intoxicated , and in one instance excessively so , and was twice ex - pelled from school for inexcusable misconduct .

		In his early school days , however , first at Mt.
Vernon	PERSON	and afterwards at
Lancaster	LOCATION	, he made considerable progress in his studies , especially in mathematics , and at the age of thirteen he began to develop his thrifty disposition . ''

		If fortunes could be made by others , '' said he , '' why could I not make one ?

		I wished I was a man .

		It began to appear to me that I could not wait to go through college .

		What were Latin and Greek to me , when they would delay me in making a fortune ? ''

		Prompted by these feelings he succeeded , through the influence of his brother
Charles	PERSON	, in getting the position of rodman under the chief engineer in charge of the improvement of the Muskingum river .

		He was then only fourteen , but proved equal to his duties , and after the survey was com - pleted he was entrusted with the supervision of a portion of the work .

The Werner Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		which was allowed him in the
fall of 1838	DATE	, he purchased a barge , and undertook the shipment of salt and other commodities to
Cincinnati	LOCATION	as a speculation , but the unexpected delay caused by the low water in the
Ohio	LOCATION	made the venture a losing one .

		In the election of this year the Democrats were successful , and a change in the board of public works deprived young Sher - man of his position .

		In the following year he determined to study law , and in
1840	DATE	entered upon his studies in
Mansfield	LOCATION	; but as he could not be admitted to practice till he was twenty - one , he managed in the mean time to support himself by such odd jobs of miscellaneous busi - ness as fell in his way , without seriously neglect - ing his studies .

		He was admitted to the bar in
1844	DATE	, soon after he became of age , and entered into a prosperous business as the equal part - ner of his brother
Charles	PERSON	.

		In this year he cast his first vote , and made his first political speech for
Henry Clay	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was a Whig by inheritance and association , and he tells us that at this time he had but two definite ideas about politics : a hearty belief in the doctrine of pro- tection to American industries , and a strong prejudice against the Democratic party .

		On the slavery question the attitude of Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	as a great Republican leader natur - ally awakens a peculiar interest .

		No man had less sympathy with abolitionism .

		By nature he was unimpassioned and conservative .

		The moral bearings of slavery gave him no concern .

		In
1848	DATE	, when men of eminence from all other parties joined in forming a new one to prevent the spread of slavery over our national terri - tories , the movement had no significance for Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	, who contentedly remained in the Whig party , and became a delegate to the national convention which voted down the Wil - mot Proviso and nominated for the Presidency a large slave-owner who was perfectly accept - able to the South .

		In
1850	DATE	, when
Congress	ORGANIZATION	balked this great uprising of the people of the
Northern States	LOCATION	by a compromise which aban - doned the
Wilmot Proviso	ORGANIZATION	, and thus invited the repeal of the
Missouri	LOCATION	restriction which followed , Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	gave his unhesitating approval to this betrayal of a great cause .

		In
1852	DATE	, when the Whig and Democratic parties joined hands in solemnly pledging themselves to oppose the further discussion of the slavery question , in
Congress	ORGANIZATION	or out of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, when - ever , wherever , or however such discussion might be attempted , and under whatever shape or color the attempt might be made , Mr.
Sher	PERSON	- man heartily indorsed these pledges , was a dele - 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, gate to the national convention which nominated General
Scott	PERSON	, and an elector of his party .

		He always declared himself opposed to the aboli - tion of slavery in the
District of Columbia	LOCATION	, though always conceding the power of Con - gress to do it ; and when the events of the war brought the question to the front in
1862	DATE	he voted for the measure because it would add to the value of the property of
the District	ORGANIZATION	and increase its population .

		The right of the ne - groes to their liberty seems not to have entered his thoughts .

		It is true that in
1854	DATE	, when he was first elected to
Congress	ORGANIZATION	by the Whigs and Know-Nothings of his district , he opposed the repeal of the
Missouri Compromise	ORGANIZATION	, and afterwards demanded its restoration ; but so did thousands of conservatives like himself who were shocked by this attempt to remove an ancient landmark and renew the agitation that had been quieted by the final settlement of
1850	DATE	.

		To oppose the repeal of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise as the violation of a solemn com - pact , was one thing ; but to oppose it as a cold - blooded conspiracy for the spread of slavery over the continent was another and totally dif - ferent thing .

		That Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's opposition to slavery was not inspired by conviction , but grounded on political expediency , was made evident by his conduct while a candidate for Speaker in the Thirty-sixth
Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		A
North Carolinian	LOCATION	named Helper had written a book entitled '' The Impending Crisis of the South : How to Meet It . ''

		Helper was not the champion of the negroes , and thought they ought to be colon - ized ; but he appealed to the poor whites of the South , of whom he was one , to organize against the crushing exactions of slavery .

		His argu - ments were unanswerable , and his facts in the main trustworthy ; and nothing could have seemed more innocent than the recommenda - tion of such a book by a man who was opposed to slavery even on economic grounds .

		But when
Clarke	PERSON	of
Missouri	LOCATION	charged Republican members of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, including their candidate for Speaker , with recommending the book , and declared that the man who did it was not only unfit to be Speaker but unfit to live , the bal - loting for Speaker was suspended , and denials , apologies , and explanations abounded , as if slavery had been of divine appointment and the writing of such a book an unpardonable sin .

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	did not think he had rec - ommended the book , but as he found his name printed along with other signatures he sup - posed he must have signed the paper .

		He finally stated that he signed it by proxy , but that he knew nothing of the contents of the book ; and he disclaimed any right on the part of the people of the Free States to meddle with the relation of master and slave in the South .

		This disclaimer was repeated and gratuitously reiterated during the protracted debate which followed ; and he made the remarkable state - ment that at the beginning of that session of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	he did not believe the question of slav - ery would come up , and that but for
Brown	PERSON	's raid at
Harper	ORGANIZATION	's Ferry there would have been no feeling on the subject .

		In his mental be - wilderment he seems to have forgotten that the repeal of the
Missouri	LOCATION	Compromise , the bloody outrages in
Kansas	LOCATION	, and the brutal assault upon
Charles Sumner	PERSON	, had created a commotion of which the affair at
Harper	PERSON	's Ferry was a mere incident .

		His labors as a peace-maker were utterly thrown away .

		It was this spirit of conciliation in the presence of turbulence and threats which called forth the stinging rebuke of
Northern	ORGANIZATION	members , by
Thaddeus Stevens	PERSON	, for cowering before the studied bluster of the Southern leaders .

		But in justice to Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	it should be remembered that he rendered invaluable ser - vice in the struggle to make
Kansas a Free State	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was Chairman of the
Congressional Committee	ORGANIZATION	which was sent to the territory to investigate the Border Ruffian outrages , and which dragged to the light a great mass of startling facts which powerfully and savingly influenced public opinion in the
Northern States	LOCATION	.

		His labors on the stump in the cam - paign of
1860	DATE	were untiring and effective , as they were a little later in the enlistment of re - cruits for the war .

		When the great conflict came , and the power he had vainly sought to propitiate struck at the
Nation	ORGANIZATION	's life , his tim - idity gave place to courage , and he gave his whole heart and strength to the imperilled cause of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		He believed in prosecut - ing the war with the whole might of the nation , and he took an active and leading part in all the legislation of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	during and following the struggle , including whatever acts affected the institution of slavery and the fortunes of the colored race .

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's strongest claim upon the gratitude of his country , however , is based upon his activity and leadership in managing the finances of the government during the war and thenceforward to the present time .

		His natural aptitude for financial studies was joined to tireless industry in the public service .

		He
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 327 was a zealous champion of the Legal-tender Act of
1862	DATE	, and of our system of national banks .

		He took the lead in the work of fund - ing the public debt , as he did also in the re - sumption of specie payments .

		His labors both as Senator and Secretary of the
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	are set forth with elaboration and detail in these two great volumes , including citations from the Congressional debates , copious extracts from his own speeches , letters from distinguished public men commending his action , and such explanations as he deemed called for in placing himself advantageously before the country .

		He may well be proud of his record , for it shows his prodigious industry and patience and the large measure , of success which followed .

		We do not mean to say , however , that he made no mistakes .

		He was wrong in espousing the Sherman Act , which proved so disastrous to the country .

		He had no faith in it , and in lending it his support on grounds of party ex - pediency the statesman was lost in the politi - cian .

		He was wrong again , as he now con - fesses , when he favored the payment of 5-20 bonds in greenbacks .

		He is wrong to-day in opposing the retirement of our legal-tender notes , and thus lending the continued sanction of the government to the mischievous folly and delusion of an irredeemable paper currency .

		And we believe the sober judgment of history will pronounce him wrong in favoring the pas - sage of the Legal-tender Act of 18 b * 2 .

		It was this legal attempt '' to make something true which was false , '' and not Secretary
McCul	PERSON	- loch 's policy of contraction , as Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	asserts , that gave birth to the greenback craze which demoralized both the great parties , de - luded the people , and finally found expression in the
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	in its its opinion overruling the decision of Chief Jus - tice Chase in the case of
Hepburn vs. Griswold	ORGANIZATION	.

		These volumes bear constant witness to Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's absolute loyalty to his party .

		If this is a virtue , no man has a better title to it .

		His career shows that he has been ambitious .

		In his long public life he has had many rival - ries and conflicts , and his aspirations for the presidency have been repeatedly disappointed ; but his devotion to his party has known no change .

		When it has gone astray , he has still followed it .

		When its chief leaders and found - ers felt compelled to leave it on account of the scandals of
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's two administrations , he quietly and uncomplainingly followed its fortunes .

		While he was Secretary of the Treas - ury he removed
Arthur	PERSON	and
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	from the
New York Custom House	ORGANIZATION	, on account of gross malfeasance in office ; but when
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	after - wards became a candidate for Governor of
New York	LOCATION	, Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	supported him in a series of public speeches .

		When this action was crit - icised by his friends , his defence was that '' we must carry
New York	LOCATION	next year , or see all the results of the war overthrown and the consti - tutional amendments absolutely nullified . ''

		Kindred considerations induced him to support the Sherman Act .

		He did not approve the measure , but thought it would be of temporary advantage in preventing the passage of a bill for the free and unlimited coinage of silver .

		Such a bill would have to be acted upon by President
Harrison	PERSON	, and his approval or veto of the measure would tend to divide and weaken the Republican party .

		That was his sole and anxious concern , for the President held in his hand the power to save the country from the free-silver madness .

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's loyalty to his party has a still more striking illustration in his action in
Louisiana	LOCATION	in the
fall of 1876	DATE	, respecting the famous
Returning Board	ORGANIZATION	of that
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		He was then in
New Orleans	LOCATION	as one of the '' visiting statesmen '' deputed by President Grant to su - pervise the action of this body in counting the vote of
the State for President	ORGANIZATION	.

		The result of the national canvass was at stake , and Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	knew that these were the same men who constituted the
Board	ORGANIZATION	in
1874	DATE	, and that after the election in that year they took the majority of votes from one side and gave it to the other , by unjust , arbitrary , and illegal ac - tion , as shown by a
Republican Congressional Committee	ORGANIZATION	composed of Wheeler of
New York	LOCATION	,
Hoar	PERSON	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, and
Frye	PERSON	of
Maine	LOCATION	.

		He knew that
Wells	PERSON	, the President of this
Board	ORGANIZATION	, who had been Governor of
the State	ORGANIZATION	under the reconstruction policy of President
Johnson	PERSON	, had been summarily ejected from that office for violating an act of the Legislature respect - ing the repair of her levees , and seeking to prostitute the funds of
the State	ORGANIZATION	to partisan purposes .

		He knew that this
Returning Board	ORGANIZATION	had no power to reject the vote of any precinct unless the certificate from such precinct was accompanied by a sworn protest , signed by the supervisors , that intimidation had been prac - ticed ; and that in no single instance did the
Commissioners of Election	ORGANIZATION	show a compliance with this requirement , without which
Tilden	PERSON	had legally carried the
State	ORGANIZATION	by seven thousand majority .

		But Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	was working for his party .

		He believed , and so did the Repub - 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, licans throughout the country at that time , that the election of Tilden would be a national calamity , and that we should '' see all the results of the war overthrown and the constitutional amendments absolutely nullified , '' as he had declared in speaking of the defeat of
Cornell	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	.

		It was as impossible for Mr.
Sher	PERSON	- man to consider the issue of the
Louisiana	LOCATION	elec - tion judicially as to add to his stature by tak - ing thought .

		Mr.
Sumner	PERSON	used to say , `` The slave of principle , I call no party master . ''

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	might say with equal truth , '' The slave of party , I call no principle master . ''

		That he attempts in this autobiography to de - fend his action in
Louisiana	LOCATION	simply proves that the party idolatry which blinded his vision in
1876	DATE	has never been intermitted .

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	refers to a meeting between General
Thomas	PERSON	and
General Sherman	ORGANIZATION	, at
Williamsport	LOCATION	, on the
Potomac	LOCATION	, early in
June , 1861	DATE	.

		In the light of the past it now has a special interest .

		The interview took place at Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's lodgings in a country tavern .

		His brother , he says , `` Then met for the first time in many years his old class-mate , Colonel , afterwards Major General ,
George H. Thomas	PERSON	, who then commanded a regular regiment of the
United States	LOCATION	army in the force under the com - mand of General
Patterson	PERSON	.

		The conversation of these two officers , who were to be so intimately associated in great events in the future , was very interesting .

		They got a big map of the
United States	LOCATION	, spread it on the floor , and on their hands and knees discussed the prob - able salient strategic places of the war .

		They singled out
Richmond	LOCATION	,
Vicksburg	LOCATION	,
Nashville	LOCATION	,
Knoxville	LOCATION	, and
Chattanooga	LOCATION	.

		To me it has always appeared strange that they were able confidently and correctly to desig - nate the lines of operation and strategic points of a war not yet commenced , and more strange still that they should be leading actors in great battles at the places designated by them at this country tavern . ''

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's interest in the finances led to a particular intimacy between him and
Sec	ORGANIZATION	- retary Chase , who figures largely in this auto - biography .

		It is pleasant to notice that their relations were those of friendship and mutual respect .

		Prior to the
National Republican Conven	ORGANIZATION	- tion of
1880	DATE	, Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's relations with
Garfield	PERSON	were most friendly .

		He now says : '' I knew
Garfield	PERSON	well .

		From his early advent in
1861	DATE	in the
Legislature of Ohio	LOCATION	, when I was a candi - date for the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	, to the date of his death , I had every opportunity to study his character .

		He was a large , well-developed , handsome man , with a pleasing address and a natural gift for oratory .

		Many of his speeches were models of eloquence .

		These qualities naturally made him popular .

		But his will-power was not equal to his personal magnetism .

		He easily changed his mind , and honestly veered from one impulse to another .

		This , I think , will be admitted by his warmest friends .

		Dur - ing the trying period between his election and inaugur - ation his opinions wavered , but
Elaine	PERSON	, having similar personal qualities but a stronger will , gained a powerful influence with him .

		When I proposed to him to be a delegate-at-large to the
Chicago	LOCATION	convention he no doubt meant in good faith to support my nomination .

		When his own nomination seemed probable , he acquiesced in , and perhaps contributed to it , but after his election he was chiefly guided by his brilliant Secretary of State . ''

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	evidently believes that Gar - field secretly cooperated with his friends in securing his own nomination ; and as to this there is probably little diversity of opinion among intelligent men .

		The Presidency was too tempting a plum to turn away from when pressed upon him by his enthusiastic admirers .

		He yielded ; but he is not solely responsible .

		If Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	's temperament had been more tropical , and his friends in
Ohio	LOCATION	and elsewhere had heartily and enthusiastically worked for his success , either he or Mr.
Blaine	PERSON	would have been nominated , and no '' dark horse '' would have been thought of .

		Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	, in tell - ing the story of his political defeats and arraign - ing other public men for their hostile action , should remember that he too has been an ex - emplar in the business of practical politics .

		He has had his literary bureaus , and has freely used all the appliances by which public opin - ion could be influenced in his behalf and the votes of delegates secured , whether in the Northern or
Southern States	LOCATION	.

		Indeed , if he had been less intensely devoted to his own am - bition , and less obsequious to the party which has so often failed him in times of trial , his chances of political success would probably have been improved .

		We have little space left for minor topics .

		In telling the story of his life , Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	has evidently cared more about the accuracy of his facts than their literary expression .

		In the matter of style , his third chapter , giving a brief history of
Ohio	LOCATION	, is by far the best in the two volumes .

		The public will be glad to learn that Secretary
Stanton	PERSON	and General
Sherman	PERSON	became reconciled , and that during
Stanton	PERSON	's last illness General
Sherman	PERSON	called to see him .

		In stating that the Republican party was named at its
Philadelphia	LOCATION	convention of the fourth of
July , 1856	DATE	, Mr.
Sherman	PERSON	is mistaken .

		It was named at its first national convention , which met at
Pittsburg	LOCATION	on the twenty-second of Feb - ruary of that year , organized the party , and issued the call for its first nominating conven - tion in the following
July	DATE	.

		THE DIAL 329 STUDIES OF BIRD TJ Any treatise in ornithology coming from the hand of Professor
Elliot	PERSON	, the Curator of Zool - ogy in the
Field Columbian Museum	ORGANIZATION	, bears the stamp of authority .

		The author has proved his capacity to deal with this branch of natural history by various monographs in special groups of birds peculiar to both the eastern and the western hemispheres .

		In his latest work , de - voted to '' North American Shore Birds , '' he addresses a more popular audience than here - tofore , desiring particularly to meet the needs of sportsmen , and of the interested but unsci - entific observer of birds found on our coasts and along the shores of our inland waters .

		He has therefore adapted his book in every fea - ture to the requirements of these two classes of readers .

		The species described number upwards of seventy , all comprised in the order Limicolice .

		Among them are some of our choice game birds , woodcock , snipe , plover , etc. .

		Each spe - cies is figured in a full-page engraving , which , with the accompanying life-history , ensures its easy recognition .

		There are furnished , besides , a key to the order , by which the name and place of any shore bird in hand may be deter - mined , an outline map plainly defining the sci - entific terms applied to its external features , and a glossary .

		The biographies are short and compact , simple in style , and enriched with incidents drawn from the author 's own experi - ence .

		He has been from boyhood a student of shore birds , seeking them in their native haunts from the
Atlantic	LOCATION	to the
Pacific	LOCATION	, and from
Alaska	LOCATION	to the plains of
Mexico	LOCATION	.

		There is con - sequently a freshness in much of the informa - tion given which renders it valuable to the naturalist as well as the inexperienced bird - lover .

		Among the whole number of species de - scribed , none are quite so curious in certain habits as the
Phaleropes	LOCATION	, of which there are three species , all partaking of the same strik - ing peculiarities .

		In his account of the North - ern Phalerope , Professor
Elliot	PERSON	thus tells its strange story : '' Early in
May	DATE	it arrives at the breeding grounds , and the females commence to make love to the appar - * NORTH AMERICAN SHORE BIRDS .

		ently indifferent males , using all the wiles and blandish - ments generally employed by one of the sterner sex -LRB- when bent on a like purpose -RRB- to gain the favor and seduce the affection of the object of its adoration .

		And the male is as coy and retiring as the most bashful maiden , turning away from the proffered attentions , first to this side , then to that , even flying to the oppo - site side of the pool , or to another near by ; but all in vain , for he is followed by the fair one who has chosen him from his fellows , and there is no escape .

		He swims rapidly along , but she is ever near , and with arched neck circles about him , rising on wing at times and poising above him , and producing a sharp series of sounds by quick strokes of the pinions .

		At last , like any other poor bachelor so beset , he yields , and the nest , a slight structure of dry stalks , is placed in the centre of a thick tuft of grass .

		The eggs are four in number ... On these the poor male , a victim to woman 's rights , is obliged to sit the greater part of the time , the female amusing herself on the pool near by . ''

		As a rule , male birds are handsomer than their mates ; and if there be a difference in their size , it is to his advantage .

		But the re - verse of this obtains among the
Phaleropes	LOCATION	.

		Only last
spring	DATE	the writer of this saw two Lady
Wilson Phaleropes	PERSON	disputing over the possession of one of the opposite sex .

		They were in a tiny pool left by the rains in a grain - field , where they had dropped to rest and re - fresh themselves on their way up from the south .

		The ladies were elegantly attired and most graceful in every motion , while the little , shy , demure male , in a coat of plain colors , kept to himself and fed quietly at one side of the pool , apparently unmindful of the eager , not to say violent , behavior of the pair con - tending for his companionship .

		It was a singu - lar study in bird-life , suggesting amusing par - allels in human history .

		How or when this dominion of the female sex began among the Phaleropes is a question lost in an obscure an - tiquity .

		The manual on '' British Birds , '' by Mr.
`` W. H. Hudson	PERSON	, might be called a companion piece to
Chapman	PERSON	's '' Handbook of the Birds of the
Eastern United States	LOCATION	, '' which won such gen - eral applause on its appearance last
spring	DATE	.

		Mr.
Hudson	PERSON	's work is one to be commended without reserve , dainty in its exterior and val - uable in its contents .

		Within the compass of a duodecimo volume it compresses the most de - sirable special information concerning the birds which make their home for any portion of the year within the territory of the British Islands , and includes also the essential parts of the rudi - mentary science of ornithology .

		A prefatory chapter explaining the anatomy of a bird is from the skilful pen of an adept in such expo - sition , Mr.
Frank E. Beddard	PERSON	, F.K.S. .

		It is 330 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, couched in language so simple that a child should be able to comprehend and enjoy it .

		By way of conclusion , a brief account is added of the scheme of classification adopted by the ornithologists of
England	LOCATION	.

		Then follow con - densed sketches of the habits and manners of more than two hundred separate species of birds , beginning with the thrushes and ending with the auks .

		Each sketch is headed by a technical description of the bird under notice , and in many cases with an exquisite portrait in black and white .

		The volume is further illustrated by eight plates in color , which , like the drawings , are executed with admirable deli - cacy and truth .

		One has to read but a single chapter in '' Game Birds at Home , '' by Mr.
T. S. Van Dyke	PERSON	, to discern that the author treats his sub - ject with a sympathy equal to his knowledge .

		All the qualities of the true sportsman are his .

		First of these is a passionate love of Nature in every form and phase , and this prompts him to study her patiently and faithfully .

		He knows every tree and flower in the region around him , not only by its name but by its minutest fea - tures .

		He has the same familiar acquaintance with the animals , although with it he has the fondness of the hunter for bringing down his game .

		The book is written , in fact , from the sportsman 's standpoint as though the author were talking to some fellow-sportsman , recount - ing , as such never tire of doing , exciting inci - dents in the field which have their date in the past , but renew their life in vivid recollections .

		It is to such comrades in spirit that the book will appeal , and probably with the same pleas - ant effect as have Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's previous works of a kindred character .


SARA A. HUBBARD	PERSON	.

		OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE .

		* It could have required no little courage in Miss
Ruth Putnam	PERSON	, author of a new life of the
Prince of Orange	ORGANIZATION	, to undertake to cover again the ground that
Motley	ORGANIZATION	has made so peculiarly his own .

		The result , however , fully justifies her undertaking ; for the difference in point of view , the use of new material discovered since
Motley	ORGANIZATION	wrote , the biographic form of the work , and the newer method of historical writing , * WILLIAM THE SILENT , PRINCE OF ORANGE .

Sixteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	.

		The Story of his Life as Told from his own Letters , from those of his Friends and Enemies , and from
Official Documents	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
Ruth Putnam	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
Q. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		all make the book a distinct contribution to our knowledge of the man and the period in which he lived , and to American scholarly achievement .

		Miss Putnam has followed
Motley	ORGANIZATION	quite closely through the tangled politics of the time , the relations of the several provinces to one another , to
Spain	LOCATION	and to outside countries , and the patient efforts of the
Prince of Orange	ORGANIZATION	to unite them against the oppressor ; but she has read in those same documents some different motives and characteristics that give her por - trait of the Prince another aspect and a new interest .

		Yet it is the same man that appears in these pages , and our estimate of his great - ness is confirmed by the result of this different treatment .

		For Miss Putnam does not write with the blind enthusiasm of the hero-worshipper , but with an excess of caution against that very enthusiasm .

		One can not imagine her giving those thrilling dramatic pictures in which Mot - ley 's volumes abound , and when she even ap - proaches enthusiasm she seems to hold herself up lest she should be betrayed out of her self - contained and almost plodding gait .

		There is in this work nothing of the grand style of the classic historians , but a plain , judicial account of the man and his work , his perplexities and disappointments , his patient steadfastness when everything seemed lost , his growth from abso - lutism and religious indifference to liberalism and spirituality .

		Strong as is the fascination of
Motley	ORGANIZATION	's brilliant word-pictures , one turns almost with relief from his strains of unmixed eulogy to the cool account in these volumes , where defects are pointed out as well as excel - lences , and no attempt is made to cover over the weaknesses of the great leader .

		Accord - ingly , we have here '' the man under the dust of the past , '' and not a glorified heroic portrait .

		The key to
Miss Putnam	LOCATION	's conception of the
Prince of Orange	ORGANIZATION	is found in the sub-title of her book .

		It is a moderate man that she sees in him , a cautious and conservative statesman , whose career is a gradual development , whose opposition to his king was forced upon him , and not a religious or political enthusiast who worked up a revolution .

		While Motley makes his opposition to Spanish tyranny mainly relig - ious , dating from the revelations of the French king in the forest of
Vincennes	LOCATION	,
Miss Putnam	LOCATION	attributes it to his indignation at the invasion of the political rights of
the Netherlands	LOCATION	, and fails to see much of heart religion in him until the later years of his life .

		That utterance of his which is taken for the motto of this work
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 331 shows his character , and in the sixteenth cen - tury could have been uttered only by a moder - ate man who cared more for the essentials of religion than for the differences that made the divisions of the Christian church bitterly hos - tile to one another : `` This difference is too slight for you to remain separated . ''

		His train - ing could well have made him tolerant beyond his age , for he was born of earnest Lutheran parents , was reared a Catholic , and then in the course of his life-struggle was led back through Lutheranism to Calvinism .

		His moderate con - servatism made him an object of distrust to the partisans on both sides , and often seemed likely to destroy his influence with the people .

		But when the radical partisans had brought disaster upon their cause , the weight of Will - iam 's character , the evident sincerity of his devotion to the popular cause , and the proved wisdom of his advice , brought them back to him with renewed confidence .

		Another of
William	LOCATION	's qualities , barely no - ticed by other writers but given almost undue prominence by
Miss Putnam	PERSON	, is his craving for sympathy .

		It was indeed a characteristic , as his letters plainly show , but hardly so excessive as to become the weakness this book would make it .

		On the other hand ,
Miss Putnam	LOCATION	is not blinded to the self-seeking ambition and the Macchiavellian subtlety that in more than one instance marred the fair outline of his career .

		For example ,
Motley	ORGANIZATION	can not explain his leav - ing his oldest son in the power of the Spaniards when he fled from the
Netherlands	LOCATION	; but
Miss Putnam	LOCATION	acknowledges that he probably risked his son in the hope that he might save his
Netherland	LOCATION	estates .

		A pathetic feature of
William	LOCATION	's career is that it was cut off before he could know that all his sacrifices and his suffering would result in success , and that he had made for himself one of the great names of history .

		Things were almost at their worst in the
summer of 1584	DATE	, after the deceptive successes of the pre - ceding year .


Washington	LOCATION	and Lincoln lived to know that they had founded and saved their country .

		William left all in confusion and even apparent decline , the southern provinces back under the Spanish rule , and the northern despondent and not yet roused to the despera - tion that finally was too much for even Par - ma 's genius and
Philip	LOCATION	's stubborn determina - tion .

		The northern union that at last won national independence was organized against his wishes , for his ideal was unity and freedom for all the provinces .

		Miss
Putnam	PERSON	's work is a genuine biography , and not a history masquerading under a false name .

		Much attention is given to
William	LOCATION	's domestic affairs , and much of the interest of the book lies in its direct and indirect descrip - tions of the
Nassau	PERSON	family the noble mother and brothers , and the close ties , reaching almost the clannish spirit , that bound them together , the spirit of mutual devotion and self-sacrifice .

		The story of
William	PERSON	's four marriages and of his married life is also most interesting , and reveals much as to his character .

		All but one of these marriages were politic , and only in that one did he find the sympathy and comfort that he craved .

		His second wife ,
Anne	PERSON	of
Saxony	LOCATION	, was a thoroughly bad woman .

		The publishers have given the work a most fitting and beautiful dress , and enriched it with more than fifty portraits , copies of old prints , and fac similes .

		Altogether it is a very satis - factory piece of work , and deserves high com - mendation .

Dec. 1	DATE	, of social life are regarded as coming within these groups , and as belonging to them by virtue of in - herent likeness .

		The analysis of phenomena and the interpretation of their existence are not treated apart from recommendations as to their improve - ment .

		These recommendations are put forward as the chief purpose of the treatise .

		The social move - ments of reform are treated under the factors of society , the reform of the press , socialism , single tax , the labor movement to secure shorter hours and higher wages , profit-sharing , extension of poli - tical control over monopolies , charities , corrections , education , improvements in taxation , arbitration of national disputes , religious progress and influence .

		The author 's long experience in public affairs , his wide reading , his reflection on events , his shrewd insight , have enriched his pages with many sugges - tive and thought-provoking sentences .

		Many of the metaphors carry one 's mind into the heart of a great theme and assist the memory in retaining the impression .

		For popular presentation , the dog - matic and oracular style of treatment is effective and suitable .

		But a careful reading compels one to ask for further discussion and different method .

		The definition of sociology -LRB- page 8 -RRB- is , '' a knowl - edge of the facts of society , the order in which they follow one another , and their causes and reasons . ''

		The author begins each part with a discussion of facts and their causal explanation , but everywhere his mind goes far beyond the limits of his definition , for he erects ideals for the future and seeks to have them realized in action .

		The definition is not large enough for his book , and it is not the book which is blamed .

		The standard and touchstone of social conduct is given at the start -LRB- page 3 -RRB- , as `` that final , comprehensive product the public welfare . ''

		In every chapter this idea controls the current of thought .

		Domestic activity , customs , political and economical methods , church work , are all compelled to pass under this measure .

		And yet one will search the book in vain for a clear and definite statement of the elements which enter into this criterion of welfare .

		No doubt all the essential elements are implicit in the discussion , but the aim of the author would have been made more clear and powerful by a complete and explicit analysis of a very complex conception .

		He has made an import - ant advance beyond his earlier work , in giving a more prominent place to the domestic institution ; and many of his suggestions are very instructive and inspiring .

		But he places the discussion under the head of '' Customs '' and along with '' Classes . ''

		It would be difficult to imagine a more incongruous or illogical arrangement .

		The title of the part does not cover the contents .

		His method confines him -LRB- page 5 -RRB- to `` phases of progress offered by our own and by English society , '' and some of the most important arguments for monogamic marriage come from its earlier history .

		One often agrees with the writer in his conclusions , while objecting to the method of reaching them .

		Just now , in the study of sociology , we need fact rather than wings , statistical method and historical investigation more than rapid flights from premises assumed to conclusions desired .

		At the present stage of the science , the method is of supreme moment ; and for special students the method of this book is not be - yond criticism .

		With all abatements due to defects of the author -LRB- or of the critic -RRB- , we have here a work which will be read , and which all interested in so - cial thought and social reform will find helpful .

		It will assist the wholesome tendency of our time to regard every question in the light , not of class in - terests , but of the common welfare .

		And this com - mon welfare is defined in terms of the highest and noblest achievements of the human spirit , and not in terms of savage life or benumbed spirituality .

		An exceedingly useful work on '' Statistics and Sociology '' is given us by Professor
Mayo-Smith	PERSON	.

		The scientific mind is never satisfied until the forces which are the objects of study have been measured .

		There are many very important facts which can not be brought into mathematical formulas , but the unscientific thinker is too easily contented with a general description when an accurate statistical con - clusion might be reached if only we take pains enough .

		From a vast range of reliable sources , Professor
Mayo - Smith	PERSON	, an expert in statistical methods , has brought together a mass of ordered materials which bear on social problems ; and stu - dents of sociology are deeply his debtors .

		Many vague notions and insecure theories will be tested by the yard-stick of this book , and no serious worker can afford to ignore it .

		Early in the book -LRB- page 6 -RRB- there is a '' classification of social phenomena . ''

		While the author is careful to indicate that the '' method of statistical observation is not of uni - versal application , '' the unpracticed reader needs to have the suggestion emphasized .

		By virtue of its purpose , the book itself may produce in some minds the impressions that the phenomena which are '' im - ponderable '' are non-existent or unimportant .

		The classification as given is sufficient for a bare out - line , and will suggest the place where-the measured facts belong ; but the more ample treatment of Spen - cer , De Greef , and Schaffle should be constantly compared .

		It is a distinct merit of the work that the data compiled are arranged in a way to excite interest and lead to results .

		At the beginning of each chapter the mind is awakened by the question , What is the purpose of this investigation ?

		Then the available data bearing on the problem are given and are sifted by scientific tests , while in the '' re - flective analysis '' the results are summarized .

		Under the head '' Demographic , '' the relevant material in respect to sex , age , and conjugal condition , births , marriages , deaths , sickness , and mortality , are pre - sented .

		Under the title '' Social '' we have a simi - lar treatment of social condition -LRB- families and dwell - ings , education , religious confessions , occupations -RRB- , the infirm and dependent , suicide , and crime .

		Race and nationality , and migration , come under the rubric '' Ethnographic '' ; and the closing book on '' Environment '' discusses population and land
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 333 -LRB- physical environment -RRB- , and population and civil - ization -LRB- social environment -RRB- .

		In a second volume the author proposes to cover the ground of '' statis - tics of commerce , trade , finance , and economic social life generally . ''

		Its appearance will be awaited with eager interest .

		In the present work , the treat - ment suffers from the absence of a distinct concep - tion of the standards and criteria pf social welfare .

		Nowhere do we find stated with sufficient clearness the test of the worth of a social arrangement or ten - dency .

		The criteria by which the accuracy of sta - tistics themselves is to be judged are given by the author ; but the '' reflective analysis '' would yield a clearer result if we were told more definitely on what principles the actions , customs , and institutions are to be held as more or less valuable to society .

		`` Evolution and Effort , '' by Mr.
Edmund Kelly	PERSON	, concludes with a summary of the argument : '' No human being is so circumstanced but that he can contribute to make life less hard for those about him ; that it is to religious sentiment , and to relig - ious sentiment alone , whether within the pale of the Church or without , that humanity can look for the exercise of the self-restraint necessary for this end ; that human suffering can be dealt with most efficaciously by the action of the
State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The min - isters of the churches should help in the organiza - tion of non-partisan and unsectarian associations for the study of social needs and promoting the efficiency of the municipal and other local govern - ments .

		Some of the particular discussions are very suggestive and stimulating , as , for example , the author 's recommendations in respect to pauper col - onies .

		The speculative elements are not always sharply distinguished from the judgments resting on facts , and one feels in reading such books that he has , after all , only the individual opinion of an intelligent man .

		The sermon form is not adapted to exhaustive and systematic discussions of social science , and the clerical temperament is not , as a rule , judicial .

		So much is illustrated in '' A Lent in
London	LOCATION	, '' by the Rev.
H. S. Holland	PERSON	and others .

		And yet it is a valuable collection of sermons , and the pages glow with inspiration and sympathy .

		If one turns to these pages for definite social programmes , he will be disappointed .

		There is some erroneous and her - etical economics , some vague declamation .

		But these men live near the people .

		One of them was a layman before he was a clergyman , and says : '' I have tried , even after I was ordained , to preserve my common sense . ''

		His contribution proves that he succeeded , for Mr.
Boiling	PERSON	's ordination did not prevent him from uttering most unpalatable truths in a wholesome way .

		The tendency of this volume is toward the '' socialistic '' camp ; at least , com - munity direction of community interests is strongly urged .

		The book will kindle that passion for hu - manity which is the sustaining motive of social in - vestigation and of humane service after the truth has been found and formulated . ''

		The Evolution of Industry , '' by Mr.
H. Dyer	PERSON	, is an attempt to show the relation of economic in - terests to the general interests of society , and to depict the process of development from lower to higher stages .

		The common welfare is set forth as the goal of all social efforts , and this welfare in - cludes all the satisfactions of man 's physical and spiritual nature .

		A rapid survey of the physical conditions of progress is followed by a discussion of the historical growth of the modern industrial sys - tem out of the mediaeval methods .

		This survey in - cludes a treatment , very brief and general , of guilds , the domestic industry , the factory system , trades unions , the work of women , cooperation , municipal and state control , and industrial training .

		The two concluding chapters on industrial guilds and indus - trial integration are the prophetic portions .

		Here the author passes , and without very distinct notice , from description and interpretation of past facts to a personal opinion of what ought to be in the future .

		His purpose is rather to show the logic of events and the drift of the period than to test the value of particular movements .

		The conclusion is : '' The society of the not very distant future will have an admixture of individualism , trades unionism , coop - eration , and municipal and state socialism .

		The present duty of all social reformers is to educate public opinion in the direction of their ideals . ''

		The
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	, under the leadership of great bishops and the Pope , is thoroughly committed to a discussion of industrial questions .

		Professor
Nitti	PERSON	's work on u Catholic Socialism '' is now trans - lated from the Italian for readers of English .

		While it is somewhat declamatory in style , it is very im - portant .

		The various forms of ecclesiastical activity in respect to the labor question , on the continent , in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, and in
America	LOCATION	, are carefully de - scribed , and the bibliography is very complete .

		Here is a power to be counted with , and those who wish to understand it will peruse these chapters with keen interest .

		The German insurance laws have attracted the attention of the civilized world , and provoked dis - cussion of state aid to workingmen in countries which have usually avoided '' paternal '' legislation .

		The schemes for old-age pensions which bear the influential names of
Charles Booth	PERSON	and
Joseph Chamberlain	PERSON	have been the theme of much discus - sion in
England	LOCATION	, and governmental inquiries and proposals have brought the topic within the field of practical politics .

		There is no consensus of opinion on the subject .

		Mr.
Geoffrey Drage	PERSON	, in his book on '' The Problem of the Aged Poor , '' makes a con - tribution of considerable interest to the discussion ; and our situation in
America	LOCATION	is not so different from that in
Europe	LOCATION	that we can safely pass it by with - out attention .

		As our cities grow larger and more numerous , we shall be seeking a method of caring for honest people in old age without the humilia - tions attending the reception of public and private charity .

		Mr.
Drage	PERSON	has , before proposing his own position , carefully stated the arguments of all the more important schools of thought , and has collected 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, data for independent judgment .

		First of all , the facts relating to the extent and causes of old-age pauperism are related , and the social apparatus for dealing with it in
England	LOCATION	is desci-ibed the poor law , charity , and thrift .

		The inquiries of the
Royal Commission	ORGANIZATION	and of Mr.
Charles Booth	PERSON	are com - pared .

		In Part II .

		we have a succinct and clear statement and criticism of the various schemes pro- posed in
England	LOCATION	by Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	,
Canon Blackley	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
C. Booth	PERSON	, Mr.
Bartley	PERSON	, Mr.
Wilkin	PERSON	- son , and Professor
Marshall	PERSON	.

		The accounts of the poor-law and workingmen 's insurance in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Denmark	LOCATION	are too brief to be entirely satisfactory , and need to be supplemented by the study of Mr.
John Graham Brooks	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Drage	PERSON	does not favor state pensions , because he thinks they are not nec - essary , that they would tend to destroy the inde - pendent friendly societies and the spirit of self-help which they represent , and that they are impracti - cable .

		He believes that with a vigorous use of the poor-law machinery pauperism will continue to be reduced in amount , and that the energy of the la - boring population and their societies will gradually take care of the infirm and aged .

		But the grounds of a different conclusion are fairly stated .

		Unfor - tunately , the experiments on the Continent are too young to help us far toward a conclusion .

		Mr.
John Cummings	PERSON	has done a careful piece of work in his account of the poor-law methods in
New York	LOCATION	and
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		The systems adopted in the early history of those two states differed in important particulars in relation to the local and general authorities .

		This difference in principle reappears in the legislation of the newer states which have followed
New York	LOCATION	or
Massachusetts	LOCATION	in these matters .

		It was worth while to trace the de - velopment of both plans from the colonial period to the present time , and the author has done this with great care , drawing his information at first - hand from documents and original authorities .

		In the appendix the immigration and contract-labor laws are printed .

		The discussion of
Ernest von Halle	PERSON	on Trusts in the
United States	LOCATION	appeared first in the publications of the German '' Verein f iir Social-Politik , '' and his positions have already been examined .

		The pres - ent book is more than a translation of the original essay , and contains important additional material .

		We have a review of the earlier attitude toward mon - opolies in this country ; of the progress of trusts before the recent anti-trust legislation ; the various forms of organization , loose and amorphous associa - tions , formal contractual agreements , and combina - tions where all interests are connected in temporary or permanent pooling and concentrating arrange - ments ; the natural , quasi-natural and legal monop - olies , and the economic causes which call them into existence .

		The author believes that while protec - tive tariffs and advantageous bargains with rail - roads have affected the growth of trusts and pools , '' these are only two of the many points to be con - sidered , and not even the most prominent ones ... They may rightly be called capitalistic combina - tions . ''

		The chief motives which lead to these com - binations are larger and surer profits , while the desire for power and social position , in a country which does not particularly honor distinction in political or literary or scientific fields , is a strong incentive .

		Even in the absence of trusts , the small producer must often succumb to the larger indus - try , for in many lines the great capital can produce more cheaply than the small capital .

		The author does not spare criticism of the defects and abuses of trusts , and is specific in his charges against sev - eral of them , as the Standard Oil , Sugar , and Dis - tillery trusts .

		A chapter is devoted to the legisla - tion and judicial decisions on the subject , and an - other to public opinion in respect to combinations .

		In the appendix , valuable documents and a full biography are printed .

		The author does not at - tempt to foretell the future , but recommends that the present anti-trust legislation be repealed , because it has proved inefficient and leads to immorality in politics and to disrespect for law .

		His general attitude as to remedial measures is shown in this sentence : '' No author has conceived better the meaning of the corporation problem for the Com - monwealth than
Henry C. Adams	PERSON	.

		He asks for publicity , publication of the results and the ways in which they were reached , a control through public bodies , and a responsibility of the individual mem - ber of the administration of the corporation for the observance of the necessary restrictions . ''

		The papers read before the International Con - gress of Charities , Correction , and Philanthropy , were valuable contributions of specialists in various departments , and they are printed in several vol - umes .

		We have before us the discussions on `` The Care of Dependent , Neglected , and
Wayward Chil	ORGANIZATION	- dren '' and '' Sociology in Institutions of Learning . ''

		This part is particularly interesting and valuable to those whose benevolent work lies in the most hope - ful field of philanthropy , the care of the young .

		Mr.
Homer Folks	PERSON	, whose success in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	is so well known , contributes two papers on family life for dependent and wayward children .

		It would help to clear the atmosphere in
Illinois	LOCATION	if his judg - ment were followed , and our commonwealth would honor itself by asking him and Mr.
Birtwell	PERSON	to serve on a commission to draft a plan of state care of such children .

		No subject is of deeper concern for us just now , and if this book could be carefully studied in women 's clubs this winter it would assist in directing public opinion along the right path .

		The essays on instruction in social subjects show that colleges have made great advance of recent years , and that the stubborn conservatism of the theological schools begins to melt a little under the genial rays of modern humanitarianism .

		But much of the instruction is still desultory and fragment - ary .

		The truths hidden in the glad message , how - ever , will find a voice in due time , and men will draw the conclusions from the abstract principles which they teach .

		THE DIAL 335 HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		i .

		The approach of Christmas-tide again brings round the pleasant , if always rather perplexing , task of preparing a summary descriptive list of the new Holiday publications .

		As heretofore , the ear - lier arrivals are given priority of ` notice in our col - umns , the later ones being reserved for the issue of
December 16	DATE	.

		At the present writing the indica - tions are that this year , as last , publishers generally are well on the conservative side , both as to the amount and the costliness of their output ; the ten - dency being still in the direction of prettily-mounted and moderate-priced reprints of old favorites .

		And what better gift is there for any time or occasion than a tasteful copy of a good book ?

		The cum - brous , highly-ornate , and correspondingly expensive quartos and folios once so abundant on the
Christ	LOCATION	- mas counters are this season conspicuously wanting a fact due perhaps as much to sounder taste on the part of the public as to prudential considera - tions on that of the publishers .

		But while the Holi - day output is naturally rather smaller and more modest than in years of '' booming '' trade and as - sured returns , it is still large enough in all con - science , and attractive enough to make the '' em - barrassment of riches , '' as usual , an obstacle in the way of choice .

		We may add that our impression is that in no former season has the general average of taste in the production of this class of publica - tions been higher .

		By all odds the most sumptuous publication on our Holiday list is Messrs.
Harper	PERSON	&
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	' '' The
Abbey Shakespeare	PERSON	, '' in four volumes , large octavo ; being the comedies of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, richly illustrated by Mr.
Edwin A. Abbey	PERSON	.

		The text is that of the folio of
1623	DATE	, with patent errors cor - rected , and the spelling modernized .

		Connoisseurs of book-making may well linger over the material and pictorial charms of this exquisite work a really monumental one in point of luxurious equip - ment and artistic finish .

		The illustrations com - prise 131 superb full-page reproductions in photo - gravure of Mr.
Abbey	PERSON	's usually admirable drawings , which display throughout the artist 's characteristic lightness and daintiness of handling and fancy , as well as a minute and scholarly regard to historical accuracy in point of costumes and settings , and ac - cessories and '' properties '' in general , that will meet the approval of those who are nice in these incidental though considerable matters .

		Mr.
Ab	PERSON	- bey 's conceptions are pleasing as a whole , refined and graceful rather than striking , and never degen - erating into burlesque .

		Perhaps there is an occa - sional want of breadth and virility notably in his Falstaff -LRB- a marked departure , by the way , from the traditional ideal -RRB- , which certainly lacks the richness , the unctuous Rabelaisian humor , with which
Grtttz	PERSON	- ner , the delineator par excellence of Falstaff , has endowed the fat knight .

		But
Grtitzner	PERSON	, again , must have made strange work of the poet 's finer and daintier conceptions , the lovely women , and creat - ures of the fancy
Katherine	PERSON	,
Miranda	LOCATION	,
Anne Page	PERSON	, Titania and her train ; and here Mr.
Abbey	PERSON	's lighter pencil is at home .

		These beautiful volumes , how - ever , must be seen and examined to be appreciated .

		They are distinctly a credit to American book mak - ing ; and we congratulate artist and publishers on a work which this season may be , all in all , safely pronounced hors concours .

		Our
Holiday list of 1891	DATE	was headed by
Messrs. Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	's '' Elizabethan Songs , '' a , choice piece of book-making that the reader is not likely to have forgotten ; and this season no less hearty praise , for beauty , taste , and general attrac - tiveness , seems to us to belong to the same firm 's '' Victorian Songs , '' a companion volume to the above , and at all points a fit casket for the gems it contains .

		Mr.
Edmund H. Garrett	PERSON	is again the editor and illustrator , and Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	suc - ceeds the ubiquitous Mr.
Lang	PERSON	as writer of the In - troduction .

		The volume a comely octavo hand - somely printed on special hand-made paper , and chastely bound in white and gilt follows the form set by its predecessor .

		The pictorial and decorative features comprise twenty full-page photogravure plates , an ornamental title-page in red and black with etched portrait of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	, four vig - nette etchings for Introduction , table of contents , etc. , and some fifty dainty head and tail pieces from pen-and-ink drawings .

		Mr.
Garrett	PERSON	's designs are , as usual , graceful and pretty , rather than strong ; the bits of sea-view and landscape being notably good better , to our notion , than the figures .

		Space limits considered , the anthology is all that could be asked .

		Lightly skimming the long gamut of
Vic	PERSON	- torian song , from such master-singers as
Tennyson	LOCATION	,
Swinburne	PERSON	, and
Landor	ORGANIZATION	, down to such lesser names as Domett and
William Bell Scott	PERSON	, Mr.
Garrett	PERSON	fur - nishes , enough certainly to bear out Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	's rather high estimate of the lyrical achievement of the period .

		The latter 's Introduction is a thought - ful and conscientious piece of literary criticism , that adds decidedly to the value of a beautiful and well-conceived book , which is not far from our ideal of what , in a general way , a Holiday book should be .

		Mr.
Timothy Cole	PERSON	's masterly series of engravings after `` Old Dutch and Flemish Masters , '' which have for some time past formed the leading picto - rial feature of '' The Century Magazine , '' are com - bined in a handsome and enduring art-book -LRB- Cen - tury Co. -RRB- .

		There are thirty plates in all : five after
Rembrandt	ORGANIZATION	, three after
Hals	PERSON	, three after
Rubens	PERSON	, three after
Van Dyck	PERSON	, one each after Cuyp ,
Potter	PERSON	,
Hobbema	LOCATION	,
Ruisdael	PERSON	,
Steen	PERSON	,
Dou	PERSON	,
Ostade	PERSON	, and so on .

		Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's skill shows throughout the flawless work - manship , the delicate rendering of individualities of mind and handling , that make his earlier series after the Italian painters probably the best extant group of translations of those works .

		Fidelity to the originals has plainly been Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's ideal ; and it is interesting to note that to secure this he has availed himself , in an ingenious and perfectly 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, legitimate way , of photography .

		In each case he has prepared his engraving with the original paint - ing hefore him , the photograph being thrown upon the block and its errors and deficiencies corrected by constant comparison with the original .

		Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's fidelity to his models is not , however , merely mechanical .

		His work has been not only the pa - tient exercise of a refined handicraft , but a labor of love and artistic zeal , an effort to grasp and trans - fer the breath and finer spirit of the great works before him .

		While the plates in the present work as a whole necessarily fall short of Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's Ital - ian series in the ideal beauty and elevation of sen - timent peculiar to the genius of that school , their subjects are less familiar , and they offer exceptional advantages to actual students of art .

		In the mas - tery of pure technique the painters of
Holland	LOCATION	and
Flanders	ORGANIZATION	have rarely been approached , and never excelled .

		Except the engraver 's pithy and charac - teristic notes , the text of the present volume is fur - nished by Professor
John C. Van Dyke	PERSON	which is equivalent to saying that it is precisely the element of sound , serious , and scholarly criticism and appre - ciation needed to supplement Mr.
Cole	PERSON	's work and give it its full educative value .

		Besides the de - scriptive matter accompanying each engraving , Pro- fessor Van Dyke provides an Introduction of some fourteen pages , which is not only a brilliant piece of writing , but the best condensed critical and com - parative summary of Dutch Art that we can recall .

		Messrs.
George Bell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's '' Masterpieces of Great Artists '' -LRB- imported by
Macmillan	PERSON	-RRB- , uniform in make-up with their popular ''
Raphael	PERSON	's
Madon	PERSON	- nas '' of last year , is a rather sumptuous volume , the aim of which is to bring together trustworthy reproductions of representative mediaeval and re - naissance masterpieces .

		There are forty-two illus - trations , representing thirty-one painters ; and the reproductions have in each case been made from photographs of the originals , and not from copies or engravings .

		Eight of the plates are in pho - togravure , and the rest in half-tone , the former being excellent examples of the process , while two or three of the latter among them , unfortunately ,
Raibolini	ORGANIZATION	's -LRB-
Francia	LOCATION	's -RRB- fine
Pieta	LOCATION	, of the
London	LOCATION
National Gallery	ORGANIZATION	are slightly marred in the print - ing .

		The average , however , is high , and the sub - jects have been well chosen .

		Notably good plates are :
Holbein	PERSON	's '' The
Meier Madonna	PERSON	'' ; the superb `` Bacchus and Ariadne '' of Titian ;
Moroni	LOCATION	's '' Por - trait of a Tailor '' ; Rembrandt 's '' Portrait of an Old Woman '' ; and '' The Creation of Man , '' detail from the
Sistine Chapel	ORGANIZATION	frescoes .

		The text , com - prising a brief Introduction and a page or so of de - scription and comment with each illustration , is by Mrs.
Arthur Bell	PERSON	, better known to art readers by her pseudonym ,
N. D'Anvers	ORGANIZATION	.

		An acceptable addition to the literature of Na - poleonic times is `` The Romance of Prince Eugene '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in two octavo volumes , trans - lated from the French of
M. Albert Pulitzer	PERSON	, by Mrs.
B. M. Sherman	PERSON	.

		While the work is not a Holiday publication in the strict sense of that rather elastic term , its sumptuous setting and pictorial attractions make it a handsome and suitable gift - book .


Eugene Beauharnais	PERSON	was an estimable and amiable man , whose private and domestic virtues won additional lustre from their comparative rarity among his compeers ; and it is the graceful and ro - mantic side of his character , as reflected in his let - ters to his wife , the beautiful Princess Augusta of
Bavaria	LOCATION	, that is mainly brought to view in the pres - ent work . ''

		All the world loves a lover , '' and it is pleasant to note that these letters , written during the stirring scenes and anxieties of the Napoleonic epopee , and amid the trials and perils of the great campaigns in which the writer participated , are true love-letters to the end , one of the latest of them closing with the sentiment , '' Our mutual love is the only sure happiness that we can look forward to . ''

		The author has drawn a graphic and pleasing pic - ture of
Eugene	PERSON	, sketching his career in sufficient detail , and weaving into the narrative many strik - ing episodes of the times .

		The volumes are ele - gantly bound in sea-green cloth , stamped with em - blematic designs in crimson and gold ; and the text is well printed on excellent paper .

		There are twelve portraits , including Prince
Eugene	PERSON	, the
Princess Augusta	LOCATION	,
Josephine	PERSON	,
Hortense	PERSON	, Murat ,
Pauline	PERSON	and
Elise Bonaparte	PERSON	, Mme.
Bonaparte	PERSON	,
Eugene	PERSON	's chil - dren , and others .

		It is pretty difficult to tell whether the pictorial or the literary element of the large octavo volume '' Pictures of Rustic Landscape '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- is to be considered its leading feature and real raison d'etre .

		The former element consists of thirty full - page woodcuts after Mr.
Birket Foster	PERSON	; and the latter of as many passages in prose or verse , selected by Mr.
John Davidson	PERSON	, and possessing a correspond - ence more or less close -LRB- or remote -RRB- with the text .

		From either point of view the book is pleasing , and should find favor with those who love rural nature , its art and literature .

		Mr.
Davidson	PERSON	has made his selections with taste , and has managed to maintain in most cases a discernible degree of harmony be - tween plate and text .

		Among the writers repre - sented are
Walton	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Hazlitt	PERSON	,
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Taine	PERSON	,
Thompson	PERSON	,
Cowper	PERSON	,
Burroughs	LOCATION	, and Jef - feries .

		Oddly enough ,
Thoreau	PERSON	's name is missing .

		The engravings are acceptably done , and there is a good portrait of Mr.
Foster	PERSON	.

		At the head of the list of old favorites in new form is the '' Buckthorne '' edition of Irving 's '' Tales of a Traveller '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Little need be said in the way of general description of these two handsome volumes , which are gotten up in the style of the same publishers ' familiar '' Agapida , '' ''
Darro	PERSON	, '' and '' VonTwiller '' editions of '' The Conquest of Gran - ada , '' '' The
Alhambra	LOCATION	, '' and '' The Knickerbocker History of
New York	LOCATION	, '' respectively , of past sea - sons .

		The most striking decorative feature of the present work is , as before , the tinted border fram - ing the text on each page , the present design show - ing a delicate combination of silver-gray and pale
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 337 salmon .

		Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	is respon - sible for most of the ornamentation , including the rather florid cover-design ; while the twenty-five full-page illustrations are mainly from new draw - ings by Messrs.
F. S. Church	PERSON	,
Frederick Dielman	PERSON	,
J. Wilson	PERSON	,
Allan Barraud	PERSON	, and
H. Sandham	PERSON	.

		The artists have acquitted themselves well , and the work ranks with the best of the season 's publications .

		A very charming edition , in two trim 16mo vol - umes , of that sweet and genuine English classic ,
Gilbert White	PERSON	's '' Natural History of
Selborne	LOCATION	, '' is issued by
Messrs D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, printed from the text and with the new letters of the
Buckland	LOCATION	edition .

		The volumes are liberally and tastefully illustrated by Mr.
Clifton Johnson	PERSON	; and Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	has furnished an Introduction in which he draws a loving and sympathetic portrait of his author , and discusses the secret of the longevity and perennial charm of his work '' one of the few books , '' he avers , '' which I can return to and re-read every six or seven years . ''

		Let us add that the qualities which have kept White 's '
Selborne	LOCATION	'' fresh and sweet while so many learned treatises on its theme have sunk to their kindred dust , are the dominant ones in Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's own fragrant pages .

		A new two-volume edition of Mrs.
Jane G. Aus	PERSON	- tin 's popular historical novel , `` Standish of Stan - dish , '' that fastidious book-buyers will find hard to resist is issued by
Messrs. Houghton , Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Timeliness of theme and quiet elegance of make-up combine to make the work one of the most desir - able gift-books of the season .

		The pictorial feature is twenty full-page illustrations by Mr.
Frank T. Merrill	PERSON	, whom we heartily congratulate on the really high artistic quality of his work .

		There are few plates in this series that are not gems in their class graceful and spirited in conception , and sound in execution .

		It is a pleasure to welcome such refined and finished productions from the pen - cil of a native illustrator .

		Of Mrs.
Austin	PERSON	's popu - lar romance we need only say that it is at once pic - turesque and scholarly , presenting in the form most generally attractive a phase of our national life - story that is just now the subject of widespread and deserved , if somewhat belated , interest .

		Messrs.
Houghton	PERSON	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's new edition of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's '' Hiawatha '' is a model one for practical use , and luxurious enough withal to make it a suitable Holiday gift .

		The art feature is twenty - two full - page photographic plates from designs originally made by Mr.
Frederic Remington	PERSON	for the elaborate edition of the poem issued by the same firm five seasons ago , the plates being now considerably reduced .

		For practical purposes , the present handier and more modest form is much the better .

		Mr.
Remington	PERSON	's designs are , as usual , re - morselessly realistic too much so , we think , for their illustrative aim and poetical setting .

		Here , Mr.
Remington	PERSON	could probably furnish cogent ar - guments contra ; but we wish , nevertheless , he had thought fit to idealize , or '' Cooperize , '' his more uncompromisingly ugly '' bucks '' and '' squaws '' a little in the interests of sentiment .

		The volume contains a portrait of Mr.
Longfellow	PERSON	, from an orig - inal of
1840	DATE	, and there is an Introduction , together with ample notes .

		Very tasty and practical is
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's Christmas edition of
Longfellow	LOCATION	's `` The Courtship of Miles Standish , '' with many illustrations , full-page and vignette , after the de - signs of Messrs.
Boughton	PERSON	,
Merrill	ORGANIZATION	,
Reinhart	PERSON	,
Shap	PERSON	- leigh , and other well-known delineators of Puritan life .

		Besides an Introduction sketching the incep - tion and growth of the poem , as indicated in Mr.
Longfellow	PERSON	's journal and letters , there are copious historical notes , which , with the accompanying wood - cuts , will materially assist the reader 's comprehen - sion and enjoyment of this graceful Puritan pasto - ral .

		Bright , open type , pliant , lightly glazed paper , and a modestly decorative cover of maroon and gilt , make up a tempting ensemble .

		A new and revised edition of Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	's inimitable ''
Uncle Remus	PERSON	, '' with an added feature in the shape of a hundred and twelve vig - nettes from the whimsical pencil of Mr.
A. B. Frost	PERSON	, together with a frontispiece showing the aged fab - ulist pouring his marvels into the ear of the little boy , is attractively issued by
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Frost	PERSON	's conceptions of '' Brer Rabbit , '' '' Brer B'ar , '' etc. , are indescribably funny , plainly the one element needed to round out '' Uncle Re - mus '' and make it '' a joy forever . ''

		In addition to the fables , the book contains Songs and Sayings of ''
Uncle Remus	PERSON	, '' together with '' Plantation Revels '' and '' A Story of the War . ''

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	furnishes an Introduction which will interest those inclined to view the stories from the f olk-lorist 's standpoint .

		Mr.
Thomas Nelson Page	PERSON	's familiar tale of Old
Virginia	LOCATION	, `` Unc '
Edinburg	LOCATION	, '' is now issued by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons in a neatly appointed small - folio volume , similar to their editions of the same author 's `` Marse Chan '' and `` Meh Lady . ''

		The illustrator is Mr.
B. West Clinedinst	PERSON	, who shows a good appreciation of his author , and the due famil - iarity with '' Old Dominion '' types .

		Everyone who reads Mr. Page at all should read `` Unc ' Edin - burg , '' for it is decidedly one of the best things he has done and Mr.
Page	PERSON	is easily chief in his chosen literary province .

		Somehow these romantic little stories of his , which we take to be at bottom reminiscent of a past social phase more than half regretted by the author , leave an impression that if the war wiped out a great moral wrong and na - tional stain , it also did away with a good deal that was beautiful and picturesque in our somewhat pro- saic and uniform civilization .

		Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's tastefully ornate edi - tion of
Goldsmith	PERSON	's '' She
Stoops	PERSON	to Conquer , '' uni - form with the firm 's '' The Rivals , '' The School for Scandal , '' etc. , of former seasons , will doubtless find friends among seekers of pretty yet inexpensive gift-books .

		The illustrator this time is Mr.
F. C. Gordon	PERSON	, and he has done fairly well , though his 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, drawings generally are hardly up to the require - ments of the text in the qualities of verve and hu - mor .

		Two or three of the plates are not unworthy of Mr.
Abhey	PERSON	, while some of them are rather me - diocre .

		The book is showily bound in dark-green cloth with gold stamping , and the text is clearly printed on rather thick glazed paper , full gilt .

		A very inviting edition of
Charles Reade	PERSON	's fine novel , `` Christie Johnstone '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is likely to prove one of the season 's favorites .

		The story , it is needless to say , is one of
Reade	ORGANIZATION	's best capital as a story , and vivid and life-like as a pic - ture of a piquant phase of Scotch life and manners .


Walter Scott	PERSON	himself has scarcely done anything better in their way than one or two of the episodes
Christie	PERSON	's famous tongue-duel , for instance , with ill-starred
Beeny Listen	ORGANIZATION	.

		The plates in the volume are so good , for the most part , as to make the omis - sion of the artist 's name rather surprising ; and , altogether , print , paper , binding , and press-work , combine to make up a material ensemble worthy of the story .

		Eugene Sue 's ever-fascinating romance , '' The `` Wandering Jew , '' once more emerges in a new garb , this time in two generous 12uio volumes from the press of
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, whose neat and inexpensive editions of standard books we have often commended .

		The volumes contain eighteen full-page illustrations , including two frontispieces in photogravure .

		The original
Chapman & Hall	ORGANIZATION	version , probably the best , has been reprinted from new plates ; and , altogether , the edition , like other similar ventures of this firm 's , is all , and rather more , than might be expected for the price .

		Mr.
F. Marion Crawford	PERSON	's graphic papers on '' Constantinople , '' with twenty-eight illustrations by Mr.
E. L. Weeks	PERSON	, are reprinted in tempting style by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		The theme is a congenial one to Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's rather florid pen , and he makes the shifting panorama of the city of the Golden Horn pass vividly before us in its pris - matic contrasts and cosmopolitan variety .

		Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	's drawings , notably a fine study of an Ar - menian and a view of Galata bridge , are satisfac - tory , and bear out the glowing descriptions of the text .

		Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	inclines to take a very favor - able view of the Turk , that is , the real Turk , whom he styles '' a fine fellow , belonging to the superior and dominant races of the world ... He is sober ; he is clean ; and he is honest , even to his own disadvan - tage , being by no means a match for the wily Greeks and Armenians , who are perpetually fattening on his heart . ''

		The conception of the Turk as an injured innocent preyed on by Armenians is a novel , and , just now , a rather startling one .

		Perhaps Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	would regard this '' fine fellow 's '' recent performances as justifiable , if somewhat stern , re - prisals .

		Three new volumes in
The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	's tiny '' Thumb-Nail Series '' are : `` The Rivalries of Long and
Short Codiac	PERSON	, '' by
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	; A
Madeira Party	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Dr.
S. Weir Mitchell	PERSON	; and `` Notes of a Professional Exile , `` by
E. S. Nadal	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Edwards	PERSON	once more finds his theme and types among the hardy fisher-folk of the islands off the
Maine	LOCATION	coast , a region pleasantly exploited in his '' P'tit Matinic . ''

		Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	's book offers two heretofore unpublished sketches : the one from which the volume takes the title , and a bizarre story of the French Revolution entitled `` A Little More Burgundy . ''

		The plot of the latter tale is ingenious enough .

		A family of suspects hide themselves from the fury of the Jacobins in a wine-celler , the entrance to which is finally closed against them .

		The cellar commu - nicates with the catacombs ; and here the fugitives lose their way and wander about for days , emerging opportunely just as the arch-terrorist , or arch-scape - goat ,
Robespierre	LOCATION	, is overthrown and sent to '' sneeze in the sack '' -LRB- according to the odious slang of the day -RRB- by the Thermidorians .

		Dr.
Mitchell	PERSON	makes the most of his striking situation .

		Mr.
Nadal	PERSON	, who was for some time a secretary of legation at
London	LOCATION	, presents in his little book a sheaf of sketches of life and character as seen at an imaginary continental watering-place , together with some other interesting notes and memories .

		The papers are pleasantly written , crisp , chatty , and shrewd , brightened with a vein of unforced humor , and sprinkled with sketches of or comments on many people famous or notorious , from
Gladstone	PERSON	and
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, down to that eminent Bostonian , Mr.
John Sullivan	PERSON	.

		Each of the dainty trio of volumes is full gilt , bound in stamped leather , and furnished with a frontis - piece drawing and tinted title-page .

		The students of the Art School at
Birmingham	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, have exercised their talents to good pur - pose in the drawings and decorations of an art edi - tion of Mr.
S. Baring-Gould	PERSON	's '' Book of Nursery Songs and Rhymes '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The text , which contains most of the old nursery favorites , is framed in freely decorated pages , each having a heavy bor - der of conventional flowers and leaves in black-and - white .

		The plates are quaint pre-Raphaelite rep - resentations of the familiar nursery characters , ''
Jack Homer	PERSON	, '' for example , being drawn by the artist as a severe young man of the '' Bunthorne '' type , who looks heartily ashamed of his frivolous Christmas-pie propensities .

		The editor 's introduc - tion is a humorously-written but forcible defense of the '' nonsense theory '' of nursery rhymes , as op - posed to the archaeological theory so profoundly urged by certain laborious writers .

		The book will amuse and entertain all persons who have not out - grown the traditions and pleasures of their child - hood .

		Mr.
E. A. Vizetelly	PERSON	's English version of
M. Zola	PERSON	's `` A Love Episode '' -LRB- '' Une Page d ' Amour `` j is issued in a thick and rather cumbrous octavo volume by the
Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work is soberly mounted , and contains ninety-four passable wood-cuts after
M. E. Thevenot	PERSON	's designs .

		The romance shows , perhaps ,
M. Zola	PERSON	at his best , or at any rate at his highest and cleanliest ; and it proves pretty conclu - sively that his realism can cut below the surface ,

		THE DIAL 339 and is not , as commonly charged , confined to out - ward and visible things .

		The account of
Helene Grandchamp	PERSON	's struggle with passion , her fall and retribution , is profoundly pathetic , the story , as Mr.
Lang	PERSON	observed , of '' a good and pure woman upon whom the fate of her family falls , with the result that she loves a kind of Dr.
Brand Firmin	PERSON	, like the father of
Philip	LOCATION	in
Thackeray	DATE	's novel . ''

		In his preface , Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	prudently observes that '' whatever charges may be levelled against some of
M. Zola	PERSON	's works , nobody can say that this tale tends to corrupt and debase ; for it teaches the wholesome lesson that dereliction of duty , whatever its attendant ` extenuating circumstances , ' brings with it its own harrowing punishment . ''

		One won - ders what
M. Zola	PERSON	himself might say of this emi - nently British appreciation of an art-work .

		Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	's is the only authorized English version .

		A dainty , moderate - priced gift - book may be found in
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's
La Belle Nivernaise	ORGANIZATION	, and Other Stories , '' by
Alphonse Dau	PERSON	- det , a comely 16mo , with a cover of pale green with gilt side-stamp .

		Besides the opening story , there are five others : ''
Jarjaille	PERSON	's Visit to the Good God , '' '' The Fig and the Sluggard , '' '' My First Dress-Coat , '' '' Father Balaguere 's Christmas Feast , '' and '' The New Teacher . ''

		The text is liberally sprinkled with slight , though piquant and clever , pen-sketches which are decidedly better than the rather insipid full-page plates .

		In '' My First Dress - Coat , '' the author treats us to a pleasant bit of youthful autobiography .

		Of all
M. Daudet	PERSON	's short stories , '' La Belle Nivernaise '' is , to our notion , the most charming ; and , if one is to read it in En - glish , the present edition is preferable to any that we now recall .

		Mr.
Huntington Smith	PERSON	's rendering is satisfactory , barring an occasional tendency to put American slang into the mouth of
Pere Lou	LOCATION	- veau which is , after all , excusable enough , in view of the difficulty of getting a foreign equivalent for the good skipper 's queer argot .

		Lovers of droll pictures may find their account in the two large-quarto volumes entitled severally `` Chip 's Dogs '' and '' Chip 's Old Woodcuts '' -LRB-
R. H. Kussell & Son	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by the late Mr.
F. P. Bellew	PERSON	-LRB- `` Chip '' -RRB- , who will be pleasantly remembered by readers of '' Life . ''

		The first-named volume is es - pecially funny rather in Mr.
A. B. Frost	PERSON	's quaint vein ; and ought to suffice to expel the '' blues '' from anyone whose bump of humor is not , as the
Irish	LOCATION	- man expressed it , `` a dent . ''

		The books are neatly bound in strong boards , and printed on smooth plate paper .

		Dr.
William Dodd	PERSON	's '' Beauties of Shakespeare '' is an excellent anthology , and Messrs.
T. Y. Crow	PERSON	-
ell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have made a pretty handy-edition of it , in two trim 16mo volumes .

		Certain judicious ad - ditions have been made to the original illustrations , and the text has been carefully revised .

		The vol - umes are printed from new plates , and there are two frontispieces in photogravure a portrait of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and a
Stratford	LOCATION	view .

		BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		L The number of new Christmas books for children is so large this year that it seems as though the old ones must be crowded out by them .

		The imagination that goes to the making of such a collection might almost supply a modern school of fiction ; yet here it is scat - tered through some half a hundred volumes , frittering away its usefulness in impractical and impossible ex - travagances .

		Brought to bear thus upon childhood , it may stimulate the heroes and geniuses who shall in the future do the world 's great work ; but it seems more probable that it may crush them .

		Nevertheless , there are a few books that compensate for the general medi - ocrity , which was perhaps necessary to produce the others ; and no year can be called barren which brings to light a masterpiece like Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's `` Second Jungle Book '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Nothing could be of more ab - sorbing interest to children ; and yet so artistic a book should not be confined to them alone .

		When one en - counters work as original , as imaginative , as masterly as this , no words can convey an idea of the thing itself .

		Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	takes all nature for his province ; he seems as familiar with the flowers of the field as with the beasts of the jungle .

		And the truth of his statements is never doubted for an instant .

		His creatures are alive in every muscle , and they are not human beings mas - querading in hair and claws .

		They are beasts , with the instincts and desires of beasts , but with emotions enough like our own to make us shudder now and then .

		An imagination which can make such creatures live for us , which can give us a breathless interest in their suffer - ings and triumphs , seems beyond the human .

		From the superb description of the drought in the jungle , with which the book opens , to the last tale , in which the irreconcilable , eternal difference between man and beast is borne in upon us , the book is a series of magnificent pictures .

		It is never still , though , but the rush of its movement has a certain stately dignity which makes one respect the Law of the Jungle .

		Each story is in - troduced and ended with a little poem , and these rhyth - mical songs are the work of a true poet , one of the truest poets who is writing in English to-day .

		Cer - tainly no other could have conceived ''
Mowgli	ORGANIZATION	's Song against People , '' '' Child 's Song , '' and '' The Song of the Little Hunter . ''

		They cling in the mind , like the great fight with Red Dog in the Place of Death where lived the '' busy , furious Little People of the Rocks . ''

		There is a vivid directness about all these descriptions which brings them straight home .

		Aside from this , the most interesting work this year is done by Mr.
Joel Chandler Harris	PERSON	, Mr.
Theodore Roose	PERSON	- velt , Mr.
Edmondo de Amicis	PERSON	, Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	, Mr.
James Baldwin	PERSON	, Mr.
A. J. Church	PERSON	, and Mrs.
Catharine Yale	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	's book is a sequel to `` Little Mr.
Thim	PERSON	- blefinger and his Queer Country , '' and it is called '' Mr.
Rabbit	PERSON	at Home '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The illustrations , by Mr.
Oliver Herford	PERSON	, are almost as charming as the stories themselves , and that is saying much .

		The talk between
Buster John	PERSON	,
Sweetest Susan	PERSON	,
Drusilla	PERSON	, and Mr.
Rabbit	PERSON	is delightful , never heavy , and always stimulating one 's interest in the tale that follows .

		There is a sparkling gaiety about the book which few writers know how to attain , and it is worth any number of moral lectures .

		The imagination that evolved '' Uncle Remus '' is turned to good account in these brief stories , and they are as delightful as a keen wit , a light heart , and a whimsical fancy can make them Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	's style is some - 340 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, what more self-conscious , but it is good and honest nevertheless . ''

		The Garden Behind the Moon '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- is as fascinating as its title , and the drawings by the author are a potent factor in this result .

		There is a wise simplicity about the style which appeals to chil - dren of all ages . ''

		You may smile at this story if you choose , '' he says at the end , '' and call it all moonshine , but if you do not believe by this time that there is more in moonshine than the glimmer and the whiteness , why , I could not make you believe it if I were to write a hundred and twenty-seven great books instead of this short story . ''

		But Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's readers do not doubt it for a moment '' More Fairy Tales from the Arabian Nights '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- is a sumptuous volume , well printed and bound , , and illustrated with
J. D. Bat	PERSON	- ten 's beautiful decorative drawings .

		The text is that of
Galland	LOCATION	,
1821	DATE	, somewhat abridged and edited for the young by
E. Dixon	PERSON	; and it forms an excellent in - troduction to those immortal tales which have helped so long to keep the weary world young It was a haz - ardous experiment that
Anna M. Richards	PERSON	tried in '' A New Alice in the Old Wonderland '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , and it is not at all strange that it is a failure .

		Those who love the original
Alice	PERSON	will be glad to meet the familiar figures again , but they will be sorry , too , to find that they have somehow lost their old elusive charm .

		There is a good deal of cleverness in the book , but alas !

		so much less than went into the making of its prototype .

		And the nonsense verses have no music in them Mrs.
Yale	PERSON	's fairy-tales are of a different kind from any of these . ''

		Nim and Cum , and the Wonder-Head Stories '' -LRB-
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is as light and delicate and fanciful as a bit of
Dresden	LOCATION	china .

		The simple pretty allegory of the cloud story at the beginning is of a kind to de - light imaginative children ; and the tales which follow it seem to be borne out of the common practical world , and yet to be of it .

		They have the realities of life in them , but they are so deftly touched as to appear to belong to the realm of fancy .

		It is an artistic hand that has builded them .

		The stories in '' The Silver Fairy Book '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- are gathered from many sources .


Sarah Bernhardt	PERSON	writes one , and a sadly theatrical one it is ; Voltaire an - other , Hige ` sippe
Moreau	PERSON	a third , and others are drawn from the Spanish , German , and Servian .

		Naturally they are of different degrees of merit , but some of them are charming , delicately suggestive of large issues .

		The drawings by
H. R. Millar	PERSON	are perhaps the best thing about the book , though , so genuinely original and artis - tic are they .

		In Mr.
Millar	PERSON	's handling of black-and - white the influence of Vierge is agreeably evident .

		In ''
Chris	PERSON	and the Wonderful Lamp '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Al - bert
Stearns	PERSON	has written an amusing story of a young American who comes into possession of
Aladdin	ORGANIZATION	's lamp .

		The genie who appears unexpectedly proves himself thoroughly modern , and the services he performs for
Chris	PERSON	include taking his place in school and on the ball - field .

		He is clever enough , however , to outwit the boy at many points , and the manifold difficulties of the sit - uation are described with much humor .

		The book is well illustrated by
Reginald Birch	PERSON	and
E. B. Bensell	PERSON	There is some humor too in '' The Keeper of the Sala - mander 's Order '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , by
William Shattuck	PERSON	, but hardly enough to pay for making the acquaintance of the strange beasts and fishes and ogres that abound in its pages .

		It is a long and complicated story , and though it required some imagination to write it , it requires lit - tle to read it .

		The cuts are hopelessly inartistic .

		Mr.
J. Selwin Tait	PERSON	has written in a bright and graceful way of the extraordinary adventures of ''
Wayne	PERSON	and his Friends '' -LRB-
J. Selwin Tait & Sons	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The beginning of a mythical story makes the boy dream of the most un - usual deeds of prowess and daring .

		Ferocious beasts quail before this valiant knight , who passes among them unharmed because he is without fear It is delightful to find a real fairy-story like '' The Elf-Errant '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , one that has the atmosphere of fairy-land , its daintiness , its flower - like grace .

		Miss
O'Neill	PERSON	's style is as light as thistle-down , as exquisite as a hare - bell ; and she has the poetic instinct which alone can make fairy-land the place of all others for children to roam in .

		The little book is printed on excellent paper and is admirably illustrated by
W. E. F. Britten	PERSON	.

		It is a decided contrast to '' The Brownies Through the Union '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which Mr.
Palmer	PERSON	Cox shows once again a certain facility in the making of amusing little figures and sadly prosaic verses .

		The first Brownie book was clever , but the fifth is merely wearisome .

		Mr.
Cox	PERSON	's imagination was long ago exhausted , and he is trying to repeat a former success .

		It is a pity that these books have become so popular , for the verses con - tain few ideas and no rhythm .

		The set of
Banbury Cross	ORGANIZATION	books -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which comes in a green cloth case , will do children far more good , for they are written in excellent English and illustrated by artists .

		They are the familiar old stories , like ''
Jack	PERSON	the Giant-Killer , '' `` Bluebeard , '' and the `` Sleeping Beauty '' ; and the series is edited by
Grace Rhys	ORGANIZATION	, and illustrated by
R. Anning Bell	ORGANIZATION	and others .

		Mr.
S. Baring-Gould	PERSON	's '' Old English Fairy Tales '' -LRB-
Way & Williams	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- represents , we believe , the first attempt to gather and adapt to the reading of children a representative collection of the older English folk tales and traditionary stories .

		Of renderings and adaptations from foreign authors , such as the brothers
Grimm	PERSON	,
Andersen	LOCATION	,
Perault	LOCATION	, the
Countess D'Aulnoy	PERSON	, etc. , there has been no lack ; but the native springs have been strangely neglected .

		The volume differs from the recent kindred collections of Mr.
Joseph Jacobs	PERSON	, in that the author has gone mainly to the ancient sources , while Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	's stories are largely of modern origin .

		We may add that Mr.
Baring-Gould	PERSON	has suc - ceeded much better than his co-worker in talking down to the mental level of the little ones for whom his book is primarily written .

		Unless our memory deceives us on this point , it would take a very wise , child indeed to wrestle successfully with Mr.
Jacobs	PERSON	's diction .

		The volume is a tasteful and durable piece of book-making ; and the fanciful full-page drawings of Mr.
F. D. Bed	PERSON	- ford make it the more attractive .

		Study some government reports of Indian life , through '' the courtesy of the Librarian of the Smithsonian In - stitute '' -LRB- an organization , by the way , that never ex - isted -RRB- , then thumb the already badly worn '' standard works of
Schoolcraft	LOCATION	,
Copway	LOCATION	, and
Catlin	PERSON	. ''

		When you have done so you will know the Indian , and his psychol - ogy will be an open book before you .

		Then sit down , and , with '' S. , C. and C. '' as your mine of crude mate - rial , make up some Indian stories for children .

		Secure an artist , badly infected with some recent fad ideas , to draw a series of astonishingly draped Indian fairies .

		All this done , combine the stories and pictures into a book for infliction on helpless childhood .

		In doing this you will repeat Miss
Compton	PERSON	's labors in '' Snow Bird and the Water Tiger , and Other American Indian Tales '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		She has produced a pretty book , but one which can have no reason for existence . ''

		THE DIAL 341 What Indian ?

		Are Algonkin and
Moki	PERSON	tales the same thing ?

		Why introduce birch-bark canoes and tarantulas into the same bit of country ?

		Does nature show us any such curious combinations ?

		If Indian tales are good food for children , let us show the little readers that there are Indians and Indians .

		Any child who would enjoy
Miss Compton	ORGANIZATION	's stories would still more enjoy
Charles Godfrey Leland	PERSON	's '' Algonquin Legends of
New England	LOCATION	'' and
George Bird Grinnell	PERSON	's '' Pawnee Hero Tales '' and '' Blackfoot Lodge Tales '' so beautifully and naturally told .

		The Indian legend does not need '' writing down '' to a child , as Miss Compton seems to think ; told just as it stands , it pleases him .

		The abil - ity to express the Indian story aright comes not through the reading of government reports ; it is absorbed by him or her who lives day after day with the red man .

		Leland 's and
Grinnell	ORGANIZATION	's stories live and breathe :
Miss Compton	LOCATION	's scarcely gasp .

		It is a pity that the lady , who has really a dainty and pretty style , should have undertaken this task .

		It is impossible to classify ''
Cuore	PERSON	, an Italian School - boy 's Journal '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , by
Edmondo de Amicis	PERSON	.

		It stands alone , with no competition in the same field .

		And it has about it a wonderful serenity : this in spite of the adventurous episodes , which are by no means tame .

		Its influence makes for gentleness and courage , sympa - thy and unselfishness , loyalty and patriotism .

		The true democracy breathes through these pages ; boys of all classes are placed upon a stern equality , and the spirit of friendly helpfulness awakened .

		Their teacher is a fine type and vividly rendered .

		The style of the book would hardly be possible to a child , yet it is written with the simplicity of childhood , and an honest boyish - ness hangs about it .

		This new edition of Isabel F. Hap - good 's translation is illustrated by Italian artists but indifferently well `` The Child 's Garden of Song '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is also unclassifiable .

		It contains the words and music of thirty songs , which were selected and ar - ranged by
William L. Tomlins	PERSON	, whose wide experience in the training of children 's voices makes him an excel - lent judge .

		His reputation alone should sell the book , but it has another attraction in the pretty decorations by
Ella Ricketts	PERSON	.

		If the world were always beautiful , and children always good , and life always smooth for the virtuous and rough for the wicked , then '' Two Little Pilgrims ' Progress '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- would be a true story .

		But as things are arranged in this ungrateful old world , it would be hard to find the counterpart of Mrs.
Burnett	PERSON	's tale .

		Although her two pilgrims are but twelve years old and travel alone to the World 's Fair , they meet no difficulties whatever .

		They have no fear , they never get lost or confused , and find only courtesy and kind - ness .

		Indeed , they encounter a man who is so fascinated that he takes them about and adopts them without fur - ther parley .

		But that is not surprising , as two such proper children are not found twice in a lifetime .

		They are mentally proper , too , and they have exactly the right emotions at the right times .

		Their ideas assuredly are rather old for their years , and they express them in a manner that would be stilted at forty ; but neverthe - less sentimental mammas will probably gloat over these ancient children , and their offspring will feel guilty be - cause they find them dull .

		The fact that the '' City Beautiful '' appears in the book is its only charm .

		The group of instructive books is small this year , but it is worth all the great pile of stories of adventure put together , and there are many boys who will find it more entertaining .

		It contains , moreover , the book of the year , aside from Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's , which is an exception to every rule , the one volume which should be in the hands of every young American .

		The '' Hero Tales from American History '' -LRB- The
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are written by
Henry Cabot Lodge	ORGANIZATION	and
Theodore Roosevelt	PERSON	, and they are as exciting as one could desire .

		The preface de - clares that the object of the book is '' to tell in simple fashion the story of some Americans who showed that they knew how to live and how to die ; who proved their truth by their endeavor , and who joined to the stern and manly qualities which are essential to the well - being of a masterful race the virtues of gentleness , of patriotism , and of lofty adherence to an ideal . ''

		This the authors have done with a direct simplicity which brings the heroic deeds home to the reader with thrill - ing effect .

		The style is admirable , a thing that unfor - tunately can not be often said of books for the young ; and any boy who can read these tales without a quicken - ing of the pulses and an enrichment of character must be made of stone .

		In '' Turning Points in Successful Careers '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- the Rev.
William M. Thayer	PERSON	attempts to select the sin - gle moment in a man 's life which has decided its direc - tion .

		This is often an impossible task , so many ele - ments usually enter into a man 's choice of occupation .

		In some cases , therefore , Mr.
Thayer	PERSON	has exaggerated the importance of certain decisions ; and in others he has even perverted mistakes .

		This is true of the story of
Claflin	PERSON	the merchant , whose abandonment of Greek and Latin for business is certainly open to question from the point of view of wisdom .

		Neither was it a deci - sion which changed the current of his life , set inevita - bly in one direction .

		Still , in spite of a certain density of insight , the book gives useful accounts of the lives of eminent men .

		Much the same service is performed for women in Mrs.
Sarah Knowles Bolton	PERSON	's '' Famous Leaders among Women '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The selections are rather eccentric , but the biographies are written with vivacity and interlarded with stories .

		Mrs.
Bol	PERSON	- ton always tries to implant a moral , but her style is a little old for young readers and a little young for older ones .

		Two books by the Rev.
A. J. Church	PERSON	will be welcomed by all boys and girls who are familiar with his work .

		One of them , '' Roman Life in the Days of Cicero '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , contains a series of sketches the material for which is drawn largely from
Cicero	PERSON	's let - ters and speeches .

		They describe many things about the life of that time which the school histories always omit , things that lend reality and novelty and color to dry facts .

		Read in connection with the study of Ro - man history , it will not only be useful but eminently entertaining .

		Even more interesting perhaps are the '' Stories from Virgil '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by the same au - thor .

		The style in which they are told is capital , with enough quaintness to suggest the charm of the original and not too much to make it easy to read .

		Books of this kind are invaluable in familiarizing children with the old stories and giving them the desire in later life to read the great poets who narrate them .

		Mr.
James Baldwin	PERSON	has worked in a similar direction in his stories of `` Siegfried '' and of the `` Golden Age , '' and the familiar acquaintance with mythology and legend which is thus given to a child will be delightful to him all his life .

		If he misses this knowledge in childhood , then so easily imparted , he can never quite make up for the loss of it afterwards .

		In this year 's volume Mr.
Bald	PERSON	- win has developed an original idea , and novelty is a 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, quality unknown to most of the current books for the young . ''

		The Horse Fair '' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is held in the land of Morgan the fay , to which an American boy who loves horses is conducted by
Cheiron	LOCATION	.

		It was a horse show such as no other mortal has been permitted to look upon .

		The famous chargers of all ages of the world were gathered there , and the programme of events is enough to set the slowest blood to racing .

		The entries were numerous and included steeds as far separated in time and quality as
Pegasus	ORGANIZATION	,
Aurora	LOCATION	's high-jumpers ,
Bucephalus	LOCATION	,
Bayard	LOCATION	,
Rozinante	LOCATION	,
Ichabod Crane	PERSON	's Gun - powder , and the horses upon which the famous generals of the world rode to victory .

		The description of the fair is written with much skill , and awakens the inter - est of old and young .

		The boys have much the best of it this year in the matter of books .

		The stories of adventure by sea and land are far more numerous than any others , and no boy with longings to become a pirate or a highwayman need go unencouraged .

		In these romances the devices of such heroes in many ages and widely different coun - tries are described for his benefit , and he may choose whatever method of procedure pleases him best .

		Of course there are always nice little boys in these tales , who are captured , through no indiscretion of their own , by naughty marauders .

		But they suffer many hard - ships in their valiant efforts to avenge the wronged and punish the wicked ; and though they are always trium - phant in the end , their lot is not nearly so attractive as that of the pirate bold , who is ruler of men and master of the seas .

		After all , though , it is no unworthy object to cultivate the spirit of daring in the American youth .

		He is often too easily content with the commonplace realities of daily life , and it is well to stimulate his imagination and give him a glimpse of active life out - side of schools and offices .

		The best book of this kind among those just issued is ''
Jack Ballister	PERSON	's Fortunes , '' written and illustrated by
Howard Pyle	PERSON	-LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This narrates the history of an English youth of good family who was kidnapped in
1719	DATE	, and taken to the colony of
Virginia	LOCATION	, where he was sold as a servant .

		Dissatisfied with his position , he makes his escape , only to fall into the hands of the famous '' Blackboard , '' whose piratical raids along the coast were a terror to ship-owners .

		The story of his life with these seamen , his rescue of a beautiful damsel , and his final return to home and fortune , is told so well as to be full of intense interest .

		The fight especially is capital , and the entire book is helped much by Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's drawings , which are delightful .

		Mr.
G. A. Henty	PERSON	publishes his customary three books , and each one has the semi-historical foun - dation which he affects . ''

		Through Russian Snows '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- is a story of
Napoleon	PERSON	's retreat from Mos - cow ; A Knight of the White Cross '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- has the siege of Rhodes for its centre ; and `` The Tiger of Mysore '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- deals with the war with
Tippoo Saib	PERSON	.

		To any right-minded boy these subjects are cer - tainly alluring , and Mr.
Henty	PERSON	's skill in dealing with them is remarkable when one considers the rate of pro- duction .

		He has a fertile invention , a good direct style , and a knowledge of the kind of exciting incident that appeals to boys .

		With them these things can carry him far , even without genius .

		There is a pic - turesqueness , too , in the subjects he selects which gives the books an impetus .

		The fires and snows lend inter - ast to the retreat from
Moscow	LOCATION	, the battle for his faith egainst the terrible but fascinating barbarian to the white Knights of St.
John	PERSON	, and the terrors of Indian beasts and jungles and revolts to the war with
Tippoo Saib	PERSON	.

		Through each of these Mr.
Henty	PERSON	interests his readers in the fortunes of some particular hero , often a private in the ranks .

		Not so skilful are the authors of `` Through Forest and Plain '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- ,
Ashmore	PERSON	Rus - san and
Frederick Boyle	PERSON	.

		But they have woven an un - usual tale about the journey of a collector and two boys in search of a rare orchid .


Costa Rica	LOCATION	is the scene of their adventures , and much information about tropical plants and flowers is intertwined with the exciting epi - sodes .

		It is more concise than '' The Wizard King '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , in which Mr.
David Ker	PERSON	has told a story of the last Moslem invasion of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The title is the name applied to
Sobieski	LOCATION	by the Khan of Crim-Tartary ; and it would be impossible to chronicle here the hair - breadth escapes , the blood-curdling dangers , the inex - haustible gore which fill these closely-printed pages .

		They rather obscure the nobility of the great Pole 's character .

		In '' Chilhowee Boys in War Time '' -LRB- Crow - ell -RRB-
Sarah E. Morrison	PERSON	brings us back to our own coun - try and gives us some account of the War of
1812	DATE	.

		The book is stilted , though , and contains much indifferent dialect .

		Its English , even when it is meant to be pure , is of inferior quality , and entirely unworthy the perusal of impressionable children .

		Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons have brought out a new edition of Captain Mar - ryat 's '' Mr.
Midshipman	PERSON	Easy . ''

		It is well printed in one large volume and contains many illustrations by
R. F. Zogbaum	PERSON	.

		These are so well drawn as to be a de - cided help to the text , and boys will find them an effec - tive invitation to a closer acquaintance with this fam - ous hero .

		There are two books this year by Mr.
Kirk Munroe	PERSON	, whose name is familiar to the young .

		One , '' Snow-Shoes and Sledges '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , is a sequel to '' The Fur-Seal 's Tooth , '' and it carries the same char - acters through a series of dangers in
Alaska	LOCATION	.

		The boys , in whom one becomes interested , pass through them safely and succeed in outwitting their enemies . ''

		At War with
Pontiac	LOCATION	, or the Totem of the Bear '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by the same author , deals with the red - skins and has a plot that is even more thrilling than the last .

		It contains , too , a fascinating Indian maiden , who makes herself very attractive to the stalwart American hero .

		The story is well written , Mr.
Munroe	PERSON	being one of the successful makers of such books .

		Oliver Optic publishes another volume in his '' All-over-the - world '' series , this one being entitled '' Half Round the World , or Among the Uncivilized '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Ran - goon ,
Singapore	LOCATION	, and
Java	LOCATION	are a few of the places vis - ited by the floating colony in this volume , and the op - portunities for novel situations are therefore rich .

		To those of us who read
Oliver Optic	PERSON	as children he will always have a warm place in the memory .

		Napoleon has always been a heroic figure to the young , and they will welcome with enthusiasm a book which deals as happily with him as the one which
Elbridge S. Brooks	ORGANIZATION	has just written . ''

		A Boy of the
First Empire	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB-
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- has for its hero a little fellow who discloses to
Napoleon	PERSON	a plot against his life .

		The boy 's hearty sincerity commends him to the Emperor , who makes him a page in his household .

		His intimate personal service to the great man tests his strength of character repeatedly , but his courage and loyalty prove equal to the test .

		The story shows one the brilliancy of life at court , and later the excitement of the battlefield , and its hero is sent on many a deli - cate and dangerous mission .

		The style is good and the interest never flags .

		The characters too are something
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 343 better than lay figures , and Mr.
H. A. Ogden	PERSON	's illustra - tions are moderately good .

		A different war is the sub - ject of ``
Jack Alden	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Warren Lee Goss	PERSON	.

		He takes one through the
Virginia	LOCATION	compaigns of thirty years ago ; and in his preface he says that there is '' not a description of a battle or scene of the war in this story that is not true to history or to real army life . ''

		This is a valuable recommendation , espe - cially as the real life of a soldier was too exciting to need any imaginative embellishment .

		The hardships the men had to endure are not neglected , and we are even taken with the hero to
Libby Prison	ORGANIZATION	and escape with him .

		The materials are well handled and make a story which should awaken the dormant patriotism of everyone who reads it War is the subject , too , of Mr.
Edward King	PERSON	's Under the Red Flag '' -LRB-
Henry T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ; but in this case it is the most terrible kind of war , that of anarchy and destruction .

		The hor - rors of the
Paris	LOCATION	Commune in
1871	DATE	form the field for the development of this plot , and three American boys who are caught in the whirlpool have their fill of adven - ture .

		The few illustrations are much worse than none .

		The remaining books of adventure deal with other battles than those of war .

		Mr.
Herbert D. Ward	PERSON	has selected the Arctic regions for the scene of his conflict , which is but little more imaginative than many of these other tales .

		It is an o'ertrue tale of '' A Dash to the Pole '' -LRB-
Lovell , Coryell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , and the journey is made in an air-ship recently invented , but destined unfortu - nately for destruction .

		It served its purpose , how - ever , in carrying an adventurous party of men and boys to the
North Pole	LOCATION	and back again , and then through a sad mistake it escaped and sailed off into space .

		The narrative is told with much cleverness , even to the re - turn and the enforced concealment of the momentous discovery .

		Mr.
George Manville Fenn	PERSON	takes smug - gling for his material , and in '' Cormorant Crag '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- relates the history of two boys who be - came involved in its meshes .

		The book is rather pro- lix , but as the story is told mainly in dialogue , a child 's interest will not easily flag , especially as the boys are engaged in probing fascinating mysteries and making - exciting discoveries .

		Even more startling are the ad - ventures recorded in '' The Desert Ship , '' by Mr.
John Bloundelle-Burton	PERSON	-LRB-
Warne	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		This narrates the search for an old Spanish galleon , wrecked long years ago in the great American desert , when it was still a sea .

		The success of the expedition has something weird and un - canny about it that is not quite extinguished by the too practical description of the ship 's treasure .

		The story has all the elements of romance , and were it only more compact would be very successful . ''

		The Chain of Gold , or In Crannied Rocks '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is another variation , by Mr.
Standish O'Grady	PERSON	, in the pos - .

		sibilities of adventure .

		The '' wild west coast of Ire - land '' is his selection , and it surprises us to find that a new series of incidents can be concocted out of old ma - teriaj .

		The style , however , is decidedly dry .

		Mr.
Louis Pendleton	PERSON	carries one south to the great
Georgia	LOCATION	swamp in his story . ''

		In the Okefenokee '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- brings in the Rebellion again , but does not make it both centre and circumference .

		The illustrations , fortu - nately , are not numerous . ''

		Boris , the Bear-Hunter '' -LRB-
T. Nelson & Sons	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Fred	PERSON	.

		Whishaw , takes one to
Russia	LOCATION	in the time of Peter the Great . ''


Hugh Mel	PERSON	- ville 's Quest '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
F. M. Holmes	PERSON	, goes even further back , to the days of the Armada .

		Though in `` The Mammoth Hunters '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Willis Boyd Allen	PERSON	returns to the present time , he describes a curious hunt for the bones of prehistoric animals in far - away
Alaska	LOCATION	.

		The Indian race plays an important part in `` The Young Ranchers , or Fighting the Sioux '' -LRB-
Henry T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Edward S. Ellis	PERSON	; and also in '' Roger the Ranger '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a story of border life in which Eli/a
F. Pollard	PERSON	touches upon the conquest of French
Canada	LOCATION	by the British .

		The figures of
Montcalm	LOCATION	and
Wolfe	PERSON	are conspicuous in this tale , a fact that will recommend it to all lovers of that picturesque period
Canada	LOCATION	is also the subject of `` My Strange Rescue , and Other Stories '' -LRB-
Thomas Nelson & Sons	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
F. Macdonald Oxley	PERSON	; but it is the Can - ada of the present time and of Mr.
Oxley	PERSON	's lively im - agination .

		One of the most useful of this year 's books is the '' Popular History of Animals , for Young People '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- , by
Henry Scherren	PERSON	.

		Its object is '' to make or quicken interest in the observation of the habits of the lower animals '' and in the '' study of their relations to us and to each other . ''

		The volume contains many illus - trations , some of them colored , which assist in making it a valuable book of reference for the young , and one which older readers should by no means disdain .

		Like the last-named book , '' Country Pastimes for Boys '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by
P. Anderson Graham	PERSON	, will give the mod - ern youth some new resources .

		It is avowedly written rather for the solitary boy than for those who are sur - rounded by companions , and it contains many hints which he will find it pleasant to follow up .

		There is much about birds ' - nesting , an occupation which one does not like to see encouraged , and more about the train - ing of pets , feathered and otherwise .

		Another clever book is `` The Three Apprentices of Moon Street '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , translated from the French of Georges Mon - torguiel .

		The cuts , by
Louis	LOCATION	Le Reverend and
Paul Steck	PERSON	, are capital , and the tale is sprightly , happy-go - lucky , gaily written .

		One of the boys falls in with a travelling show , and acts the part of a wild untutored savage in it .

		It is amusing and of very light weight .

		Mr.
J. T. Trowbridge	PERSON	always winds up his books with wholesome morals , and in '' The Lottery Ticket '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- be relates the story of a boy who goes to the city to earn his fortune , falls into bad company , and becomes involved , unwittingly , in a dishonest transac - tion .

		His troubles , severe as they are , are finally over - come , but the warning is emphatic .

		Mr.
Maurice Thompson	PERSON	does not overburden his romance with ethics , but '' The Ocala Boy '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- is wholesome enough , nevertheless .

		Two Northern boys who are spending the winter in
Florida	LOCATION	are the centre of interest , and the au - thor contrives to give the narrative a certain charm of mystery .

		It is simple , though , and well-written .

		A new edition of '' Half a Dozen Boys , '' by
Anna Chapin Ray	PERSON	, is published by
Messrs. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a pleasant story of harmless mischief , and the boys are very much alive , which accounts for the republicatiou after five years .

		A little book called '' The Nimble Dollar , with Other Stories '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the work of an artist .

		The little tale called '' The Reward of Heroes '' would alone prove the author , Mr.
Charles Miner Thompson	PERSON	, worthy of that title .

		There is a good deal of realism in the stories , which does not mean that they have no touches of romance .

		They are lively tales , which will do much more good than the sentimentalities that are too often offered . ''

		The Impostor , '' by Mr.
Charles Remington Talbot	PERSON	-LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a college story , in which athletics form the most conspicuous feature .

		Messrs.

Boston	LOCATION	on the twenty-seventh of
November	DATE	, at the age of seventy - three .

		For nearly half a century he has occupied a prominent position in the Unitarian church , and was well known as a writer upon religious and literary sub - jects .

		Really good editions of ''
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	'' and ''
Uncle Tom	PERSON	's Cabin '' for
fifty cents	MONEY	each seem an almost incredible achievement in bookmaking , yet this is what is promised by
Messrs. Houghton	ORGANIZATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in the
December	DATE	issues of the excellent '' Riverside Literature Series . ''

		Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	's new volume of essays on `` Nineteenth Century Literature '' will be published immediately by

		The plates of General Grant 's '' Memoirs '' have come into possession of the
Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and the work is re - issued in a handsome two-volume edition , with new por - traits , maps , notes , and index .

		The edition is nearly uniform with the Century `` Life of Lincoln , '' and is well worthy to stand beside it .

		A new edition of the ''

		It is expected that the book will be a contribution to the knowledge of organic evolution , as well as to the betterment of garden-craft . ''

		Othello '' is the latest addition to the '' Temple ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		If imitation be the sincerest form of flat - tery ,
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	must think well of the form of this work , for they have taken it as a model in their twenty-three-volume reissue of
Tennyson	LOCATION	, now in course of publication , and in '' The Modern Reader 's Bible , '' of which The Proverbs , '' edited by Mr.
R. G. Moulton	PERSON	, is the first volume to appear .

		The new `` Cyclopedia of Architecture in

Greece	LOCATION	, and the
Levant	PERSON	, '' to be issued by Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons in a style uniform with their '' Cyclopaedia of Painters and Painting '' and ''

		The volume will be a quarto , with twelve full - page plates and over 250 text illustrations .

		Baron
John Byrne Leicester Warren de Tabley	PERSON	, who died on the 24th of
November	DATE	, had reached the age of sixty years .

		It is only of late that he has become gen - erally known among the English poets , but the two volumes of his verse recently published have given him a wide reputation .

		Among the English poets who have survived
Tennyson	PERSON	, he must be reckoned as one of the ten or twelve who have stood next to Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	and Mr.
Morris	PERSON	.

		An afternoon of authors ' readings was given at one of the

Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	, the son of Alexander the Great , died on the twenty - seventh of

		MRS.
LATIMER	PERSON	'S HISTORIES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY .

		The popularity of these histories and the confidence of the public in them are due to the fact that they contain just that recent history that is so hard to find anywhere in con - densed form .

		Following the three histories that have ap - peared during the past three years , Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	has added a fourth , in which she gives in her attractive and trust - worthy way the full story of European exploration , discov - ery , conquest , and adventure in
Africa	LOCATION	.

		The new volume is entitled : EUROPE IN
AFRICA	LOCATION	IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY .

		By
ELIZABETH WORMELEY LATIMER	PERSON	, author of ``
France	LOCATION	in the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' etc. .

		Beautifully illustrated with twenty-three full-page half-tone Portraits .

		8vo , 456 pages ,
$ 2.50	MONEY	.

		It comes filled with fascinating historical gossip on matters , some of which are so recent that they seem almost like cur - rent news .

		The
New York Independent	ORGANIZATION	, in speaking of Mrs.
Latimer	PERSON	's histories , says : `` In her the qualities which lead to just comparisons seem to be largely developed .

		She possesses in an eminent degree the power of calling up the past and setting it side by side with the present . ''

		The
Chicago Inter Ocean	ORGANIZATION	says : '' The great world outside is now to hear a great deal more of
Africa	LOCATION	than ever before , and such a book is timely and abounding in valuable facts . ''

Mediterranean	LOCATION	coasts have played the most important part in the history of advancing civilization .


Greece	LOCATION	has bequeathed to us her precious legacy of art and poetry , Home has given us her grand representatives of patriotism and statecraft ,
Egypt	LOCATION	has filled our souls with thrills of awe and wonderment , the Holy Land has inspired us with lofty sentiments and relig - ious fervor .

		All along the blue
Mediterranean Sea	LOCATION	we find the indelible imprints of man 's past , the glo - rious monuments of antiquity .

		The whole scenery of ancient history unrolls before our eyes , not in artistic reproduction , but in all its realistic grandeur and glory .

		The memories of such a trip , the sights of the scenery of the most remarkable events of man 's history , will remain for a lifetime in the soul of every beholder .

		_ THE SECOND CRUISE will be by the Twin -
Screw Express Steamer COLUMBIA	ORGANIZATION	, Cap - tain Vogelgesang , sailing from
New York	LOCATION
January 25 , 1896	DATE	, to the WEST INDIES and the SPANISH MAIN .

		The Itinerary will be : From
New York	LOCATION	and Old Point Comfort to Port au Prince -LRB-
Hayti	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
May	DATE	- aguez -LRB- Porto Rico -RRB- ,
St. Thomas	LOCATION	,
St. Kitts	LOCATION	,
Antigua	LOCATION	,
Guadeloupe	LOCATION	,
Martinique	LOCATION	,
St. Lucia	LOCATION	,
Barbados	LOCATION	,
Trinidad	LOCATION	, La Guayra -LRB- for
Caracas	LOCATION	-RRB- and Puerto Cabello -LRB-
Venezuela	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Kingston	LOCATION	-LRB-
Jamaica	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Havana	LOCATION	, Key West , Old Point Comfort , and
New York	LOCATION	.

		This tour lasts about four and a half weeks , and offers American tourists a most attractive and com - fortable means of escaping the bitter blasts of our rigorous Northern winters .

		A glance at the itinerary suggests at once tales of romance and adventure , recalling many a famous exploit of dead-and-gone worthies .

		But it also presents to the mind a vista of smooth seas and lovely palm-covered beaches , of beautiful scenery and strange peoples , offering an ever-varying and inexhaustible fund of novelty to divert the mind and charm the senses .

		In cruising from port to port in these en - chanted seas , among verdant and flower-clothed islands , nature is seen in her brightest and most beautiful mood , and life in the tropics at its best .

		It would be difficult , indeed , to imagine any attribute of an ideal winter resort not found among these '' Fortunate Isles . ''

		CABLE CONNECTION WITH ALL PORTS TOUCHED ON THIS CRUISE .

		TIME AT EACH PORT IS AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO VISIT ALL PLACES OF INTEREST .

		For further particulars , descriptive pamphlet , rates , etc. , address HAMBURG-AMERICAN LINE .

		When he is quite at his best ,
Crawford	PERSON	is worthy of comparison with writers of the past whose names are held in reverence , and in these chapters , hi fact nearly all through the first part of his new story , he is quite at his best .

		Character after character is made to stand forth vividly , to move and breathe , with scarcely a seeming effort at description of traits or moods ; wit and humor have free play , and the passions of love and hate , the devotion of the religieuse , the superstition of the ignorant , the self-sufficiency of lusty youth are denoted with satisfying art .

		LITERARY NOTES 397 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 398 THE AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOL .

		The interesting series of papers upon '' The Public Schools of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' prepared for ''
Harper	PERSON	's Weekly '' by Mr.
F. W. Hewes	PERSON	, has just been made to include a discussion of '' High Schools , '' which presents a large num - ber of interesting facts , scientifically marshalled , and illustrated by graphic tabulations .

		High schools are for the most part confined to the cities or large towns , and their students num - ber about twelve per cent , of the city school attendance , or about two per cent , of the total school attendance of the country .

		In this esti - mate , private institutions of high-school grade are included .

		The subject is considered under the six heads of distribution , coeducation , enrol - ment , studies pursued , sex in study , and grad - uation .

		Throughout the study , use is made of 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, the division of our schools into five groups
North Atlantic	LOCATION	,
South Atlantic	LOCATION	,
North Central	ORGANIZATION	, South Central , and Western employed by the
National Commissioner of Education	ORGANIZATION	in his statistical summaries of educational work .

		The facts relating to distribution are easily disposed of .

		Taking the country as a whole , there are 58 high - school students for every thousand of population .

		The numbers for the five grand divisions are 69 , 39 , 67 , 38 , and 59 , taking the divisions in the order above named .

		If we include the preparatory departments of the colleges , our numbers become 71 , 43 , 76 , 47 , and 71 , respectively , while for the whole country the number 58 is raised to 65 .

		In other words , the two Northern divisions make nearly twice as good a showing as the two Southern ones , while the West nearly repre - sents the general average of the whole .

		The figures upon coeducation and enrolment reveal the interesting fact that our public high schools in all sections of the country are attended by about fifty per cent , more girls than boys , while in the private schools of similar rank , the bal - ance of the sexes is nearly equal , inclining slightly to the male side of the scale .

		In the two
Atlantic	LOCATION	divisions , particularly , many more boys than girls are enrolled in the private acad - emies .

		Roughly speaking , we may also say that the public schools outnumber in their attendance the private schools by more than two to one , while four-fifths of all the high - school students in the country are .

		found in the two Northern divisions .

		It is interesting to note , moreover , that two-thirds of the high - school work of the South is carried on by pri - vate enterprise .

		The statistics of '' studies pursued '' offer par - ticularly interesting results .

		The eight repre - sentative subjects selected for comparison stand in the following order : Algebra , Latin , phys - ics , geometry , German , French , chemistry , and Greek .

		Of course , the subjects that head this list occupy their respective places mainly by virtue of the fact that they are the subjects with which high-school courses usually begin .

		About three times as large a proportion of stu - dents pursue Greek and French in private schools as take these subjects in public institu - tions , while with the other subjects there is no marked disproportion , the balance inclining in favor of the public schools in most cases .

		The most instructive figures in this department are those relating to college preparatory work .

		About twelve per cent , of all our high-school students are fitting for college , and rather more than half the number are taking classical in - stead of scientific courses .

		But the full sig - nificance of the figures does not appear until we compare the West with the
East	LOCATION	, and the North with the South .

		In the two Southern divisions classics are to science in the ratio of eighteen to eight , while in the two Northern divisions they are represented by nearly equal percentages .

		It takes the West to redress in this respect the balance of the South , and in the
West	LOCATION	science is farther ahead of the classics than in the South the classics have the advantage over science .

		These facts are easily explicable .

		The South keeps to the fine old traditions of what the education of a gentleman should be ; the West has never had any such traditions to defend ; while the North has had to carry on a losing fight for the humanities against the forces that have become more and more aggressive and predominant in that com - mercial and manufacturing section .

		The diagram devoted to '' Sex in Study '' is the most complicated of them all , and offers some of the most startling contrasts .

		Greek , for example , we find to be studied by three times as many boys as girls , while more girls than boys study Latin .

		Twice as many girls as boys study French , while rather more boys than girls study German .

		More girls than boys study algebra and geometry , while physics and chemistry appeal about equally to both sexes .

		The statistics concerning graduation are not es - pecially significant , although it is an interesting fact that the
North Central	ORGANIZATION	division turns out more graduates than all four of the remaining divisions .

		This statistical showing , taken as a whole , is extremely interesting , and some of the more salient matters , as we have pointed them out , offer much food for reflection .

		That the American secondary school is a distinctive and valuable part of our public edu - cational system hardly needs to be urged at present , although in every large community there is a small but aggressive minority of per - sons who argue that such schools are an unjust burden to the tax-payer .

		The answer to this argument of course is that the existence of the public high school involves no question of prin - ciple .

		The only principle seriously brought into question by reputable thinkers is that of the justice of any system whatever of state - supported education .

		Mr.
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	, as we all know , and a small group of his fellow - extremists , claim that all education should be provided for by private enterprise .

		But the admission once made that state education is 1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 375 justifiable and the recalcitrants upon this sub - ject are really too few to be taken into account the question of how far the educational sys - tem should go is clearly one not of principle , but of expediency .

		Whether it cover a term of four years , or of sixteen , or of some inter - mediate number , is obviously a matter to be set - tled by compromise , to be determined by the resources of a given community , and the con - sensus of intelligent opinion .

		It may possibly be '' tyranny of the majority '' to make tax - payers provide for any system at all of public education , but there is no new '' tyranny '' in the determination to make the period one of ten or twelve years , rather than of six or eight .

		And no one , we think , who intelligently looks into the workings of the American high schools , can reasonably claim that a dollar of public funds expended upon them is less advantage - ously employed than a dollar expended upon the schools of lower grade .

		So far , indeed , is such expenditure from being subject to any law of diminishing returns as we go upward in the scale , that we are rather justified in claim - ing that the law which prevails is one of increas - ing returns , and that the higher the education we provide at public expense the better is the state rewarded for its outlay .

		i an abstract of which may be found in the Historische Jahrbucher -LRB- Vol .

		There has always been a tra - dition that the bull was granted .

		In Lord
Herbert	PERSON	of
Cherbury	ORGANIZATION	's '' History of
England	LOCATION	under
Henry VIII	PERSON	. ''

		the tenor of the decree , as it was supposed to be , is given , but any exact knowledge of the docu - ment has hitherto been impossible .

		The whole cor - respondence between
England	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	was car - ried on in cipher , and so apprehensive was
Clement	PERSON	VII .

		of its purport creeping out that he kept even the translation of the dispatches in his own hands .

		Under pressure from
Wolsey	LOCATION	, who was in turn forced by the king ,
Clement	PERSON	was prevailed upon to issue the bull of divorce , but on condition that it never be made public .

		Campeggio , the papal legate , read it in the presence of
Henry	LOCATION	and
Wolsey	PERSON	, but would not suffer it to pass out of his hand .

		Henry was furious , and
Wolsey	PERSON	's fate was sealed .

		Accord - ing to
Ehses	LOCATION	, the bull was burned some time between the 22d and
26th of May , 1529	DATE	.

		Later , when
Campeggio	PERSON	was about to leave
England	LOCATION	, at
Dover	LOCATION	,
Henry	PERSON	had the box containing his correspondence forced open and all his luggage searched ; but the document was never found .

		Undoubtedly the Pope , in his embarrassment , was simply serving the hour , and never intended the bull to be of legal force ; when he at last concluded a treaty with the em - peror , in Lord
Herbert	PERSON	's words , he '' could no longer , either with the safety of his person or dig - nity , favor our king ; so that what excuses soever -LRB- in the frequent dispatches he made about this time -RRB- were given to our king , yet were they little more than complement and evasion , till finally , de - claring himself more openly for the emperor , he sign 'd an advocation of the cause to himself . ''

		An absolute rendering of the bull is , of course , in this day , impossible ; Ehses has recovered so much as there is to be recovered , from a comparative study of the correspondence and the diplomatic history of the times .

		It is no serious omission in that Mr.
Han	PERSON	- some has not said that the bull was actually granted , but such a statement would have intensified the high interest that has always been attached to this great episode in English history .

		ENGLISH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I have just received the interesting little volume which results from the collection of the articles on En - glish in
American Universities	ORGANIZATION	published in THE DIAL .

		In the valuable Introduction , however , I find an infer - ence due I confess , to a want of categorical com - pleteness in my own contribution for the correction of which , as my article originally appeared in your col - umns , I must ask for a little of your valuable space .

		The passage runs : '' From
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	comes the vague report that ' English literature ' is required for entrance . ''

		I trust that it is not a fault , in which we are too peculiar at
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	, to suppose that the world is well acquainted with things which have always been perfectly well-known to us .

		Certain it is that it never occurred to me for a moment that it could be necessary to mention in my article the fact that
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	has demanded the
New England	LOCATION	requirement for admission to college in English for many , many years , almost , indeed , from the year in which the
New England	LOCATION	agreement was reached .

		Although we are , I acknowledge , still quite as far as
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	confesses herself to be from the '' elimination '' of '' the Freshman course in theme writ - ing , '' which happy immunity one of our most Western sisters enjoys , we demand a higher grade of standing for entrance in English than for entrance in any other subject , and accept no student , whatever his other equipment , who can not reasonably fulfil that demand .

Pennsylvania	LOCATION	,
Dec. 5 , 1895	DATE	.

		376 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, THE ARNOLD LETTERS .

		* It is pleasant to be able to premise of the long-awaited `` Letters of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, '' now before us , that they are altogether more likely to exceed than to fall short of the agree - able anticipations the reader will probably have formed of them .

		There are antecedent reasons enough , both of style and personality , why Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	should have excelled as a letter - writer ; and certainly no collection of recent years has surpassed the one he has left us in real biograph - ical value , or approached it in the distinctive merits and graces of epistolary writing .

		Per - haps the best summary of the letters that can be made is that they are -LRB- as their excellent editor , Mr.
G. W. E. Kussell	PERSON	, testifies -RRB- the writer himself , as the members of his family and his closer friends were permitted to know him ; and there can be no higher praise of them than this , especially in view of the fact that it was Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's express wish that he might not be made the subject of a biography .

		No formal life of him by a hand other than his own can approach these charming volumes as an intimate disclosure of the personal qualities which the reserve , or , as Mr.
Russell	PERSON	chooses to call it , the '' magnificent serenity , '' of Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's demeanor veiled from the general world .

		Essentially familiar and domestic , and written without a thought of their ever passing beyond the limits of the family circle , the let - ters discover a vein of sunny geniality and play - fulness , a sense of fun , a capacity for little pleasures , in fine , a large , free , simple , and kindly view of life and men , that will prove a pleasant revelation to the many who have learned to vaguely figure the writer as the some - what supercilious apostle of the cultus of '' cul - ture , '' the fastidious critic , the faultily faultless poet whose formal and studied excellences are for the few .

		In his '' Victorian Poets '' Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	speaks of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	as impart - ing to his readers a vague impression that he cares less for man in the concrete than for man in the abstract '' ; adding that '' while admiring his delineations of
Heine	LOCATION	, the De Guerins ,
Jou	PERSON	- bert , and other far-away saints or heroes , we feel that he possibly may overlook some pil - grim at his roadside-door . ''

		Now it is pre - cisely this general notion of Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	-LRB- which * THE LETTERS OF MATTHEW ARNOLD -LRB-
1848	DATE	-
1888	DATE	-RRB- .

		Col - lected and arranged by
George W. E. Knssell	PERSON	.

		In two volumes .

		JNew
York	LOCATION	:
Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		we venture to say is a pretty common one -RRB- , this current impression of his coldness and aloof - ness , that the letters tend to dispel , as the sun dispels a mist - wreath .

		They portray for us unmistakably , in a hundred frank , unconscious touches , the kindliest and gentlest of men , the tender father , the unfailing friend , the Good Samaritan who revelled in beneficence , and never more than when the object of it was a little child , a worn schoolmistress , or a strug - gling author .

		So far from overlooking '' the pilgrim at his roadside-door , ''
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, it is pleasant to learn , often '' taxed his ingen - uity to find words of encouragement and praise for the most immature and unpromising efforts . ''

		We shall point out here what seems a flaw in the temper of these usually gracious letters the '' rift in the lute '' that will possibly im - pair their harmony for many readers .

		There is no evading the unwelcome fact that they contain some harsh judgments of the people of this country , put in a way that savors more of prejudice than of reasoned opinion , and pro- nounced at a time when Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's experi - ence of us was , for any purposes of serious in - duction , absolutely nil .

		We find , for instance , the apostle and presumed exemplar of '' urban - ity , '' '' sweetness , '' '' open-mindedness , '' and other cardinal virtues of temper and criticism , long before his visit to this country , assuming that `` the really well-bred and well-trained American '' is '' a rara avis '' ; holding that the bulk of our people are `` not of fine enough clay to serve the higher purposes of civiliza - tion '' ; cordially agreeing with the `` French and Italians '' that the Americans are a '' na - tion mal elevee '' -LRB- '' such awful specimens as I was in the Coliseum with !

		'_' he feelingly adds -RRB- ; fearfully presaging a `` wave of more than American vulgarity , moral , intellectual , and social , preparing to break over us , '' and so on .

		It is to such conclusions as the fore - going that we may ascribe the principle pro- pounded in a letter to his mother in
1865	DATE	, that '' to be too much with Americans is like living with somebody who has all one 's own bad habits and tendencies '' without having , we are led to infer , any considerable amount of `` one 's own '' virtues and graces .

		It might have oc - curred to Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	here that time and liberal institutions may well have developed in the American people certain good '' habits and tendencies '' which go to make their contact harmless and even salutary to a society com - posed of '' an upper class materialized , a mid - dle class vulgarized , and a lower class brutal -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 377 ized . ''

		Too much stress need not , of course , be laid on these little '' Briticisms '' of Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's ; although the fact that they are found in his private correspondence forces us to regard them as accurately indicating his opinion of us at that time .

		Let us rather endure them in the mild and forbearing spirit which enabled Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	himself to lay a .

		wreath of im - perishable laurel on the grave of that
Heinrich Heine	PERSON	who so bitterly satirized the English , and who died '' firmly persuaded that a blas - pheming Frenchman is a more agreeable spec - tacle in the sight of God , than a praying En - glishman . ''

		Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's visit to
America	LOCATION	in
1883	DATE	plainly gave him a more favorable opinion of us than the one he had formed a priori .

		The tone of his sprightly series of letters of that date is friendly enough toward this country , although the familiar note of '' a certain condescension in foreigners '' which so tried Mr.
Lowell	PERSON	is pretty clearly distinguishable .

		Once or twice , indeed , touched by the warmth of his reception , he seems almost on the point of thawing out as when , for instance , shortly after reaching
New York	LOCATION	, he tempers his complaints of the '' blaring publicity of the place , '' and of the re - viewers who `` render life terrible , '' etc. , by graciously adding : '' But the kindness and goodwill of everybody is wonderful , and I can - not but be grateful for it . ''

		A few random extracts from the American letters will serve to show their general tenor .

		Not a little amus - ing , and we may add surprising , are Mr. Ar - nold 's curt references to people who entertained him at their houses during his trip through the States ; and the reader will possibly compare these references with what a Frenchman , an American , or even a German , in Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's position , might have felt it gracious to say under the circumstances .

		Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's en - tertainers at one city , for example , are kindly described as '' a nice old couple called Clark '' ; at another they are merely '' some rich people called Shepard '' -LRB- one can not help thinking of his famous '' a native author called Roe '' -RRB- .

		His impressions of
Chicago	LOCATION	seem rather fa - vorable on the whole , although we find him later , in a letter from
Quebec	LOCATION	, declaring that he would sooner be a poor priest in that ram - shackle , picturesque town , than '' a rich hog - merchant in
Chicago	LOCATION	'' !

		De gustibus non est disputandum .

		As to
St. Louis	LOCATION	, he holds that , by virtue of its being '' an old place and a mixed place , '' it escapes the profound
Gemein	PERSON	- heit -LRB- commonness , vulgarity -RRB- of the ordinary American city ; while
Philadelphia	LOCATION	he con - cludes to be '' the most attractive city I have seen over here .

		I prefer it to
Boston	LOCATION	. ''

		In a
New York	LOCATION	letter Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	expresses much gratification at '' the way in which the people , far lower down than with us , live with some - thing of the life and enjoyments of the culti - vated classes . ''

		He adds : '' The young master of the hotel asked to present his steward to me , as a recompense to him for his beautiful arrangement of palms , fruit , and flowers in the great hall .

		The German boys who wait in the hair-cutting room and the clerks at the photographer 's express their delight at seeing ' a great English poet , ' and ask me to write in their autograph books , which they always have ready . ''

		The great thorn in Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's side , dur - ing his American tour , was , of course , the newspapers '' the worst and most disquieting things here , '' he feelingly says .

		One ambitious scribe , with a turn for metaphor , pleasantly likened him -LRB- as he stooped over now and then , on the rostrum , to refer to his notes -RRB- to '' an elderly bird pecking at grapes on a trellis '' ; while the
Chicago	LOCATION	paper 's portrait of him '' He has harsh features , supercilious manners , parts his hair down the middle , wears a single eye-glass and ill-fitting clothes '' is historical .

		Some interesting views as to educational mat - ters in
America	LOCATION	are outlined in a letter -LRB- 1886 -RRB- to Professor
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	: '' ... I read the account of your meeting ; the speeches were good , but I am doubtful about your petty academies , just as I am more than doubtful about your pullulating colleges and universities .

		Das Gemeine is the American danger , and a few and good secondary schools and universities , setting a high standard , are what you seem to me to want , rather than a multitude of institutions which their promoters delude themselves by taking seriously , but which no serious person can so take . ''

		Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	's occasional rather peevish out - spokenness is not wholly confined to
Ameri	LOCATION	- cans , there being sundry sharp little references in the Letters , of a quite Carlylean flavor , to his English literary brethren , which are much out of harmony with his usual gentleness and serenity .

		Of '' Modern Painters '' and its au - thor , he says , for instance : '' Full of excellent aperqus , as usual , but the man and character too febrile , irritable , and weak to possess the ordo concatenioque veri '' Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	he inexplicably regards -LRB- 1858 -RRB- as `` hopelessly confirmed in her aberration from health , na - ture , beauty , and truth '' ; the luckless Profes - sor
Blackie	PERSON	is put down as '' an esprit as con - fused and hoity toity as possible , and as capable of translating Homer as of making the Apollo 378 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Belvedere '' ; while the author of ''
Laus	PERSON	Ven - eris '' figures as '' a sort of pseudo-Shelley called Swinburne '' a characterization that will be relished by not a few victims of Mr.
Swin	PERSON	- burne 's own caustic pen .

		More temperate in statement , though scarcely less surprising in judgment , is this reference to
Tennyson	PERSON	-LRB- 1864 -RRB- : '' I do not think
Tennyson	PERSON	a great and powerful spirit in any line as
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	was in the line of modern thought ,
Byron	PERSON	even in that of passion ,
Wordsworth	PERSON	in that of contemplation ; and unless a poet , especially a poet at this time of day , is that , my interest in him is only slight , and my conviction that he will not stand high is firm . ''

		In a letter of
1869	DATE	, Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	makes a frank critical estimate of his own poetical work as compared with that of his two great English contemporaries , which is doubly interesting in view of the prediction already made by influ - ential critics in
England	LOCATION	, that of the three poets Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	is destined to rank the highest in the not remote future .

		M My poems represent , on the whole , the main move - ment of mind of the
last quarter	DATE	of a century , and thus they will probably have their day as people become con - scious to themselves of what that movement of mind is , and interested in the literary productions that reflect it .

		It might be fairly urged that I have less poetical sentiment than
Tennyson	PERSON	, and less intellectual vigor and abundance than
Browning	PERSON	; yet , because I have per - haps more of a fusion of the two than either of them , and have more regularly applied that fusion to the main line of modern development , I am likely enough to have my turn , as they have had theirs . ''

		Writing to his sister , Mrs.
W. E. Forster	PERSON	, in
1859	DATE	, Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	draws another interesting personal comparison this time with M. Re - nan , whose line of endeavor bore a certain resemblance to his own : '' The difference is , perhaps , that he tends to incul - cate morality , in a high sense of the word , upon the French nation as what they most want , while I tend to inculcate intelligence , also in a high sense of the word , upon the English nation as what they most want ; but with respect both to morality and intelligence , I think we are singularly at one in our ideas , and also with re - spect both to the progress and the established religion of the present day ... Renan pushes the glorification of the Celts too far ; but there is a great deal of truth in what he says , and being on the same ground in my next lecture , in which I have to examine the origin of what is called the ' Romantic ' sentiment about women , which the Germans are quite fond of giving themselves the credit of originating , I read him with the more interest . ''

		The following lively account of his meeting -LRB- 1880 -RRB- with Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	, at the
Duchess of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	's , shows Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	in an unfamiliar vein : `` I went to the dinner because I wanted to have spoken once in my life to
Newman	PERSON	, and because I wanted to see the house .

		The house was not so fine as I ex - pected .


Newman	PERSON	was in costume not full Cardinal 's costume , but a sort of vest with gold about it and the red cap ; he was in state at one end of the room , with the
Duke of Norfolk	ORGANIZATION	on one side of him and a chap - lain on the other , and people filed before him as before the Queen , dropping on their knees when they were presented and kissing his hand .

		It was the faithful who knelt in general , but then it was in general only the faithful who were presented .

		That old mountebank Lord * dropped on his knees , however , and mum - bled the Cardinal 's hand like a piece of cake .

		I only made a deferential bow , and
Newman	PERSON	took my hand in both of his and was charming . ''

		As we have already said , the bulk of the let - ters are family letters , forming together a f airly continuous record of the writer 's life from day to day .

		Cheery and buoyant as they generally are , one reads nevertheless between the lines no faint inkling of the writer 's consciousness of the hardship of a lot which condemned him to sacrifice the best that was in him to a long ; O round of ill-paid drudgery in an office which many a man of middling capacity might have filled as well , perhaps better .

		The relative scantiness of his poetic production is as easy as Gray 's is difficult to divine .

		He says -LRB- writ - ing to Mrs.
Forster	PERSON	-RRB- : '' To produce my best is no light matter with an exist - ence so hampered as mine is .

		People do not under - stand what a temptation there is , if you can not bear anything not very good , to transfer your operations to a region where form is everything .

		Perfection of a cer - tain kind may there be attained , or at least approached , without knocking yourself to pieces , but to attain or approach perfection in the region of thought and feel - ing , and to unite this with perfection of form , demands not merely an effort and a labor , but an actual tearing of one 's self to pieces , which one does not readily con - sent to unless one can devote one 's whole life to poetry .

		Wordsworth could give his whole life to it ,
Shelley	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	both could , and were besides driven by their demon to do so .

		Tennyson , a far inferior natural power to either of the three , can ; but of the moderns
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	is the only one , I think , of those who have had an exist - ence assujettie , who has thrown himself with a great re - sult into poetry . ''

		It remains to say that Mr.
Eussell	PERSON	's editing of these letters is satisfactory in the main helpful , careful , and commendably unobtrusive .

		The foot-notes are excellent , as is the brief in - troductory .

		The German words , of which Mr.
Arnold	PERSON	used a good many , are sometimes in - correctly printed , as , for example , '' Militar '' '' hubsch , '' ''
Konig	PERSON	'' and so on ; and it is to be sincerely hoped that subsequent editions of this charming and monumental work will be provided with what are very essential to its convenience and usefulness , a table of contents and an index .

		* Mr.
Henry Van Dyke	PERSON	, who is well known as a writer on
Tennyson	LOCATION	, gives us in his latest book a series of outdoor vacation studies , which he has entitled '' Little Rivers . ''

		Some of this material has appeared in '' Scribner 's
Maga	PERSON	- zine . ''

		The first essay contains general obser - vations and reflections somewhat after the man - ner of
Thoreau	LOCATION	, the chief of river-lovers .

		With
Thoreau	PERSON	, Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	thinks a river the most companionable object in nature , though he fails to note what was with
Thoreau	PERSON	the greatest attraction , namely , its '' liberating in - fluence . '' ''

		A river , '' says
Thoreau	PERSON	, '' is su - perior to a lake in its liberating influence .

		The '' lit - tle rivers '' of which our author tells us are various fishing-streams of the

Andrew	PERSON	's crosses clearly marked on his plump sides , and the iri - descent spots gleaming on his small , shapely head . ''

		The book is prefaced by a poetic prologue and closes with a poetic epilogue .

		It is illustrated with a number of passable drawings .

		Mr.
C. A. Stoddard	PERSON	, editor of the ''
New York	LOCATION	Observer , '' in '' Cruising among the Caribbees , '' gives an account of a midwinter excursion in the steamer '' Madiana '' to the Lesser Antilles .

		Short stops were made at a large number of islands , from
St. Thomas	LOCATION	to
Trinidad	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	met with no very striking adventures ; however , as a specimen of his style we quote a description of the
Trini	PERSON	- dad pitch lake : '' A vast black lake with multitudes of circles such as are made when a stone is thrown into water , gives a fair idea of the appearance from a little distance .

		When one comes to walk over the pitch , for it is solid enough to walk over , he finds deep pools and channels of water , and places where the pitch bubbles up with a yellowish scum and a sulphurous smell .

		If he stands long in one place after the sun is high , his feet sink gradually ; and horses and carts which load the material only remain a few moments in the same spot .

		When pieces of pitch are taken out , nature at once begins to repair the damage , and in twenty-four hours the hole is filled up again .

		We saw the process beginning in a dozen different places .

		Besides the curious sight of lit - tle islands of rich vegetation rising out of this black plain , there were here and there great pieces of wood sticking up endwise , having apparently come up through the pitch , for they had crowns of pitch on the end which rose two or three feet above the surface . ''

		The outlook for the
Caribbean	LOCATION	Islands Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	represents as very discouraging , ow - ing to the depression in the sugar trade .

		Some useful but mostly second-hand information is conveyed in a sober and straightforward style .

		But our excursionist necessarily records only hasty and rather superficial impressions and reflections , which , though perhaps serviceable for newspaper letters , seem scarcely worthy of book form .

		This volume is illustrated by cuts from photographs , but it lacks a map .

		Mr.
Francis Tiffany	PERSON	's book , This Goodly Frame the
Earth	LOCATION	, '' consists of brief notes of a round-the-world trip in the customary route .

		The author is , as we judge from internal evi - dence , a clergyman of truly catholic spirit and thoughtful mind .

		The book is too full of re - flection of a rather commonplace sort , though occasionally there is a suggestive remark , as this on the much-praised Japanese courtesy and superior civilization : '' After awhile , every man of frank , unconventional nature begins to hate this manner for its false , its shal - 380 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Till they get rid of their masks , they will never understand the social charm of the free play of joy , love , sorrow ! '

		... There is nothing behind the Japanese face politically , morally , intellectually , reverentially that can hold a moment 's comparison with that which is behind the faces of those who are free-born heirs of our complex , magnificent , historical past .

		Strange ignorance of this is it which has led so many travellers to attribute to the Japanese a depth of quality that in the nature of things , the order of evolu - tion , can in no way belong to them ; and until one sees into the simplicity and even the monotony albeit a ' monotony of endless variety , ' that is characteristic alike of their literature , their poetry , their architecture , their music , their politics , and even of their art , he will never read them with discrimination . ''

		This seems to us a truer statement than the panegyrics of Sir
Edwin Arnold	PERSON	or of Messrs.
Hearn	PERSON	and
Finck	PERSON	.

		The author 's account of his stay in
Japan	LOCATION	is , in fact , much the best part of the book .

		As an explorer of temples , he saw some odd scenes .

		Thus , '' in many of the Shinto temples , '' he says , '' the awful-looking war-gods ... are seen literally covered with innumerable spit-balls , thrown by devotees ... Thus have the worshippers signified that they mean business . ''

		Mr.
Tiffany	PERSON	's style is chatty , too profuse in allusion , and too staccato .

		While his book is of no high quality or importance , it may yet serve with some , especially those of the writer 's own profession , for an hour or two of pleasant desultory reading .

		Another American clergyman , the Rev.
J. M. Alexander	PERSON	, in '' The Islands of the
Pacific	LOCATION	, '' gives an account of Christian foreign mis - sions , with the avowed aim of promoting inter - est therein .

		The several chapters give a short description and history of the various groups and an account of missionary labors .

		The book seems to be a fairly reliable compilation , and of special interest to Sunday-schools and missionary societies .

		Mr.
Alexander	PERSON	takes an optimistic view of missions in the
South Seas	LOCATION	, and there they have undoubtedly been highly successful .

		Yet as the islands become less and less isolated from the general struggle of life , and more and more infected by the vicious ele - ments of our civilization , it is a grave question whether or not the native races of the
Pacific	LOCATION	have sufficient stamina to long survive .

		It seems one sad duty of Christianity to minister at the death-beds of races .

		This book is pro- vided with crude maps and an abundance of process cuts , some of them very interesting .

		Miss
Woolson	PERSON	's papers on
Mentone	LOCATION	,
Cairo	LOCATION	, and
Corfu	LOCATION	are reprinted , with some changes , from ''
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine . ''

		The one on Men - tone takes the form of a story of a party of travellers in which a professor , a Miss Tres - cott , and others figure who have varied ex - periences , and chat agreeably and brightly thereabout .

		Miss
Woolson	PERSON	shows her literary deftness in this slight narrative , in which bol - uses of sound information are often popped down our unsuspecting throats .

		But her re - markable feeling for style signally fails her when she makes the Professor say of the Corni ice-road : '' The genius of
Napoleon	LOCATION	, Miss Tres - cott , caused this wonderful road to
spring	DATE	from the bosom of the mighty rock . ''

		The accounts of
Cairo	LOCATION	and
Corfu	LOCATION	are straightforward descrip - tions , without the guise of a conversation among a party of travellers .

		That of
Corfu	LOCATION	and the
Ionian Sea	LOCATION	, being the least hackneyed subject , is perhaps the most interesting in the book .

		Corfu is for
Miss Woolson	PERSON	the isle of magical light and beauty : '' Although the voyage from
Brindisi	LOCATION	hardly occupies twelve hours , the atmosphere is utterly unlike that of
Italy	LOCATION	; there is no haze -LRB- which is not in the least a mist -RRB- , that soft veil which makes the mountains look as if they were covered with velvet .

		But a love of this softness need not , I hope , make us hate everything that is dif - ferent .


Greece	LOCATION	-LRB- and
Corfu	LOCATION	is a Greek island -RRB- seemed to me all light the lightest country in the world ... The mountains , the hills , the fields , are sometimes bathed in lilac .

		Then comes violet for the plains , while the mountains are rose that deepens into crimson .

		At other times , salmon , pink , and purple tinges are seen , and ochre , saffron , and cinnamon brown .

		This descrip - tion applies to the whole of
Greece	LOCATION	, but among the
Ionian Islands	LOCATION	the effect of the color is doubled by the wonderful tint of the surrounding sea .

		I promise not to mention this hue again ; hereafter it can be taken for granted , for it is always present ; but for this once I must say that you may imagine the bluest blue you know the sky , lapis lazuli , sapphires , the eyes of some children , the Bay of
Naples	LOCATION	and the
Ionian Sea	LOCATION	is bluer than any of these . ''

		While this volume can not add much to our knowledge or to Miss
Woolson	PERSON	's reputation , it is on the whole a readable and pleasant record .

		The book is illustrated with a large number of soft and pretty wood engravings .

		In Mr.
Alfred Parsons	PERSON	's book on
Japan	LOCATION	, we have an artist 's notes during a sketching and painting tour in the Land of the
Chrysanthe	LOCATION	- mum .


Japan	LOCATION	is a paradise for two classes of persons children and artists ; and Mr.
Par	PERSON	- sons , like all his predecessors , luxuriates in the quiet and simple beauty of Japanese art and life .

		He makes some interesting remarks on the nature of Japanese art : '' The Japanese treatment of landscape is not more - conventional than that of
Claude	PERSON	or
David Cox	PERSON	, or than the shorthand of our pencil-sketches , but it records its facts in a different way .

		The everlasting question in
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 381 art is the imitation of nature ; it has never been carried further in certain directions than by
Millais	PERSON	and his pre - Raphaelite brethren , or in others than by
Manet	ORGANIZATION	,
Monet	ORGANIZATION	, and other modern French , but no one can put in every - thing ; look at a simple bunch of leaves in sunlight against a wall , and think how long it would take to really imitate all their complexities of form , color , and light and shade ; some facts can only be given by ignor - ing others , and the question what is the important thing which must be insisted on is the personal affair of each individual artist in every country where art is unfet - tered and alive .

		But in Japanese , as in Byzantine and other
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	arts , this question is still decided by the practice of past generations , and it will take all the vi - tality of a strong man to infuse new life into it without destroying its many exquisite qualities .

		Perhaps when Japanese artists absorb its spirit instead of merely try - ing to imitate its methods , Western art may help in the direction of freedom ; at present I fear its influence has done more harm than good . ''

		In their appreciation of nature , and in their art , the Japanese are traditionalists , and so have little real life and force of individuality ; this , at least , is Mr.
Parsons	PERSON	's impression .

		But the bulk of his book has little substance , though it is written in an easy and , in general , accu - rate style .

		The many drawings by the author are the feature of the volume .

		The portrait of O
Kazu San	PERSON	is a most delightful bit of genre , though slightly marred in the press - work .

		The cuts on pages 73 and 91 also seem damaged by imperfect press-work .

		Mr.
E. L. Weeks	PERSON	is another painter-trav - eller who gives us by pen and pencil his im - pressions of Asiatic life , but in a region far to the west .

		Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	's route was from
Trebizond	LOCATION	on the Black Sea by caravan to
Bu	ORGANIZATION	- shire on the
Persian Gulf	LOCATION	, thence by steamer to
Kurrachee	PERSON	on the confines of
India	LOCATION	, and thence by rail through a large part of Hindos - tan .

		As far as Julfa in
Persia	LOCATION	he was accom - panied by Mr.
Theodore Child	PERSON	, who succumbed , near there , to an attack of typhoid fever .

		The first part of the journey is described under the form of a journal , the rest under topical heads , ''
Lahore	LOCATION	and the Punjaub , '' '' A Painter 's Im - pressions of Rajpootana , '' etc. .

		Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	often writes in an entertaining way , as we may illustrate by a selection from his description of a ride to Jodhpore on a little branch railway belonging to the Rajah : `` When we reached a village , or even a flag-house , with a collection of mud huts in the background , we made a lengthy halt , and when the engineer met an ac - quaintance we came to a standstill ; and on all occa - sions the gaunt , jackal-faced village dogs trotted along - side for miles , looking up wistfully for the chance bone or crust of bread , or they ran on ahead and barked at the engine .

		These capricious halts did not , as might be supposed , subject us to the risk of collision , since our train composed the company 's entire rolling stock .

		A dapper little
Thakor	PERSON	or princeling of some sort entered the other compartment of our carriage at one of the way stations , and his crowd of retainers got into third - class carriages some distance off .

		As he stepped out at every station to issue orders to his people , we had sev - eral opportunities of observing him .

		He was a fair type of the Jodhpore swell , young , with a budding mus - tache and hair brought down in a large glistening curl over each cheek .

		His small pink turban , dainty as a lady 's breakfast-cap , was cocked jauntily on one side , and he wore a caftan of striped and rainbow-tinted silk ; he kindled a fresh cigarette at each station , and his little air of insolent swagger was quite in harmony with the rakish set of his turban and his aggressive side - locks .

		... At one of these stations , where he sent a servant to look for a clean handkerchief among his lug - gage , the train had to wait until it was forthcoming . ''

		The accounts of Jodhpore and Bikanir , quite remote and little-visited points , are especially interesting .

		While Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	is a pilgrim in search of the beautiful , he does not neglect other aspects , but discourses very intelligently of things military , economic , and social .

		The book lacks what every well-regulated book of travels should have , a map .

		On the whole , Mr.
Weeks	PERSON	has given us a pleasant and instruc - tive volume both in letter-press and illustration .

		THE MIDDLE - AGE CONCEPTION or VIRGIL , .

		* The intelligent reader of the present day , as he becomes more thoroughly acquainted with the poems of
Virgil	PERSON	, and the facts of the poet 's life which have come down to us , is more and more impressed that he is dealing with a man who , were he permitted to recross the irremea - bilis unda , would fall naturally into his place as the congenial companion of the choicest spirits of the nineteenth century civilization .

		Even the fact that his development took place amid pre-Christian and pagan influences would make much less difference than we might at first sup - pose , since he was singularly free from the characteristic vices of paganism , and singularly near to the fundamental virtues of Christian civilization .

		L , pp .

		87-96 , 170-178 .

		382 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, sible at any former period subsequent to the Augustan age itself .

		That the long-continued gloom between these two outbursts of intellectual light should give rise to distorted visions of his life and charac - ter was inevitable .

		An occasional trace of these distortions appears in modern literature , as in
Scott	LOCATION	's note to the Lay of the
Last Minstrel	LOCATION	, II. , 17 , where the unquenchable lamp that burned in the tomb of
Michael Scott	PERSON	, the magi - cian , leads to the quotation of a story from the Virgilius of
John Doesborcke	PERSON	, according to which the poet has himself cut to pieces and pickled down in a barrel , in order to be reju - venated by the dripping from a magic lamp under which the barrel was placed .

		But no systematic collection of these stories existed until the publication , in
1872	DATE	, of the first Ital - ian edition of Compare tti 's
Virgilio nel Medio Evo	PERSON	, an English translation of which , from the proof-sheets of the second edition , is now be - fore us .

		In point of exhaustive research , Professor Comparetti seems to have left almost nothing whatever for any subsequent investigator to do .

		The work is divided into two parts , the first dealing with '' The Vergil of Literary Tradi - tion , '' and covering the period from the poet 's own time down to the age of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	.

		This goes , of course , beyond the apparent limits of the title ; but the reader will at once see the neces - sity for this in a work which aims to explain , as well as relate , the facts under consideration .

		It must be said , however , that in numerous portions of the book one finds page after page of matter so indirectly connected with
Virgil	PERSON	as fairly to raise the question whether the prom - inence of the poet 's name in the title is strictly justified .

		The most important thread running through this portion of the work is the inex - pugnable position of the Virgilian poems in the schools of Rhetoric and Grammar , which made it impossible that their author should be forgotten , however unable it might be to pre - vent misconceptions of his character .

		The stu - dent of
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, even more than the student of
Virgil	PERSON	, will find matter of interest and profit in the fourteenth and fifteenth chapters , wherein the connection between the two poets is so dis - cussed as clearly to display the wide range of
Comparetti	ORGANIZATION	's attainments in both the classical and the medieval fields .

		The second part treats of '' The Vergil of Popular Legend '' ; and the distinction between a popular and a literary tradition , running down through the ages in parallel but separate course , is a point which the author is careful to main - tain .

		It would be interesting to enter at length into the substance of these legends , but space will not permit .

		It is enough to say that the sensible , scholarly , and unassuming
Virgil	PERSON	of actual fact grew now into an inspired prophet of the advent of Christianity , and even an ac - tual preacher of its doctrines , in full detail ; now into the guardian of his country , building a temple with images which would indicate automatically the outbreak of war in any por - tion of the Empire ; now into the beneficent wonder-worker , able to construct a bronze horse which had the effect of preventing other horses from becoming sway-backed , a bronze fly which prevented other flies from entering the city of
Naples	LOCATION	, shambles upon which meat would re - tain its freshness , etc. , etc. ; now into a devotee of the Black Art , consorting with devils , learn - ing the secrets of their power and surpassing them in their own cunning ; and now into an amorous gallant , as far from the author of the ^ Eneid , in his relations with women , as one can easily imagine .

		The genesis of the ascription of magical power to
Virgil	LOCATION	, Comparetti traces to the folk - lore of the city of
Naples	LOCATION	, where the poet long maintained his residence , and near which he was buried .

		This view had been generally ac - cepted until the appearance of Mr.
J. S. Tuni	PERSON	- son 's `` Master
Virgil	PERSON	, `` the first editions of which are dated
1888	DATE	and
1890	DATE	, respectively .

		Mr.
Tunison	PERSON	, whose proneness to penetrate such byways of literature is a matter of tradition at his old college home , began the study of these legends before he was aware of
Comparetti	ORGANIZATION	's work , but availed himself thoroughly of what the latter had done before his own book was prepared for publication .

		He maintains that Comparetti has '' overdrawn the indebtedness of the literature of the twelfth century to
Nea	ORGANIZATION	- politan folk-lore '' ; that the absence of these legends from the lore of
Naples	LOCATION	to-day '' is the complement of the fact that they never had any vital relation to the people of that city '' ; that a literary rather than a popular origin is indicated by the fact that '' the various phases of the legends correspond respectively to the diverse phases of
Virgil	PERSON	's personality and learn - ing , as reflected in classical and post-classical criticism '' ; that there is no necessity for the presumption '' that the populace were ever any - thing but followers in the adaptation of magical fables to the fame of Virgil '' ; and finally the central point in his theory that the con - nection of these stories -LRB- in substance , of almost
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 383 world - wide circulation -RRB- with the name of Vir - gil was due '' to a disposition in writers and readers favorable to a specific mode of romance writing .

		A certain kind of incident was credi - ble , when related of a sorcerer .

		The romances which included this species of incident were popular .

		Therefore the romances were writ - ten , regardless of facts , and even in defiance of facts that were generally known . ''

		Connec - tion with famous names of antiquity naturally increased the popularity of such stories , and what name more obvious than that of the author of the .

		/ Eneid ?

		In harmony with the theory is the fact , not adequately accounted for by
Comparetti	ORGANIZATION	, that this attribution of magical power first appears not in Italian writers but in the
Norman Latinists	PERSON	of
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	, spreading into
Italy	LOCATION	last of all .

		In order to account for this latter fact
Comparetti	ORGANIZATION	is driven to attribute to the Italian writers of the time a less degree of the intellectual darkness of the Middle Ages than is perhaps their just due .

		Mr.
Tunison	PERSON	supports his position with ability , and the various legends fall naturally , under his treatment , into a classification based upon their relation to the salient points in the poet 's life and work .

		That Comparetti , in his new edi - tion , should take no further notice of this work than to stamp it in a footnote as '' crude and illogical reasoning '' speaks more loudly for his determination to stand by his own thesis than for his scientific spirit or his courtesy , and is the more inexcusable when we consider the repeated and emphatic praise which Mr.
Tuni	PERSON	- son has bestowed upon him .

		As to crudity , Professor
Crane	PERSON	-LRB- `` The Nation , '' No. 1228 -RRB- was putting it very mildly when he said that Mr.
Tunison	PERSON	's work was '' more attractive for the general reader in form and style '' than that of Comparetti .

		It may be added that the same authority credited Mr.
Tunison	PERSON	with doing his work `` so thoroughly as to leave little room for criticism or suggestion . ''

		In the matter of logic , too ,
Comparetti	ORGANIZATION	is open to attack at other points than those assailed by Mr.
Tuni	PERSON	- son .

		He repeatedly fails to distinguish between '' Christianity '' and various vagaries into which the organized Church of the Middle Ages was led by perversities of human nature having no fundamental connection with Christianity , and as wide-spread , both in geographical distribu - tion and in recorded history , as the human race : a fallacy from which
Tunison	ORGANIZATION	keeps him - self free , when dealing with the same subject - matter .

		Comparetti has a private right , of course , to his bias against Christianity , but in at least two cases he has dragged it unneces - sarily into this work ; once when he sees in the birth of Christ the advent of one who '' was to drive mankind so far back and down from the height of civilization which they had then attained , '' and again when he asserts that '' those who maintain that woman owes a deep debt of gratitude to Christianity ... main - tain what is contrary to the facts . ''

		Mr.
Tunison	PERSON	takes a more favorable view of the amount of knowledge which the Middle Ages possessed than does Comparetti . ''

		It is presumed , '' says he , '' that the reader knows the Middle Ages not to have been the time of ignorance described by the common run of writers since the so-called revival of learning .

		If he does not know this he will need to be told that , considered as literature , and not as a mere philological stalking-horse , the poems of Vir - gil were as widely read and as well understood in the twelfth century as they are to-day . ''

		For this assertion he was taken to task by the late Professor Sellar , in the '' Classical Review '' -LRB- JIL , 265 -RRB- , and this led him to the preparation of a paper published in two parts in the ''
Deni	PERSON	- son Quarterly '' under the caption of `` Virgil and the Twelfth Century Poets . ''

		In this pa - per the traces of a thorough literary acquaint - ance with
Virgil	PERSON	in the works of two represen - tative twelfth century poets ,
Joseph	PERSON	of
Exeter	LOCATION	and
Gunther	PERSON	, a German monk , are carefully followed out .

		But I have far transcended my limits , and must close with the wish that the '' almost mar - vellous celerity '' with which Professor
Robin	PERSON	- son
Ellis	PERSON	tells us that Mr.
Benecke	PERSON	translated
Comparetti	ORGANIZATION	's book had been held sufficiently in check to obviate such absurdities of expression as '' This was merely a tribute ... and are no indication , '' '' like Prudentius ... and so many other Christian poets did '' the repeated misplacing of the adverb only , etc. , etc. .

		The absence of any index is utterly inexcusable .

		We have seen no book in five years the full value of which was so absolutely dependent upon an exhaustive index as is the case with this .

		Has not the time arrived when reputable publishers should refuse to put their imprint upon such a book without an adequate index ?

		* `` Casa Braccio '' fills two volumes , but might easily have been compressed into one .

		Mr.
Craw	PERSON	- ford 's fatal habit of indulging in commonplace philo - sophical reflections , of insisting upon the obvious , has doubtless now become so confirmed that he is not likely to succeed in breaking loose from it .

		It is all done very neatly , to be sure , but with the neat - ness that somehow suggests the exasperating per - fection of a copy-book model .

		In this book , for the rest , Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	appears at his best .

		The one subject that he knows better than any other is that of the Roman life of a generation ago , and to this subject he returns in ''
Casa Braccio	PERSON	, '' handling it with the ease born of long practice and close famil - iarity .

		A more than usually pronounced tinge of melodrama marks the book at several critical junc - tures , and certainly adds nothing to its strength .

		The author employs the trick of using some of his stock characters over again , performing it so deftly that the impression is pleasant , and helps noticeably to sustain the illusion that we are living with him in a world of real men and women .

		In the pres - ent instance , our old friend
Paul Griggs	PERSON	plays an important role , and our newer acquaintance Crowdie is partly accounted for .

		When he makes one of his characters poison herself with '' hydrocyanide of potassium , '' Mr.
Crawford	PERSON	's usually accurate in - formation fails him for once . ''

		Casa Braccio '' is the author 's twenty - fifth novel , which is doing fairly well for a career of fifteen years .

		The personality of

Bagby	PERSON	's Weimar Idyl . ''

		To this the love affair of '' Miss Traumerei '' and her American tenor , the petty gossip of the natives , and the intrigues and jealousies of the music-students are subordinated , although they all play their part in the development of the story .

		The book , like nearly all musical novels , is over - emotional , and lacking in a nice sense of proportion .

		The oppressive sentimentality of its atmosphere , the effusive hero-worship of the little group clustered about the

		of weakness in a story which may , nevertheless , in - fect with some measure of its own contagious en - thusiasm the musically-minded reader .

		Perhaps it is well not to bear too hard upon defects that
spring	DATE	from exaggeration of reverence , seeing how greatly we need that quality in our literature as in our life .

		The title of the new novel by Mr.
Brander	PERSON	Mat - thews '' His Father 's Son '' almost tells its own story , so frequently does the moralist find occasion to note the degeneracy of our wealthy families in the second generation .

		We should say that if ever the great American novel gets to be written it is bound to give conspicuous embodiment to this dis - heartening fact .

		It matters little whether the for - tune of the parent has been honestly or dishonestly won , it proves a curse to the son in so many cases that the rule comes near to being established .

		The heedlessness of parents , coupled with the enervation of luxurious surroundings and the contagion of the associations that cluster about the possession of wealth in all but rare instances , make up a combina - tion of circumstances that comparatively few young men have the stamina to resist and to conquer .

		No ideal is more in need of inculcation in our Amer - ican society than the Goethean '' Was du ererbt von deinen Vatern hast , Erwirb es , um es zu besitzen , '' and no worthy ideal of conduct , it must be added , is less frequently sought after and attained .

		We can not help regretting that Mr.
Matthews	PERSON	should not have made more than he has of so great a theme .

		His typical case of moral disintegration is rapidly sketched from surface indications ; not from within , as it must be to become effective .

		In this treatment the dramatic bent of the author is appar - ent ; he may say that the psychology of the matter is to be understood , but in a novel we may rightly ask for a certain amount of explicit psychology .

		The addition of this element to the others so skil - fully compounded would certainly have added much to the force of the novel , and without more of it than is given us the awakening of vicious instincts in his hero is not adequately accounted for .

		As a study of the sinister side of Wall Street financier - ing , the book is a marked success ; its thrusts are keen , and its logic is convincing . ''

		The American in
Paris	LOCATION	'' may best be described as an anecdote history of the Franco-Prussian War , the siege of
Paris	LOCATION	, and the Commune , interspersed with numerous quotations from state papers and personal memoirs the whole treated in a style of sophomorical flamboyancy .

		The story , aside from this , is hardly worth mentioning , and any attempt to account rationally for the extraordinary conduct of the American hero is quite beyond our powers .

		The author , we suspect , is a jingo , and it is well - known that the jingo scorns the commonplace in - tellectual processes of ordinary mortals .

		So pre - tentious and badly-written a book has not often come into our clutches . ''

		Bunch-Grass Stories '' is as pretty a name as another , and in the case of Mrs.
Bates	PERSON	's collection
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 385 it serves as pretext for an exceptionally graceful cover design .

		We presume that bunch-grass is a characteristically Western product , for all but two of the eight stories are told of the
West the West	LOCATION	of the later settlements and '' seek to embody the spirit of the transition time . ''

		Mrs.
Bates	PERSON	, we may say at the outset , has been surprisingly successful in her task .

		She has known at first-hand the fron - tier life whereof she writes , and her tales bear out the statement that it was '' full of zest . ''

		More than once they suggest the similar work of Mr.
Bret Harte	PERSON	, and their direct , picturesque , vivid quality stirs the blood with a keen sense of the robust life which they depict .

		Perhaps the most striking thing about them is that they should have been written by a woman , for their point of view is distinctly masculine , and we listen in vain to catch the fem - inine note .

		If we catch it at all , it is in the two stories '' of other days and other wheres , '' which we can not but feel to be misplaced in this group .

		They are fantastic and unreal ; their fellows are throbbing with vigorous life .

		The contrast is as great as pos - sible between '' The Great Concern '' and the story of Iphigenia at
Aulis	LOCATION	, and it is almost wholly in favor of the former .

		Three or four longish stories and a couple of very short ones are the contents of Mrs.
Cruger	PERSON	's new volume .

		We should infer that they were the sweep - ings of the writer 's desk , so inferior are they to the greater part of her work .

		They are mostly about people of intense emotions , and their atmosphere is that of the hot-house .

		Their artificiality and crude - ness of coloring produce an unpleasant effect , and the occasional clever touches do little to counteract it .

		They are , moreover , for the most part sadly lacking in the constructive art that the writer has , in some of her longer works , shown herself to pos - sess .

		Holland has provided inspiration for artists of many sorts , but rarely for more genuine and sym - pathetic work than Mrs.
King	PERSON	's '' Kitwyk Stories . ''

		There are just a dozen of them , linked by a com - mon scene and common characters , vividly depict - ing the quaint life of a sleepy Dutch town , and brimming with alternate humor and pathos .

		They range from grave to gay , from burlesque to tragedy , and every episode is a delight .

		Who could forget , for example , the story of the dominie expounding scripture from his pulpit , and all the time guiltily conscious of the fact that his coat-tail pockets con - ceal a fragmentary sausage , and that the sacristan 's dog , keen upon the scent , is lurking somewhere be - hind .

		As for '' The Wild Huntsmen of Kitwyk , '' whose exploits are wrought in a vast cabbage-patch , and whose only embarrassment is that the rabbits are so tame that they will not get far enough away to be properly aimed at , the humor of the situation is entirely irresistible .

		The thing is as good , in its way , as
Tartarin	ORGANIZATION	's lion-hunt in the Algerian cab - bage-patch .

		In fact , there are many scenes in Mrs.
King	PERSON	's book that suggest the doings of the
Taras	PERSON	- connais , and
M. Daudet	PERSON	, had he been a Dutchman , might have written of the good burghers of Kitwyk in a similar strain .

		The cover of the book , in blue
Delft	LOCATION	, and the drawings by Messrs.
Edwards	PERSON	and Sterner , harmonize with the text , and add not a lit - tle to the charm of this delightful book .

		Miss
Goodloe	PERSON	's '' College Girls '' are healthy and well-bred specimens of feminine humanity , and she contrives to interest us in their doings .

		They are denizens of
Wellesley College	ORGANIZATION	, and their thoughts are not all of books .

		Each one of the fourteen stories in this collection is based upon a distinct idea , worked out with skilful economy , and produces a singular impression of completeness .

		This fact , together with the touches of comedy and sentiment that alternately enliven the pages , gives artistic value to what is otherwise a slight performance .

		If such a book has any lesson , it is that the higher educa - tion of woman does not make her any less feminine than she would be without it .

		Two volumes of stories by the late
Constance Fenimore Woolson	PERSON	have been added to the consid - erable list of books bearing her name .

		The six stories of the one volume and the five of the other all relate to
Italy	LOCATION	, where the writer spent the clos - ing part of her life .

		But , although the scenes are Italian , the characters are for the most part ex - patriated Americans , who speak and act very much as they would have done at home , except that they have more interesting things to do and talk about .

		Most of these stories are swift character-studies , filled with much animated chatter of the sort that passes for conversation in our feverish modern so - ciety , and only now and then are the springs of life for a moment touched .

		They are finished work , and consequently satisfactory in a way , despite their limitations .

		Two or three of them display consid - erable inventive skill , while others have fine-spun analysis as their chief element .

		Perhaps the most striking of all is the story of '' The Front Yard , '' with its simple pathos and its wholly original con - ception .

		All of the stories have had previous pub - lication in the magazines .

		n. First in order and importance among the volumes before us for treatment in our second article must be ranked the two stately volumes , entitled '' Con stantinople '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- by
Edwin A. Grosvenor	PERSON	, Professor of European History at
Amherst College	ORGANIZATION	, and formerly Professor of History at
Robert Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege ,
Constantinople	LOCATION	.

		Professor
Grosvenor	PERSON	's book is a serious and scholarly work , the result of years of arduous labor and research ; and we include it in the present category only by reason of its sumptu - ous make-up and unusual pictorial attractions .

		That it is not , like so many books of the kind , a mere learned compilation , a mosaic of laborious glean - ings from the authorities , the warmly commenda - 386 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, tory Introduction supplied by Gen.
Lew	PERSON	.

		Wallace well serves to show .

		A necessarily hurried exam - ination of the work inclines us to endorse without qualification General
Wallace	PERSON	's characterization of it as a History of Constantinople which will not merely serve every want of the tourist , student , and general reader , but be indispensable to every library for purposes of reference .

		Let us add that it is precisely the store-house of historical , archaeological , and topographical facts long needed by tourists to en - able them to '' do '' Constantinople intelligently and profitably , and to dispense with the greedy and pes - tilent horde of '' guides '' thrust upon the helpless pilgrim by the Pera landlords .

		The volumes are copiously and informingly illustrated with photo - graphic plates which , in point of subject , fairly beg - gar description portraits , views , cuts of tombs , buildings , bas-reliefs , antiquities , street-scenes , etc. , following each other in bewildering variety .

		Sev - eral good maps and charts are added , and there is a chronological list of Emperors and Sultans , and a good Index .

		A graceful gift to a friend of bookish tastes would be a copy of Mr.
W. Roberts	PERSON	's '' The Book - Hunter in
London	LOCATION	, '' a well-made , handsome volume , of which
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the American publishers .

		The author is an authority on book-collecting , and his work is the first serious attempt , we think , to give a fairly comprehensive history of that fascinating pursuit , as carried on in the British metropolis .

		The work is , he says , '' the outcome , not only of material which has been accu - mulating for many years past , from published and unpublished sources , but also of a long and pleasant intercourse with the leading collectors and booksel - lers in
London	LOCATION	, not to mention a vigorous and con - stant prosecution of one of the most pleasant and instructive of hobbies . ''

		Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	's scholarly and matterful work deserves much fuller treatment than can be accorded it here ; and we must content ourselves with describing it in a general way as a storehouse teeming with facts and anecdotes of the greatest interest to collectors and amateurs , and to bookish people generally ; the whole being set forth in a very genial and agreeable style .

		The matter is conveniently arranged under such captions as : '' Early Book-Hunting , '' '' Book - Auctions and Sales , '' '' Bookstalls and Bookstalling , '' '' Some Book-Hunt - ing Localities , '' `` Some Modern Collectors , '' etc. .

		The humors of the subject are not neglected , and we need scarcely say that the
Chicago	LOCATION	collector -LRB- by no means such a rara avis as the author seems to fancy -RRB- comes in for a share of notice .

		Somehow , everyone seems to feel himself entitled to gird at
Chicago	LOCATION	the moment any topic germane to culture comes up for discussion ; and yet Mr.
Warner	PERSON	years ago was far-sighted enough to predict that when
Chicago	LOCATION	did take hold of culture she `` would make it hum . ''

		Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	, however , on the authority of a
London	LOCATION	dealer , tells a story -LRB- largely apochry - phal , we dare say -RRB- of a '' stylishly-dressed man '' who walked briskly into his shop saying , as he pointed to a `` sample lot '' outside : ' `` I 'll take these books ; and , say , have you any more of this kind with this shield onto them ? '

		pointing to the bookplate attached , which bore the arms and name of a good old country family ... ' What 's yer fig - ger for them , anyway ?

		See here , I start back to
Chicago	LOCATION	to-morrow , and I mean to take these books right back along .

		I 'm goin ' to start a libery thar , and these books will just fit me , name and all .

		Just you sort out all that have that shield and name and send them round to the
Langham	LOCATION	at seven sharp .

		I
' 11	DATE	be round to settle up ; but see , now , do n't you send any without that name-plate , for that 's my name , too , and I reckon this old boss with the dag - gers and roosters might have been related to me some way . ' ''

		Just where this
Chicago	LOCATION	bibliophile acquired his amazing dialect will be a mystery to his puzzled fellow-townsmen who read the story .

		We have included Mr.
Roberts	PERSON	's book in the pres - ent category largely by reason of its attractive make-up and its profuse illustrations , which em - brace a great number of portraits of noted collectors and dealers , cuts of famous shops and stalls , rare texts and title-pages , bookplates , etc. .

		The tasteful cover design calls for its word of praise .

		Not a few readers will feel misgivings at the publication of Mr.
W. Hamilton Gibson	PERSON	's '' Our Edible Toad-Stools and Mushrooms , and How to Distinguish Them '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , but examination of the book will show no real cause for alarm , for the writer has been more than necessarily timid in his suggestions , and sounds the danger-note so persist - ently and obtrusively that the wayfaring man in search of mushrooms for his dinner-table , though a fool , is not likely to err in consequence of Mr.
Gib	PERSON	- son 's advice .

		The simple fact of the matter is that our woods are full of delicious mushrooms of the edible sort ; that , although there are also noxious species to be found in their company , it is not a dif - ficult matter to make a safe selection , and that the knowledge by which the edible fungi may be distin - guished from the poisonous ones is jworth the pains required to master the directions given in Mr.
Gib	PERSON	- son 's book .

		Indeed , it is not fair to speak of read - ing such a book as a painful experience at all , for the author is not only an accurate scholar -LRB- as far as he goes -RRB- , but two kinds of an artist as well with the pen and with the pencil or brush .

		His book is a very beautiful one , with thirty colored plates remarkable for truth of design and delicacy of tint , a still greater number of illustrations in black-and-white , many passages of fine descriptive writing , and , last but not least , an appendix of re - ceipts for the practical uses of the kitchen .

		Armed with the facts to be got from this book , and keeping it at hand for the process of verification , one may safely sally forth in quest of edible mushrooms , and as safely indulge in the epicurean delights that they afford .

		Here , at least , is a holiday book that is not only charming to read and look at , but is also of solid practical use , and hardly to be spared from the library of the country house .

		THE DIAL 387 Among gift-books combining high literary qual - ities with fastidious workmanship and moderate price , the season 's publications of Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	,
Portland	LOCATION	,
Me.	LOCATION	, are deservedly conspicuous .

		Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's charming '' Bibelot '' edition of
Fitz	PERSON	-
Gerald	PERSON	's '' Omar , '' published a year ago , will be fresh in the recollection of many book-lovers .

		The edi - tion was a small one , and quickly exhausted .

		An Edition definitive of this classic has now been pro- duced , with several new features , among them an intelligent sketch and appreciation of
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
W. Irving Way	PERSON	, two poems by Mr.
Theodore Watts	PERSON	, and a bibliography .

		The text of the first and fourth -LRB- original -RRB- editions is given , with the variant readings of the other two .

		It will be dif - ficult to plan a better or more attractive presentation of the work than that now devised by the taste and judgment of Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	.

		The qualities that make this little book so attractive are shared by Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	's two additional volumes in the '' Bibelot '' series a selection from the lyrics of
Rossetti	PERSON	, and
Symonds	PERSON	's translation of the sonnets of Michel An - gelo .

		The former volume includes '' The Blessed Damozel , '' `` Jenny '' -LRB- with some variant readings -RRB- , the translations from
Villon	PERSON	, the shorter ballads , and a score of the best-known lyrics .

		Mme. Dar - mesteter 's tributary '' Canzone '' serves as an appro - priate foreword .

		The
Michel Angelo	PERSON	volume has a frontispiece head of
Vittoria Colonna	PERSON	, and the notes of the translator .

		Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	opens what he happily calls the `` Old World Series '' volumes a trifle smaller than the '' Bibelots '' with a re - print of Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's ever-delightful translation of '' Aucassin and Nicolete . ''

		The original etched title-page is reproduced , together with Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's introduction and '' Ballads of Aucassin . ''

		We are also given Mrs.
Marriott-Watson	PERSON	's '' Ballads of Nic - olete '' and Mr.
Stedman	PERSON	's '' Provencal Lovers , '' without which latter poem , as the editor remarks , '' the edition would be incomplete . ''

		Last of all , Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	has issued the daintiest imaginable edi - tion , printed on
Japan	LOCATION	vellum , of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's `` The Child in the
House	ORGANIZATION	, '' with the obituary sonnet by ''
Michael Field	PERSON	. ''

		In a thin oblong octavo entitled '' The Quest of the Holy Grail , ''
Messrs. R. H. Russell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	re - produce the series of paintings done by Mr.
Edwin A. Abbey	PERSON	for the decoration of the
Delivery Room of the Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		The plates enable one at least to enjoy Mr.
Abbey	PERSON	's fine and romantic conceptions , and even to form a notion of the gen - eral technique and rich effects of color and chiaros - curo of the original works .

		The artist has pre - served throughout the mystic romanticism and chivalric-religious symbolism of his difficult theme ; and the details of costume , ritual , and accesssories appear to be historically accurate .

		He has taken as his hero the British Sir
Galahad	PERSON	, the Parzeval of the continental versions of the legend , arranging the sequence of adventure to suit the exigencies of pictorial treatment , and drawing from various poet - ical sources , but mainly from
Robert de Borron	LOCATION	,
Walter Map	PERSON	,
Wolfram of Eschenbach	PERSON	, and
Chres	PERSON	- tien of Troyes .

		The five plates given -LRB- the original series is not yet completed -RRB- represent as many phases in the life of Galahad and in his quest of the Grail .

		In the first picture he is shown as an infant in the arms of a nun , visited in the convent by an angel who bears the mystic cup .

		The second represents the knighting of
Galahad	LOCATION	.

		The third is an elaborate and highly dramatic composition , show - ing the Knights of the Round Table seated in Ar - thur 's Hall , the motif being the fable of the seat Perilous fashioned by the enchanter
Merlin	PERSON	.

		The fourth plate shows the beginning of the Quest , the design representing the Knights about to set out on their mission ; and in the fifth we see Galahad 's '' First Coming to the Castle of the Grail . ''

		The text gives a brief outline of the history of the Grail Legend , together with the artist 's comments on the plates .

		An enticing little volume , which to see is to wish to handle , is
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's collection of '' Moral Tales '' from
Marmontel	PERSON	, in a revised translation and with an Introduction by Mr.
George Saintsbury	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Chris	PERSON	.


Hammond	PERSON	is the illustrator , and the form of the volume is generally similar to that of the same firm 's familiar green-and-gold edi - tions of ''
Cranford	LOCATION	, '' '' The Vicar of
Wakefield	LOCATION	, '' etc. .

		If the reader have a literate taste and his due share of fancy , let him turn to this still fresh and fragrant garland of -LRB- in the qualitative sense espe - cially -RRB- eighteenth-century tales .

		Marmontel was a gifted , versatile man , whose mind was tinged with the peculiar doctrines and enthusiasms of his day , as his style was with its neo-classicalism .

		He was a true conteur , a weaver of quaint conceits and romantic fancies in the manner of
Cre	ORGANIZATION	` billon the younger and of Marivaux ; and in these '' exquisitely finished tales '' of his , as ^ Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	styles them , one may find a refreshing contrast to the dusty real - ism of our modern Gradgrinds , who , by some strange inversion of the normal order of things , have gotten out of their native thistle-field of re - porting and statistics , into the rose-garden of fiction .

		Essentially a man of his time ,
Marmontel	ORGANIZATION	's writings the Contes Moraux scarcely less than the me - moirs and treatises are saturated with its peculiar spirit .

		He was a philosophe too of the salons , indeed , and well below those leaders of the Eight - eenth
Century Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	who sapped the citadel of the old intellectual and political order , and headed the assault upon the crowned and the cowled foes of light and liberty .

		The
Contes Moraux	PERSON	, then , may be read either as tales pure and simple , or as documents of the period , as the reader please ; and from either standpoint he will be well repaid .

		Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's rather lengthy Introduction is inform - ing and vivaciously written , and Mr.
Hammond	PERSON	's illustrations are pleasing .

		Another new volume in the charming '' Cranford series '' presents a collec - tion of
Mary Russell Mitford	PERSON	's `` Country Stories , '' illustrated by
George Morrow	PERSON	.

		The tales , of course , are charming in style and theme , and Mr.
Morrow	PERSON	's 388 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, pictures have quite a
Hugh Thomsonish	PERSON	flavor which is commendation enough .

		The titles include '' The
London	LOCATION	Visitor , ''
Jesse Cliffe	PERSON	, '' '' The Beauty of the Village , '' '' Town versus Country , '' '' Honor
O'Callaghan	PERSON	, '' etc. .

		Mr.
W. D. Howells	PERSON	's garland of brief poems , '' Stops of Various Quills , '' is issued in Holiday ap - parel by
Messrs. Harper & Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, and cleverly illustrated by Mr.
Howard Pyle	PERSON	.

		Touching the essentially poetic quality of the work , it can not be said that the flight of Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's muse is either lofty or well sustained .

		His numbers lack music , and his style lacks distinction ; but the verses are always thoughtful and virile , and lack of form is partly atoned for by pith and manifest sincerity of matter .

		There is a sombre tone throughout , which will be a little surprising to those who know only Mr.
Howells	PERSON	's crisp and buoyant prose ; and it is this , perhaps , which has inspired Mr.
Pyle	PERSON	's particularly dismal frontispiece .

		Illustration and decoration are finely done , for the most part , and not overdone which is a desideratum in books of the kind .

		Very pretty and dainty is Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	's quartet of brief romances of George Sand : '' Francois the Waif , '' translated by
Jane Minot Sedgwick	PERSON	; '' The Devil 's Pool , '' translated by
Jane Minot Sedgwick	PERSON	and
Ellery Sedgwick	PERSON	; '' Fadette , '' translated by
Jane Minot Sedgwick	PERSON	; and '' The Master Mosaic Workers , '' translated by
Charlotte C. Johnston	ORGANIZATION	.

		The edition is limited to 750 copies , and each little volume , simplex munditiis , is a jewel of quiet , artistic book-making .

		Etched front - ispieces ,
Windsor	LOCATION	hand-made paper , and the clear print of the De
Vinne Press	PERSON	, complete a material ensemble that offers little room for cavil .

		The vol - umes , with one exception , deal with a phase of French life that
George Sand	PERSON	is perhaps unexcelled in portraying ; and the publishers may be congrat - ulated on their selections .

		A unique volume of jwasi-artistic interest is Mr.
Charles Hiatt	PERSON	's `` Picture Posters '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , being a short history of tbe illustrated placard , with many reproductions of choice and curious examples in all countries .

		While we can not fully agree with the author as to the palaeolithic antiquity of the poster -LRB- the cave-dweller , he thinks , '' must surely have possessed the essential idea of it '' -RRB- , the device is certainly obvious enough to have presented itself to the mind of a very primitive advertiser .

		There is in the
Louvre	LOCATION	collections a papyrus , which may be fairly called a poster , dating back to 146
B. C.	PERSON	, and offering a reward for the apprehension of two slaves escaped from the city of
Alexandria	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Hiatt	PERSON	's illustrations embrace many photographic cuts of French , English , German , and American posters , most of them ingeniously grotesque , many in the unmeaningly-hideous style of Mr.
Aubrey Beards	PERSON	- ley , and a few really graceful and artistic .

		The list of considerable artists who have condescended to this sufficiently rank form of the '' pot-boiler '' is such as to give color to Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's contemptu - ous dictum that '' Art is on the town , '' and to the theory that the coming art-patron is the enterprising vendor of soaps and patent pills .

		The volume con - tains much curious matter , pictorial and otherwise , and should have a passing vogue .

		We spoke not long ago of the first two volumes - in
Messrs. Houghton	LOCATION	,
Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's attractive re - issue of the art-histories of Mrs.
Jameson	PERSON	.

		Three more volumes , now published , complete the series .

		They are as follows : '' Legends of the Monastic Orders , '' '' Legends of the Madonna , '' and '' Me - moirs of Italian Painters . ''

		All are abundantly illustrated , and supplied with notes embodying the work of recent critical scholarship .

		The series of illustrations in the '' Memoirs of Italian Painters '' is entirely new .

		Miss
Kuril	PERSON	, who has done the editorial work upon all these volumes , is to be con - gratulated upon the knowledge and taste brought by her to this delicate task .

		Last year
Messrs. D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issued a handsome Edition de luxe , limited , of
Dumas	PERSON	's '' Three Musketeers , '' translated by Mr.
William Robson	PERSON	, and enriched with 250 illustrations by
Maurice Leloir	PERSON	, engraved on wood by
J. Huyot	PERSON	.

		The same house now offers a far less expensive edi - tion of this work , which for all practical purposes is as good as its more luxurious predecessor , or even better .


Leloir	PERSON	's work is exceedingly spirited , the plates are bright and clear , and altogether the vol - umes present a most inviting and readable appear - ance .

		Messrs.
George Bell	PERSON	& Sons of
London	LOCATION	publish , and
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	import , an interesting if rather desultory work on '' Modern Illustration , '' put together by that undefatigable bookmaker , Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	.

		The author observes in his pre - face , in his usual pleasant way , that the book is '' but a sketch of what I think is the most import - ant work of this century ; from which I know I shall be told I have omitted almost all that I should have included , and inserted much that should have been omitted . ''

		Now we do not think that the '' unknown or anonymous nobodies , '' as Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	styles his critics , will be quite so hard on him as that comes to .

		His examples are undeniably well chosen , and , space limitations considered , repre - sentative ; and the only fault we have to find with his book on its pictorial side is that the author has over-modestly refrained from inserting in it speci - mens of his own often admirable drawings .

		Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	at his best ranks with the first half-dozen illustrators of to-day ; and the fact should have been recognized , even in a book of his own compil - ing .

		The volume being a small one , and inclusive of many names , the text is necessarily little more than a good catalogue raisonne .

		It is marked , how - ever , with the author 's usual peculiarities of style , including a certain snappishness and cocksureness qualities which have done even more than Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's inaccuracies as a chronicler and heresies as a critic to bring the swarm of '' anonymous no - bodies '' about his ears .

		Like too many artists -LRB- lit -
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 389 erary ones not excepted -RRB- , Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	ill brooks the rivalry of the dead ; and he has his usual quota of sharp things to say of past celebrities .

		Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's narrative , however , is lively and enter - taining ; and it contains a good deal of information as to modern French , German , English , and Amer - ican illustrators and their methods that the reading public will be glad to get , and which can not be got in any other single book that we know of .

		The plates , of course , form the main attraction and real raison d'etre of the volume ; and of these there are some 140 , full-page and vignette , forming a decid - edly interesting collection .

		Mr.
Philip Gilbert Hamerton	PERSON	's graceful and thoughtful study of '' Painting in
France	LOCATION	after the Decline of Classicism '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , illustrated with fourteen full-page photogravures after characteris - tic paintings of
Aubert	LOCATION	,
Courbet	LOCATION	,
Tissot	PERSON	,
Corot	LOCATION	,
Brun	PERSON	,
Lobrichon	LOCATION	,
Landelle	LOCATION	, and others , should find favor with those in quest of a sound , pictorially attrac - tive , and moderate-priced art-book .

		The plates are exquisite examples of process-work , and the sub - jects are chosen with the author 's usual correct taste .

		Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's essay is an altogether charming piece of work all in all , the best summary appre - preciation of the spirit and method of modern French art and of its representative exponents that we remember to have seen .

		The peculiarities of such men as
Tissot	LOCATION	,
Manet	LOCATION	,
Courbet	LOCATION	,
Flandrin	PERSON	, and the rest , are brought out with a few swift and felici - tous touches , the justice and delicate discrimination of which must at once strike anyone with the slight - est critical knowledge of those painters .

		Especially acute are the brief remarks on
Edouard Manet	PERSON	, the end and aim of whose art , Mr.
H.	PERSON	thinks , '' est sim ^ plement la tache '' la tache being perhaps the best rendered here as '' the patch . ''

		As
David	PERSON	used to teach that , in painting , the outline is everything , while others hold that modelling is everything , so our ultra-impressionist Manet may well say that la tache is everything .

		With purely technical aims , any subject whatever suits
Edouard Manet	PERSON	, if only it presents a suitable arrangement of variously col - ored patches .

		Let the reader recall , for instance , one of his marvellous stubble-fields , with the long rows of pyramidal ricks , the whole glorified and empurpled by the slant rays of the westering sun , and the truth of Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's characterization will appear .

		We regret that no example of Manet 's work is given ; though it is perhaps ill-suited to reproduction .

		The same house issues , in simpler style , another of Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	's works , '' Imagin - ation in Landscape Painting , '' with twenty-seven illustrations after
Claude	PERSON	,
Ruysdael	LOCATION	,
Cuyp	ORGANIZATION	,
Turner	PERSON	, Constable , and other masters to whom Nature was an inspiration rather than a model to be literally copied by the art -LRB- as some one sagaciously called it -RRB- `` of representing objects deceptively in relief on a flat surface . ''

		The imaginative landscape painter is distinguished from the mere copyist in that he is interested in natural objects not , as the author well puts it , '' for themselves alone , but because he per - ceives in them certain obscure analogies with the moods of man . ''

		This thesis Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	devel - ops , with his usual delicate analysis and wealth of illustration , through twenty readable chapters .

		The book should make a pretty and valuable gift for those who can appreciate it .

		While speaking of this work by Mr.
Hamerton	PERSON	, we should mention that another attractive edition of it , at moderate price and with well-executed illustrations , is issued by
Messrs. Macmillan & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Messrs.
Henry T. Coates & Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue , in two taste - fully ornate volumes bound in white and gold and encased in crimson slip-covers , the ``
Spain	LOCATION	and the Spaniards '' of that sprightly and romantic Italian traveller ,
Edmondo de Amicis	PERSON	.

		The work is newly _ and admirably translated by Mr.
Stanley Rhoads Yarnall	PERSON	from the tenth Italian edition , and is en - riched with forty-seven excellent full-page photo - gravure plates of Spanish scenery , buildings , street scenes , paintings , etc. .

		De Amicis is a delightful writer , and his ''
Spain	LOCATION	'' is one of his most delight - ful books still perhaps the best , and certainly the most brilliant and picturesque , Spanish travel-book extant , though very good ones have been written by
Gautier	PERSON	, and by our countryman , Mr.
Henry T. Finck	PERSON	.

		The work is one of the choicest and best conceived gift-books on our list .

		The same firm offers this year a revised and enlarged edition of that standard anthology
Coates	PERSON	's '' Fireside
Encyclo	PERSON	- paedia of Poetry . ''

		The popularity of this work is attested by the fact that the present is the thirty - first edition , and the freshness of the present revi - sion by its inclusion of some of the recent pieces of
Eugene Field	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Riley	PERSON	.

		A sightly and suitable Christmas gift for a friend engaged in wrestling with the knotty problem of building a new house , or the perhaps knottier one of altering an old one , would be a copy of Mr.
Louis D. Gibson	PERSON	's `` Beautiful Houses '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , a sort of sequel , we take it , to his useful and prac - tical work on '' Convenient Houses '' of some months back .

		Since the publication of the latter work , Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	, who is a professional architect , has been abroad for the purpose of studying European arch - itecture at first hand and in detail ; and the present volume is largely the outcome of his trip .

		It is partly historical and descriptive , yet essentially sug - gestive and practical ; and the intelligent reader can not fail to gather from it many valuable hints as to the possibility of adapting the beauties and merits of foreign houses to the exigencies of Ameri - can life and construction .

		Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	, whose aes - thetic sense is evidently offended by the costly yet hideous '' residences '' that shock the trained eye at every turn in the fashionable quarters of our cities , has a good deal to say on the sound text that all buildings , however modest , may be artistic ; that the cottage occupied by a clerk or bookkeeper who earns a hundred dollars a month is often a gem of good taste , while the '' palatial abode '' of the pork - packer or brewer who employs him is an architect - ural horror ; that there is no good reason , pecuniary 390 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, or other , for ugliness ; and that , in fine , the cost or elaborateness of a house is no measure at all of its beauty , save in the eye of the vulgar .

		The text is divided under the main headings : '' House-Building an Art , '' `` The World 's Homes , '' `` Some House Plans , '' `` Materials and Details . ''

		There are a great many illustrations , full-page and vignette , embracing choice examples of foreign and American houses , plans , details , etc. ; and these are handsomely repro - duced .

		The book forms the supplement needed by its extremely practical predecessor .

		Lovers of the writings of Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	will at last have their eyes gladdened by the sight of a really ideal edition of his works the '' New Riverside '' -LRB- limited to 1,000 copies -RRB- , in nine duo - decimo volumes , from the press of Messrs.

Mifflin & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In design , material , and finish , these little volumes seem to us well-nigh flawless .

		They are clearly printed from new plates , on spe - cial paper , and bound in the style of simple elegance characteristic of this firm 's choice publications .

		Illus - tration and ornamentation are precisely what they should be thoroughly artistic and not overdone .

		They consist of etched frontispieces and engraved half-titles suggested by passages in Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's works , and were designed by Messrs.
Charles H. Woodbury	PERSON	,
Sidney L. Smith	PERSON	, and
W. H. W. Bick	PERSON	- nell ; and there are several etched portraits of Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	.

		Author , publishers , and artists are to be heartily congratulated on these beautiful vol - umes , which challenge , from cover to cover , com - parison with examples of the best English and Con - tinental book-making .

		An extremely choice and elegant three-volume edition , printed at the
De Vinne Press	ORGANIZATION	and limited to 750 copies , of
Marie-Henri Beyle	PERSON	's -LRB- '' De Stend - hal 's '' -RRB- fine romance , ' La Chartreuse de Parme , '' translated by
E. P. Robins	PERSON	, comes to us from
Messrs. G. H. Richmond & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, of
New York	LOCATION	.

		The con - noisseur of fine book-making may well linger over the charms of these refined and captivating little books .

		The binding , a delicate neutral tint with gilt stamp , is in the best taste ; the print is clear and open a model page ; and there are thirty etched plates , gems of Gallic esprit and daintiness , by
G. Mercier	PERSON	, after the designs of V. Foulquier . ''

		Chartreuse de Parme '' is easily
Beyle	PERSON	's master - piece in the department of fiction '' in any case , '' said Balzac , '' a wonderful production , le llvre des esprits distingues '' Written in
1830	DATE	, at
Padua	LOCATION	, and inspired by a chance narration of the striking -LRB- if not altogether laudable -RRB- adventures of the
Duch	PERSON	- ess
Sanseverina	LOCATION	, it presents a vivid picture of Italian manners in Napoleonic times , as well as of scenes and events incidental to the French invasion of
Italy	LOCATION	.

		The translation of the work is easy , flowing , and idiomatic .

		Mr.
Alfred C. Eastman	PERSON	has collected and illus - trated with considerable taste twenty-six '' Poems of the Farm '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , from various au - thors
Holmes	PERSON	,
Whittier	LOCATION	,
Higginson	PERSON	,
Madison Caw	ORGANIZATION	- em ,
Mary E. Wilkins	PERSON	,
S. W. Foss	PERSON	, and others .

		Most of the pieces are sentimental , some are humorous ; and Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	's drawings range from bits of rural landscape and genre , to decorations and em - blems indented in the text or strewn on the mar - gins .

		The effect of the whole is pleasing enough ; and the verses in the book appeal strongly to that very large class of town-dwelling Americans whose earliest and fondest memories are associated with the farm with a phase of life which , we venture to say , is most pleasing at a distance , like a mosaic .

		As a matter of fact , your typical American gets away from the farm as soon as he can , and only returns to it when he must .

		But he likes to senti - mentalize about it ; and Mr.
Eastman	PERSON	's pretty book is a capital one to assist the process .

		All true
New Englanders	ORGANIZATION	will appreciate the tasteful small - quarto volume entitled `` Old Bos - ton '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , in which are reproduced , generally in satisfactory form , the fine collection of etchings made by Mr.
Henry R. Blaney	PERSON	, represent - ing historic buildings and street scenes in the fam - ous capital of Yankee-land .

		Many of these build - ings are well-known landmarks , some of which still remain , though others have long since disappeared .

		The collection includes many fine specimens of Col - onial architecture , and public and private buildings of moi'e recent date .

		Among the views are the
Old State House	ORGANIZATION	,
Faneuil Hall	ORGANIZATION	,
Lamb Tavern	ORGANIZATION	, Birth - place of
Paul Revere	PERSON	,
Sheafe House	ORGANIZATION	, Liberty Tree ,
Green Dragon Tavern	ORGANIZATION	,
Birthplace of Cotton Mather	ORGANIZATION	, Old Boston Theatre , Old South Church , Old Prov - ince
House	ORGANIZATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	in
1768	DATE	, etc. .

		Each illustration is accompanied by explanatory text , giving an his - torical account of the building represented .

		An inviting , artistic looking book , embellished with eleven etchings and twenty pen-and-ink sketches by Mr.
H. Hovell Crickmore	PERSON	, is '' Old Chester '' one of Messrs.
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons ' importa - tions .

		Mr.
Crickmore	PERSON	, a native Cestrian and a cap - ital cicerone , is the author as well as illustrator ; and it is an open question in which capacity he is the happier .

		Most of the etchings-are admirably done , and the reproduction bears comparison with first-class American work .

		Quaint old sixteenth - century Chester is fast vanishing before the tooth of time and the vandal hand of the restorer ; and the past twenty years especially have wrought havoc with many a picturesque nook dear to artist and antiquary .

		While many an antique gem of stone and timber still remains , these are largely tottering to decay ; and , says Mr.
Crickmore	PERSON	, '' we must be up and doing if we would secure the semblance of their scarred and wrinkled features before they van - ish forever . ''

		It is in pursuance of this pious aim that he has prepared the present volume a beau - tiful memorial of the storied remains of '' Old Chester . ''

		Few persons know much about the beautiful in - dustrial art of fan-painting , or of its masterpieces .

		The loan exhibitions at
South Kensington	LOCATION	in
1870	DATE	, at
New York	LOCATION	in
1882	DATE	by the Society of Decorative Art , and in
1891	DATE	by the
Grolier Club	ORGANIZATION	, gave a great

		THE DIAL 391 impulse to the collection and decoration of fans ; but the opportunities of seeing these are very rare , the private collections in which they are treasured not being accessible to the public .

		The subject , so far from being a frivolous one , has a history which can not be treated thoroughly without entering some - what into the social and artistic history of many na - tions .

		To supply such a history , and to reproduce some of the most interesting examples of the art , is the object of '' A Book about Fans '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The text is highly interesting , and the illustrations in photogravure , twenty-nine in number , cover a great variety , from the old Etruscan and Chinese speci - mens down to the work of the moderns ,
Vibert	PERSON	,
Leloir	PERSON	,
Wattier	PERSON	, and others .

		From the concluding chapter , '' Fan-Collecting , '' may be learned some - what of the encouragements and difficulties for the enthusiast in this field .

		In one way , fans are more puzzling than silver or china ; for they have no hall - mark or factory stamp , and the old ones are almost never signed .

		Yet a little study of these exquisite butterflies of art will give an interesting idea of what may be called the philosophy of style in dec - oration , and for such a purpose the handsome vol - ume just issued will serve as a valuable aid .

		Messrs.
T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's new two-volume edition of '' The Poetical Works '' of
John Keats	PERSON	is a very desirable exact reprint of Mr.
J. Buxton Forman	PERSON	's latest edition , with its complete editorial apparatus of notes , appendices , etc. .

		The Forman edition contains everything in the way of verse that
Keats	PERSON	is known to have written ; and the present publishers have added an acceptable feature a good biographical sketch of the poet , by Mr.
Nathan Haskell Dole	PERSON	.

		The volumes are prettily bound in maroon and gilt , and the text is clearly printed on fair paper .

		The edition is an inexpensive one , de - spite its liberal pictorial attractions , the latter em - bracing some excellent portraits , together with drawings of views suggested by
Keats	PERSON	's poems , or of scenes associated with his name .

		Uniform with the above are two-volume editions , from new plates and with new illustrations , of
Moore	PERSON	's '' Complete Poetical Works '' and
Jane Porter	PERSON	's '' The Scottish Chiefs . ''

		Price considered , these are very desirable editions of these standard works .

		A comely Christmas edition of `` Ian
Maclaren	PERSON	's '' popular novel , '' A Doctor of the Old School , '' with copious illustrations by Mr.
F. G. Gordon	PERSON	, is issued by Messrs.
Dodd	PERSON	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Gordon	PERSON	's draw - ings are capitally done , albeit he seems to us to have invested the face of the good Doctor MacLure with an even more than Caledonian harshness of feature .

		A special preface to this edition is fur - nished by the author , in which he answers the often repeated question , '' Was there ever any doctor so self-forgetful and so utterly Christian as
William MacLure	PERSON	? ''

		emphatically in the affirmative : '' Not one man , but many in
Scotland	LOCATION	and in the South country ; I will dare prophecy also across the sea . ''

		The rich and tasteful binding of the volume de - serves special mention . ''

		Literary Shrines '' and '' A Literary Pilgrim - age '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- are the titles of two tasteful vol - umes in red buckram , the work of Dr.
Theodore F. Wolfe	PERSON	.

		The former is devoted to the homes and haunts of American authors , the
Concord	LOCATION	group in particular ; while the latter treats in similar fashion of a number of English authors .

		The books are pleasantly written , interspersed with bits of de - scription and anecdote , and are inspired by a gen - uine , if somewhat undiscriminating , literary feeling .

		Each volume has a number of pretty illustrations . ''

		One of the greatest pleasures I have known '' is the phrase with which Mr.
H. S. H. Waylen	PERSON	de - scribes the task of selecting a hundred or more pages of '' Thoughts from the Writings of
Richard Jefferies	PERSON	. ''

		Few men have known nature so inti - mately as
Jefferies	ORGANIZATION	, or written of her so tenderly and so well .

		His work abounds in quotable passages of the deepest beauty , and it was a happy inspira - tion that impelled Mr.
Waylen	PERSON	to prepare this little book .

		The volume is very prettily printed in red and black , and bound in covers decorated with a strikingly imaginative design .

		-LRB- Longmans . -RRB-

		Messrs.
Little	PERSON	,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	issue , in continua - tion of their excellent shelf edition of the romances of
Alexandre Dumas	PERSON	, a new series of six volumes embracing `` Ascanio , '' `` The War of Women , '' Black , the Story of a Dog , '' and '' Tales of the Caucasus , '' each a shapely , neatly bound , and well printed duodecimo , with an etched frontispiece by
E. Van Muyden	ORGANIZATION	or
Eugene Grivaz	PERSON	.

		We have had frequent occasion to praise these series of standard well-translated works , the form of which is now too familiar to call for special description .

		A book large enough , certainly , not to be lost sight of by Christmas buyers , and furnishing in its end less profusion of illustrations and general mechan ical excellence , combined with substantial contents , sufficient claim to be regarded as a gift-book par excellence , is the new edition of ''
Webster	PERSON	's Inter - national Dictionary '' -LRB-
G. & C. Merriam Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- The fortunate young man or woman who receives this noble work will possess a copy of what is perhaps the most remarkable single volume in the world , and one that in itself may be made the foundation of an education ; while scholars and literary workers find that , whatever other dictionaries they may possess , the '' International '' has special merits of its own that make its presence a necessity in every well-ordered library .

		A generous royal octavo compiled by Mr.
Will	PERSON	- iam
Ellis Scull	PERSON	and published by
Messrs. John C. Winston & Co.	ORGANIZATION	,
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, presents a copiously illustrated sheaf of descriptions of ''
Westminster Abbey	ORGANIZATION	and the Cathedrals of
England	LOCATION	, '' from the writings of
Deans Farrar	PERSON	,
Milman	PERSON	,
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	, and other authorities .

		The pictures comprise a great variety of photographic views , exterior and interior , of the great English cathedrals and their more note - worthy architectural and artistic details , together with many interesting portraits of such leading cler - ical lights as
Deans Stanley	ORGANIZATION	,
Farrar	PERSON	,
Milman	PERSON	, and 392 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Church ,
Canon Liddon	ORGANIZATION	,
Archbishops Tait	PERSON	,
Benson	PERSON	,
Magee	PERSON	, and Maclagan , Bishops Lightf oot ,
Westcott	LOCATION	,
Woodworth	PERSON	,
Wilberforce	LOCATION	, etc. .

		The plates are fine examples of the capabilities of the half-tone process ; and altogether the equipment of the work is remark - ably good , in view of the modest price asked for it .

		A thin quarto volume of a somewhat '' churchly '' flavor , bearing the non-committal title '' Crowns '' -LRB-
A. S. Barnes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , is a work that almost defies definite description .

		Each left-hand page presents a text containing some allusion to a crown ; while on the opposite page is a picture presumably sug - gested by and illustrative of the text .

		For instance , a portrait of Mr.
Gladstone	PERSON	-LRB- at least we take it to be such from the collar -RRB- faces the verse , '' The hoary head is a crown of glory , if it be found in the way of righteousness '' ; while the text : `` Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown ; but we an incorrupt - ible , '' is mysteriously coupled with a cut of an '' up to date '' young woman playing the violin .

		Several of the pictures , taken by themselves , are rather nicely done ; and it is only fair to say of the artist ,
Miss Blanche McManus	PERSON	, that she was almost hope - lessly handicapped at the start by the nature of the work cut out for her .

		An admirable little volume containing Shake - speare 's '' A
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream , '' specially prepared for the use of young readers , comes from the Dent press of
London	LOCATION	-LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is pro- fusely and artistically illustrated by
Robert Anning Bell	PERSON	; and
Israel Gollancz	PERSON	has supplied a rather lengthy but pleasantly written Introduction -LRB- in the form of a letter -RRB- discussing the play and its author , and dipping lightly into the complex subject of En - glish fairy-lore .

		There is a helpful glossary .

		Two pretty and inexpensive books from
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are '' L' Avril , ''
M. Paul Mar	PERSON	- gueritte 's charming tale of
Southern France	LOCATION	, and
Champfleury	ORGANIZATION	's classic '' The Faience Violin , '' both translated by
Helen B. Dole	PERSON	.

		The illustrations of the former volume are from the author 's own de - signs ; while the latter contains reproductions of the still-life etchings made by
M. Jules Adeline	PERSON	for
Conquet	ORGANIZATION	's fine limited edition .

		The books are made up in the tasteful style of the '' Faience Library . '' ''

		On Winds of Fancy Blown '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a thin octavo volume of the once conventional '' Christmas book '' order , contains some pretty , if amateurish , verses and decorative drawings by
Mary Yale Shapleigh	ORGANIZATION	.

		Text and pictures are printed in a delicate neutral tint on rather thick glazed paper ; and the whole is encased in a chaste cover of light green , with gold lettering and a tasteful thistle de - sign stamped in green of a darker tint .

		Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	's protean '' Sesame and Lilies '' ap - pears in still another form , this time in that of Messrs.
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons ' thoroughly artistic `` Elia Series . ''

		The volume contains the preface to the original edition , and also the one written by Mr.
Ruskin	PERSON	in
1871	DATE	.

		It is clearly printed on deckel - edge paper , and bound in full , umber-colored ooze calf ; and altogether we do not recall a prettier handy edition of this sweet and suggestive book .

		The benighted souls who have not read M. Dau - det 's '' Tartarin of Tarascon '' will do well to pro- cure without delay a copy of
Messrs. T. Y. Crowell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	's pretty and convenient edition of that rollick - ing work .

		The translation is an excellent one , and the artist has succeeded very well in delineating the whims and humors of the good Provencal Quixote or
Sancho Panza	PERSON	, one scarcely knows which .

		The volume is nicely bound in green and gold , and looks as if it were worth double the money asked for it .

		A tempting little book in a showy binding of crimson and gold is '' Old -
World Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- , a collection of twenty Japanese folk-tales re - told by Mr.
Frank Rinder	PERSON	and tastefully illustrated by Mr.
F. H. Robinson	PERSON	.

		The author has made his selections with a view rather to their inherent charm and beauty as stories , than to their interest from the f olk-lorist 's standpoint ; and he has re-worded them nicely .

		The volume makes an exceedingly pretty gift-book for young readers . ''

		Broken Notes from a Gray Nunnery '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by
Julia Sherman Hallock	PERSON	, is the not very luminous title of a vague little booklet con - taining , apparently , the year 's journal little day - to-day jottings from
January	DATE	to
January	DATE	, as to the changing seasons , the birds , plants , etc. , and the writer 's moods and fancies of a lady -LRB- dare we guess , a maiden lady ? -RRB-

		who lives in the country .

		Some of the entries display a vein of pleasing senti - ment ; and the little sprays of flowers , leaves , etc. , strewn through the text , are nicely executed .

		The remaining holiday books , which the limita - tions of space force us to dismiss in a more sum - mary fashion than many of them deserve , include the following works : '' The Oxford Miniature Scott '' -LRB-
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , being the poems of the great nov - elist , printed on
Oxford India	ORGANIZATION	paper , and filling five volumes , neatly boxed ; '' In Friendship 's Name '' and `` What Makes a Friend ? ''

		-LRB-
Lamson	PERSON	-RRB- , being new editions of Mr.
Volney Streamer	PERSON	's pretty an - thologies ; '' The
Helen Jackson	PERSON	Year-Book '' -LRB- Rob - erts -RRB- , selected by Miss
Harriet T. Perry	PERSON	; `` The Whittier Year-Book '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with a good por - trait '' cet 78 '' ; '' Dr.

J. R. Miller	PERSON	, the author ; '' The Spectator in

		BOOKS FOR THE YOUNG .

		II .

		It is hard to tell what the children would do without Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's contributions to their entertainment .

		Much as he writes for their elders , he never forgets the little people , and as regularly as Christmas comes round he sends them a literary gift .

		This year he sends two , so that all tastes may be satisfied . ''

		The Red True Story Book '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- seems the more interesting to one of the untutored elders , whose travels no longer take him into fairyland ; although there will doubtless be plenty of boys and girls to disagree with such a judg - ment .

		To these the realm of Prince
Prigio	PERSON	will be far more real than the
South Africa	LOCATION	of to-day or the
France	LOCATION	of the fifteenth century ; truth is so much stranger than fiction , and these tales of heroism and self-sacrifice are so much more romantic than any manufactured stories .

		What could be more splendid , more thrilling , than this story of ''
Wilson	PERSON	's Last Fight , '' as told here by Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	?

		The magnificent mettle of these men , and their brave acceptance of their fate , called forth from the Zulu chieftain who slaughtered them the tribute that '' they were men who died like men , men whose fathers were men . ''

		This human document is followed by Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's narrative of the '' Life and Death of
Joan	PERSON	the Maid , '' and the nobility of her dis - interested devotion to her country is vividly brought out .

		Aside from these , the stories for the most part are unfamiliar but eminently worthy of enduring fame .

		A few tell of heroes whose deeds are mentioned in the histories that children study , but without the detail that makes them picturesque and vivid .

		For the purpose of bringing these stories to life , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's compilation is valuable .

		Mr.
Henry J. Ford	PERSON	illustrates the book with many spirited drawings .

		In '' My Own Fairy Book '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , Mr.
Lang	PERSON	for the first time invents his own fairy stories and tells them in his own way .

		The ancient kingdom of
Pantouflia	LOCATION	is his scene of action , and about it , he says , very little is known . ''

		The na - tives speak German ; but the Royal Family , as usual , was of foreign origin .

		Just as
England	LOCATION	has had Nor - man , Scottish , and at present a line of German mon - archs , so the
Kings of Pantouflia	ORGANIZATION	are descended from an old Greek family , the
Hypnotidse	PERSON	, who came to Pan - touflia during the Crusades .

		They wanted , they ex - plained , not to be troubled with the Crusades , which they thought very injudicious and tiresome .

		The crest of the royal house is a Dormouse , dormant , proper , on a field vert ; and the motto , when translated out of the original Greek , means ` Anything for a Quiet Life . '

		But all this is only in the preface , which all well-regu - lated children will skip in order to plunge at once into the romantic adventures of Prince
Prigio	PERSON	and his son Ricardo .

		The first of these gifted princes was endowed at his birth with many fine qualities , but the last of the fairies maliciously declared that he should be `` too clever . ''

		The story of the loneliness which this gift brings upon him is told with so much humor and such delightful paradoxes that little people can easily per - suade their elders to read it aloud to them .

		In spite of the bad fairy , however , everything turns out happily , for the Prince marries a wife who is wise enough to say to him , '' Now , could n't you take the wishing cap , and wish to be no cleverer than other people ?

		Then every - body would like you ! ''

		The Prince obediently consents ; but when it comes to the point , he can not quite make up his mind to the sacrifice .

		So , thinking that every man has one secret from his wife , he puts on the cap and says , '' I wish to seem no cleverer than other peo - ple . ''

		And he lived happily ever after .

		A new book by the author of '' Captain
January	DATE	'' and '' Melody '' is welcome , and though this one lacks a little of their fine simplicity , it has still the power to charm .

		Mrs.
Laura E. Richards	PERSON	's style is easy and graceful , and her character-drawing , though on broad lines , is good . ''

		Nautilus '' -LRB-
Estes & Lauriat	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with its gay decorative cover , is the story of a Spanish ship , laden with treasure of shells and sea-products , which sails up a
New England	LOCATION	river to the amazement of a quiet little town .

		The contrasts are effective , and the plot developed by them is interesting .

		The cuts by Mr.
W. L. Taylor	PERSON	are capital `` My Honey '' -LRB- Rob - erts -RRB- , by the author of '' Miss Toosey 's Mission , '' is a charming novel without sentimentality .

		It is designed for older girls , and the writer 's knowledge of character and delicacy of perception make it a good thing for them to read .

		There is nothing goody-goody about the heroine .

		She is made of clay with a heart of gold ; and the refining and ennobling influence of the fine old man who develops her conquers at last her obstinacy , and brings out the lovely qualities of her nature .

		She is vividly alive , and the writer succeeds in making us believe in the essential beauty of her character .

		One could hardly judge of the nature of '' Subject to Van - ity '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- by its title , for it contains a series of sketches of domestic animals .

		Written by Miss
Margaret Benson	PERSON	, a sister of the author of '' Dodo , '' it will make an attractive present to a child who is fond of pets .

		The writer understands her subjects thoroughly , and , what is of more importance , can make them entertaining to her readers .

		There is nothing dull in the little book , and the style is delightful .

		A book that belongs especially to our own country is '' Children 's Stories in American Literature , '' by Hen - rietta
Christian Wright	PERSON	-LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		It contains brief and interesting studies of the lives and works of sixteen of the more prominent writers .

		In one way or another , the writer strives for picturesqueness even at the expense of truth .

		She neglects her opportunities in this respect , however , when she utterly ignores
Poe	PERSON	's faults of char - acter , and makes him good and conventional .

		One could wish for a finer sense of truth than this indicates , and a greater confidence in the childish intellect .

		It is worse than useless to conceal the fact of evil from chil - dren , and to make gods for them of very human heroes .

		The truth is much more helpful in the end , and much more interesting The '' Arabian Nights '' are unus - ually popular this year , if one may judge from the fact that two volumes derive their stories from that source .

		One of these has already been noticed by us , and the second contains '' Sinbad the Sailor , and
Ali Baba	PERSON	and the Forty Thieves '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		The translation of Mr.
Edward William Lane	PERSON	has been followed in the first , 394 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, and of the Rev.
Jonathan Scott	PERSON	, in the second .

		The decorative drawings , by Mr.
William Strang	PERSON	and Mr.
J. B. Clark	PERSON	, are exceedingly clever , and the stories them - selves are always young .

		The nature of '' Stories from English History '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is sufficiently explained by its title .

		It forms the second part of the series by the Rev.
A. J. Church	PERSON	, and carries the reader from the time of Richard II .

		to that of Charles I .

		The period is full of romance , which the writer does not make the most of ; the tales are prosaically told .

		But the mate - rial is carefully handled , and the book will give boys a much clearer idea of Hotspur and
Jack Cade	PERSON	, the King - maker and Essex and Sir
Walter Raleigh	PERSON	, than he can gain from the ordinary school history .

		The books for girls this year are not quite so numer - ous as those for boys , but in these modern days when women appropriate men 's prerogatives , we can not ex - pect the girls to leave tales of adventure unread .

		Rightly speaking , all books for the young are for both sexes and it is only for convenience in grouping that they are divided .

		It would be a pity if girls only were to read the '' Stories and Poems for Children '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton -RRB- , by
Celia Thaxter	PERSON	, yet the book seems to belong primarily to them .

		There is a poetic delicacy about the tales which is charming , but makes some of them a trifle complicated for young readers .

		The first story is an exquisite little idyl about a '' spray sprite '' who loved the '' shifting , musical , many-colored sea . ''

		The other tales are less fanciful , and contain much informa - tion about birds and insects , cleverly disguised and touched with color by Mrs.
Thaxter	PERSON	's imagination .

		The verses are less poetic than the stories , and show an im - perfect sense of rhythm ; but they are close to nature , and permeated with the love of birds and flowers .

		Children , however , are quickly responsive to the really great poetry of the world , and are given too little of it .

		One of the prettiest stories of the year is '' A Child of
Tuscany	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- by Miss
Marguerite Bouvet	PERSON	.

		It tells of a little Italian boy , stolen in babyhood by a woman of the people who brought him up and loved him .

		It begins when he is six years old and tries to sell flowers in the city .

		Miss
Bouvet	PERSON	weaves a graceful tale about his adventures and his strange restoration to his own family , one that keeps the interest throughout .

		The book is well printed and bound , but the decorative drawings are better than the pictures Even prettier in its binding and illustrations and general make-up is '' A Last Century Maid , and Other Stories for Children '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Anne Hollingsworth Wharton	PERSON	.

		The stories , too , are capital , quaintly told with a touch of archaism that helps to carry one into the past .

		There is a glimpse of colonial life , and , by way of novelty , an introduction to some good and generous Indians .

		The story that one of them tells is delightfully romantic without being terrible , and the entire book has a cer - tain gentleness and peace about it .

		A new edition of '' Gypsy 's Cousin Joy '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Elizabeth Stuart Phelps	PERSON	, should be welcome to all girls who like a fresh , wholesome , vigorous story .

		It is thirty years since the book was written , and thirty years are a severe test of popularity .

		But the girls of to-day will find '' Gypsy '' quite as attractive as their mothers did before them , and the work is worthy of being brought to their attention .

		The illustrations would be good if
Miss Clark	PERSON	's drawing were not defective The new uniform edition of Mrs.
Molesworth	PERSON	's stories is contin - ued by the publication of '' The Carved Lions '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- .

		The illustrations , by
L. Leslie Brooke	PERSON	, are capital , and the type and paper are excellent '' Oak - leigh '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- , by
Ellen Douglas Deland	PERSON	, is an at - tractive story of family life , for older girls .

		The plot hinges upon the rebellion of five children against their father 's second marriage , and their unfair struggle with the new mamma .

		The latter 's gradual conquest of their hearts is prettily told , with a knowledge of human na - ture .

		It is a pleasure to add that the pictures by
Alice Barbar Stephens	PERSON	are charming Miss
Julia Magruder	PERSON	, the author of '' The Princess
Sonia	PERSON	, '' has done a kindly service for the young in selecting the '' Child Sketches from George Eliot '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		She has taken the children bodily from the great novels , adding a para - graph here and there to explain the situation , but leav - ing the extracts untouched .

		To
Tom	PERSON	and
Maggie Tul	PERSON	- liver the greatest space is of course given ; but the Poy - ser children , the Garths , the little Cohens ,
Effie	PERSON	, and Job Tudge , are not neglected .

		The book will furnish an excellent method of interesting children in
George Eliot	PERSON	and giving them a desire to read more of her work .

		Although some of the drawings are by
R. B. Birch	PERSON	, they can not be much commended ; and the others , by
Amy Brooks	PERSON	, are far from artistic .

		Mrs.
Cheney	PERSON	's '' Number 49 Tinkham Street '' -LRB- McCiurg -RRB- is a story of friendship .

		A boy who belongs to a well-to-do family becomes interested in an Italian organ-grinder , and takes him into his heart and home .

		The introduction of the Italian boy to the Sunday-school and to the happiness of a quiet home is followed by a gradual softening of his nature and a change from boisterous and evil ways .

		He is not convincing , though , this boy of the slums ; he is too easily turned into unfamiliar paths .

		The house which gives its name to the book is a social settlement , which this boyish friendship is instrumental in founding .

		The influence of the story is sweet and gentle , but the char - acters are too uniformly good .

		Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Champney	PERSON	has two books this year .

		One of them , '' Witch Winnie at
Versailles	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , follows that popular heroine through her studies and pleasures in the historic city named .

		Yet the book is not so much a story of Winnie as of the men and women who have made
Versailles	LOCATION	famous .

		Their romantic histories , interwoven with
Winnie	ORGANIZATION	's life , make the book pleasantly instructive .

		It is illustrated with reproductions of famous portraits . ''


Paddy O'Leary	PERSON	and his Learned Pig '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a real story artistically told .

		Mrs.
Champney	PERSON	shows herself appreciative of the agreeable side of the Irish charac - ter , its generosity , its adroitness , its wit .

		Paddy is a genuine boy , and a very clever one .

		His brogue is de - lightful , and his story is told with a rollicking humor which will recommend it to boys and girls alike .

		In '' A Flock of Girls and Boys '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ,
Miss Nora Perry	PERSON	has published ten stories for the young ; but there is a flavor of snobbishness about them that makes them harmful reading .

		It is not that she makes the snobs triumphant , rather the reverse ; but she emphasizes class distinctions in a way that should never be brought to a child 's attention .

		Social position and wealth are given too great importance ; and though the moral of the first tale is intended to be wholesome , it is not in the least so , as it makes the heroine succeed because of her possession of these advantages .

		The story leaves one with a bad taste in the mouth , and a desire to keep it away from the American girl .

		In her other tales ,
Miss Perry	LOCATION	is somewhat more democratic .

		It would be a mistake to confine '' Aunt
Billy	PERSON	, and Other Sketches '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Alyn Yates	PERSON	1895 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 395
Keith	PERSON	, to children , such insight do they show into hu - man nature .

		They are slight things , episodes , charcoal drawings ; but they have character and are drawn with style .

		The few pages given to Aunt
Billy	PERSON	make her stand out vividly before us , and the writer has a nice discrimination in selecting her material .

		The cover of the book is pretty .

		In `` A Sherburne Romance '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- ,
Miss Amanda M. Douglas	PERSON	has yielded to the requests of the admirers of her '' Sherburne Series '' to give its heroine a love story .

		It is pleasantly writ - ten , but whether such sentimentalities are good for young girls is hardly an open question .

		If they are to read such things at all ,
Thackeray	PERSON	and
Dickens	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	would be infinitely better .

		From these they can at least acquire some knowledge of life and of literature .

		Mr.
W. O. Stoddard	PERSON	gives his attention this year to girls , and they will be grateful to him . ''

		The Partners '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a hearty , healthful , whole - souled story , which the boys will certainly not leave to their sisters if they once catch sight of it .

		Nelly is a breezy girl with no lack of pluck and generosity , and she does more than her share of work in the world with energy and enthusiasm . ''

		The Mushroom Cave '' -LRB- Rob - erts -RRB- , by Miss
Evelyn Raymond	PERSON	, combines a good deal of scientific information with a pleasant home story of a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	family .

		The characters are human and nat - ural , and the slight quaintness of their speech lends a charm to the book .

		It has incident enough , too , is writ - ten in good style , and the decorations by
Victor A. Searles	PERSON	are very clever .

		`` Girls Together '' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- , by Miss
Amy E. Blanchard	PERSON	, is what one might call a '' talky '' book .

		It is written almost entirely in dialogue , which makes it lively but does not prevent it from being diffuse .

		The English is not of the best , and when books for the young are sophisticated enough to marry off their heroes and heroines , one can not apply juvenile standards to them .

		That kind of thing re - quires genius to make it acceptable to youth .

		And one does not find genius in `` Cousin Mona '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Rosa Nouchette Carey	PERSON	.

		It is about a prig of a girl , who tells her own story and shows in detail how kind and self-sacrificing she is , and how narrow and uninteresting .

		Her noble scorn of the ordinary weak - nesses of humanity is not exactly worthy of emulation .

		But she takes care to make the moral good , and to show that virtue in her own disagreeable person is ade - quately rewarded .

		Miss Grace Le
Baron	PERSON	's story of '' Little Daughter '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a blithe little narrative of a kind-hearted girl . ''

		Dorothy and Anton '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- is likewise written for small children , and
Miss A. G. Plympton	PERSON	has made it a sequel to '' Dear Daughter Dorothy . ''

		It is a charming little tale of an American girl in
Berlin	LOCATION	, a child who is generous with - out being self-conscious , and frank and natural without being sophisticated .

		She is a fresh and childish little creature , who awakens our interest in her friendships and kindnesses , and our sympathy for her ambitions .

		The illustrations are rather good . ''

		Katharine 's Yes -
terday	DATE	, and Other Christian Endeavor Stories '' -LRB- Loth - rop -RRB- , by Mrs.
Grace Livingston Hill	PERSON	, is written for older girls .

		But there is very little human nature in these girls who reform suddenly and completely and change their ill-humor into gentleness and tolerance .

		They may be enjoyed possibly by the girls who are already perfect , but no other could be led by them into right - eousness .

		A book that has no touch of life in it is fruit - less The Elsie Books '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- are continued by ''
Elsie	PERSON	's Journey on Inland Waters , '' in which Miss
Martha Finley	PERSON	describes further excursions of her little party through the World 's Fair and over the great lakes .

		The talk is stilted , but there are as usual many historical narratives about places the chil - dren see and characters suggested by them `` A Jolly Good Summer '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- is a continuation of a series by Mrs.
Mary P. Wells Smith	PERSON	.

		It is a pleasant home story of American children , who , though not unnaturally perfect , have good instincts and happy lives .

		Sophie
May	DATE	's books are familiar to many little people who have grown into big people since they read them ; but some of them retain even now an affection for the names of Dotty Dimple and
Little Prudy	ORGANIZATION	.

		The present volume is in the series called '' Little Prudy 's Children , '' and bears the title of ''
Kyzie Dunlee	PERSON	, a Golden Girl '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		It is a fresh , wholesome , breezy little story , which can be heartily recommended to all small girls who love to know what other small girls are do - ing . ''

		The Kanter Girls '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , by Miss
Mary L. B. Branch	PERSON	, is one of the prettiest of the current books , so attractive are Miss
Helen Maitland	PERSON	Arm - strong 's decorations and pictures .

		It is a fanciful story of two little girls who come into possession , through the intervention of a generous bluebird , of some rings which have the power of making them invisible .

		With these at hand they have strange adventures and go off on curious journeys , and the writer who tells us of them has skill and imagination enough to keep our interest awake and active .

		The books for the little folk are not numerous this year , but the most conspicuous of them is a picture-book containing '' The Adventures of Two Dutch Dolls '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- .

		The colored cartoons were made by Flor - ence
K. Upton	PERSON	and the words by
Bertha Upton	PERSON	.

		The verses are not as rhythmical as they might be , but they are unimportant in comparison with the pictures .

		These are clever , relating in comical fashion the adventures of two Dutch dolls on Christmas Eve , the one night in the year when such creatures taste the joys of life But the pleasure the little people will take in '' Little Miss Phoebe Gay '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Miss
Helen Dawes Brown	PERSON	, will last much longer .

		It is a charmingly fresh little tale of a charmingly fresh little girl , and is han - dled by the author with a kind of sparkling gayety .

		The cleverest thing in it is perhaps the chapter where little Miss Phoebe Gay pretends to be ill in order to escape learning the names of the rivers in
China	LOCATION	, with the result that they are forever fixed in her memory .

		`` There is something queer about thoughts , '' she re - flects ; '' you can not have a good time with them if you have done anything naughty .

		I do not say that I had been naughty , but I do say that my thoughts that morning behaved as if I had been . ''

		The cover and pictures by Mr.
S. J. F. Johnston	PERSON	are capital A pretty book is `` Dear Little Marchioness '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is a story of the yellow fever epidemic in
Memphis	LOCATION	, written by one who ministered to the sick during that terrible time .

		The horror , however , is only suggested , and the effect in spite of it is of gentleness and peace .

		The old darkey is a good bit of character-drawing on broad lines There is character , too , in '' The Young Pretenders '' -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , by Miss
Edith Henrietta Fowler	PERSON	.

		These children are not puppets , set up to be shifted about and made to gesticulate at the whimsical will of the author .

		They have an independent life of their own , and their emotions are not always cut and dried to order .

		They are delightfully mischievous , and `` Babs '' is a veritable fascinator `` Young Master 396 -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
Kirke	PERSON	'' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is by Miss
Penn Shirley	PERSON	, the author of '' Little Miss Weezy , '' and that popular maiden appears again in these pages .

		The little family is taken down to
Mexico	LOCATION	, and the writer gives one too slight a glimpse of that picturesque country . ''

		Frow - zle the Runaway '' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- , by Miss
Lily F. Wessel	PERSON	- hoeft , is described on the title-page as a fable for chil - dren ; but it is merely a pleasant , wholesome story , which takes a dog for a hero , wisely enough , too , for dogs are so often more heroic than boys .

		Messrs.
Roberts	PERSON	publish three little books by
Miss M. Carrie Hyde	PERSON	, which are cleverly illustrated by Mr.
Victor A. Searles	PERSON	. ''

		Under the Stable Floor '' is a romance of the rat king - dom ; `` Goostie '' of a pathetic little waif of humanity ; and '' Yan and Nochie of Tappan Sea '' tells the story of some Dutch children who were transplanted to this country early in the century .

		Miss
Hyde	PERSON	's style is good , and she knows so well how to evolve an enter - taining story that children will welcome her into their kingdom .

		In spite of the many books for boys mentioned in our previous number , a few must still be added to the list .

		A profitless undertaking was that of Mr.
Elbridge S. Brooks	PERSON	in searching out '' Great Men 's Sons '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- and writing their lives .

		It is almost always a disap - pointment to learn of the sons of distinguished men , so rarely have they done anything worth recording .

		Mr.
Brooks	PERSON	's style is light and even gay , but one feels all the time that he is making an effort to be bright and picturesque .

		With these subjects he has some difficulty in compassing it .

		The book is well and abundantly illustrated , and carries one from
Socrates	LOCATION	to
Napoleon	LOCATION	.

		The children are indulged with a share of the cur - rent fads , and therefore they are presented with '' The Boy Life of Napoleon '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , adapted and enlarged from the French of
Madame Eugenie Foa	ORGANIZATION	.

		The sub - ject could not well be more interesting , for there is much in the story of the Conqueror 's youth that sug - gests his later triumphs .

		And if
Mme. Foa	ORGANIZATION	has enlarged a little upon the truth , she has not perverted it , and she has made a readable narrative Captain
Charles King	PERSON	,
U.S.A.	LOCATION	, knows how to make an entertaining story , and the boys will be glad that he has turned his attention to them . ''

		Trooper
Ross	PERSON	and Signal Butte '' -LRB-
Lippin	PERSON	- cott -RRB- gives them two stories containing plenty of sol - diers , Indians , and cowboys .

		The first story is the quieter of the two , but Captain King knows his material and his audience , and he furnishes spirited tales .

		A second book by Mr.
George Manville Fenn	PERSON	relates to the English civil war . ''

		The Young Castellan '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- is written chiefly in dialogue and relates en - tirely to adventure .

		A boy who likes the clash of arms will be absorbed in this book . ''

		The Boy Officers of 1812 '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is written by Mr.
Everett T. Tomlinson	PERSON	, who wishes to give his readers a conception of that struggle , in the belief that it will '' lead to an increased patriotism . ''

		But the English of the book is so bad that even such a result does not seem worth while at the expense of reading it .

		`` A Lieutenant at Eighteen '' -LRB-
Lee & Shepard	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the third of the series of `` The Blue and the Gray , on Land , '' by
Oliver Optic	PERSON	, and the Rebellion is an absorbing subject to boys . ''

		The Knight of Liberty '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a tale of the fortunes of
Lafayette	LOCATION	, always a fascinating figure .

		Mr.
Hezekiah Butterworth	PERSON	writes the narrative of
Lafay	PERSON	- ette 's young life , and his work in
America	LOCATION	, in a spirited manner .

		He leans somewhat too much , however , to - wards eulogy .

		Emigrants and axes , Indians and toma - hawks , are the materials with which one 's blood is cur - dled in looking at the frontispiece of ''
Chumley 's Post	ORGANIZATION	, a Story of the Pawnee Trail '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
William O. Stoddard	PERSON	.

		And it will give as good an idea as any words of the nature of this thrilling tale .

		It is necessary to add , though , that if anyone likes that kind of work , Mr.
Stoddard	PERSON	does it well '' The Young Cascarillero '' -LRB-
Lothrop	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Marlton Down	PERSON	- ing , takes one into
Ecuador	LOCATION	; while the second story in the same book , by Mr.
Harry W. French	PERSON	, tells of the startling adventures of a globe-trotter `` The Hobble - dehoy '' -LRB- Lothrop -RRB- , by Mrs.
Belle C. Green	PERSON	, and `` The Missing Pocket-Book '' -LRB-
Coates	PERSON	-RRB- , by Mr.
Harry Castle	PERSON	- mou , are not quite so wildly thrilling .

		The former is a good piece of work , and its hero is at the most awk - ward age , just between boy and man . ''

		The Brown Ambassador '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Hugh Fraser	PERSON	, is a strangely contrived story most effectively told .

		The vacation of an English boy with some strange relatives is the basis of the action ; and
Donald	PERSON	is met at the station by a brown ambassador in the shape of a dachs - hund .

		This intelligent animal is so well trained that he speaks the English language and gives the boy a surprising welcome .

		Donald 's embarrassed introduc - tion to the family is cleverly conceived , and his later experiences with man and beast have an agreeably ro - mantic flavor .

		The scene of the perilous sleep-walking is even poetic .

		But the book has rather too much of ghosts and intrigue to be entirely healthful for children .

		A thrilling tale of revolution in
Nicaragua	LOCATION	, by Mr.
Herbert Hayens	PERSON	, is called '' Under the Lone Star '' -LRB-
T. Nelson & Sous	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		We open the book at random upon the sentence , '' One glance told me that escape was im - possible . ''

		And yet he did escape to write chapters with such hair-raising titles as '' Unearthing a Con - spiracy , '' A Struggle for Life , '' '' A Death-Trap , '' and '' Hemmed In . ''

		These will give a sufficiently vivid idea of the nature of the book '' The Sheik 's White Slave '' -LRB-
Lovell , Coryell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Raymond Raife	PERSON	, is of much the same calibre .

		But the heroes of this tale try to unravel the mysteries of a temple in a city of the desert .

		The extraordinary adventures which are the result of this effort are too impossible to be ex - citing Some decidedly blood-curdling pictures in - troduce us to '' How
Jack Mackenzie	PERSON	Won His Epau - lettes '' -LRB-
T. Nelson & Sons	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Gordon Stables	PERSON	, Surgeon of the
Royal Navy	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a story of the Crim - ean War , and the author declares it to be '' all true , sadly , terribly true . ''

		There are many stories of brav - ery on the field ; but there are also others of the courage necessary to patient endurance and rigorous training .

		A boy will learn from the book that other qualities are required for a soldier besides fearlessness in the excite - ment of battle . ''

		A Lost Army '' -LRB-
T. Nelson & Sons	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Frederick Whishaw	PERSON	, tells of the Russians in
Central Asia	LOCATION	; and `` Leaves from a Middy 's Log '' -LRB-
T. Nelson & Sons	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Arthur Lee Knight	PERSON	, is quite as adventurous .

		There are still quieter books for boys , however , some that are less exciting and less feverish .

		But whether ''
Joel	PERSON	, a Boy of
Galilee	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Roberts	PERSON	-RRB- is one of these or not , is hard to determine .

		It is certainly simpler and calmer , but in a different way it is quite as thrilling .

		Written by
Annie Fellows Johnston	PERSON	, and illustrated tol - erably well by
Victor A. Searles	PERSON	, it describes the expe - rience of a lame boy who lived in the time of Christ .

		He is himself cured by the Lord ; he is in the boat when He stills the storm , and he witnesses others of the
1895	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 397 miracles .

		He knows nothing of the Crucifixion until it is over , but the description of the earthquake and of his discovery of the crime is impressive .

		The story is told without undue emotion , but its attitude towards Christ is too familiar .

		A book dealing with the same sub - ject is
Mary Hastings Foote	PERSON	's '' Life of Christ for Young People '' -LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- .

		But it will never be read by the young , so didactic and uninteresting is it , and so impossible for continuous reading is the form of ques - tion and answer which it adopts .

		To parents and to Sunday-school teachers , however , it will doubtless be useful , as it is accurate and carefully compiled .

		The title of ''
Sunday	DATE	Reading for the Young '' -LRB-
E. & J. B. Young & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- sufficiently explains its character .

		It is a large book , containing many illustrations and stories and descriptions of all kinds .

		But a book of this kind may do more harm to a boy 's literary taste than good to his heart .

		The bound volume of ''
Harper	PERSON	's Round Table '' for
1895	DATE	-LRB-
Harper	PERSON	-RRB- is full of delightful things for boys and girls .

		It is an excellent periodical , well-written , and well illustrated ; and it contains wholesome food enough to satisfy the most exacting young appetite .


Peter Newell	PERSON	's drawings alone should make it popular , so rich are they in originality and humor .

George Augustus Sala	PERSON	, who was born in
1828	DATE	, died on the seventh of this month .

		He was essentially a journalist , and produced journalistic work of almost every conceivable sort from war correspondence to cook - books .

		He was also the founder of '' Temple Bar , '' and , later , of the short-lived weekly , '' Sala 's Journal . ''

		He did nothing to entitle him to a place in literature , vol - uminous as was the output of his pen .

		The
December	DATE	number of the '' Midland Monthly '' has for its chief feature an illustrated article upon some of the literary folk now living in
Chicago	LOCATION	, the work of Mrs.
Mary J. Reid	PERSON	.

		The writer has been at consider - able pains to collect material for this article , and , although she has omitted some names that ought to have been included , and does not in her discussion show a due sense of proportion , her account is amiable , and , for the most part , just .

		The centenary of the birth of
Thomas Carlyle	PERSON	was celebrated at his birthplace ,
Ecclefechan	LOCATION	, near Dum - fries ,
Scotland	LOCATION	, the other day .

		A large number of wreaths were sent from all parts of
Great Britain	LOCATION	and the Continent , one of them being presented by Emperor
William	PERSON	of
Germany	LOCATION	, with the inscription : '' In memory of the writer of the
Life of Frederick the Great	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		A meeting was held at
Chelsea	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, where the Car - lyle house in
Cheyne Row	LOCATION	, which was bought with money subscribed in
England	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	, was formally handed over to the trustees .

		Mr.
John Morley	PERSON	pre - sided and made an address .

		The following note is from a recent number of the ``
Japan	LOCATION	Mail , '' published at Tokio : `` Mr.
Miyake Yu	PERSON	- jiro , joint editor of the Nippon-jin , ' has an interesting article on the late
Oliver W. Holmes	PERSON	, a writer hitherto little studied in this country .

		Mr.
Miyake	PERSON	tells his countrymen that in the great American poet they will certainly find much to enjoy and admire .

		He draws attention to a remarkable coincidence in conception and tone between ' The Last Leaf ' and a celebrated poem by the Chinese scholar Liu Ting-che .

		The two pieces are published side by side .

		The resemblance is really striking , all the more so in that the American author could never by any possibility have possessed a knowl - edge of the Chinese writer 's verses . ''

		The
Modern Language Association of America	ORGANIZATION	, which is to meet at
New Haven	LOCATION	from the 26th to the 28th of this month , offers an attractive programme of papers , among which we note : '' The Conventions of the Drama , '' by Professor
Brander Matthews	PERSON	-LRB- a paper prepared for the
Twentieth Century Club	ORGANIZATION	of
Chicago	LOCATION	a year or more ago -RRB- ; '' English as a Living Language , '' by Professor
James Morgan Hart	PERSON	; ``
John Wesley	PERSON	's Translations of German Hymns , '' by Professor
J. T. Hatfield	PERSON	; '' The Comparative Study of Literature , '' by Professor
Arthur R. Marsh	PERSON	; ''
Richardson	PERSON	and
Rousseau	PERSON	, '' by Professor
B. W. Wells	PERSON	; `` Chaucer 's Development in Rime-tech - nique , '' by Professor
G. Hempl	PERSON	; The Italian Novella , '' by Dr.
Mary A. Scott	PERSON	; '' Troilus and Criseyde , '' by Pro- fessor
Thomas R. Price	PERSON	; and `` Fiction as a College Study , '' by
Professor Bliss Perry	ORGANIZATION	.

		The large number of papers on the culture side of modern language study makes this programme noteworthy , and emphasizes a healthful tendency .

		We have had all sorts of wild suggestions concerning the appointment of a new Poet Laureate .

		One of the later and more sensible expressions of opinion on the subject is that made by the `` Saturday Review '' in the following terms : '' The Laureateship is still unfilled , and there is a great deal more to be said for than against the abolition of an office which is really an awkward survival in this modern world of ours ; but if 398 -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, we must have a Laureate , there is no one better fitted for the post than Mr.
Patmore	PERSON	.

		There are good reasons why Mr.
Swinburne	PERSON	and Mr.
William Morris	PERSON	would not care to accept the Laureateship , and so among the greater poets there is no one left except Mr.
Patmore	PERSON	.

		It would be a graceful and a wise thing if Lord
Salis	PERSON	- bury , should he decide against the abolition of the office , were to offer to this great religious poet and noble moralist an office which Mr.
Patmore	PERSON	, a staunch Con - servative and lover of the old order , could accept with - out any loss of dignity .

		This would save the appoint - ment from the jostling and conceited crowd of minor poets and poetasters who are struggling for it ; while it would mark the growth of faith and the decline of un - faith in our time that the author of ' The Unknown Eros ' should be the Laureate of a nation at heart so deeply religious as our own .

		THE DIAL 403 GRAND WINTER CRUISES BY THE MAGNIFICENT TWIN-SCREW EXPRESS STEAMERS OP THE HAMBURG-AMERICAN LINE .

		FOR several years past the
Hamburg	LOCATION	-
American Line	ORGANIZATION	has arranged cruises at certain seasons , placing at the disposal of travellers one of its floating palaces , and affording them all the comforts and luxuries of modern life .

		These cruises have become so popular with the American travelling public that the Company has made them a permanent feature of its service .

		THE FIRST CRUISE will be by the
Twin-Screw Express Steamer FURST	ORGANIZATION
BISMARCK	LOCATION	, Captain
Albers	PERSON	, sailing from
New York	LOCATION
January 28 , 1896	DATE	, to
MADEIRA	LOCATION	, the MED - ITERRANEAN , and the ORIENT .

Palermo	ORGANIZATION	,
Naples	LOCATION	,
Genoa	LOCATION	, and return to
New York	LOCATION	.

		The cruise from
New York	LOCATION	to the Orient and return to
New York	LOCATION	will occupy about ten weeks .

		Pas - sengers desiring to prolong their stay in
Europe	LOCATION	before returning to
America	LOCATION	may leave the excursion upon touching at
Genoa	LOCATION	the second time and take any one of the Hamburg-American Line 's Express Steamers from
Hamburg	LOCATION	,
Southampton	LOCATION	, or
Cherbourg	LOCATION	, to
New York	LOCATION	, up to
August 1 , 1896	DATE	.

		Ever since the childhood of the human race the
Mediterranean	LOCATION	coasts have played the most important part in the history of advancing civilization .


Greece	LOCATION	has bequeathed to us her precious legacy of art and poetry ,
Rome	LOCATION	has given us her grand representatives of patriotism and statecraft ,
Egypt	LOCATION	has filled our souls with thrills of awe and wonderment , the Holy Land has inspired us with lofty sentiments and relig - ious fervor .

		All along the blue
Mediterranean Sea	LOCATION	we find the indelible imprints of man 's past , the glo - rious monuments of antiquity .

		The whole scenery of ancient history unrolls before our eyes , not in artistic reproduction , but in all its realistic grandeur and glory .

		The memories of such a trip , the sights of the scenery of the most remarkable events of man 's history , will remain for a lifetime in the soul of every beholder .

		THE SECOND CRUISE will be by the
Twin-Screw Express Steamer COLUMBIA	ORGANIZATION	, Cap - tain Vogelgesang , sailing from
New York	LOCATION
January 25 , 1896	DATE	, to the WEST INDIES and the SPANISH MAIN .

		The Itinerary will be : From
New York	LOCATION	and Old Point Comfort to Port au Prince -LRB-
Hayti	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
May	DATE	- agues -LRB- Porto Rico -RRB- ,

Venezuela	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Kingston	LOCATION	-LRB-
Jamaica	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Havana	LOCATION	, Key West , Old Point Comfort , and
New York	LOCATION	.

		This tour lasts about four and a half weeks , and offers American tourists a most attractive and com - fortable means of escaping the bitter blasts of our rigorous Northern winters .

		A glance at the itinerary suggests at once tales of romance and adventure , recalling many a famous exploit of dead-and-gone worthies .

		But it also presents to the mind a vista of smooth seas and lovely palm-covered beaches , of beautiful scenery and strange peoples , offering an ever-varying and inexhaustible fund of novelty to divert the mind and charm the senses .

		In cruising from port to port in these en - chanted seas , among verdant and flower-clothed islands , nature is seen in her brightest and most beautiful mood , and life in the tropics at its best .

		It would be difficult , indeed , to imagine any attribute of an ideal winter resort not found among these '' Fortunate Isles . ''

		CABLE CONNECTION WITH ALL PORTS TOUCHED ON THIS CRUISE .

		8 ^ THE TIME AT EACH PORT IS AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO VISIT ALL PLACES OF INTEREST .
