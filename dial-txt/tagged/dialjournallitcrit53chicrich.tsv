		29 CONVENTION MUSINGS .

		The political doings of the past fortnight would seem to provide a suitable occasion for a few reflections upon the relation between lit - erature and life , or upon the revelations of national character which are made during sea - sons of excitement both of which subjects come within the scope of a journal like ours .

		From a literary point of view , one of the two opposing chieftains in the factional republican struggle now happily past its first crisis may be regarded as a negligible quantity , whose writings are likely to be preserved only in some future edition of '' Messages of the Presidents '' preserved and entombed , as is the fate of such compositions .

		But with the other the case is different .

		Not only is he the '' contributing editor ' * to a popular organ of sterilized culture , but he is also an author of respectable rank , whose dozen or more volumes have rightfully earned for him the distinction of election to the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters , making him one of the Fifty whose names are -LRB- more or less -RRB- household words in circles where intellectual and artistic interests are held to be of importance .

		He illustrates , among other things , the danger , which ever lurks in the path of the politician , of expressing views in print which it is afterwards most inconvenient to have tactless persons recall for the purpose of refuting his latest set of opinions out of his own mouth .

		It must be indeed galling to a candidate for popular favor , after he has formulated and ex - pressed the life-long convictions that are clearly demanded by the exigencies of his immediate political situation , to be confronted with quota - tions from his own books , in which diametrically opposite convictions are voiced with the same apparent fervor and sincerity .

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	has experienced this sort of discomfiture on many occasions , and has be - come an adept in the art of defending his own reversals of judgment , and making the worse appear the better reason when expediency coun - sels such a logical masquerade .

		A correspon - dent of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Nation '' has recently given him a fairly hard nut to crack , shaken from the tree of his earlier writings .

		The pas - sage is from the life of
Gouverneur Morris	PERSON	, who , we are told , '' Denounced with a fierce scorn that they richly merit , THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, the despicable demagogues and witless fools who teach that in all cases the voice of the majority must be implicitly obeyed , and that public men have only to carry out its will , and thus ' acknowledge themselves the willing instruments of folly and vice .

		They declare that , in order to please the people , they will , regard - less alike of what conscience may dictate or reason approve , make the profligate sacrifice of public right on the altar of private interest .

		What more can be asked by the sternest tyrant of the most despicable slave ?

		Creatures of this sort are the tools which usurpers em - ploy in building despotism . '

		Sounder and truer maxims never were uttered . ''

		The appeal from
Philip	LOCATION	drunk to
Philip	LOCATION	sober which this citation prompts has now , however , to reckon with a conscience so elastic and a sophistry so barefaced that they dare attempt to justify such a shameless act as the rape of
Colombia	LOCATION	in defiance of every dictate of inter - national good faith .

		The only plea ever made by the author of that outrage in its extenuation is that it was committed '' to please the people . ''

		Those who are not satisfied with this plea or with its author 's attempts to justify many another in - defensible act or tortuous policy , have no need to echo the wish '' that mine adversary had written a book . ''

		The books are there , for anyone to read , and they throw a most revealing light upon the workings of the opportunist mind to which principles are but playthings , or pretexts for the exercise of ingenious casuistry .

		The game is too easy in this case , for their author has himself furnished a running ironical com - mentary upon most of the incidents of his later career .

		Literature provides many suggestive parallels to the words and acts of the now discomfited leader .

		The Homeric student will be reminded , here of Achilles sulking in his tent , there of Thersites and his railings .

		The satire of Juvenal and the indignation of Tacitus find in him a predestined mark .

		Milton supplies many apt texts , such as '' The strongest and the fiercest spirit That fought in heaven , now fiercer by despair , '' and '' His form had not yet lost All her original brightness , nor appeared Less than archangel ruined , '' which seems to fit the leader 's case ; or these that might be applied to his frenzied supporters in the Convention : '' The universal host upsent A shout that tore hell 's concave , and beyond Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night , '' and '' When night Darkens the street , then wander forth the sons Of Belial , flown with insolence and wine . ''

		In the mouthings of
Jack Cade	PERSON	,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	has limned the demagogue for all times , and
Cade	ORGANIZATION	's declared purpose to hang all the lawyers is only a blunt way of stating the hatred of legal restraint which has been so ominous a feature of the recent agitation against the constitutional safeguards of order .

		Shelley 's '' Mask of Anarchy '' yields the following stanza , which is not without its suggestiveness : `` And he wore a kingly crown ; And in his grasp a sceptre shone ; On his brow this mark I saw 1 1 am God , and
King	PERSON	, and Law ! ' ''

		Perhaps the most apposite of all these literary parallels is that to be found in
Dante	LOCATION	's '' Para - diso , '' where the poet is informed by Cacciaguida of the evil company into which he is destined to fall , and is told that he will be well-advised to become his own political party . ''

		Of its besti - ality , its own procedure will give the proof ; so that it will be seemly for thee to have made thyself a party by thyself . ''

		Turning from the aggressive personality which has been so conspicuously to the fore of late , and looking at the Convention turbulence as a reve - lation of national character , we are prompted to some grave reflections .

		After making a liberal allowance for the exuberance of youth and the ebullition of party feeling , after indulgently ac - counting for many distasteful happenings on the ground that a large section of the American public regards politics as a form of sport , and has no inclination to deal with it in a serious and sober fashion , there nevertheless remains a condition which should give pause to our optim - ism and lead us to a searching self-examination .

		Is it really necessary , even in a presidential year r that reason should abdicate almost altogether in favor of impulse and emotion ?

		If we let our - selves go in this fashion too often , may we not some time be carried so far that our balance will be regained only at the terrible cost of bloodshed and the overthrow of social order ?

		We got into that position half a century ago , and the results were appalling .

		Civilization at best is but a thin crust beneath which the primal forces of human nature greed and passion are seeth - ing in the effort to find vent .

		Whoever seeks to weaken that restraining shell has small appre - ciation of the forces that may be unloosed if it once breaks .

		We are at all times nearer than we think to '' Red ruin , and the breaking up of laws . ''

		The Anglo-Saxon peoples have ever prided themselves on their self-restraint upon critical occasions , and in their devotion to the principle
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL of '' laws , not men '' in the ordering of their political life .

		But the English people were rudely aroused from their pharisaical self - sufficiency by the ugly demonstrations of '' mafficking , '' and who can say that , under a similar excitement , the American people would not lose their heads to even more disastrous effect ?

		That '' added drop of nervous fluid '' which
Colonel Higginson	PERSON	used to talk about as differentiating us from our English cousins may sometime prove a menace to our social stability .

		We already enjoy the international reputation of being a strikingly lawless community , and our statistics of homicide are so appalling that we can not comtemplate them without hiding our heads in shame .

		The frenzied passions , the charges and counter-charges , and the con - tempt for law , that have characterized this Convention period have been deeply humiliating to all sober-minded Americans , who have felt like exclaiming '' A plague on both your houses ! ''

		to the two political parties and to the two warring factions in each of them .

		The spectacle has not only been humiliating but ominous , and few can have failed to be reminded of the resemblance to the situation which a quarter of a century ago came near to over - throwing the French Republic in the interests of
General Boulanger	ORGANIZATION	, and which sixty years ago witnessed its actual overthrow by a self - acclaimed '' savior of society . ''

		Not a few of us have trembled at the possibility that this chap - ter of French history might be provided with a parallel in the history of our own republic .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE GENDER OF BOOKS is sometimes as marked as the gender of human beings .

		Some books have a masculine strength , and some a feminine grace and tenderness . ''

Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' though written by women , are marked by virility rather than by femininity . ''

		The Essays of Elia '' and `` Marius the Epicurean '' do not fall in the class of rugged masculine books ; no one would place them beside Borrow 's `` Lavengro , ''
Burton	PERSON	's `` Pilgrimage to Al-Madinah and Meccah , '' or
Scott	PERSON	's Waverley novels * Certain studies , too , have the softness of the gentle sex rather than the hardness of the sterner one .

		Professor
Earl Barnes	PERSON	, discours - ing in the
June	DATE	``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' on `` The Feminization of Culture , '' finds what seems to him rather disquieting evidence that our system of education is losing its virile qualities and becoming unduly feminine in character .

		He considers it `` taken for granted that , in education , feminization means emphasis on languages , literature , and history , as opposed to mathematics , physics , chemistry , and civics . ''

		In general , the abstract presents itself to him in female garb , the concrete in male attire .

		The fine arts are , of course , feminine , the sciences masculine .

		Sta - tistics from high schools and seminaries for the
last two decades	DATE	are examined by the writer , and he finds that the study of
Latin	LOCATION	, for example , has in that time increased fifteen per cent , French four per cent , German thirteen per cent , European history twenty-seven per cent , and English literature -LRB- since
1901	DATE	-RRB- seven per cent .

		Physics , chemistry , physical geography , physiology , and civics have all fallen off at rates varying from three to fifteen per cent .

		`` A careful study of these figures , '' he maintains , `` must convince any fair-minded person that our school cur - riculum , even in the secondary field where women 's control is least complete , is moving rapidly in the direction of what we have called feminization . ''

		Nevertheless , it is probable that not all his readers will allow their slumbers to be disturbed by this demonstration of tendencies in current culture .

		There is a grain of comfort in the fact that not even the difficulties of Latin have caused a decline in its vogue , nor the easiness of French greatly increased the popularity of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's tongue .

		Latin has gained fifteen per cent , and the rugged Teutonic tongue has gained thirteen .

		English literature , the `` softest snap '' of all , has advanced only four per cent in ten years .

		And even if the whole statistical showing were much more impressive than it is , can - not the finer qualities of manhood as well as the more admirable qualities of womanhood be nurtured on gentle studies ?

		Must one study bridge-building and mining engineering in order to escape becoming a milksop or a mollycoddle ?

		But perhaps the best reply to the alarmist is now being made by
Minnesota	LOCATION	, where more than fifty thousand persons are taking university extension courses , in which such mascu - line studies as sociology and economics are enjoying the highest favor .

		BRINGING BOOKS TO BOOKLESS PEOPLE to the dwellers in rural communities whose remoteness from public libraries deprives them almost wholly of library advantages is just now a subject of very lively interest in the library world .

		It was the dom - inant theme at the
Convention of County Librarians	ORGANIZATION	held in connection with the
June	DATE	meeting of the
California State Library Association	ORGANIZATION	at
Lake Tahoe	LOCATION	.


California	LOCATION	has recently enacted some very good laws for systematic `` library extension '' work in that
State	ORGANIZATION	through the agency of County Free Libraries , under whose direction books are sent to remote commu - nities , very much as letters are sent there by the
Rural Free Delivery	ORGANIZATION	.

		This system has now been on trial long enough to make the detailed reports of its practical operation , such as were presented at the
Lake Tahoe	LOCATION	conference , of special significance .

		The system is of course still in its experimental stages as to details and methods , but the intelligent and often enthusiastic reports of those who have been engaged in the work leave no room for doubt as to its gen - 8 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, eral success and its future importance as a branch of the general system of popular education in this coun - try .

		Particularly telling , and often touching , were the instances related of the joy and gratitude of people living in remote mountain regions , to whom the arrival of a dozen books is an event in the life of a community whose hunger for books could hardly be met in any other way than by these periodical dis - pensations from the county library .

		It was noticeable at the
Tahoe	LOCATION	meeting , as at other recent gatherings of librarians , that problems of library administration received but scant attention , matters relating to the widening of the library 's sphere and the extension of its benefits being clearly in the foreground .

		This was illustrated throughout the reports and discus - sions , and was the key-note of an excellent talk on the influence of museums and art-galleries as auxil - iaries of the public library , by Mr.
C. S. Greene	PERSON	, of the
Free Public Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Oakland	LOCATION	.

		A LITERARY EVENT of an unusual nature , and , in strict accuracy , more an athletic than a purely liter - ary event , was the spirited contest , on
Lincoln Field	LOCATION	at
Providence	LOCATION	, between the forces of `` The Brown Herald '' and `` The Brunonian , '' in a game of base - ball , umpired by the president-elect of
Amherst Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege , Dr.
Alexander Meiklejohn	PERSON	, who with the close of the present academic year relinquishes his office of Dean at
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	to assume the larger duties awaiting him at the sister institution in the
Connecticut	LOCATION	valley .

		His election to the
Amherst	LOCATION	presidency may itself be regarded as an event in the world of letters , so ardent a zeal has he shown for that form of learning which is something more than a mere vocational training or specialist 's grind .

		Dis - approving the increasing latitude of the elective sys - tem , which , he is said to have declared , has brought with it `` educational chaos , '' he can not but find him - self heartily in accord with
Amherst	LOCATION	's spirit of reac - tion and of reversion to the older ideals of liberal culture .

		It was Dr.
Meiklejohn	PERSON	who took the initia - tive in shaping the new course at
Brown	PERSON	leading to the degree of bachelor of philosophy , a course which he tersely described as '' a vigorous attempt to single out and to require the most significant and funda - mental elements of human culture . ''

		Another quo - table utterance from the same source , delivered in an address before the
Brown	PERSON	alumni of
Boston	LOCATION
last year	DATE	, will here be not out of order .

		`` I have lately heard a correction of an old saying , ' You can drive a horse to water , but you ca n't make him drink . '

		` No , ' it was added , ` but you can make him thirsty . '

		Just so you ca n't force boys into learning , but if your zeal be hot enough you can develop a thirst .

		To do that is to win . ''

		... THE MYSTERIES OF LIBRARIANSHIP let the word `` mysteries '' be here understood in its Greek sense are probably mysteries indeed to .

		the great general public , no large fraction of whom ever gets so far toward an initiation into them as to give them even a passing thought .

		Library administration , systems of cataloguing , shelf-listing , accessions-lists , charging systems , fixed location , decimal classifica - tion , all these and many other terms familiar to the initiated are vague or meaningless technicalities to those unversed in library science .

		Consequently a sentence or two from the current '' Circular of
Infor	ORGANIZATION	- mation '' issued by the
Library Training School of the Carnegie Library	ORGANIZATION	of
Atlanta	LOCATION	one of our most ac - tive and enterprising institutions of the sort , despite its location in the sultry South may have for the casual reader the charm at least of novelty .

		Under `` Course of Study '' it is announced that `` especial attention is given to administrative work , including the study of plans for small buildings and the details of organization of new libraries continually springing up in this section . ''

		Also , '' In addition to the strictly technical subjects the course includes the study of the English novel , tracing its sources ; the appraisal of fiction , English and foreign ; the survey of the li - braiy field , enabling the students to keep pace with the leading movements of the library world ; field work , consisting of visits of observation to other libraries ; and the history of printing . ''

		Almost a liberal education is here outlined , one would say , and not simply a narrow technical training out of touch with the warm and living interests of hu - manity at large .

		THE CAUSE OF CULTURE IN THE SOUTH has of late received much encouraging support , both moral and material .

		Conspicuous among recent gifts of money is the fund of a
quarter-million dollars	MONEY	voted by the
General Education Board	ORGANIZATION	to the
George Peabody College for Teachers	ORGANIZATION	, at
Nashville	LOCATION	, in memory of the life and work of the late Dr.
Seaman A. Knapp	PERSON	, the organizer of cooperative demonstra - tion work , the promoter of boys ' corn clubs and girls ' canning clubs , the successful fighter against the boll weevil , and the advocate of diversified farming , deeper ploughing , and increased stock - raising .

		This same Teachers ' College , which is the successor to the
Peabody Normal College	ORGANIZATION	, but planned on a larger scale , has lately received
one million dollars	MONEY	from the
Peabody Educational Fund	ORGANIZATION	, and other considerable gifts from the state , the county , and the city in which it is situated .

		Also , the trustees of the Peabody Fund , who have voted `` to close the Trust and to distribute the moneys remaining in their hands , '' have offered to endow the
College	ORGANIZATION	with an additional gift of half
a million dollars	MONEY	, provided that before
November 1 , 1913	DATE	, the
College	ORGANIZATION	raise the further sum of
one million dollars	MONEY	.

		The graduates themselves * , teachers earning salaries that average not over
four hundred dollars	MONEY	a year , have pledged themselves to raise a fifth part of this required million , but for the remaining four-fifths the wealthier friends of
Southern	ORGANIZATION	education are asked and expected to open their purses .

		A '' State - ment and Appeal , '' signed by the Hon.
Joseph H. Choate	PERSON	and the Hon.
Samuel A. Green	PERSON	for the Trustees of the
Peabody Educational Fund	ORGANIZATION	, invites subscriptions , and requests that all communications

James C. Bradford	PERSON	,
Chairman Executive Committee	ORGANIZATION	,

Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		THE SCHOLAR 'S CONSCIENCE ought to be pecul - iarly sensitive , inasmuch as he , far more than the un - thinking , uncritical , carelessly observing person , has abundant opportunity to learn from his studies how futile and foolish in the long run are all evasions of either intellectual or moral truth , all dishonorable sub - terfuges , all attempted short-cuts to the good things of life .

		And yet we who use public libraries know that we have among us not a few book-thieves who pass in the world as persons of liberal culture .

		Even the highly-educated and intellectually-accomplished biblioklept is not unknown .

		On the open shelves near the centre desk in
Bates Hall	PERSON	, at the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, are temporarily displayed the more recent accessions in literature of a more serious and scholarly character than the average reader is inter - ested in ; and to these shelves resort each day the serious and the bespectacled students whom such a display naturally attracts .

		But , as is regretfully recorded in the library 's latest Report , `` the loss of books by theft from these shelves , affecting as it does new books , just published and in active demand , has become so great that , in the public interest , a new arrangement with some limitation upon freedom of access is required .

		It is proposed to place such books upon guarded shelving in the delivery room , immediately under the control of an attendant , to permit anyone to examine them upon request , but to require the use of a call slip before they can be re - moved to the reading tables . ''

		Not even the soothing conjecture that these thefts have been mostly effected by the unscholarly for purposes of pecuniary gain is tenable , since the perforated stamp and other marks of ownership make the books difficult of sale .

		It must be sadly admitted that a love of good literature is not incompatible with schemes for its unlawful acquisition .

		... AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION LAUNCHED WITH A WARNING to the public to think twice before pat - ronizing it would seem destined , according to the theories of our modern promoters , to a short and circumscribed career .

		Yet
Mount Holyoke Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege , which plans to celebrate in
October	DATE	next the seventy-fifth anniversary of its founding , was first advertised on a strictly look-before-you-leap basis .

		In a pink-covered pamphlet that bears the imprint of
South Hadley	LOCATION	,
1835	DATE	,
Mary Lyon	PERSON	wrote : `` It is very desirable that friends of this cause should carefully consider the real design of founding this institution before they use their influence to induce any of their friends and acquaintances to avail themselves of its privileges . '' ''

		Harmless cumberers of the ground '' were notified that they would be persona non grata , in the new type of woman 's school .

		It was `` to meet public , not private , wants '' ; to send forth women `` to exert power over society which can not be exerted by mere goodness without intellectual strength . ''

		Such a type of school ap - pears to have required a good deal of explanation to make the idea of it intelligible to the public of
1837	DATE	.

		So perhaps its hard-headed builder did well to fling out warning rather than inducement .

		Otherwise the young
Mount Holyoke	ORGANIZATION	might have been swamped under a rush of utterly unfit students ; and the edu - cational world , instead of gathering in
October	DATE	to honor this first small beginning of colleges for women , would pass heedlessly over the grave of another idea born too soon .

		THE SHY '' HOMER OF THE INSECTS , '' as the au - thor of '' The Life of the Bee '' and '' The Blue Bird '' has called the nonagenarian French naturalist ,
M. J. Henri Fabre	PERSON	, whom Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	has styled `` the wisest man and certainly the best read in the books of nature of whom the centuries have left us any record , '' is likely soon to become better known than at present to the English-reading world through the issue of a complete edition , in our language , of his fascinating '' Entomological Memories . ''

		A nona - genarian he is not quite yet , to be accurate , for he was born in
1823	DATE	, but the indications point encour - agingly to his attainment of that and even of a riper age .

		The story of his lowly birth , of his long strug - gle with poverty before he could devote himself to his beloved insects , of his shyness and his panic-fear of public recognition , and of his warm attachment to his native
Provence	LOCATION	, rivals in interest anything that his own gifted pen has produced .

		His life , like all great and noble lives , has had its keen dis - appointments , its crushing sorrows .

		In his struggle to win the independence that should leave him at liberty to pursue his chosen studies , he was once on the verge of an important invention that promised him a handsome fortune .

		He had perfected a process for extracting dye from the madder , a fac - tory was being built , and an assured income seemed all but within his grasp , when a heartless chemist discovered a cheap artificial substitute for the nat - ural dye , and all the high hopes of the entomologist fell to the ground and thus was wrought , it may be , a fortunate deliverance from the clutch of com - merce ... A GREEK PLAT IN THE OPEN AIR , after the man - ner of the ancients , was one of the commencement events of the season .

		The young ladies of Rose -
mary Hall	PERSON	, at
Greenwich	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, presented the `` Alcestis '' of Euripides , in Mr.
Arthur S. Way	PERSON	's excellent metrical version , under the trees of the school orchard , and , let us imagine , to the accom - paniment of the feathered musicians there having their abode .

		Not the least interesting feature of the entertainment was the devotion of the pecuniary proceeds ` to the newly-planned
Connecticut College for Women	ORGANIZATION	.

		The recent exclusion of women from
Wesleyan University	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- at
Middletown	LOCATION	-RRB- has made it necessary for
Connecticut	LOCATION	girls desiring a college edu - cation to seek it beyond the borders of the
Nutmeg State	ORGANIZATION	.

		Agitation for a girls ' college within these borders was started by certain
Hartford	LOCATION	women of light and leading , and ere long the movement spread 10 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, over the commonwealth until
New London	LOCATION	felt prompted to offer a site for such a college , with a grant of fifty thousand dollars .

		Acceptance of this generosity was not slow to follow , and then Mr.
Morton F. Plant	PERSON	contributed a handsome endowment fund of a
million dollars	MONEY	.

		A commensurate building fund is now the crying need , and it was to help raise this that the Greek play was presented by the stu - dents of
Rosemary Hall	PERSON	.

		WELL-EARNED ACADEMIC HONORS TO MEN OF LETTERS are to be noted as one glances over the sea - son 's list of degrees conferred ; and no one has more richly deserved the decorative letters indicating such honors than Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, who is now entitled to write `` L.H.D. -LRB-
Princeton	LOCATION	-RRB- '' after his name .

		`` The dean of the guild of belles-lettres in
America	LOCATION	'' is Prince - ton 's appropriate designation of the distinguished author .

		No less appropriately it characterizes Dr.
James Ford Rhodes	PERSON	as `` our first living American political historian , '' and emphasizes the characteri - zation by making him a doctor of laws .

		Of course in both these instances this is a betitling of the already much-betitled , and one is reminded of the witty re - joinder of another eminent man of letters -LRB- our fore - most Shakespeare scholar , to be more definite -RRB- who , on having his attention called to the fact that he was decorated with about all the coveted academic initials in vogue , but was not yet a
D.D.	LOCATION	, instantly replied : `` Oh , I am that too ; I 'm d d deaf '' a rejoinder to which the ear-trumpet , carried now for some weary decades by the speaker , gave manifest point ... A NORMAL COURSE IN LIBRARY TRAINING is announced as a new departure at the
Pratt Institute School of Library Science	ORGANIZATION	.

		The purpose of the course , which will first be offered in
1912-13	DATE	, is `` to prepare students to teach in library schools , to take charge of training classes or school depart - ments in public library systems , and for librarianship in normal schools or other educational institutions where courses in library science are given .

		The experience of those who have had to seek trained library workers who are also qualified to teach library science shows that the required combination of qualifications is extremely difficult to find among the members of the profession .

		Furthermore , there is an increasing number of positions to be filled due to the development of library schools and the grow - ing demand for trained service in all libraries . ''

		A descriptive outline of the course is issued by the school .

		... ONE WAY TO ADVERTISE A PUBLIC LIBRARY , a Way that will not have occurred to all librarians , comes to our attention in turning the interesting pages of the ''
Minnesota Library Commission Library Notes	ORGANIZATION	and News . ''

		In the
June	DATE	number a news item from
Owatonna	LOCATION	reports that `` the librarian has been doing some effective work in advertising the library throughout the county .

		One of the ministers at
Deerfield	LOCATION	devoted a
Sunday	DATE	sermon to the Library and its work , and distributed the leaflets ` Do n't be a quitter . ' ''

		The library and the school are becoming every day more closely and usefully affiliated ; why , then , may not the library and the church join forces , wherever practicable and as opportunity pre - sents itself , in the work of mental and moral uplift ?

		COMMUNICA TION .

		SHAKESPEARE IN JAPANESE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		One evidence of the universality of the genius of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is to be found in the fact that his dramas are translated into so many different languages all over the world .

		This is true not only of the Indo-European tongues that are so nearly related to the English , but also of Semitic and Turanian languages that are not thus closely related to our own .

		It seems to be an axiom that
Shakespeare	PERSON	put into expression the common uni - versal human feelings , which can be translated from one language to another without great difficulty .

		This is not saying that literal translation is possible .

		It is , of course , necessary to adapt more or less , accord - ing to circumstances , to cut out , to add , to explain .

		Absolutely literal word-for-word translations are much less in vogue than formerly ; it is not the form , but the spirit , that is important . ''

		The letter killeth , but the spirit giveth life . ''

		This is the sort of translation of Shakespeare that Dr.
Tsubouchi	PERSON	is giving to the Japanese .

		He is himself a fine Shakespearean scholar , sensitive and appreciative ; and he seems to know how to interest others , for his lectures on Shakespeare at
Waseda University	ORGANIZATION	are so popular that students scarcely have standing room .

		Dr.
Tsubouchi	PERSON	has recently published his fourth trans - lation of a Shakespearean drama .

		The first three were '' Hamlet , '' '' Othello , '' and ''
Romeo	PERSON	and Juliet '' ; and the fourth is ''
King Lear	PERSON	. ''

		He has also translated portions of other plays , such as `` The Tempest , '' '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	, '' etc. .

		We have often thought that the Japa - nese would take naturally to ''
King Lear	PERSON	, '' because the motive of filial piety is so strong in
Japan	LOCATION	and other countries of the
Orient	LOCATION	.

		We have doubted whether '' Romeo and Juliet '' would be successful here , unless the sentimental love-scenes were toned down and modi - fied considerably on the stage .

		It has been suggested , not without reason , that , '' as
Japan	LOCATION	has so recently emerged from the feudal age , '' '' the modern Japanese can understand the spirit of
Elizabeth	LOCATION	's time better even than the present-day peo - ple of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		The same writer also says : `` That Shakespeare has taken deep root in the dramatic soil of
Japan	LOCATION	is evidenced by the remarkable interest that has recently been shown in the great English dramatist . ''

		The court scene in '' The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' is one in which Japanese actors feel not a little at home , partly on account of the formalities demanded by the occasion .

		And a man in
Portia	LOCATION	's part as a lawyer is not out of place !

		It is pleasant to be able to add , in conclusion , that the work of Dr.
Tsubouchi	PERSON	meets with suitable recogni - tion .

		The newly organized
Institute of Literature	ORGANIZATION	and Arts made its very first award , in the forms of a diploma , a bronze medal , and the sum of
2,200 yen	MONEY	-LRB-
$ 1,100	MONEY	-RRB- , to this great Shakespearean scholar .

		* But for the fact that
Henry Demarest Lloyd	PERSON	was not yet born when the words were uttered ,
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	might have had him in mind when he said : `` The face which character wears to me is self - sufficingn ess .

		I revere the person who has riches ; so that I can not think of him as alone , or poor , or exiled , or unhappy , or a client , but as perpetual patron , benefactor , and beatified man . ''

		In her life of her brother , now , nearly nine years after his too - early death , issued in two handsome volumes , a beautifully appreciative and in every way worthy tribute to his memory , his sister draws with the hand of sympathy and affection the noble outlines and the lovable traits of a character such as might well prompt one to exclaim , paraphrasing the old poet , `` He had his faults , perhaps ; I wish I had them too ! ''

		In his biographer 's words , '' his personality was happily so proper an expression of his spirit that men and women loved him at first sight .

		Some who saw him only once spoke of him ever after with a kind of exaltation .

		Many loved him who never saw him , as one who said , ' I never had the un - speakable joy of looking upon his face . ' ''

		Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	was born
May 1 , 1847	DATE	, the first child of
Aaron Lloyd	PERSON	, minister of the Dutch Re - formed Church , and
Maria Christie Demarest	PERSON	.

		It was at the home of his mother 's father ,
David Demarest	PERSON	, in
Sixth Avenue	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, that he achieved his entrance into the world , and in that city most of his early life was passed .

		There he went to school and college , and there he prepared himself for the practice of the law .

		His father , having no pulpit at the time , had tried to make a living as a bookseller , starting an ''
Olde Booke	PERSON	Store '' in Nassau Street , and afterward remov - ing to busier Broadway .

		But it was a hard fight , and the boys of the family had to work their own way in large part .

		The
Mercantile Library	ORGANIZATION	gave them employment out of school-hours , and at the same time ministered to their love of read - ing .

		good of humanity , engrossed his attention and left him little time or inclination for the narrower field of the law .

		In fact , his '' first case , '' as he called it , did not come to him until
1902	DATE	, when the anthracite coal miners ' strike enlisted his sympathies and he took part in the proceedings of the arbitration court at
Scranton	LOCATION	.

		His work as a journalist , largely as a writer of editorials on questions of the day , began in
New York	LOCATION	, but was continued in
Chicago	LOCATION	from the
autumn of 1872	DATE	, when he formed a connection with the `` Tribune `` of that city , beginning as a paragraph - writer , then being placed in charge of the liter - ary department , and before many years rising to the dignity of leader-writer .

		But the things for which he will long be remembered are the unpaid and at the time too little appreciated services rendered to his fellow - men wherever they were seen to be in need of an eloquent and fearless advocate and champion .

		The Pullman strikers , the
Spring Valley	ORGANIZATION	miners , the so-called anarchists of the
Haymarket	LOCATION	trag - edy of
1886	DATE	, the struggling
People 's Party	ORGANIZATION	of a few years later , the workers for municipal own - ership of public utilities , these and other fighters found in him a valiant leader whose utter disre - gard of his own personal interests is illustrated by his cheerfully risking the loss of fortune and the estrangement of friends which did not fail to follow upon his defense of the unfortunate men who suffered capital punishment because of the explosion of a bomb thrown by an un - known hand .

		It was impossible for him not to take sides with the under dog ; and - Mrs.
Lloyd	PERSON	was always with him , heart and soul .

		When the probability of her father 's extreme displeas - ure at her husband 's course was pointed out to her , she replied : '' Do you suppose that any such consideration will stop
Henry Lloyd	PERSON	from doing what he believes is right ? ''

		The warn - ing , as appeared later , was no idle one .

		`` In conseqence of their course , the
Lloyds	ORGANIZATION	suffered the loss of fortune .

		Between
Henry Lloyd	PERSON	and his father-in-law there had always existed sincere respect and affection which made this honest difference all the more painful .

		Mr.
Bross	PERSON	declared that Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	had disgraced the family .

		The ample fortune was entailed to the grandchildren , and Mr. and Mrs.
Lloyd	PERSON	were not entrusted with the guardianship nor the care of the property of their children , a sting even more keen than the financial loss . ''

		In connection with Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's early and ardent espousal of the cause of labor , of the right of laborers to organize for mutual defense , it is worth while to quote here a few words defining his position as a peaceful but uncom - promising trades-unionist , or labor-unionist .

		To 12
THE DIAL	ORGANIZATION	-LSB-
July 1	DATE	, him , says his biographer , '' the labor movement was not a movement of hate , but of love . ''

		In his own words : '' It pities the man who can stand at the helm of any of the great concerns of modern industrial life , made possible only by the countless efforts , loyalty , and genius of thousands of his fellow men living and dead , and say , ' This is my business . '

		It says to him , ' This is not your business , not my business .

		It is our business . '

		... It pities him as robbing himself of the greatest joys and triumphs of leadership .

		It seeks to lift him from the low level of selfish and cruel milliouairism to that of a gen - eral of great cooperative hosts of industrial brothers . ''

		Probably there are many among Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's warmest admirers who would hesitate to go all the way with him in his enthusiastic champion - ship of the cause of labor .

		In defending the sympathetic strike he draws illustrations , or analogies , from history , and puts the case thus : `` Americans can not forget that
America	LOCATION	is free from
Great Britain	LOCATION	because
France	LOCATION	ordered a sympathetic strike .

		The negro is free because of the sympathetic strike of the North .

		What greater love hath any man than this , that he lay down his life for his friend ?

		The sympathetic strike in a good cause is orthodox Christian - ity in action . ''

		Following the successive events in Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's strenuous advocacy of the people 's rights , an advocacy that earned him his self - bestowed title of '' the people 's attorney , '' one is likely to receive the impression that he lived in an unusually troubled time .

		The financial panic of
1873	DATE	was followed by distress and unrest among the laboring classes .

		The year
1877	DATE	was so marked by the occurrence of strikes that at one time no fewer than ten governors were calling for national troops to suppress disorder .

		We are inclined to regard the present period as one of unprecedented dis - content and turmoil , and unquestionably there is reason for grave apprehension unless the growing antagonism between capital and labor can be softened and the selfish greed of million - airedom be made to listen to reason ; but even in the '' good old days '' there were problems of this sort in plenty , as the book under review makes abundantly evident .

		From a chapter devoted to the late Governor
Altgeld	LOCATION	, a cordial friend and admirer of Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	, a short passage of the latter 's writing calls for insertion here .

		`` I was an eye-witness of Governor
Altgeld	LOCATION	's conduct during the great Pullman strike of
1894	DATE	.

		... I spent a number of hours with him at the most critical point of those eventful
July days	DATE	.

		Almost universally the American desires to treat even a political opponent with fairness and trust , however sharply he may criticise his opinions and actions .

		Not one of those who are so volu - bly joining in the fashionable denunciation of
Governor Altgeld	LOCATION	on account of what they believe , upon informa - tion at second hand , to have been his attitude and be - havior at that time would indulge in this hue and cry if they knew the facts . ''

		The facts which the writer of the foregoing is able to cite in refutation of the familiar charges against
Altgeld	LOCATION	are nothing short of convincing , and they can not but leave the reader with a deep sense of the injustice suffered by one placed in a difficult public position , and with a feeling of admiration for the staunch friend who hastened to his defense .

		Concerning Mr.
Lloyd	PERSON	's best-known piece of writing , the fraud-exposing , greed-condemning '' Wealth against Commonwealth , '' there is here but little space to write .

		The sensation its appearance made is partly described in the fol - lowing : '' From all parts of the land there now came to him the warm response from an unknown host whose eyes had never looked into his .

		Into the study where he had wrestled with his task , there came words of blessing , gratitude , courage from men whose ideals rose to meet his own .

		He began to feel the beat of the people 's hearts .

		He woke to find his self-controlled method of recital producing the most startling effects .

		Men read the book with the same absorbing interest which as boys they gave to pirate stories .

		So exciting was it that they could read only a little at a time ... On all sides was echoed
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	's verdict , that it was an epoch-making book , an '
Uncle Tom	PERSON	's Cabin ' of the labor movement .

		... It startled many Americans out of that comfortable assurance that , having the franchise , their liberties were secure .

		To lawyers it was partic - ularly convincing .

		Ministers and writers preached and wrote upon it , thrilled with a sense of the peril before the Republic .


Robert Louis Stevenson	PERSON	decided to found a novel upon its disclosures .


John Burroughs	PERSON	said that after an hour 's reading he was so angry that he ' had to go out and kick stumps . '

		Those indeed were days when good men swore and even a minister confessed that he threw down the book and cried , < Damn those rascals . ' ''

		In illustration of the personal charm of this noble champion of the right who wore himself out at the age of fifty-six , and whose full tale of good works can not here be even epitomized , many passages might be quoted from the biog - raphy ; but one must suffice . ''

		He himself , free from the restraint of the public ear , lavishly gave his thought however radical and his hopes however lofty or shy .

		His talk was brilliant and fasci - nating , full of startling prophecy , firm in its convictions ; it was now hard as steel , and now tender .

		It seethed with indignation .

		It touched earth , firm-footed , and again it soared , in a creative flight , far off into theory .

		It was interesting to see him throw out the line of a theory tentatively , so that he might watch its impression on various minds , testing its value , even prankishly see - ing how near he could come to the quick of his hearer 's prejudices , tickling the talk , as it were .

		All was moreover touched with wit and suffused with grace and courtesy .

		Like
Emerson	PERSON	's wise man he went to this game of conver - sation ' to play upon others and to be played upon . ' ''

PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		OSCAR , WILDE CRITICALLY STUDIED .

		* Modern literary criticism loves the exception .

		It delights in types like
Wilde	PERSON	and
Verlaine	PERSON	; it is fond of flaunting its romantic individualism in a large contempt of prejudice .

		And being individualistic , it devotes itself all the more willingly to subjects in which a truly impartial attitude is to-day quite beyond our grasp .

		Thus Mr.
Arthur Ransome	PERSON	follows up his work on
Poe	PERSON	with `` a critical study '' of Oscar Wilde .

		The book is really an essay in biograph - ical interpretation .

		No man 's work , as Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	reminds us in his introductory chapter , can be treated as a mere disembodied result ; and , in the case of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	, `` whose books are the by - products of a life more important than they in his own eyes , '' a biographical criticism is `` not only legitimate but necessary . ''

		The method is none the less most discreetly employed : a spirit of moderation characterizes , in the main , this study of one who , in spite of his life , has a cer - tain importance in the history of contemporary literature .

		For the present influence of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	is beyond question .

		`` He has been translated into French , German , Italian , Spanish , Swedish , Yiddish , Polish , and Russian . ''

		-LRB- The statement prob - ably refers to separate works , possibly only to `` Salome . '' -RRB-

		In his own country , says Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	, '' he left no form of literature exactly * OSCAR WILDE .

		A Critical Study .

		By
Arthur Ransome	PERSON	.

		With portrait .


New York	LOCATION	:
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	.

		as he found it .

		He brought back to the English stage a spirit of comedy that had been for many years in mourning .

		He showed both in practice and in theory the possibilities of creation open to the critic .

		He found a new use for dialogue , and brought to
England	LOCATION	a new variety of the novel . ''

		And so the volume takes up , one after the other ,
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's various phases of literary activity , interpreting them by such reference to his life as the subject demands .

		The Poems receive a rather extended treat - ment .

		To be sure they constitute a literary debut , and every critic must take account of origins .

		Wilde 's origins were numerous : his verses echo nearly every poet whose note impressed his ear .

		Mere lyric exercises these , according to Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	, a parodic imitation which is in itself a form of criticism .

		But he overlooks the deeper significance of all this open plagiary , which makes
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's poetry a summary of the poetic tendencies of his age .

		Beneath all this epiphytic verse we see no mere literary disci - pline , but a real inability to derive poetic impulse or inspiration from life untouched by art .

		An unemotional temperament , I believe , we must surely call
Wilde	PERSON	, in spite of his sensuous - ness and his sensuality .

		Possibly the latter was the direct result of his frenzied search for emo - tion , which we may note , even in these early poems , turning him from the delights of the pagan world to the no less sensuous mysticism of his Catholic verses .

		However that may be , we shall all agree with Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	that this `` youthful '' volume of poems is `` too immediate an attempt to turn life into literature . ''

		It has suggested to others , as to him , that its author has now and again `` tried to make life simply for the purpose of transcribing it . ''

		But did he ever quite outlive this characteristic ?

		Those who doubt it may point to his `` aes - thetic '' period .

		Shades of
John Ruskin	PERSON	!

		It appears that
Wilde	PERSON	was sent to
America	LOCATION	, not primarily to lecture , but to ensure the success of '' Patience '' by giving the Americans a speci - men of the genus a3sthete to illustrate - the satire of the opera .

		Like
Gautier	PERSON	in the thirties ,
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	at this time was already famous for his eccen - tricities of dress his velveteen knee-breeches and his lace - trimmed shirts .

		So he came to
America	LOCATION	, and filled thereby his ever-gaping pockets .

		That accomplished , '' tired of prophecy and ready to take a part in a new play , '' he went to
Paris	LOCATION	, where he imitated Balzac down to his dressing-gown and jewel-set cane .

		The result of this visit was that Elizabethan pastiche , '' The Duchess of
Padua	LOCATION	, '' and `` The Sphinx , '' a `` rare 14 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, incantation , '' perhaps , but one which certainly contains a deal of Romantic rigmarole .

		Was it
Flaubert	LOCATION	,
Heredia	LOCATION	, or
Huysmans	PERSON	who inspired this curious production , wherein one can scarcely see the poem for the words ?

		Mr.
Ran	PERSON	- some does not tell us .

		So we must leave '' The Sphinx '' and follow
Wilde	PERSON	back to
London	LOCATION	an unintentional expatriate to whom Provi - dence had denied the boon of a Gallic nativity .

		Brought home by an empty purse , he resumes his lecturing , marries , becomes a book-reviewer , and edits `` The Woman 's World , '' gaining from all this journalistic work a lighter touch and a number of good paragraphs for which he will find a further use in his later books .

		He writes a few rather mediocre stories , imitates
Hans Chris	PERSON	- tian
Andersen	PERSON	in `` The Happy Prince '' and `` A House of Pomegranates , '' but imitates him with pen tempered in the far richer diction of
Gautier	PERSON	and
Flaubert	ORGANIZATION	.

		Decorative prose that is his new experiment , just as in `` The Sphinx '' he had anglicized decorative verse .

		And when , several years later ,
Wilde	PERSON	wrote '' The Picture of Dorian Gray , '' he calls it frankly `` an essay on decorative art , '' a book which '' reacts against the brutality of plain realism . ''

		Certainly `` Dorian Gray '' is not realistic .

		Yet it is modelled upon a Gallic type , probably '' A Rebours , '' and constitutes `` the first French novel to be written in the English language . ''

		We can allow this , if the phrase be limited to a certain kind of modern novel .

		Not all of our contemporary French fiction , however , is of the type of '' Dorian Gray . ''

		But we have outstripped our chronology .

		We must turn from this curious book , disre - garding , as our critic does , its pathological sig - nificance , and take up
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's work in literary criticism , which also derived much from his journalistic period .

		Half story , half essay , '' The Portrait of Mr.
W. H.	PERSON	'' may serve as a transition .

		And , like ''
Dorian Gray	PERSON	, '' the story has its biographical value ; in none of his work can
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	keep from self - portrayal .

		In another essay he defends Wainewright the murderer , perhaps with a prophetic intuition of his own destiny ; and then , in `` The Decay of Lying '' and `` The Critic as Artist , '' he brings together his decadent
Socrates	PERSON	and
Alcibiades	LOCATION	, the bril - liant sophist and the languid disciple of these essays in dialogue .

		Here , says Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	, we find `` the domi - nant mood of his life '' ; herein best of all may we taste `` that elixir of intellectual vitality that he royally spilled over his conversation . ''

		This is probably true ; at any rate these essays give us his whole aesthetic and literary theory .

		Criti - cism , for
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	, means `` the delicate adven - tures of the intellect , '' precisely the attitude of
Monsieur Anatole France	PERSON	, whose charming essays in dilettanteism had already begun to appear in `` Le Temps '' two years before .

		The fact might well be added to Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	's enumeration of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's French models .

		Furthermore , not only did
Anatole France	LOCATION	provide
Wilde	PERSON	the critic with a theory , but his `` Thai 's '' gave Wilde the dramatist the plot of '' La Sainte Courtisane . ''

		For in the drama , as elsewhere , this genius was not '' unready to work with bouts-rimes '' He knew the favorite characters of the French stage as well as the British , and he used them .

		Wilde was no respecter of dramatis personce .

		Of these characters he made mouth-pieces for his epigrams ; once more he finds a use for the puns that rose so readily to his Irish lips .

		Into these stage dialogues go all the paradoxes of his other works ; and when one notes the frequency of these repetitions , one is tempted to doubt the vitality of that conversational '' elixir . ''

		Cer - tainly '' The Importance of
Being Earnest	LOCATION	'' has little of the intellectual element in its laughter .

		Best of the comedies , because of its consistent triviality , across the footlights it produces the aching cheeks of farce .

		All this makes it hard to place '' Salome . ''

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	connects the play with the two early tragedies ; and reminds us that if
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	was a jester for love of money and popularity , he always preferred to think of himself as `` a person with magnificent dreams . ''


Maeterlinck	PERSON	, too , was dreaming in drama just then , and many of the qualities of that expression passed by some mysterious influence into
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's production .

		That fact may even account for its being written in French , as the most immediate vehicle of its morbid symbolism .

		In any case , '' Salome '' was not written in that language for
Bernhardt	PERSON	, but only offered to the divine
Sarah	PERSON	when she asked
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	for a play .

		Three French authors , it appears , had a hand in the revision of the text , the final touches being given by
Pierre Louys	PERSON	.

		But before '' Salome '' was presented ,
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's own life-drama had reached its climax , and he was serving a two-year sentence in Reading Gaol .

		Here he came into contact with physical pain , rebelled , and then yielded to its teaching , casting up accounts with himself in the introspective pages of '' De Profundis . ''

		Not that the book had any continuous practical relation to his life afterwards .

		No , it is a pure piece of artistic feeling , vivified by the emotional unity that pain
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 15 alone can give a nature such as
Wilde 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Re - pentance like that in ' De Profundis , ' '' observes Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	, '' is a guarantee of a moment of humility , but not of a life of reform . ''

		And once out of prison , he soon became a mere straw in the current of events , having lost once and for - ever `` his power of turning life into tapestry . ''

		It is a different Wilde that we have now , not a reformed one .

		The difference appears in the `` Ballad of Reading Gaol . '' '

		Within the prison walls he could still dream , as he did in '' De Profundis , '' of what his life to come might be ; now at last he knew what it was .

		It was a rude awakening , and the violence of the ballad does but reflect it .

		This delicate artist , this dilettante of emotion , has come into contact with pain , with a reality so harsh as to tear from him the cry of Marsyas .

		And so the decorative mood gives way to realism , a realism which is only partially obscured by the completion of the ballad in a more '' artistic '' mood .

		The result is interesting , because it shows
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's art for once deficient in unity .

		Thoroughly artificial in his conception of literature , a real emotion has almost shattered his lyre .

		Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	, it must be said , does not go so far as this .

		He is quite impressed with the '' Ballad of Reading Gaol , '' and pursues a long digression on what he calls `` kinetic '' and `` po - tential '' literature , which those interested in es - thetic theory may best peruse in his own words .

		They may also read his `` After Thought , '' with its discussion of
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's prose , of his love of admiration , and his virtuosity .

		`` He leaves three things behind him , '' says Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	, '' his legend , his conversation , and his works .

		... Much of his work fails ; much of it has already faded , but ' Intentions , ' ' The Sphinx , ' ` The Ballad of Reading Gaol , ' ` Salome , ' ` The Importance of
Being Earnest	LOCATION	, ' one or two of the fairy tales , and ' De Profundis , ' are surely enough with which to challenge the attention of posterity . ''

		The attention of posterity !

		Perhaps , if we take the word in its most immediate connotation .

		But for all but the greatest art there is no pos - terity , unless we consider the handful of scholars and writers of doctors ' theses who alone concern themselves with the secondary works of a bygone age .

		Wilde has his part in literary history as a precursor , but to believe that another century will occupy itself with him requires strong faith .

		He has no message for which he will be remem - bered , unless it be the one essay which is so ex - ploited by advancing socialism .

		He has artistic qualities , indeed ; he has beauties of style , but no style fades more quickly than one which is inspired by a pure love of decoration .

		The man , of course , will continue to have his interest for the pathologist , for the student of literary types , for the morbidly romantic person . ''

		Some day it will be possible to write of him , '' asserts Mr.
Ransome	PERSON	, `` with the ecstatic acquies - cence that
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	calls
Amor Fati	PERSON	, as we write of
Csesar Borgia	ORGANIZATION	sinning in purple , Cleopatra sinning in gold , and
Roberto Greene	PERSON	hastening his end by drab iniquity and gray repentance . ''

		The gods preserve us from all such ecstasy , no matter what the color-scheme !

		Various and changeable as moral codes have been and may be , the virtue of self-control must always remain at least a distinction .

		Possibly this is a narrow attitude .

		I have said that it is altogether too soon to claim impar - tiality ; one can only state one 's personal view .

		But as a critic of life and an exponent of a new '' philosophy '' of conduct , we have the right to adopt a personal standpoint toward
Wilde	ORGANIZATION	.

		As a representative of the last phase of a decadent Romanticism , its cult of sentiment transformed to a mere worship of sense and sense-impressions in themselves , we have the right to confront his theories with his life .

		As a socialist , an individualist , an intellectual dilettante without a concept of the social function of art , we have every right to judge him .

		And however a sen - timental or '' aesthetic '' liberal may bring him - self to disregard the life of this gifted degener - ate , he can not obscure the fact that
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, with his poses and his follies , has done more than any other writer to degrade the adjective '' artis - tic , '' and to further the growing contempt of the workaday world for art .

		16 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, nary shifting would no doubt take place among the objects at the focus of our attention .

		It is needless to specify the public issues that would be crowded toward the extreme margin of our field of vision ; among those that would continue to force themselves upon us insistently and pain - fully is that of the conservation of our human resources .

		Are we certain that our human re - sources are not going the way of our forests , the native fertility of our soils , our mineral wealth , exploited in haste and waste ?

		It is obvious enough that our industrial system draws largely upon human energy stored up under different conditions of life .

		Our own farms and villages , the rural districts of European countries , have provided us with an indispensable part of our industrial labor supply .

		How are we using this source of our power ?

		We know that among the waste products of our industry along with tailings , slag , and culm heaps are great numbers of men , women , and children with warped bodies and shattered nerves , with dulled intelligence and blunted morals , victims of the racking strain of the machine process .

		We know that great numbers are chronically underfed , wretchedly housed and clad .

		We know that the overstrain and the un - derpayment rest especially heavily upon women , to whom , we are wont gallantly to assert , is entrusted the destiny of the next generation .

		These things we all know , but our knowledge is of a vague and abstract character , ill calculated to arouse us to action .

		Fortunately there is now a group of valiant men and women who have undertaken the gigantic task of making concrete our knowledge of the human aspect of industrialism .

		Of this group the writers whose books are here under review deserve to rank as honored members .

		The point upon which Miss
Goldmark	PERSON	lays chief emphasis in her work on '' Fatigue and Efficiency '' is the fatigue from which industrial workers suffer .

		Everyone who has lived in a factory town has observed that large classes qf workers , especially women and girls , appear excessively weary , not merely at the end of the day , but often at its beginning .

		Observers of optimistic temperament usually assume that this is merely an incident to adjustment to the work , or a result of the strain of seasonal labor , soon to be relaxed by the approach of dull seasons .

		Miss
Goldmark	PERSON	places the facts of overwork and overstrain in a new light through an analysis of laboratory studies in the problem of fatigue .

		The phenomena of fatigue , the physiologists tell us , are phenomena of poisoning .

		Long continued exertion produces various toxins that must be re - moved by complete rest , on pain of serious dis - turbance of all organic functions .

		A working population whose periods of rest are insufficient to remove the toxins of fatigue generated in its working periods is a population suffering under chronic poisoning .

		The resistance of such a population to general infections is lowered in a marked degree .

		Such evidence as we have , though fragmentary , indicates pretty clearly that the morbidity rate is higher among indus - trial workers than among other classes of the same age-groups .

		It also indicates that the morbidity rate is especially high among women engaged in industry .

		It is no doubt the deterior - ation of the general health of women industrial workers that is largely responsible for the fright - ful infant mortality of some of our textile towns .

		In
Lowell	LOCATION	, for example , out of 1000 children born , 231 die under one year of age .


New York City	LOCATION	, not over-merciful to its children , destroys only 125 .

		We can not return to the simpler and more wholesome conditions of an earlier age .

		Our machines will continue to increase their speed ; labor will be further subdivided , and grow still more monotonous .

		We can not expel women from industry : our society needs the services of the millions of women and girls in its stores and factories and workshops , and these millions of women and girls need their opportunities for employment .

		We can , however , reduce the working day to a reasonable length ; we can pro- hibit night work and restrict overtime to narrow limits .

		To judge from past experience in the reduction of working hours , these reforms would not involve even an immediate loss in productive power .

		They would force a readjiistment of work , and more careful planning on the part of employers .

		They would eliminate a few em - ployers too incompetent to adapt themselves to a new situation .

		In the long run , without doubt , their influence would be wholly salutary .

		Miss
Goldmark	PERSON	recognizes that fatigue is not the only evil afflicting the working class .

		But the evil of fatigue is , in her view , fundamental .

		As long as the worker remains , in effect , a vic - tim of chronic poisoning , better wages , greater security of employment , and improved housing can avail him little .

		As the purpose of the writer is purely prac - tical , she does not confine herself narrowly to her main theme , but introduces whatever mate - rial she conceives may prove useful to the re - former .

		Much of the space of the book is given to an analysis of existing labor laws and a criti -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 17 cism of the methods employed in their enforce - ment .

		The book contains , in addition to its three hundred pages of text , the substance of the briefs submitted to the courts by Mr.
Louis D. Brandeis	PERSON	and
Miss Goldmark	PERSON	in defense of the ten-hour laws of
Oregon	LOCATION	and
Illinois	LOCATION	and the fifty-four-hour law of
Ohio	LOCATION	.

		This material is excellent ; it gives ready access to the best expert opinion , both American and foreign , on the physical effects of industrial labor .

		Miss
Goldmark	PERSON	's book may justly be appraised as the most important recent contribution to the litera - ture of the labor problem . ''

		Making Both Ends Meet '' also deals with the strain and weariness of women 's labor , the waste of women 's strength and life in the fac - tories and workshops of the modern city .

		Chief emphasis , however , is laid upon the question of wages .

		The method employed by Mrs.
Clark	PERSON	and
Miss Wyatt	PERSON	differs radically from that of
Miss Goldmark	LOCATION	.

		The latter works , by pref - erence , with statistics , laboratory tests , expert opinion ; the authors of '' Making Both Ends Meet '' describe the life of the workers as it has fallen under their direct observation , and narrate the histories , more or less typical , of workers whose confidence they have gained .

		The au - thors enable us to see exactly what these workers earn and how they spend their earnings ; what is their home life , if we may thus distort the meaning of that phrase ; what opportunities they have for recreation and enjoyment ; what chances offer of substantial improvement in their lot .

		At best the story is one of barely making both ends meet ; at worst , it is a story no one will read with pleasure .

		The book gives evi - dence of much patient and courageous work on the part of the authors and their collaborators .

		Its intensely personal note makes it an excellent complement of the work of Miss
Goldmark	PERSON	.

		Miss
Butler	PERSON	's '' Saleswomen in Mercantile Stores '' is a detailed study of the conditions of work and pay in the mercantile establishments in
Baltimore	LOCATION	.

		The author 's work is thorough and systematic ; and it is to be hoped that similar investigations will be made in other cities .

		The saleswomen of
Baltimore	LOCATION	work 56.9 hours a week -LRB- 70.7 hours the week before
Christmas	DATE	-RRB- .

		Half of them earn
five dollars	MONEY	a week or less ; not one-fifth of them earn above
six dollars	MONEY	a week .

		Overwork and underpay , these form the com - mon lot of women in `` gainful occupations . ''

		In '' The Women of To-morrow , '' Mr.
William Hard	PERSON	addresses himself to another aspect of the modern industrial situation : the assumption by industry of manifold functions formerly exercised by the household , and the consequent acquisition of leisure by women of the middle class .

		That this problem is a serious one , Mrs.
Schreiner	PERSON	and Mrs.
Gilman	PERSON	have already convinced us .

		Half the women of the middle class do not marry ; those who do marry have few children , as a rule , and consequently find difficulties in occupying themselves fully difficulties possibly somewhat exaggerated by our sociological writers .

		Mr.
Hard	PERSON	sees in present-day educational tendencies the promise of a solution of the problem .

		The women of to-morrow will be trained for an inde - pendent part in economic life ; they will be trained in the art of spending ; they will be trained for the assumption of civic duties Mr.
Hard	PERSON	is , however , no dealer in solutions ; he is an enthusiastic inquirer with an optimistic trend , and his book is so attractively written that the reader himself is almost constrained to assume an attitude of enthusiastic optimism .

		Who knows ?

		Possibly the well-trained women of to-morrow will solve the problems of industrial labor now so hopelessly bungled by the men of to-day .


ALVIN S. JOHNSON	PERSON	.

		CARTWRIGHT LABRADOR .

		* Toward the close of the eighteenth century there appeared a formidable narrative , in three volumes , bearing in the manner of the period this comprehensive title : `` Journal of Transac - tions and Events during a Residence of nearly Sixteen Years on the Coast of Labrador ; con - taining Many Interesting Particulars both of the Country and its Inhabitants not hitherto Known ; Illustrated with Proper Charts . ''

		The Journal of Captain
George Cartwright	PERSON	now ranks among the rare Americana , and is seldom found even in the larger libraries .

		It has always seemed matter for regret that someone had not under - taken a reprint of this valuable narrative ; for it is such from several points of view .


Cartwright	PERSON	was a man of untiring energy and wide observa - tion .

		During his long residence on the Labrador coast he was almost constantly on the move , hunting , trapping , fishing , visiting Indian and Eskimo encampments , exploring the country ; wherever he went he found something new to interest him , and whatever he saw he made a note of , for his own sake in the first instance , and ultimately for ours .

		What he tells us is well worth the telling , and it gains double value * CAPTAIN
CARTWRIGHT	PERSON	AND His LABRADOR JOURNAL .

		Edited by
Charles Wendell Townsend	PERSON	, M.D. With an Intro - duction by Dr.
Wilfred T. Grenf	PERSON	ell .


Boston	LOCATION	:
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		18 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, from the simple and graphic frankness of the author 's style .

		The Journal in its original form is a delightfully entertaining narrative , with only two faults its inaccessibility and its inordinate length .

		Thanks to Dr.
Townsend	PERSON	, to whom we were already indebted for several books on Lab - rador , both these faults have now been elimi - nated .

		He has not only given us a reprint of
Cartwright	PERSON	's Journal , but he has succeeded in reducing it to the compass of a single volume without destroying any of the charm of the ori - ginal .

		In his own Preface and Introduction , Dr.
Townsend	PERSON	presents an interesting account of
Cartwright	PERSON	as he appeared to his contemporaries , and of his life before and after he engaged in the Labrador fur-trade .

		Southey 's picture of this
Robinson Crusoe	PERSON	of the north , as he ap - peared in
1791	DATE	, is too good to pass by .

		`` I was visiting with the Lambs , at
Hampstead	LOCATION	, in Kent , at the house of
Hodges	PERSON	, his brother-in-law ; we had nearly finished dinner when he came in .

		He de - sired the servant to cut him a plate of beef from the sideboard .

		I thought the footman meant to insult him : the plate was piled to a height which no ploughboy after a hard day 's fasting could have levelled ; but the moment he took up his knife and fork and arranged the plate , I saw this was no common man .

		A second and third sup - ply soon vanished .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Lamb	PERSON	, who had never before seen him , glanced at each other ; but
Tom	PERSON	and I , with schoolboys ' privilege , kept our eyes riveted upon him with what Doctor Butt would have called the gaze of admiration . '

		I see you have been looking at me , ' -LRB- said he , when he had done -RRB- . '

		I have a very great appetite .

		I once fell in with a stranger in the shooting season , and we dined together at an inn .

		There was a leg of mutton , v/hich he did not touch .

		I never make more than two cuts off a leg of mutton ; the first takes all one side , the second all the other ; and when I had done this , I laid the bone across my knife for the mar - row .

		The stranger could refrain no longer . '

		By God , sir , ' said he , ' I never saw a man eat like you ! ' ''

		It is difficult to give an adequate idea of the range of subjects that engaged
Cartwright	PERSON	's rest - less curiosity and found a place in his Journal .

		Nothing was too trivial to escape his notice .

		He gives many pages to a minute and remarkably accurate account of the beaver ; and elsewhere he gravely describes the adventure of the ship 's goat with a bucket of rum .

		She got through nearly a gallon of that insidious beverage , it ap - pears , `` and has continued ever since in so com - plete a state of intoxication as to be unable to get upon her legs . ''

		His description of a mid -

		`` At midnight the frost increased ; the wind blew the fire about , and made it smoke most intolerably .

		The fuel was not of a good kind for burning , and the trees in the wood being small and rather thinly scattered , those parts of us which were not immediately next to the fire were ready to freeze ; we were therefore obliged to turn ourselves continually ; during which time I often wished to be lashed to a spit , and turned like a roasting goose , without the trouble of doing it myself .

Cartwright	PERSON	's narrative . ''

		Shuglawina -LRB- an Eskimo -RRB- made me a present of a very fine silver fox skin ; but he insisted on having the same price for the brush of it as I had just paid for an entire skin .

		However , as he only demanded a small ivory comb , which cost me no more than twopence half - penny , and the skin was worth four guineas , I made no scruple in completing the purchase . ''

		After what
Southey	ORGANIZATION	tells us , it is not sur - prising to find frequent mention of meals in the Journal , and some of them were odd enough .

		Traders wintering on the Labrador could not afford to be squeamish . ''

		I had a loin of white bear roasted for dinner , '' he says in one place , '' which proved very good ; although , to say the truth , it was much like beef basted with seal oil ; however , for want of the beef without the oil , I ate near two pounds of it . ''

		On another occasion he and his men were reduced to a fore-quarter of wolf , which proved so hard , dry , tough , and rank , that at first he could not swallow it .

		A day or two later , he mentions that he had finished the wolf , and adds , with an air of sly triumph , that he has at last got the better of his squeamish stomach .

		But as a trencherman he has to admit that he is not in the same class with the average Eskimo .

		He entertained a party of them at his camp . ''

		Nine salmon were boiled for them , and , although the fish were fifteen pounds weight each , on an average , they ate the whole at a meal .

		I can eat pretty well myself ; but my performances in that way are not worth recording in the history of men of such superior talents . ''

		In addition to a very complete account of the Eskimo , and the Indians of Labrador ,
Cart	LOCATION	- wright gives from personal knowledge a de - scription of the since extinct Beothuk tribe of
Newfoundland	LOCATION	.

		So little is known of this unfor - tunate race that this record , based on personal observation , is exceedingly valuable .

		He de - scribes them as '' the most forlorn of any of the human species which have yet come to my knowl - edge , the Indians of Terra del Fuego excepted . ''

		Of his many adventures by land and sea , none is perhaps more exciting than a raid which he suffered in

Boston	LOCATION	privateer , commanded by one
John Grimes	PERSON	.

		THE NEW HISTORY .

		* Every now and then the omniscient reviewer pronounces some historical work to be `` definitive . ''

		I confess to an entire lack of interest in all such works , if they really are definitive .

		Why study a subject about which nothing more can be learned ?

		It is a desolating thought that a period once impor - tant , such as the Reformation , or a great movement as fascinating as it is elusive , like the French Revo - lution , has been put on the shelf finally : quite fin - ished and done with , and done for ; nothing more to be said about it , henceforth useless except to be conned by rote .

		Who cares to open a book that is without defect or amiable weakness ?

		The impec - cable thing paralyzes the will and makes pedants of us all .

		Fortunately , the definitive book in history is never definitive for more than a short while .

		The appearance of many definitive works , the flourishing of `` standard '' histories , is most usually an indica - tion , not that history is exhausted , but that a certain method of treating it is about played out .

		Sooner or later some disturbing genius takes a new point of view , some heretic comes along with a novel method of treatment , and everything has to be done over again .

		The `` new history '' is announced before the old has become fairly complacent .

		`` The present , '' says Professor
Robinson	PERSON	in his volume entitled `` The New History , '' `` has hitherto been the willing victim of the past ; the time has now come when it should turn on the past and exploit it in the interest of advance . ''

		In one sense it might be maintained that the present has never been the victim of the past , but that its instinct has always * THE NEW HISTORY .

		been to exploit the past for its own purposes .

		In some periods the interest of the present has seemed to lie in sustaining existing social arrangements , in justifying certain prevailing theories of life ; and in such periods history has been a conservative force .

		At other times the interest of the present has seemed to lie in transforming existing institutions , in de - stroying certain prevailing conceptions ; and then men have turned to the past and have found in it arguments suited to revolution .

		History , when it has not been merely edifying , has usually served primarily either as a justification or as a criticism of the existing regime .

		Thus
Saint Augustine	PERSON	exploited the past to dis - credit Paganism and to propagate Christian doctrine ; and his conception of history , after Christianity almost destroyed Paganism , was for many centuries a powerful conservative force , an instrument for maintaining the supremacy of the
Church	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the Protestants appealed to history to justify their revolt from that same Church , quite definitely and con - sciously they '' exploited the past in the interest of advance . ''

		Quite as definitely , though perhaps less consciously , the erudite scholars of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries contributed an intellectual prop for the absolutist system of that age .

		But when the main currents of social life in
France	LOCATION	set in the direction of reform the patient Benedictine engaged in collecting documents for the history of his order , or the learned layman , a Fre ` ret for example , with his twenty volumes of impartial and disinter - ested scholarship , suffered eclipse .

		It was about the middle of the eighteenth century that the '' Phi - losophers '' announced a `` new history , '' a history which was to tell the average man , not what actually happened , but what he ought to think about what had happened , and especially about what might happen ; and this new history did indeed exploit the past most effectively in the interest of advance , or what was supposed to be advance .

		But what of the nineteenth century , with its de - tachment and scientific method ?

		Have we not been assured that the writing of history has at last been put on a sound and permanent foundation ?

		Un - doubtedly we have , but that is an old story .

		Every generation is disposed to think `` we are the people and wisdom will die with us . ''

		Still one may hope that historical wisdom will survive
Leopold von Ranke	PERSON	, and even Mr. Round .

		The future student of the intellectual life of our day will doubtless see shat the historical writing of the nineteenth century , ike the historical writing of other times , has been shaped by the pressure of social needs ; will point out how it has served a certain social purpose ; will perhaps admit , from his superior vantage , that much rood work was done in spite of inadequate knowl - dge and an imperfect criticism .

		Perhaps it will then > e seen that the method inaugurated by
Savigny	LOCATION	, and > rought to some sort of perfection by
Ranke	PERSON	and his disciples , was one of the forms assumed by the intel - ectual reaction from the philosophy of the French devolution ; that the historical school was in the in 20 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, tellectual life of the century what the Historic Rights party was in political life , a most effective bulwark against those insurgent principles that were regarded as having played havoc with
Europe	LOCATION	for a generation .

		Convinced by sharp experience that conscious at - tempts at radical social reconstruction were danger - ous , the nineteenth century wished to exploit the past to disprove the doctrine of natural rights and to con - demn the methods of the French Revolution .

		And so , working in such an atmosphere , historians nat - urally enough became interested in historic rights rather than in natural rights ; preoccupied with what happened , they were studiously non-commital about what ought to have happened ; disposed to make much of changes that came very slowly and little of changes that came suddenly ; inclined to belittle con - scious purpose as an influence in shaping institutions ; well content if it turned out that some great affair could be traced to an obscure origin , as , for exam - ple , the expense involved in equipping a cavalry service .

		And after much patient investigation along the lines of these initial preconceptions , it was discov - ered that in fact there were no natural rights ; that what happened was nearly if not quite the thing that had to happen , so that it was useless to inquire what ought to have happened ; that change in institutions and ideas was , to be sure , the fundamental thing in history ; but that change was most fruitful if it came slowly without anyone 's wishing for it , and least fruitful if it came quite suddenly as the result of everybody 's wishing for it very much , and working to bring it about .

		For purposes of illustration , the history of
England	LOCATION	was found , rather providentially , to be wonderfully well adapted .

		And so , by a most happy chance , history itself , scientifically conceived and impartially studied , proved that the French Revolution was undoubtedly a necessary mistake , an historical event which had done a certain amount of good surely , but which , by virtue of having de - parted from the most approved precedents , had done it in a very bad way .

		But the shadow which the Reign of Terror cast over
Europe	LOCATION	for a century is passing , while at the same time it is perfectly certain that neither the formulas of the Manchester school , nor the resound - ing phrases of Liberalism , nor reliance upon the
Manifest Destiny of Historic Rights	ORGANIZATION	, is ushering in any millenium .

		At present there are signs of a re - turn to earlier ideas , a disposition , in certain quar - ters , to rehabilitate the `` rags and tags and paltry blurred shreds of paper about the rights of man . ''

		The resplendent vision of
Perfectibility	LOCATION	, although it has doubtless taken on some neutral litmus paper tints , has never been quite lost ; transformed into the idea of Progress the belief that society can by its own efforts indefinitely increase the happiness and welfare of all men it is perhaps the one really vital faith of our day .

		It is not impossible , therefore , that the great task of the present century will centre in a second attempt to bring to fruition those splendid ideals of social justice which the generous minds of the eighteenth century conceived , and which the men of the Revolution , with the courage of their emotions , embodied in '' glittering generalities '' for the edifica - tion of mankind .

		As the problem of '' social better - ment '' becomes more insistent , discontent with the ex - isting regime gathers force .

		It is not unreasonable to suppose that in the next half century intellectual inter - ests will be somewhat withdrawn from the past and concentrated somewhat more in the future , less con - cerned about what actually happened and rather more concerned about what ought to happen .

		That this change of emphasis will profoundly affect the study and writing of history , is a prediction which may be safely ventured .

		The purpose of Professor
Robinson	PERSON	's little volume -LRB- which is only a collection of essays and addresses prepared for different occasions during the last ten years , and which , for that reason , lacks something of the definiteness , consistency , and structural coordi - nation which the title might lead one to expect -RRB- is to venture just that prediction , to suggest that the time is ripe for historians to ask themselves whether the aims and methods by which so much has been achieved in the last sixty years are precisely those which will serve best for the future .

		Professor
Robinson	PERSON	is con - vinced that they are not ; and , without professing to formulate any definite programme , he wishes to em - phasize the fact '' that history should not be regarded as a stationary subject which can only progress by refining its methods and accumulating , criticizing , and assimilating new material , but that it is bound to alter its ideals and aims with the general progress of society and of the social sciences , and that it should ultimately play an infinitely more important role in our intellectual life than it has hitherto done . ''

		Not unnaturally , therefore , one characteristic note of the book is discontent ; and in this it voices the feeling of many historical students , especially of the younger generation .

		What is the use , they are asking them - selves , of so many learned volumes which nobody reads ?

		What is the use of so much erudition that contributes so little to `` the instant need of things '' ?

		In reading these essays one often wonders if Profes - sor
Robinson	PERSON	does not regret that Fate made him an historian at all , and not a real scientist , an anthro - pologist perhaps , or comparative psychologist .

		In the end , however , one is convinced that such is not the case ; for if he sees the `` plight in which history finds itself '' just now , he is confident that there is a bril - liant future in store for it ; and this note of confidence in the future of history is only less marked than the note of dissatisfaction with its present condition .

		In both respects Professor
Robinson	PERSON	's attitude inevitably recalls the point of view of the eighteenth century Philosophe .

		`` All the weighty substance of our historians , '' said
Grimm	PERSON	in
1755	DATE	, `` consists in a tedious and pedantic discussion of facts which are ordinarily as indifferent as they are uncertain . ''

		Professor
Robinson	PERSON	, in like manner , employs his dry humor at the expense of a certain type of historian solemnly engaged in determining `` whether Charles the Fat was in Ingelheim or Lustnau on
July 1	DATE	, 887 , '' or in pointing out `` the spot where Nehemiah
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 21 Abbot 's ox met an untimely and suspicious end by choking on a turnip . ''

		With the dull chronicle , how - ever adequately `` documented , '' Professor
Robinson	PERSON	is dissatisfied , not because it is dull , but because it so often does not help us in the least to understand the present , and so does not help us to deal with its problems intelligently .

		This was also the point of view of the eighteenth century reformer .

		`` Other historians , ''
Diderot	PERSON	told
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	, `` relate facts to inform us of facts .

		You relate them in order to excite in us an intense hatred of lying , ignorance , hypocrisy , superstition , fanaticism , tyranny ; and this anger remains , even after the memory of the facts has passed away . ''

		Professor
Robinson	PERSON	is as far as possible from wishing the historian to relate facts in order to excite hatred and anger .

		The point of resemblance is that he , like
Grimm	PERSON	and
Diderot	ORGANIZATION	, wishes to exploit the past in the interest of advance .

		Now , in the eighteenth century the histories which exploited the past in the interest of advance were precisely those which aroused discontent with the existing regime .

		It is perhaps a fair question whether histories written in the
twentieth century	DATE	, if they are consciously to exploit the past in the interest of advance , will do it in the same way , by arousing discontent with the existing regime .

		Yes , Professor
Robinson	PERSON	would reply ; provided it arouses an intelligent discontent , that is precisely the best thing history can possibly do .

		The business of history is to arouse an intelligent discontent , to foster a fruitful radicalism ; but it should do this , not by becoming less scientific than it is now , but by becoming more scientific .

		And this , again , is the attitude of the eighteenth century philosophers .

		Diderot and
Grimm	PERSON	and their fellows were con - vinced that history could be properly written only `` by Philosophers , '' by men , that is , who were thoroughly familiar with the scientific knowledge of the day .

		Now , the most definite contention in Professor
Robinson	PERSON	's book , the one which he would doubtless consider most important , is precisely that historians have hitherto failed to make use of the results of what he calls the newer sciences of man - kind , `` Anthropology , in a comprehensive sense , Prehistoric Archaeology , Social and Animal Psy - chology , and the Comparative Study of Religions . ''

		History , professing to deal with man in the past , has concerned itself much with the past but very little with man .

		In the future , `` if history is to reach its highest development , it must confess that it is based on sister sciences , that it can progress only with them , must lean largely on them for support , and in return should repay its debt by the contributions it makes to our understanding of our species . ''

		The most vital concern of our day is the progress of the race through conscious effort .

		Such progress will be permanent and real only if based upon a genuine scientific knowledge of man ; and only by assimilating thoroughly this scientific knowl - edge of man can the historian point out to us how real progress has been made in the past and so help us to proceed aright in the future .

		It is in this way that history will arouse an intelligent discontent and foster a fruitful radicalism .

		I have insisted , perhaps unduly , upon the analogy between Professor
Robinson	PERSON	's point of view and that of the eighteenth century reformers , because it seems to me that his conception of history raises a funda - mental difficulty , a difficulty which also confronted them .

		This difficulty is in respect to the idea of progress .

		What , after all , is progress ?

		What is the test , the standard of value , which is to determine the direction of conscious effort towards social recon - struction ?

		Professor
Robinson	PERSON	's only reply to this question is that '' no one who realizes the relative barbarism of our whole civilization ... will have the patience to formulate any definition of progress when the most bewildering opportunities for social betterment summon us on every side . ''

		This is very well if it is only a matter of doing what our hands find to do : one may venture to feed the starving before formulating a definition of progress .

		But if one wishes to remove the causes of poverty , a defi - nition of progress might prove most useful .

		And certainly if the historian is to renounce his present aims and methods , and to set himself the task of '' exploiting the past in the interest of advance , '' he needs a far more definite notion of what advance is than can be found in the statement that `` the most bewildering opportunities for betterment summon us on every side '' ; he needs , in fact , a genuinely scien - tific definition of progress .

		It need hardly be said that present-day ideas of progress are most intangible .

		A profound faith in progress , we have ; a world of light talk about it , that we have also ; but the truth is we never know what form progress will take until after the event .

		Opposing principles are reconciled by falling into chronological sequence , and socialism , for example , acquires virtue by the mere passing of liberalism into the limbo of yesterday .

		And this would seem to be the necessary result of a philosophy which identifies man and nature , thus reducing all values to the relative test .

		The price of not having dogmatic creeds is that the content of our faith is successively unfolded , as it were , only in the daily practice of it .

		In the
eighteenth century	DATE	the conclusions drawn from the premises of
Locke	PERSON	left the reformers facing a similar difficulty : man is an irresponsible product of uniform natural law , said the materialist ; in that case , asked the reformer , is not society in all its forms necessary too ; this Old Regime , which we have con - demned , is it not a very `` state of nature '' after all ?

		The dilemma had been succinctly stated by
Pascal	PERSON	long before .

		`` Custom , '' he said , `` is a second nature which destroys the first .

		But what is this nature ?

		I fear that nature itself is only a first custom . ''

		No French Revolution could issue from a dilemma which brought everything to a stand .

		It was
Rousseau	PERSON	who cut the Gordian knot by giving a new form to the old dualism of man and nature : '' Man is naturally good , it is society which corrupts him . ''

		The modern social reformer is confronted by much the same di - lemma ; and if conscious effort towards social regen -
22	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
July 1	DATE	, eration is to issue in anything more than temporary expedients , the distinction between what is natural and permanent in human society and what is artificial and temporary must be drawn again in some manner or other .

		But to be in any way effective , the distinc - tion must be based upon genuine scientific knowledge as well as upon an emotional faith .

		Perhaps it is the task of religion to furnish the latter ; it certainly rests with science to furnish the former .

		Science , rather than history , must discover , as
Kant	PERSON	said , `` the constant elements in man 's nature , in order to under - stand what sort of perfection it is that suits him , alike in a state of rude simplicity , in a state of wise simpli - city , and in a state which transcends both of these . ''

		It may be that the `` newer sciences of mankind '' can achieve this .

		Who shall say ?

		But until they do , it is infinitely true , as Professor
Robinson	PERSON	himself says , that `` one may find solace and intellectual re - pose in surrendering all attempts to define history , and in conceding that it is the business of the his - torian to find out anything about mankind in the past which he believes to be interesting or important and about which there are sources of information . ''

		This is a franchise which surely includes us all .

		Meanwhile , by all means let the historian learn all he possibly can about the newer sciences of mankind , and about the older sciences too , and about philoso - phy , about literature , about art , about everything that is under the sun : all this knowledge will serve , `` if judiciously practised , greatly to strengthen and deepen the whole range of historical study and render its results far more valuable than they have hitherto been .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		It is a most attractive personality that
Hale	PERSON	's volume entitled ``
Woodrow Wilson	PERSON	: The Story of His Life '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- .

		Whatever may be the outcome of the present presi - dential campaign , no one who reads this sketch can doubt that our political life has already received a much-needed impetus upward by Dr.
Wilson	PERSON	's en - trance from the seclusion of academic labor into the strenuous activities of politics .

		Dr.
Wilson	PERSON	comes naturally by his seriousness of purpose , his strength of conviction , and his devotion to the cause of edu - cation and good government .

		He is descended from an ancestry that has always stood for what is sturdy and honorable in American history .

		The Wilsons were Scotch-Irish and the
Woodrows	PERSON	-LRB- the mother 's family -RRB- were Scotch .

		One fancies there must have been village dominies in the line of the mother 's descent , and that one of them was reincarnated in the friendly , sane , and vigorous president of
Princeton	LOCATION	, who fought so faithfully for sincerity in academic life and work and for democracy in the university .

		Most interesting is the story of this batttle of a president of one of our greatest universities to restore the preeminence of intellectual concerns over the shallow and abnormal social interests and the baneful athletic craze , which together called forth the remark of a cynical observer that
Princeton	LOCATION	was the finest country club in
America	LOCATION	.

		Dr.
Wilson	PERSON	was not content to alter radically the system of election of studies , so as to secure better coordination in the studies of each student ; but he also introduced the system of preceptors , in order that young and imma - ture minds might have the steady guidance and inspiration of trained intelligence in the pursuit of their university careers .

		He went yet a step further , and proposed to cut through the artificial stratifica - tion of university society , to house all students in dormitories and to have men from all college classes in the same buildings , and with them young profes - sors .

		It was just when this plan for making uni - versity life democratic , and his allied plan for the graduate school to be erected on the same campus with the college , had received a serious setback , and seemed doomed to temporary defeat , that Dr.
Wilson	PERSON	was summoned into public life .

		No one who had observed his career at
Princeton	LOCATION	could fail to foresee that he would be unswerving in his adherence to democracy and honesty in politics ; yet the bosses who helped to seat him in the governor 's chair seem to have estimated the sincerity of his campaign declar - ations at the same rate as their own .

		When they learned too late that he meant to keep every promise he had made , there was bitter denunciation .

		He had proved recalcitrant and ungrateful .

		In the pic - turesque language of the campaign , Dr.
Wilson	PERSON	had warned all concerned that it was plain that Provi - dence had not intended him to be ornamental and that he would be a very busy governor .

		The record of what he accomplished for the people of
New Jersey	LOCATION	against the combined rings of both the Dem - ocrats and the Republicans is as thrilling as a story of knight-errantry .

		It is a record that harmonizes with the rare quality of Dr.
Wilson	PERSON	's stump oratory clear , vivid , picturesque , and yet always flavored with the dignity that we associate with scholars - whose culture has not killed their humanity .

		The story of J .

		n an allegory or fantasy clothed in a heavenly simple and beautiful language that pilgrimage .

		occasionally reminds one of `` The Pilgrim 's Progress , '' Mr.
Arthur C. Benson	PERSON	relates , in '' The Child of the Dawn '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , the supposed experiences of a soul privileged to visit heaven and to see God in the timeless interval between two suc - cessive reincarnations .

		In an interesting preface the author says : `` The fact that underlies the book is this : that in the course of a very sad and strange experience an illness which lasted for some two years , involving me in a dark cloud of dejection I came to believe practically , instead of merely theo - retically , in the personal immortality of the human soul .

		I was conscious , during the whole time , that though the physical machinery of the nerves was out of gear , the soul and the mind remained , not only
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 23 intact , but practically unaffected by the disease , im - prisoned , like a bird in a cage , but perfectly free in themselves , and uninjured by the bodily weakness which enveloped them . ''

		Nor was that all .

		He was led to see that his hitherto accepted standards of value were more or less false , and `` that what really mat - tered to the soul was the relation in which it stood to other souls ; that affection was the native air of the spirit ; and that anything which distracted the heart from the duty of love was a kind of bodily delusion , and simply hindered the spirit in its pil - grimage . ''

		The picture presented in the succeeding pages of the joys and sorrows of discarnate spirits is admirably drawn , enriched with many a stroke of wit and wisdom , of tenderness and humor , of insight and sympathy .

		The prospect of an indefinite series of earthly lives for each soul , as conceived by the author , is of course not new or startling , but so for - bidding to most of us that we prefer to dream our own dreams about the tremendous possibilities of the future .

		What the book teaches most impressively and acceptably is the supreme importance of love , compared with which nothing else matters .

		To show that the book is not unworthy of mention in the same breath with
Bunyan	PERSON	's masterpiece , let us quote , as an example of its style , a paragraph from its closing pages .

		`` Then I took
Cynthia	PERSON	's hand and laid it in the hand of
Lucius	LOCATION	; and I left them there upon the peak , and turned no more .

		And no more woeful spirit was in the land of heaven that day than mine as I stumbled wearily down the slope , and found the valley .

		And then , for I did not know the way to de - scend , I commended myself to God ; and he took me . ''

		A history ^ n
1892	DATE	, Professor
Petrus Johannes	PERSON	of the people
Blok of the University of Leyden of Holland	ORGANIZATION	.

		published the first two volumes of a '' History of the People of the Netherlands , '' and in
1900	DATE	these volumes were translated into English by Miss
Ruth Putnam	PERSON	.

		As subsequent instalments ap - peared in
Holland	LOCATION	, the translation has been continued ; until now the fifth and concluding volume , translated -LRB- as was the fourth -RRB- by Mr.
Oscar Bierstadt	PERSON	, is pre - sented to the public .

		At the outset the author asserted that he desired to present not so much the evolution of
Holland	LOCATION	as a
State	ORGANIZATION	, but rather the life of the peo - ple in '' civilization , commerce , industry , agriculture , navigation , law , and economic development , '' and he avowedly modelled his work on that of the English historian ,
John Richard Green	PERSON	.

		In the execution of his plan , however , he failed , in the earlier volumes , in the attempt to interweave political events and popu - lar reaction to those events ; and in this last volume , covering the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , he has largely altered his method .

		Political events and institutional change are here segregated in separate chapters , as are intellectual , industrial , and cultural topics , the result being a distinct improvement in clarity .

		The work now completed is an important contribution to historical knowledge , at least for En - glish readers , since it presents a continuous narrative of Dutch history not elsewhere duplicated , while the present volume offers a clear resume of political conditions in
Holland	LOCATION	since
1850	DATE	, by a careful and scholarly observer .

		The most interesting personality of this period is Thorbecke , professor at the Univer - sity of
Leyden	PERSON	, leader of the liberal movement of
1848	DATE	, and during three terms chief minister of the state .

		Under his guidance , ministerial responsibility and direct election of the popular branch of the legislature were secured , and without the strain of a revolution , such as swept over
Europe	LOCATION	in
1848	DATE	.

		For over a quarter of a century he exercised a tremen - dous influence .

		Mr.
Blok	PERSON	tells us that `` Thorbecke created the forms in which the government was to move for a long time ; his strong hand had pointed out the way to progress in constitutional development , in material prosperity , and intellectual emancipation .

		His name is bound to the history of this important period ; his statue on the Thorbecke square in Am - sterdam is the memorial of a remarkable phase of
Holland	LOCATION	's national history . ''

		The reason of the pseu - donym , `` Vanoc , '' is explained , or an explanation is attempted , in a dedicatory note to the Editor of `` The Referee . ''

		Here , to change the subject , is a suggestive passage from the section devoted to eugenics : '' The work of the world is mainly done by the gouty ; to speak by the card , by the irritable , sanguine , nervy , 24 THE DIAL -LSB-

		That each of us is among the unfit is known to every soul honest with itself . ''

		The book is already in its second edition , or impression , which speaks well for its readable qualities .

		Masterpieces of As with everything that the late art illustrated
John La Farge	PERSON	wrote , his comments and described .

		upon u One Hundred Masterpieces of Painting '' -LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , originally published in ''
McClure	PERSON	's Magazine , '' and now put together in book form , bear the impress of a thoughtful and well-stored mind .

		The pictures one hundred and six in all selected for repro - duction have been chosen to exemplify the point of view that art is '' the mirror of life , '' and they are arranged accordingly , in subject groups .

		This classification , though an arbitrary one , serves well enough , especially as care has been exercised to include only works that have enduring charm and are free from what the author stigmatizes as '' the bad taste of fashion . ''

		His descriptions of the paintings , though engagingly written , sometimes , it must be said , seem to start nowhere and to lead nowhither .

		In a measure this impression is attrib - utable to the way in which , while advancing in an apparently leisurely manner , he touches lightly upon this thing and that , and passes on to another before the reader quite realizes that the transmigration has taken place ; but in larger part it is due to the avoidance of technical explanation .

		This omission , however , necessarily precludes an adequate expo - sition of the really vital qualities in the works described .

		Herein lies the futility of so-called '' popular '' writing about works of art .

		The nature of art forbids that the essential qualities can be apprehended without some understanding of the laws of aesthetic relationship .

		Still , the other and more usually considered qualities are not unimport - ant , and it is instructive to note how they impress an artist of such distinction and a man of such broad culture as
John La Farge	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is illustrated with excellent half-tone reproductions of the famous paintings that he has taken as his text .

		The range is a wide one , extending from
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	and Memling to Puvis de Chavannes , and even in - cluding one picture by an early Japanese master .

		the genial Irish portrait-painter Mr.
H. Jones Thaddeus	PERSON	tells how he painted the portraits of Pope
Leo XIII	PERSON	.

		and his successor
Pius X.	PERSON	; how he dined with
Robert Browning	PERSON	, who looked `` like a portly shopkeeper '' and `` whose whole attention was centered on the good things before him '' ; how he found it possible to paint
Gladstone	PERSON	in peace only by agreeing with everything that the irascible statesman happened to say ; and how he played the part of actor or spectator in a hundred other incidents which were quite as amusing , even though the par - ticipants were less celebrated .

		Now and then he is too much of an artist to be followed patiently by the lay reader .

		Now and then , also , he is perhaps a little too much of a Bohemian to please the strait-laced and the orthodox ; but he is so hearty and genuine through it all that it is not difficult to overlook an occasional instance of unnecessary frankness or indis - creet levity .

		In his anxiety to make his book attract - ive he drags in by the heels a good many anecdotes which have not the remotest connection either with himself or with his art , certainly one of the most noticeable of `` the many defects of this my maiden effort to wield that which is mightier than the sword . ''

		The first few chapters are filled with delightful ac - counts of youthful pranks in the art schools of
Cork	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Thaddeus	PERSON	has been an invet - erate traveller , and his impressions of
Algiers	LOCATION	,
Cey	PERSON	- lon , and
Australia	LOCATION	are something more than witty .

		Like some other Britons of even greater celebrity , he has little use for
America	LOCATION	, although a number of Americans have sat for him , and contributed gener - ously toward his princely income .

		Of the seventeen illustrations scattered through his book , the most interesting is a reproduction of a photograph which represents him painting a portrait of Pius X .

		This photograph , he says , he secured '' partly from a his - torical point of view , and partly to disarm calumny , to which I had been exposed while painting his predecessor . ''

		A convenient yet comprehensive his - tory of French literature in English has long been a desideratum .

		We have , to be sure , manuals like Professor
Dowden	PERSON	's and Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	's , as well as the somewhat anti- quated longer work of
Van Laun	PERSON	, but still no one - volume history to place beside the admirable French production of
M. Lanson	ORGANIZATION	.

		So Professor
C. H. C. Wright	PERSON	of
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	has undertaken to give us `` A History of French Literature , '' and his well-printed octavo of 964 pages has just been issued by the
Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a conscientious piece of work , this account of the literary development of
France	LOCATION	; indeed , it yields to none of its American or English predecessors in soundness of scholarship or in range of information .

		The index , for exam - ple , contains over two thousand names a signifi - cant number when it is considered that only in his final chapter does the author show that inclination to enumerate minor writers which is so frequent a characteristic of manuals of literature .

		Professor
Wright	PERSON	, be it said , devotes his attention mainly to the great movements and the great names .

		Admir - able in this respect , the book commends itself to the college student and the general reader by its pro- portion , its judgment , and its recognition of the lat - est discoveries and theories of scholarship .

		The advanced student and the teacher will be grateful to the author for his bibliographies and bibliogra - phical hints a closely-printed section of 54 pages .

		And both graduate and undergraduate will recog - nize in this volume , as in practically all the so-called The literary development of

		But defensible as these things may be in lectures to ennui-laden seniors , they hardly seem well-placed in a `` literary history of

		< jred miles to the east , the sprightly chronicler who signs herself ''
Janey Canuck	PERSON	, '' with an explanatory ``
Emily Ferguson	PERSON	'' added in paren - theses , made her leisurely and observant way with a single companion and by various modes of con - veyance .

		Her account of this journey she calls `` Open Trails '' -LRB-
Cassell	PERSON	-RRB- , and it is enlivened , if it needs further enlivenment than her own pen has given it , by a gorgeously colored frontispiece and a multitude of well-executed smaller drawings .

		The story is one that excels rather in the telling of it than in the things told .

		In other words , it has more manner than matter .

		So abundant is the literary drapery clothing the body of facts that one can hardly discern the merest outlines of the body .

		In the matter of proper names alone the heroine of the adventure , the narrator herself , is `` Janey , '' or `` dear old girl , '' as her companion styles her ; the travelling companion is for literary purposes `` the
Padre	LOCATION	, '' but in plain English , as one makes out at last , the husband of the woman with whom he is on so intimate terms and whom he addresses so familiarly ; the author 's birthplace is `` X , '' and she apparently , near the end of the book , almost falls a victim to `` cholecystitis , '' which to most readers will be about the vaguest thing in the whole narrative .

		As a specimen of the author 's buoyant style , here is what she says of
Alberta	LOCATION	: ''
Alberta	LOCATION	has no past to speak of , but has a future beyond com - parison .

		Tut !

		I bite my thumb at the past .

		A past may be as great a detriment to a country as to a woman . ''

		The writer of '' Open Trails '' is already known through her previous book entitled ``
Janey Canuck	PERSON	in the West , '' and most of her readers will hope for still further books in the same jaunty and spontaneous manner .

		Kant and
Spencer	PERSON	critically expounded .

		Students of the late
Professor Borden Parker Bowne	ORGANIZATION	will welcome the post - humous work from his pen entitled `` Kant and Spencer : A Critical Exposition '' -LRB-
Hough	PERSON	- ton
Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- which has been edited from the au - thor 's rough notes by a number of friends who were sufficiently familiar with his thought to supply what seemed the necessary corrections .

		The book deals with
Kant	PERSON	and
Spencer	PERSON	from the standpoint of Mr.
Bowne	PERSON	's own philosophical interpretation of the uni - verse , which was a spiritual and personal one .

		It is therefore quite natural that
Kant	PERSON	, the philosopher who criticised the intellect as a revealer of religious truth only to supplant it by the practical reason , and who therefore placed the religious interpretation of the universe on a stronger basis than ever before , comes in for sympathetic treatment .

		.

		Kant , however , was not final , and Mr.
Bowne	PERSON	criticises incisively his doctrine of the understanding and of time and space .

		He recognizes , however ,
Kant	PERSON	's permanent contribu - tions to thought , and points out how pragmatism has its original source in
Kant	PERSON	's doctrine of the activity of the mind and the need for an interpretation of the universe which shall satisfy the soul as well as the intellect of man .

		The exposition of
Herbert Spencer	PERSON	is a very thorough piece of destructive criti - cism , dealing especially with the `` First Principles '' and the `` Principles of Psychology . ''

		The author 's summing up of the matter is that
Spencer	PERSON	's philoso - phy , apart from the suggestions thrown out by the way throughout its course , has no value as a system , and that it has passed away with that reliance on physical science which was the intellectual feature of its generation and which gave it so great a vogue .

Peter Parley	PERSON	's and
Jacob Abbott	PERSON	's and
Miss Sedgwick	PERSON	's little books of harmless fiction for innocent children , the author traces , in seven carefully-written chapters , the genesis of the American story-book for young people , bring - ing out for the benefit of the philosophical student of the subject the influence exerted by the spirit of each successive age upon the character of its juven - ile literature .

		It is this constant even though grad - ual change of atmosphere , in the family life and in the nursery as well as in the greater world , that largely accounts for the obsoleteness of most of the children 's books of the past ; but the author puts it too strongly when she says that `` there is nothing more rare in the fiction of any nation than the pop - ular child 's story that endures . ''

		What , pray , are the favorite collections of fairy-stories and nursery rhymes made up of to-day if not of the good old tales and jingles that , in many cases , have in sub - stance if not in form come down from a more or less remote past ?

		Does our current adult fiction show as many hoary survivals ?

		Miss
Halsey	PERSON	's book , besides being well printed in a handsome limited 26 THE DIA1L , -LSB-

		The life of ^ r *
Francis Gribble	PERSON	, clever purveyor an imperial of breezy scandal , gives us in his adventuress .

		i atest vo i unie w h a t he calls `` The Comedy of Catherine the Great '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		His title is a shrewd warning that he intends to deal , not with Russian politics or the serious side of
Catherine	PERSON	's life , but solely or principally with her amours .

		Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	does not reprobate his heroine , and hold her up as a horrible warning ; he reminds us again and again that she was more sinned against than sinning , that her faults were the faults of her age and position , and that she was at bottom a very capable and very good-hearted woman .

		The latter quality he proves by abundant anecdote , the former he contents himself with repeating earnestly and frequently .

		The substance of his book , however , is a sensationally detailed account of the woman 's end - less series of love affairs .

		Such works have not even the merit of historical trustworthiness .

		Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	, who has undeniably put much labor into the making of his compilation and brought together material from a hundred different sources , conscientiously admits that many of the salacious morsels which he dishes up most carefully are only matters of rumor and can not be verified .

		His book has little value for the historian , and in spite of the ostentation of a moral attitude it can scarcely be reckoned a treatise on morals .

		Nevertheless , it is a breathlessly inter - esting story , built of vigorous and rapid sentences and strewn from beginning to end with examples of witty phrase-making .

		If Mr.
Gribble	PERSON	had chosen to study
Catherine	PERSON	and her reign from a different and less questionable point of view , he might have produced a permanently valuable book , instead of merely a readable one .

		aspiring student of architecture .

		Un - doubtedly , the training of the eye before the actual masterpieces of the builder 's art is the most valuable apprenticeship .

		Yet for those who can not take such a travel-course , good photographs are really not a bad substitute : they afford an easy means of making an art-pilgrimage by proxy .

		And we are all fond of this sedentary kind of travel , made so enticing recently by the perfecting of reproductive processes and the zeal of the publishers .

		Such books as Dr.
Julius Baum	PERSON	's `` Romanesque Architecture in
France	LOCATION	'' and
Signer Ricci	PERSON	's '' Baroque Architecture and Sculpture in
Italy	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Button -RRB- offer the most alluring opportunities to art-student and arm-chair tourist ; they are perfection in their class .

		Made up respectively of 226 and 274 full-page plates , these splendid folios present their subjects mainly through the range and choice of their illustrations ; they are practically art-albums , prepared by experts and pro- vided with brief introductions and full indexes .

		Our profit from such books is dependent , of course , upon our previous knowledge ; but not our pleasure .

		Even the most indolent arm-chair traveller will not be daunted by a prefatory essay which fills scarcely a dozen pages .

		He will skip it , pass at once to the plates , and feast his eyes thereon , his pleasure unal - loyed except by a possible consciousness of his ignor - ance .

		He will learn as the tourist learns , with or without a guide-book .

		And if he will not run , he need not even read !

		tergj the English Cathedral tour finds much favor with travellers abroad .

		And since these wonderful buildings make a many-sided appeal through their history and associations as well as through their architecture many handbooks more or less satisfactory have been offered from time to time on the subject .

		The latest of these , `` How to Visit the English Cathedrals '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , by Miss
Esther Singleton	PERSON	, is by no means the least welcome .

		Those who are familiar with the long list of this writer 's other works know her method .

		Frankly compiled from various sources duly acknowledged , the citations are tied together with a thread of original matter which adds greatly both to the value and the interest .

		The introductory chapter of thirty-one pages deals with `` Styles of English Architecture '' ; the twenty-nine chapters following consider as many different cathedrals , and each is illustrated by several charming photographs .

		It is a book suitable for the rapid but intelligent traveller who may not have either time or inclination for ex - haustive study .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The name of
Thomas Deloney	PERSON	will not commonly be found in manuals of the history of English literature , yet future compilers of such books will hardly be able to escape giving some attention to this Elizabethan novelist and poet , now that his complete works have been put forth by the
Oxford Clarendon Press	ORGANIZATION	in a stout volume edited by Mr.
Francis Oscar Mann	PERSON	.

		`` Le Frangais et Sa Patrie , '' by Mr.
L. Raymond Talbot	PERSON	-LRB-
Sanborn	PERSON	-RRB- , is a French reading-book for the first or second year , planned to put the student into posses - sion of much interesting information about French home life , and the history and geography of the country .

		The matter is partly conversational and partly epistolary .

		There are also pictures , songs , poems , notes , and a vocab - ulary .

		It seems to be a particularly praiseworthy text - book .

		But it is strange to be led through `` the heart of the Vosges '' and hear no mention of the fine old Meistersaenger ,

		And no less strange is it to meet no reminiscences of Walther und Hildegund , who made their famous flight and fought their valiant battle in these passes .

		The editor dis - penses with glossary and critical and interpretative notes , but explains difficult words and lines on the pages upon which they occur .

William Watson Goodwin	PERSON	, known to thousands of school and college graduates by reason of his widely - used '' Greek Grammar , '' '' Greek Moods and Tenses , '' and an excellent edition of Xenophon 's '' Anabasis , '' died
June 15	DATE	, at his home in

May 9 , 1831	DATE	.

		After taking his bachelor 's degree at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1851	DATE	, he studied at three German universities , travelled in
Italy	LOCATION	and
Greece	LOCATION	, and served four years as tutor in the college that had given him his academic training , and was then , in
1860	DATE	, appointed to the Greek chair which he held until his resignation in
1901	DATE	, when he professed to have `` taught himself out . ''

		That he was no mere grammarian is proved by the fact that he was the first Director of the
American School of Classical Studies	ORGANIZATION	at
Athens	LOCATION	, and that his lectures at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	concerned themselves with broader interests than the niceties of the Greek tongue .

		His published version of Plutarch 's '' Morals '' also shows him to have been something more than a gerund - grinder .

		In short , he was a fine example and exponent of academic culture at its best .

		BRIEFER MENTION 56 NOTES 57 LIST OF NEW BOOKS 57 THE SCHOLAR IN POLITICS .

		Out of the political turmoil of the past month one result has emerged which is peculiarly grat - ifying to all who take a serious interest in our national life and problems .

		One of the great political parties has chosen as its candidate for the office of chief magistrate a man who embodies that ideal of the scholar in politics which has hitherto seemed to be impossible of realization in a democracy like ours , short-sighted in its vis - ion and deaf to the purely intellectual appeal .

		It is hard even now to believe that the incredi - ble has become fact , and equally hard to account for it , considering in what contempt the '' intel - lectual '' and the theorist are held by most of those who think themselves practical politicians .

		In a truly enlightened community nothing could be more natural than the selection for its leader of a man who had devoted his life to the inves - tigation of the problems of statecraft , and spent his days in teaching young men to understand them .

		Who should be competent to lead , if not one who for many years had given his attention to the questions for which leadership is expected to find answers , and who could bring to bear upon them a wide knowledge of the art of gov - ernment in all countries , at all times , and under all conditions ?

		Yet , plain as the matter is , there is a surprising number of persons who fail to see in a man of this type the most essential of all qualifications for high administrative office the wide range of knowledge , the trained analytical faculty , and the habit of forming disinterested judgments upon political issues .

		Although we have been a working democracy for upwards of a hundred years , we have in all that time acquired only a rudimentary percep - tion of what constitutes fitness for office .

		We have complacently witnessed the placing of men without scientific equipment in positions whose duties involved the management of observatories and laboratories and museums , we have seen with nothing more than a shrug of the shoulders , translated into the words `` another political ap - pointment , '' the selection of men without expert knowledge for posts in which such knowledge was imperative , we have seen surgeons trans - formed into generals , and politicians into judges , and sportsmen into civil service commissioners , and illiterates into ministers and consuls , de 36 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, spatched to countries of which they could not even speak the language we have seen all these grotesque administrative misfits , and , if we have felt anything like adequate indignation , have failed to express it , and all because of our na - tional habit of viewing politics as a form of sport instead of as a business to be dealt with accord - ing to the dictates of reason and in a spirit of high seriousness .

		When it comes to choosing people for office ourselves , by exercising the sacred privilege of the ballot , we do not , once in a score of times , make a decent effort to find out whether the men for whom we are voting have either the knowledge or the character that the offices require .

		As far as knowledge goes , we pretend to believe that any American citizen can learn to do anything if he is only given an opportunity , and , as far as character goes , we take our chances , or fall back upon a cynical disbelief in the integrity of any man whose duties are found to conflict with his interests .

		Aside from the suspicion with which the scholar in politics is widely regarded , taking shape in abstract allegations barbed with such .

		damning epithets as theorist , visionary , Utopian , dreamer , idealist , and reformer , his entrance into the field has to encounter the very serious obstacle presented by the damaged reputations of men who have been supposed to be con - spicuous examples of the principle which he represents .

		We have undoubtedly had scholars in politics for whom the noblesse oblige of their rank has had no constraining force , and who promptly sold themselves to the devil as soon as they were taken up on the high mountain .

		Two of these lost souls are particularly prom - inent in our national affairs because their sin against the light has been more than commonly flagrant , but there are many others of lesser stature who , with the scholar 's equipment , have not had the character needed to steel them in the hour of temptation , and so have helped to bring into disrepute what is nevertheless the unquestionable truth that high -LRB- and to a certain extent specialized -RRB- education is above all things else to be desired in a public officer .

		We must not be disheartened by the cases in which intel - lect has been put to shame by deed , but hold fast to the principle that education ought to count as a very large percentage of the total of what we require in a candidate for high public office .

		It is amazing that this matter should be even arguable in a country like the
United States	LOCATION	, which does more lip-service to education , and goes down deeper into its pocket to pay the bills , than any other on earth .

		But the fact is that along with our devotion to popular educa - tion we cherish as a nation a certain distrust of all education that goes beyond the elementary stages , excepting that which is definitely shaped to practical ends .

		The absurd notion that the higher education somehow disqualifies a man for the real work of life is entertained by a sur - prisingly large number of people , and urged by them with a zeal worthy of a better cause .

		It is but a step from this general prejudice to the more specific one that would hold it rather against a candidate for high office that his education had been of a nature to win for him academic honors , even if they were honors in the very field of scholarship that prepares a man to deal with political and economic prob - lems upon a basis of scientific knowledge .

		We take for granted that expert chemists are needed in the direction of our industrial organizations , and trained electricians and mathematicians in the management of our traction systems and engineering enterprises .

		But we balk at the idea that our executive and legislative officers need to be trained in the niceties of interna - tional law or the theories of the tariff , and scout the notion that a knowledge of political and economic history can alone supply the examples and the warnings by which a government may learn what is wise and do what is right .

		We prefer to do what unintelligent impulse directs and interested ignorance counsels , disregarding the accumulated experience of mankind which might so easily save us from mistaken courses and pernicious policies .

		In the impending pres - idential campaign , when almost for the first time in our history we have the opportunity of placing a mind trained in political science at the head of national affairs , we shall have to contend with a stout opposition whose chief `` argument '' will be the multiplication of cheap gibes about misguided pedagogues who foolishly aspire to become statesmen .

		Governor
Baldwin	PERSON	, in the last number of '' The
Yale Review	ORGANIZATION	, '' has some pertinent remarks about placing educated men in public office . ''

		The indirect consequences of any new piece of legislation are far more numerous and far more import - ant than those which are direct .

		Only well-trained minds can anticipate many of them .

		And the highest education can never enable a man to forecast them all .

		In
America	LOCATION	one is quite sure that well-trained minds , sooner or later , will trace out these consequences .

		This falls to our judges .

		They will be quick to see how an alteration in one of the rules of law may affect the working of others , because this will tell in determining whether the new statute does or does not square with the constitutional guaranties of individual right .

		THE DIAL 37 its effect will be found such as to produce a benefit to a few at the cost of injustice to the community .

		He who finds this out first , without waiting for some law - suit to develop the wrong , has won a place among public benefactors .

		Still more of a benefactor is the member of a legislature who perceives the impractica - bility of some such proposition , before it can take the shape of law , and see to it that it is rejected . ''

		All of this illustrates the importance of
Bastiat	PERSON	's `` Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne voit pas . ''

		It is what people do not foresee of the consequences of the legislation for which they clamor that makes all the mischief .

		It is the special func - tion of the trained mind in office , of the scholar in politics , to trace out these ulterior conse - quences , and , perceiving them to be seriously dangerous to prosperity , to justice , and even to liberty , to stand firmly against them , no matter at what cost of immediate public favor .

		He may suffer for his stand at the time , but he will have his reward in the end , if he only have the patience to wait . ''

		The huge world will come round to him '' when the clamor has died away .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE PUBLIC LIBRARY AS AN EDUCATIONAL FORCE was a subject of marked prominence at the thirty - fourth annual conference of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, just held at
Ottawa	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	.

		The con - viction was emphasized that the library constitutes not only a great civic force , but the one educational agency which must be relied upon to reach the citi - zenship of the country , since it is only a small minor - ity who are privileged to give up other occupations in order to attend academic institutions .

		This feeling was voiced especially in an address by Mr.
William H. Hatton	PERSON	of
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, who said that `` Society is required to educate the man of forty just as much as the boy of five ; the training of the school can only be a beginning in learning how to assimilate knowl - edge .

		The student should be trained to find knowl - edge for himself .

		There is no place more fitted to accomplish this task than the library .

		The public library is the university of the people .

		It is the dominant factor in civic efficiency . ''

		Another dis - tinct impression received was that it is more than ever the thought of the library profession that good librarianship demands a keen sense of society 's needs , together with a clear appreciation of literary values ; that knowledge of people and books is more import - ant than the technical side of library administration .

		That this conception was so definitely impressed upon those in attendance was in a large measure due to the preliminary work of the first woman who has ever been president of the
A. L. A.	PERSON	, Mrs.
Theresa West Elmendorf	PERSON	of
Buffalo	LOCATION	.

		It was in the main her views upon this subject which were worked out upon the programme , and her personality which dominated the conference .

		Our
Chicago	LOCATION	librarian , Mr.
Henry E. Legler	PERSON	, won merited recognition in the form of a unanimous election to the presidency of the Asso - ciation for the coming year .

		The eloquent and progressive head of the
University of Minnesota	ORGANIZATION	bore to
Ottawa	LOCATION	the greetings of the
National Edu	ORGANIZATION	- cation Association , and delivered one of the best addresses of the week .

		An especially enjoyable session was the fourth , for which a Dominion Day programme had been prepared , in which Sir
Wilfrid Laurier	PERSON	and other notables took part .

		On the whole , this year 's conference was one of the most interest - ing and stimulating that have been held .

		More than 700 members were in attendance , and the bonds uniting library workers in this country with those across the Canadian border were more closely knit . ''

		GUIDE-POST '' REFORMERS OF OUR LANGUAGE in respect to its spelling or , in other words , those who cheerfully consent to point the doubtful and difficult road to some imaginary orthographic happy land , but prefer for their own part to stay where they are and bear those ills they have rather than fly to others that they know not of receive a word of reproof in the
June	DATE	issue of that vivacious organ of a doleful cause , the `` Simplified Spelling Bul - letin . ''

		In an editorial paragraph we read : `` As one of our members has put it , too many reformers are inclined to take the offis of a gide-post , and thus to point bravely the road of reform , while taking no steps themselvs .

		We need gide-posts , but if the road of reform is not traveld by some more pedes - trians , to say nothing of those who prefer the more rapid rate of vehicular progression , the grass will grow , and the evening sun will throw a tender but fading light upon the faithful gide-post , with its sturdy motto , ` Here I am , here I stay . ' ''

		The printed list of the officers and board of the S.S.S. -LRB- the official abbreviation for
Simplified Spelling Society	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- contains so many names of writers and others whom the world in general has had no reason to suspect of inoculation with the S. S. virus , that one is inclined to believe there may indeed be not a few of these `` gide-post '' reformers in the S. S. S. ranks .

		The general tone of this number of the `` Bulletin '' conveys a certain sense of some - thing like despondency in the cause .

		Possibly this is a false impression ; certainly it need not be the one given by the following paragraph , from the department of facetice , contributed by a correspon - dent : `` One man to whom I had the BULLETIN sent was suffering from prejuditis and fossilization of the spelling bump .

		After taking three bottles of your cure he shows markt symptoms -LSB- why not simptoms ? -RSB-

		of improvement , the foren substances o , g and h in his through having been painlessly re - moved . ''

		... THE CALUMNIATED BOOK-PUBLISHER finds an eloquent advocate in Mr.
Filson Young	PERSON	, who writes ably in his defence in the
London	LOCATION	'' Eye - Witness . ''

		Much has been said and printed about the sins of publishers , almost nothing about those of authors in 38 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, their dealings with these same wicked publishers ; societies have been formed for protecting the author from his hereditary foe , the publisher , but no societies exist for shielding the publisher from the madness or malevolence or unreasonableness of the author . ''

		I have taken considerable interest in this question , '' says Mr.
Young	PERSON	, `` and both as an author and a pub - lisher 's reader have had opportunities of examining it from both sides .

		Since my income is derived solely from writing , and not from publishing , I am naturally on the author 's side ; but I am bound to admit that in most of the cases of discontent and jealousy which exist , the wrong is on the side of the author .

		It is quite commonly supposed by the world at large that publishers are a dangerous set of criminals , who in reality sell immense editions of every book they pub - lish , but only account for a small number of copies to the author .

		And it seriously believes also that except for the vigilance of societies and agents , au - thors would all be starving in the gutter and publish - ers would all be millionaires .

		But I know more rich authors than publishers . ''

		Most assuredly one half of the world does not know how the other half has to struggle and contend with all sorts of unimagined and indescribable difficulties .

		Life is a rough road for most of us , and not for the publisher any more than for anyone else has it been sandpapered down to a polished smoothness .

		THE PRIMROSE PATH OF LETTERS or , rather , what is imagined by the uninitiated to be the flower - carpeted road travelled by those who earn their bread by writing will doubtless , as a matter of fact , always have more thorns than roses for the feet of the way - farers .

		But a pleasing fiction will survive .

		A rather well-known writer of our acquaintance received a letter , such as probably many other prominent writers have received , asking , as if it were the simplest thing in the world , advice that would enable the ingenuous correspondent to become a successful author .

		Unintentionally diverting as this letter was , an even more amusing one , addressed likewise to a person known in the literary world , is printed in '' Public Libraries '' for
June	DATE	. ''

		Pardon this intru - sion upon your time , '' it begins , '' but seeing your like - ness in a magazine and reading some of your articles prompts me to ask a favor of you and it is if you will write me a short article on ' The Novels of
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	. '

		I know you will think me very presump - tuous but it will be no exertion for you and will be granting a great favor . ''

		It continues , with a mix - ture of frankness and flattery : '' I do n't believe you want to be paid for every article , do you , when you will be conferring such a favor ?

		Your countenance appeals to me and so I write asking this favor .

		I have access to so few of his books and really do not care for him as a writer , so I find it quite a task to prepare a lengthy article for our literary club on the subject , especially as I am a very busy mother and have had so much sickness and have so short a time to prepare an article .

		If you can write me a humorous statement or two on the subject please do so , as long dry articles are so tiresome . ''

		What a vast amount of benefit that busy mother must get from her literary club !

		A MOVING APPEAL to the citizens of St.
Joseph	PERSON	,
Missouri	LOCATION	, to visit and use more freely and frequently their excellent public library has been made in the past year through the agency of a local moving - picture theatre , which , says Librarian Rush in his unusually attractive and cleverly illustrated Report , `` kindly exhibited a specially prepared lantern slide showing at each performance photographic repro - ductions of the Library buildings , together with the following note :
` Your Free Public Library	ORGANIZATION	has ar - ranged with this management to select interesting books and magazine articles upon the historical , lit - erary , and industrial subjects treated in these pic - tures .

		It is a bright idea to see something good and then learn more about it . ' ''

		Even more moving than this appeal would have been , let us say , a cinemato - graphic representation of some of the library 's bene - ficent activities .

		For instance , a worried club-woman , seeking material for a paper to be read at the next meeting of the
St. Joseph Culture Club	ORGANIZATION	, might be pictured in the process of applying for and promptly obtaining just the book or books that she needs , and departing with smiles of gratitude on her face and her precious data under her arm .

		Or the simple ceremony of applying for and receiving a book at the delivery desk might be thrown on the screen , to show how prompt and efficient is the library service .

		If all the world , or at least all the juvenile world , will endanger its eye-sight by visiting the moving - picture show , why not give it something well worth seeing , and worth thinking about afterward ?

		A HERO AND HIS VALET are not always pictured in such pleasant relations to each other as in the '' Recollections of Guy de Maupassant , '' by his body - servant , Francois a French book that has recently achieved the distinction of being translated into En - glish .

		Not all valets , it is true , are equal to the task of putting their reminiscences of their masters into book-form , else we might have more refutations of the familiar dictum ascribed , with varying weight of authority , to
Madame de SeVigne	ORGANIZATION	'' , to
Madame Cornuel	ORGANIZATION	, to
Marshal Catinat	ORGANIZATION	, and perhaps to others .

		Evidently Francois was a faithful servant and a minute observer ; and that , with all this minuteness of observation under the somewhat disenchanting conditions of domestic service , he still felt sufficiently moved with admiration to present the world with a portrait of his master in undress , so to say , speaks well for both master and servant .

		In addition to those intimate personal details about which only a valet would be qualified to write fully and accurately , there are matters touched upon of far greater pith and moment , questions of literary taste , even , and discussions -LRB- somewhat one-sided , naturally -RRB- of Zola and his writings .

		Maupassant , as appears from his
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 39 valet 's book , was a veritable steam engine for work when once the creative impulse seized him ; he could cover no fewer than thirty-seven foolscap pages in a day .

		Those who wish to know the real
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	, to become better acquainted with the man behind his writings , will not fail to read these entertaining recollections from the pen of Francois .

		THE DWINDLING OF THE BACCALAUREATE , the degree that a few decades ago stood as a symbol for all that was best in college culture for an intimate and loving acquaintance with the humanities , and an ardent devotion to the highest ideals both of scholar - ship and of conduct , conduct being the very art of arts , and so not to be ignored by the holder of a B. A. diploma is sadly attested by this year 's record of our college and university graduates .

		In a list of thirty-nine of our leading institutions of higher learn - ing , graduating at the recent commencement nearly thirteen thousand students , there were bestowed not quite four thousand degrees of bachelor of arts , or less than
thirty-three per cent	MONEY	of the total number of diplomas awarded .

		Only one of these colleges and universities is found to confine itself , with commend - able restraint , to the B. A. degree as the official attes - tation that the student has successfully completed its curriculum ; and that one is , of course , a New En - gland country college
Williams	ORGANIZATION	.

		The sister insti - tution at
Amherst	LOCATION	graduated ninety-five students -LRB- to
Williams	ORGANIZATION	's ninety-three -RRB- , but allowed twenty of these to go forth with some sort of substitute for the time - honored parchment of our ancestors probably a B. S. diploma .


Lehigh University	ORGANIZATION	makes , on the whole , about the poorest showing in this connection , with only four
B. A.	PERSON	's to its credit , out of eighty-five grad - uates ; and , sad to relate , the
University of Vermont	ORGANIZATION	sends forth this year but five bachelors of arts in a graduating class of ninety-six afalling-off of three from last year 's B. A. record .

		At this rate , the time may come , within our own lifetime , when bachelors of arts will constitute a smaller and more distinguished company of scholars than doctors of philosophy .

		AN EXPERIMENT IN CO-OPERATIVE BOOK-BUYING forms the subject of an interesting section in the latest Report of the
John Crerar Library	PERSON	, and it seems not unlikely to lead to still further and larger enterprises of the same sort .

		After a preliminary reference to the matter , the librarian continues : `` The purchases of the year were greatly affected in character by the experiment already mentioned .

		Four libraries ,
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	,
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	,
The University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, and The
John Crerar	PERSON	, sent a joint representative to
Europe	LOCATION	.

		They were fortunate in securing , through the cour - tesy of
Northwestern University	ORGANIZATION	, the services of its Librarian , Dr.
Walter Lichtenstein	PERSON	, who had very special qualifications for the task .

		Dr.
Lichtenstein	PERSON	brought together for
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	its
Hohenzollern Collection	ORGANIZATION	, and in so doing obtained an exceptional familiarity with the European book trade . ''

		It is understood that the results of this venture were satisfactory to all concerned .

		In the case of the library of which we are now speaking , `` the pur - chases cover all the departments of the Library and , indeed , most of the individual subjects .

		The principal object of the experiment was to obtain books which could not be obtained through the regular channels of trade , but it is pleasant to be able to add that , after allowing for all expenses , the purchases were made at less cost than they could have been made through these channels . ''

		SIR
SIDNEY COLVIN	PERSON	'S WORK AT THE BRITISH MU - SEUM , as keeper of prints and drawings since
1884	DATE	, draws to itself some merited attention just now by reason of his recent retirement from the post .

		Though best known to the reading public as editor of the Edin - burgh edition of
Stevenson	PERSON	's works and of
Stevenson	PERSON	's letters , there are other and greater achievements to his credit than the editing of
R. L. S. Scholar	PERSON	and fellow of
Trinity College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, he was elected in
1873	DATE	Slade professor of fine art at that university , and was also director of the
Fitzwilliam Museum	ORGANIZATION	at
Cambridge	LOCATION	from
1876	DATE	until he went to the British Museum in
1884	DATE	.

		The pre-Raphaelite movement found in him an eloquent advocate in the days of its unpopularity .

		His acquaintance with
Whistler	LOCATION	and his high opinion of that eccentric artist 's work are matters of record as is also
Whistler	LOCATION	's characteristic treatment of his admirer .

		In every way equipped for his duties at the British Museum , Sir
Sidney	PERSON	acquired a reputation for expert knowledge of the old masters second to that of few or none in En - gland ; and his diplomacy and tact in the discharge of those duties secured for his department valuable accessions that another man might not have secured at all , or only at a considerably greater cost in money .

		The story is current of a dealer who , after making a sale to the keeper of prints and drawings , repented the transaction and grumbled : ``
Colvin	PERSON	is so -LSB- profane adverb -RSB- pleasant he gets things for nothing . ''

		A LIBRARY IN A WATER-TANK , Occupying some of the space once devoted to water , enjoys a security from fire -LRB- the tank being of iron -RRB- which not every library can boast .

		The
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, as we now know it , has grown from a nucleus of about three thousand volumes given to the city
forty years ago	DATE	, just after the great fire , by the late
Thomas Hughes	PERSON	and others , authors and publishers and lit - erary and scientific societies that he had interested t in the cause , in order that
Chicago	LOCATION	might no longer suffer the reproach of having no library in the least degree worthy of so large and enterprising a city ; and in the old water-tank on the site of the present Rookery Building the books thus secured through English generosity were first shelved and made accessible to the public .

		Since then the growing collection , which now numbers nearly half a mil - 40 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, lion volumes , has been four times removed to new and larger quarters , and to-day there are , in addi - tion to the fine central library building at
Michigan Avenue	LOCATION	and
Washington	LOCATION	Street , twenty-five branch libraries , one hundred and sixteen delivery stations , nine employees ' libraries in industrial and commer - cial establishments , sixty-six classroom libraries in schools , and two travelling libraries .

		These facts and figures , with others of interest and a classified list of recent accessions , are to be found in the
June	DATE	number of the library 's interesting `` Book Bulletin . ''

		THE DEMAND FOR GOOD BOOKS OF MODERATE PRICE appears rather to grow than to be satiated with the increasing output of such excellent series as `` Everyman 's Library , '' the `` Temple Classics , '' and the `` Home University Library . ''

		`` Everyman 's '' has passed well beyond the half-thousand mark in the number of its titles , and the `` Home University Library '' of authoritative little manuals devoted to various branches of learning is now circulating to the extent of half a million copies of its various issues .

		One watcher of the book-market and critic of litera - ture attributes the present social unrest a discon - tent that is the beginning of progress largely to the wide circulation of these excellent , thought-provoking textbooks and reprints .

		No longer , it appears , does the popular novel or the illustrated magazine , or even the many - paged and profusely-pictured
Sunday	DATE	news - paper , quench the public thirst for reading matter .

		If this is really so , and if the inexpensive reprint and the low-priced scientific or economic or historical treatise are at the same time creating and respond - ing to a more wholesome craving , there is cause for felicitation .

		... OUR AMERICAN '' DEBRETT , '' instead of being a blue-book of the peerage , is a red-book of men and women of achievement .

		It lays emphasis rather on the qualities commonly associated with red blood than on those traditionally characteristic of blue .

		The current issue of `` Who 's Who in
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Vol .

		VII. , 1 912-1913 -RRB- , fresh from the hands of its enterprising publishers , contains nearly three thou - sand new names ; which means that about eight times a day , during the period of the book 's compilation , fame has struck some hitherto obscure person and made of him or her a Who .

		Presumably , too , the rate of mortality among the Whos must in the long run about equal the birth-rate .

		Contemplating this endless procession of the illustrious from the cradle to the grave , with their achievement of renown marked by admission to '' Who 's Who , '' one might be tempted by a sense of the transitoriness of all thingsr mundane , great as well as small , to essay a labored and clumsy parody of certain familiar lines of Ten - nyson , somewhat as follows : Fill the cup and fill the can , Have a rouse before the morn ; Each three hours a Who expires , Each three hours a Who is born .

		COMMUNICA TION .

		RESEARCH AND INTERCOMMUNICATION : A PARTIAL SURVEY OF WAYS AND MEANS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Of bibliographical undertakings , large and small , past , present , and future , there are many , and they are of great utility ; but it is not the chief purpose of this note to deal therewith .

		We have in mind rather those publications and organizations which afford assistance in current research , or through the medium of which investigators can be placed in direct communication with each other .

		It is generally recognized now that the serious student is no longer content with printed literature .

		He must seek , and , if possible , secure the last word on the subject in point .

		He may join some one or more of the societies , national or international , devoted to the matters or problems of interest to him , but he will still find that there is a chasm which can not be bridged over except by some one general clearing - house to which , in certain emergencies , to apply .

		With this state of affairs , it was not surprising to hear of the creation of such an institution as '' Die Briicke '' -LRB- The Bridge -RRB- , under the presidency of Prof. Dr.
Wil	PERSON	- helm
Ostwald	PERSON	, of
Leipsic	LOCATION	, and having its headquarters at 30 ,
Schwindstrasse	LOCATION	,
Munich	LOCATION	.

		The minimum yearly subscription for membership is only
six marks	MONEY	-LRB- about
$ 1.50	MONEY	-RRB- .

		Dr.
Ostwald	PERSON	has already , according to report , donated to `` Die Briicke '' the sum of one hundred thou - sand marks -LRB-
$ 24,000	MONEY	-RRB- from his private fortune .

		An active international propaganda will , no doubt , soon be commenced by '' Die Briicke , '' which has so far been giving special attention to the organization of its work in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		It will probably establish , in due course , branch organizations in the various countries , and will begin the publication of an official organ of intercom - munication .

		The scope of '' Die Briicke , '' unlike that of any other previously existing body , is unlimited as to subject .

		Its members will be privileged to submit queries on any imaginable topic .

		It will seek affiliation with all other institutions , societies , etc. , throughout the world .

		Among its first serious tasks , therefore , will be the compilation of a complete list of the almost innumer - able organizations in existence , with some indication of their scope and purpose .

		True , this was largely accom - plished a few years ago by the Carnegie Institution , in its '' Handbook of Learned Societies in
America	LOCATION	, '' and in its as yet unedited lists for foreign countries ; but there remains nevertheless ample room for the good work undertaken by '' Die Briicke . ''

		Its ultimately large corps of correspondents throughout the civilized world will form a very strong working organization .

		We have chosen to present first this international pro- ject in its latest form , before dealing with some of the national undertakings , in order to have the broadest possible ground-work for that ultimate coordination of endeavor which is rapidly becoming so essential .

		In
England	LOCATION	, the old
London	LOCATION	`` Notes and Queries , '' which has appeared weekly since
1849	DATE	and is rendered accessible by many excellent indexes , is an exceedingly useful means of research and intercommunication , par - ticularly on subjects of literature , grammar , linguistics , philology , history , biography , heraldry , genealogy , folk - lore , bibliography , and allied matters .

		There also exist in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and
Ireland	LOCATION	numerous local '' Notes and Queries '' magazines , and many societies of varied

		THE DIAL 41 purposes .

		Among those whose objects should be of gen - eral interest is the
British Institute of Social Service	ORGANIZATION	, 4
Tavistock Square	LOCATION	,
London	LOCATION	,
W. C.	PERSON	, which has an offi - cial organ , '' Progress . ''

		In seeking a likely candidate for appointment as the British representative of '' Die Briicke , '' however , we would most naturally turn to such an organization as The Information and
Agency Bureau	ORGANIZATION	,
J. W. Shaw	PERSON	, Director , 24
Hart Street	PERSON	,
Holborn	LOCATION	, Lon - don , W. C. Among Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	's current investigations is one relating to the production of crockery , china , earthenware , etc. , in the various countries , in behalf of a company making a patented tunnel oven for firing pottery .

		This is at least suggestive of the commercial possibilities of such a clearing-house .

		In
France	LOCATION	, we have '' L'Interme ` diaire des Chercheurs et Curieux , '' appearing in
Paris	LOCATION	three times a month , since
1864	DATE	.

		A general index to its contents to the year
1896	DATE	has been printed .

		A complete set of this periodical may be found in the library of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	.

		Many are the quaint and interesting contributions in its columns , relating to French history and art .

		We must not overlook , in passing , the existence of the
Institut International	ORGANIZATION	pour la diffusion des Experiences Sociales , under the general direction of Prof. Dr.
Rodolphe Broda	PERSON	, 59
Rue Claude Bernard	PERSON	,
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Its official organ , `` Les Documents du Progres , '' is inter - esting and useful .

		The French representation of '' Die Briicke '' might , perhaps , be assigned to the
Institut du Mois Scientifique et Industriel	ORGANIZATION	, in
Paris	LOCATION	, or to the
Association de Bibliographic et de Documentation Sci	ORGANIZATION	- entifique ,
Industrielle et Commerciale	ORGANIZATION	, of which the Directeur is
M. Jules Garc.on	PERSON	, 40 bis
Rue Fabert	ORGANIZATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	-LRB- viie -RRB- .

		As to
Germany	LOCATION	, '' Die Briicke '' itself , with headquar - ters in
Munich	LOCATION	, will doubtless provide its own national bureau .

		It might receive valuable assistance from such an organization as the Institut fiir Internationale !!

		Austausch fortschrittlicher
Erfahrungen	PERSON	-LRB-
International Institute	ORGANIZATION	for the interchange of progressive experi - ences -RRB- , of which the official organ , '' Dokumente des Fortschritts , '' is becoming more and more widely known .

		The Secretary is Prof.
J. H. Epstein	PERSON	, 22 Hermannstrasse , Frankfurt-am-Main .

		In the
United States	LOCATION	, we think first of the
Smith	PERSON	- sonian Institution , with its efficient International Ex - change through which , indeed , interrelations with '' Die Briicke '' were established
April 30 , 1912	DATE	, and the interchange of documents begun .

		The
Carnegie Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tution , also richly endowed , is , like the

		Ax INTIMATE VIEW OF A GREAT PAINTER .

		* Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	's book on
George Inness	PERSON	is a great service to all who desire to know the development of American landscape painting .

		It is not an attempt at a biography , or even at a critical estimate , but a personal record per - sonal not in the gossippy but in the artistic sense .

		Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	had particular opportunities for knowing Inness thoroughly as an artist , and his essay gives us a sketch based on intimate details .

		The painter 's development in power , his effort first for a command of form and com - position , then for color , atmosphere , value ; his technical theories of painting or of composition , his eccentric doings-over , his search for obscure laws of color ; his personal character , his inten - sity , vigor , impulsiveness , courage , these things are given us by an authority , and we must always be glad to have them .

		We are unfortunately lacking in studies like this on the work of our great painters .

		Whoever would understand their works must either be content with the paintings themselves as he may be able to see them in the public galleries or in occasional exhibitions , or he must rely upon the general histories of American painting which , however excellent , must lack whatever value would come from the authors ' being provided with independent studies of the painters with whom they had to deal .

		Both these methods leave a good deal to be desired .

		Our galleries , as a rule , do not attach much importance to American landscape , or , if they do , they are unable to carry out in any systematic way such a selection and arrangement as would serve as a guide to the student .

		The Metropolitan Museum in
New York	LOCATION	, for instance , and the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	have a good many pictures by American landscape painters , but their examples are only by accident representative pictures , and their catalogues give very little about them of use to the student .

		Our histories of American paint - ing are generally based upon the particular knowledge of the authors ; and although such is the very best foundation for such works , yet it is a great advantage to be able to correct or modify one 's own impression by the studies and opinions of others .

		Of such discussions there are on this subject very few .

GEORGE INNESS	PERSON	: The Man and His Art .

		By
Elliott Daingerfield	ORGANIZATION	.

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
Frederic Fairchild Sherman	PERSON	.

		Of course it may easily be alleged that the his - tory of American landscape has not been , until recently , a matter of great artistic interest or importance .

		The
Hudson River	LOCATION	,
Lake George	LOCATION	, or
White Mountain School	ORGANIZATION	, it may be pointed out , is hopelessly antiquated , and its pictures may be relegated to the lumber-room without loss .

		The pictures of
George Inness	PERSON	, in like manner , are pushed into obscurity by others who feel that American landscape painting began , for the purposes of the artist , with the followers of
Monet	ORGANIZATION	.

		All this may be quite true from the standpoint of the painter or the art-student commonly so-called .

		And yet I feel sure that an element of national interest that occupied so large a place in the mind of the people as did American landscape ought not to be allowed to fall into obscurity , if only from the standpoint of American history .

		It is true that schools and manners have succeeded each other , and that to those who love the present manner that of the past may be absurd .

		But such things have their ebb and flow .

		In the matter of subject only , which an amateur may understand more about than of the matter of technique , there have been very great changes .

		Forty years ago the pupils of Hunt sought out a pair of fence-bars to paint , just as twenty years later the disciples of Monet were satisfied with a haystack done in a dozen different lights .

		Both spoke scornfully of the `` panoramic '' views that had delighted the older men .

		But in the last few years the landscapes which one sees are as likely as not to exhibit wide stretches of country , while the pair of bars and the haystack seem rather dull .

		Inness himself reacted against the followers of
Thomas Cole	PERSON	, who , Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	thinks , borrowed the worst in the empty classicism of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		They painted mountains and lakes : Inness painted a pasture or an apple-orchard .

		Yet the
George Inness	PERSON	medal was awarded this year for a picture of
Lake Louise	LOCATION	in the
Canadian Rockies	ORGANIZATION	, a sub - ject quite as romantic as the '' Mount Corcoran '' of
Bierstadt	PERSON	.

		There is certainly much in the painting of the earlier men , and of Inness too , that has merely gone out of fashion .

		Their real character and spirit will generally be found well worth looking into and studying .

		All of this may seem far too long an introduc - tion to a comment on a book on the painting of
George Inness	PERSON	.

		Indeed , it may be said that
Inness	PERSON	is the one great exception to the general view just remarked .

		1 do not think he is .

		It is true that
Inness	PERSON	is at the present day much more highly esteemed by the general picture-lover than any who preceded or many who have followed
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 43 him .

		Compared with
Cole	PERSON	,
Durand	PERSON	,
Church	ORGANIZATION	,
Winslow Homer	PERSON	, I presume
Inness	PERSON	is to most people a sun among stars .

		There is a good rep - resentation of his pictures in most large galleries and in the great private collections .


Chicago	LOCATION	is especially fortunate in this respect , for the
Butler	PERSON	collection is the best to be found anywhere .

		But there is yet no very thorough or satisfac - tory study of his work , nor is there agreement as to its value .

		Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	's book does not precisely try to fill this lack .

		As has been said , it does not pretend even to be an estimate ; it is one of those preliminary studies of so much value to the critic .

		Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	tells us things about Inness that no one else knew things that one would want to be sure to take account of in getting to a true appreciation of his noble and beautiful art .

		It is a most attractive and interesting pic - ture of his master that he gives us , partly per - sonal though not too much so , partly artistic , with detail of method and ideas that must be of value to the technical student .

		It will not be a very important matter that I should not agree with Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	in his view of Inness .

		I could not , of course , pretend to an opinion of much value in comparison with his in the matter of painting .

		Just the value of
Inness	ORGANIZATION	's technique in comparison with all that has come in since his day is something about which I should have but the personal taste of any amateur .

		But so far as the pictures are concerned , there are certain points remarked by Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	on which one who is not a painter may fairly , I believe , desire to have an independent opinion .

		Chief of these matters is the view that
Inness	PERSON	really had more love and knowledge of Nature than many a man before him , or indeed beside him or after him , who could not paint so well .

		Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	says `` the frail , weak and altogether insipid effort of those about him was distasteful ; they borrowing the worst in the empty classicism of
Europe	LOCATION	produced nothing upon which such such a nature could lean , nor from which learn even the rudiments of land - scape art '' -LRB- p. 10 -RRB- .

		And he further gives us to understand that the contemporaries of
Inness	PERSON	's younger days were apostles of the brown tree in the foreground -LRB- p. 9 -RRB- , and that their method was opposed to copying the landscape `` he saw with his own eyes '' -LRB- p. 11 -RRB- .

		This must have been between
1845	DATE	and
1855	DATE	.

		The passage presents what is to me quite a new view of the American landscape-painting of that time .

		Those years saw the last of the paintings of
Cole	ORGANIZATION	, some of the best of
Durand	PERSON	's and the first of those of Church .

		We can not say who were the artists around
Inness	PERSON	, but surely it is not a common idea to believe that
Cole	PERSON	,
Durand	PERSON	, and
Church	ORGANIZATION	, men fairly representative of the landscape-painting of that time , borrowed the worst in the empty classicism of
Europe	LOCATION	or did not believe in paint - ing the landscape that they saw .

		Of
Cole	PERSON	some - thing of such an idea might prevail , but even he thought that he was following Nature closely and said so over and over again .

		Durand was a Pre-Raphaelite before the P.R.B. : Mr.
Still	PERSON	- man says that he `` first showed American artists what could be done by faithful and unaffected study of Nature in large studies carefully finished on the spot . ''

		And as to Church , his chief power was his wonderful eye for seeing the detail of Nature , and his still more remarkable hand for rendering what he saw .

		Inness , of course , often painted direct from Nature ; but he was not the only one to do so , and I should think myself , on the ground of Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	's accounts of his later methods , that his greatest success was ob - tained when he painted out of his own head .

		His head , like
Gainsborough	PERSON	's , was wonderfully stored with forms , but after his early copyings of Nature he very often depended entirely upon it .

		I have generally thought of
Inness	PERSON	, not as a leader in any return to Nature , but as one who developed a new and very beautiful way of presenting certain aspects of Nature .

		His con - temporaries were inferior to him there .

		Cole as early as
1825	DATE	tried to paint what he saw .

		So he says himself , and I see no reason to doubt it , least of all that he often did not do so .

		He saw , for instance , that Nature in the
summer	DATE	was green rather than brown .

		His '' Mount
Washington	LOCATION	'' -LRB- 1827 -RRB- is as green as anything of Constable 's , whose pictures he had never seen at that time .

		Then
Durand	PERSON	, who did not have
Cole	PERSON	's passion for the '' ideal , '' developed a kind of landscape painting that was nearly akin to that propounded by
Ruskin	PERSON	.

		Of Church it is said that when
Cole	PERSON	, his master , told him to select a subject one morning he chose the valley of the
Hudson River	LOCATION	.


Cole	PERSON	, looking at his work in the
afternoon	TIME	, set him another subject , namely , a mullein stalk .

		The story , if not true , is signifi - cant ; for Church is as remarkable for his accu - racy of detail as for his grasp of range .

		Now the great thing about
Inness	PERSON	was that he did not do anything at all like any of those things , but something quite different inspired , Mr.
Dain	PERSON	- gerfield says , by Barbizon .

		He did not aim at the particular facts , usu - ally of form and color , that interested most of 44 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, his contemporaries , he more commonly saw in Nature other facts facts of light , atmosphere , value .

		What he saw in Nature is more like what later men have seen than what
Cole	PERSON	,
Durand	PERSON	, and Church saw .

		But to represent
Inness	PERSON	as one of the first of those to whom truth to Nature , in any ordinary sense , was the main aim seems to me to convey a wrong idea , at least to the non-technical reader .

		Nor is this a minor point .

		It is the founda - tion of
Inness	PERSON	's greatness , the essence of his peculiar quality , and the reason why he was not greater than he was .

		It makes clear that
Inuess	PERSON	, like his predecessors and his successors , was limited to his own field of thought .

		He saw in Nature something very particular ; and to people chiefly interested in that particular kind of thing he is the greatest of American landscape painters .

		But he failed to see various other things of interest .

		During the first part of the nineteenth century the typical landscape painter in American opinion was
Salvator Rosa	PERSON	; afterward
Theodore Rousseau	PERSON	took that position ; then
Claude Monet	PERSON	.

		At the present day the first is commonly regarded with contempt , the second with indifference , the third with devotion .

		But it is a foregone conclusion that the love of
Monet	ORGANIZATION	will pass , because his view of Nature is as limited as that of
Salvator Rosa	PERSON	or
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		We like his pictures better because his view of Nature is limited to things that we have learned to like .

		But his vogue will certainly pass .

		In like manner
Inness	PERSON	's view of Nature appears to me to be limited .

		There was a time when his art seemed to me to include the most beautiful aspects of Nature , and from it I learned to admire and love much which might otherwise be still hidden from me .

		But with a wider acquaintance with the work of others , and of Nature herself , I have thought that there were other aspects quite as beautiful and interesting as those which Inness perceived .

		So one may not probably will not agree with Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	in his view of
George Inness	PERSON	.

		But this makes little difference in the value of his book .

		He has put into these few pages something of great value , namely ,
George Inness	PERSON	's own commentary on his own art , and he has been able to illustrate it by beautiful reproductions of typical pictures .

		No one will read the book without an increase of admiration for the artist .

		We need not put aside the work of others to make Inness seem great .

		His work presents some of the most beautiful aspects of Nature in a very beautiful way .

		TRAVELS ix
THE AMERICAN TROPICS	ORGANIZATION	.

		* `` Delight itself is a weak term to express the feelings of a naturalist who , for the first time , has wandered by himself in a Brazilian forest .

		The elegance of the grasses , the novelty of the parasitical plants , the beauty of the flowers , the glossy green of the foliage , but above all the general luxuriance of the vegetation , filled me with admiration .

		A most paradoxical mixture of sound and silence pervades the shady parts of the wood .

		The noise from the insects is so loud , that it may be heard even in a vessel anchored several hundred yards from the shore ; yet within the recesses of the forest a universal silence appears to reign .

		To a person fond of natural history , such a day as this brings with it a deeper pleasure than he can ever hope to experience again . ''


Charles Darwin	PERSON	.

		We are gradually waking up to the fact that there is a fairyland to the south of us , readily accessible within a week .

		The volume of travel to the American tropics accordingly increases , taxing the capacity of vessels running to
Central America	LOCATION	and the
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		With the open - ing of the
Panama Canal	LOCATION	, `` everybody '' will visit the Isthmus ; and after the excitement has died down , it will probably remain `` the thing '' to take the tropical route to
California	LOCATION	.

		At the same time , now that modern sanitation is able practically to abolish malaria , yellow fever , and other diseases , tropical regions will gradually become sufficiently healthy to be colonized by our countrymen in much greater numbers than heretofore .

		All this will not be without its dis - advantages , and if it happens -LRB- as it has happened in places -RRB- that we are chiefly known to the na - tives for our vulgarity and commercial crooked - ness , the discovery of the tropics by the people of the
United States	LOCATION	will seem to the rest of the world a calamity .

		Primarily owing to the intel - ligence and untiring energy of a small group of men , we have made an excellent impression by our work at
Panama	LOCATION	, and this should stand as a model for the future , no matter if it is suggest - ive of State Socialism .


Panama	LOCATION	, however , illus - trates organization , cooperation , government ; it does not closely touch the relation of the indi - vidual , as such , to his environment .

		The Amer - ican in the tropics , if he is to make the most of his opportunities , must cultivate at least in some degree the faculty of intelligent appreciation ; something at least of the feeling so well expressed by
Darwin	PERSON	in the quotation above .

		To do this , he must not be wholly ignorant , either of what is known , or of the vast opportunity still remain - * !

		THE DIAL 45 ing for increasing knowledge .

		Without being a professional naturalist , he may nevertheless read books of travel , and get an idea of the coun - tries he is to visit .

		If , in an amateur way , he aspires to add something to the storehouses of science , so much the better .

		Beginning thus , he is more than likely presently to find himself in possession of a delightful hobby .

		A lady of my acquaintance , during the present year , spent a month in
Guatemala	LOCATION	, and while there discov - ered a large tree with splendid red flowers , more than forty kinds of insects , and half a dozen other small animals , all wholly new to science .

		With the journey back and forth , she was absent from home just six weeks .

		It is not our purpose at the present time to enumerate the '' best hundred books '' on the American tropics .

		As a matter of fact , good books on tropical Nature are not numerous ;
Wallace	PERSON	,
Darwin	PERSON	, Spruce , and
Beebe	PERSON	, on
South America	LOCATION	, the charming volume of
P. H. Gosse	PERSON	on
Jamaica	LOCATION	, Belt on
Nicaragua	LOCATION	, are the ones that first come to mind .

		Belt 's famous little work is unfortunately out of print , and may only be obtained with difficulty , at a fancy price .

		Two new books now before us are the immediate cause of this discussion .


James Rod	PERSON	way , long resident in
British Guiana	ORGANIZATION	, well known as a competent and enthusiastic naturalist , has en - larged and revised his work on the natural history of that country , which now comes to us as a volume of 326 pages , well illustrated .

		He graphically describes the life of the forest , where the Indian seems part of the general order of things , one of the animals .

		He explains how the beauty and order of nature comes out of the struggle for existence ; and this term , instead of being a vague abstraction , is made to stand for living realities , described in detail .

		From the account of the Indian we quote a few paragraphs . ''

		The man of the forest is in almost perfect harmony with his surroundings , and if to be so is to be happy , as some have said , then the South American Indian must be one of the happiest of men ... Having lived iii the forest for ages , the Indian can hardly be looked upon as one of the rulers of creation , but rather as in perfect unison with nature .

		He is as much a part of the whole as the jaguar , the howling monkey , or the tapir .

		He does not interfere with the constitution of things does not clear great tracts of land builds no cities erects no monuments nor does he leave many more traces of his presence than the other inhabitants of the forest ... From one point of view he may be consid - ered as having attained perfection .

		The balance of life has been kept up , and , apart from outside influences , he does not exterminate a single animal .

		Nowhere per - haps is the fauna of such an ancient type so well pro- tected and so perfectly fitted to its environment , and nowhere can we study man as an animal so well as in the
Guiana	LOCATION	forest . ''

		Here and there , we may find reason to debate or dispute some of Mr.
Rodway	PERSON	's opinions , * but we always admire his ability to see and to de - scribe .

		He tells us that he has studied tropical nature for forty years ; his book is not based on the hasty impressions of a visitor , it is the fruit of long and persistent investigation .

		Perhaps `` investigation '' is not quite the word to use here , it is too suggestive of technicalities ; we may rather say that Mr.
Rodway	PERSON	has made himself at home in the forest , has lived the life there , and describes what he has felt and seen .

		Thus his narrative flows and has no suggestion of a catalogue ; there is nothing technical enough to frighten any educated reader , and yet it is clear that the author knows his subject from the technical side as well .

		Mr.
P. R. Lowe	PERSON	's '' A Naturalist on Desert Islands '' is a quite different book , the author having neither the maturity nor the experience of Mr.
Rodway	PERSON	.

		Nevertheless , it gives a read - able and interesting account of the voyages of Sir
Frederic Johnstone	PERSON	and his companions among the islands of the
Caribbean Sea	LOCATION	.

		The first part describes
Swan Islands	ORGANIZATION	, two small and isolated bits of land nearly a hundred miles north of the coast of
Honduras	LOCATION	.

		The rest of the book is de - voted to
Blanquilla	LOCATION	and the
Hermauos Islands	LOCATION	, north of
Venezuela	LOCATION	.

		Although the author and his companions made no long stay at these places , they were able to obtain much interesting infor - mation and a good series of specimens , especially of birds .

		Either the collections had not all been worked out at the time of writing , or Mr.
Lowe	PERSON	did not wish to burden his text with too many dry details , so we are left uncertain as to the total results of the expeditions .

		We hear , how - ever , of a new bird from
Blanquilla Island	LOCATION	, and various additions to our knowledge of the distri - bution of birds and other animals .

		There is also much interesting discussion of the problems con - nected with island life , while the human history of the places visited is well described .

		The effect upon the reader will be to make him wish to ex - plore some of these fascinating
Caribbean	LOCATION	islands ; and while few have a yacht or other means at their command , one may hope that some , at one time or another , will be found to take up the evidently uncompleted work .

		46 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, A SURVEY or ENGLISH POETRY .

		* The recent re-issue of Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's '' His - tory of English Poetry , '' which involves , besides the reprinting of the last two volumes , some revision of the text of the earlier ones , makes it fitting to consider the character and value of this monumental work .

		It is the fulfilment of an idea which in the eighteenth century was dreamed of by Pope and Gray , and brought to measurable achievement by
Thomas Warton	PERSON	, but which Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	was the first of mod - ern scholars to realize the survey of the whole course of English poetry at the hands of a single man .

		Such an undertaking gives rise , first of all , to the query whether any one man can hope to accomplish such a task in accordance with the standards of the scholarship of our time .

		The characteristic historical work of this generation is of the type represented by the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	Modern History '' and the ''
Cambridge History	ORGANIZATION	of English Literature , '' works formed by the combined labors of a company of scholars , no one of whom would have been able or willing to do the whole with thoroughness .

		One might , therefore , feel some misgivings concerning the efforts of a single scholar , whose previous studies have been largely confined to the modern period , to survey a field which has been so thoroughly subdivided by his contemporaries .

		And the result to some extent justifies the misgivings .

		The diverse researches of modern philology and literary history , in the English field , are only partially represented by Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's work .

		From one point of view this deficiency may be expressed by saying that the History has too few footnotes .

		To some readers this statement will appear a dreadful example of misguided academic pedantry .

		But if it is recalled that the History does not set out to be merely popular , but to attain genuine scholarliness of method and result , it will perhaps be admitted that , without abundant reference to authorities , to sources , to the discussion of doubtful matters , to incidental issues that constantly arise , queries will often be raised which can not be answered in the complacent ipse-dixit of a smooth-flowing text .

		Two books of recent years , which added respectively to the glory of American and British scholarship , and which are far from being pedantic or even merely learned , may be * A HISTORY OF ENGLISH POETRY .

		instanced as examples of what footnotes mean : Professor
F. B. Gummere	PERSON	's '' The Beginnings of Poetry '' and Professor
A. C. Bradley	PERSON	's '' Shakespearean Tragedy . ''

		* They mean that at every point the writer has not merely set forth the results of individual study , but has envisaged the problems suggested in all directions by the work of previous scholars .

		In this regard , then , Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's work , while not wholly negli - gent , leaves very much to be desired .

		In many a difficult tract of his territory , the character of epic represented in '' Beowulf , '' for example , the authorship of ''
Piers Plowman	PERSON	, '' the mean - ing of Euphuism , the authenticity of certain quasi-Shakespearean plays , one may trace the dangerous results of what from another stand - point might seem a really noble individualism or self-dependence .

		But on the other hand , if the detailed results of modern philology are inadequately repre - sented , the processes of that form of study which has come to be called comparative literature are conspicuous for their presence and effectiveness .

		In his own reading and thought Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	has embraced the classical literatures as well as those in other modern languages , thus avoiding the insular standpoint from which the story of English literature has generally been told .

		Typi - cal results are such , chapters as those on allegory in

		iii. , chap .

		14 -RRB- , chapters which for breadth of background it would be difficult to parallel in any similar work .

		A second query which naturally arises from the character of the undertaking is that which concerns the possibility of defining the bound - aries of `` English Poetry '' for such a purpose .

		Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	started out with a conspicuously simple and sensible definition : `` By English Poetry I mean metrical compositions written in our language . ''

		But as he proceeded he did not remain faithful to this .

		In the drama he found , as was to be anticipated , a troublesome problem , and courageously met it by including the whole subject of English Drama , at least for the earlier periods .

		Reaching the Elizabethan age , he allowed himself to include a chapter on Lyly and euphuistic prose , because of the undeniable relationship between these and poetical matters .

		For less obvious reasons , he later included a chap - * In the second instance , the book being composed of lec - tures published as delivered orally , the notes are relegated to the back of the volume , a method followed in the case of one or two matters by Mr.

		It is indeed pretty clear that , if poetry is viewed not as a form of art so much as the expression of national life always Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's leading idea its separation from prose literature becomes often difficult if not positively misleading .

		The thoughtful reader of these volumes will therefore almost inevitably come to the conclusion that the work should either have been expanded to form a History of English Literature , or curtailed to form a History of Modern English Poetry , the drama and other doubtful forms excluded .

		But , setting aside these perhaps ungenerous queries , what sort of a history is actually in our hand ?

		One , in the first place , of undeniable and impressive unity , such as the work of a com - pany of scholars could never attain .

		This unity is the outcome of the central purpose of the writer , which is stated repeatedly and consistently main - tained .

		At the outset he tells us that his aim is `` to treat poetry as an expression of the im - agination , not simply of the individual poet , but of the English people . ''

		And at the close his hope is that the completed work has enabled the reader to `` conceive more distinctly the gradual and majestic growth of the British Empire out of the institutions of the Middle Ages . ''

		This method produces a genuine history , as distin - guished from the succession of facts , biograph - ical and bibliographical , which usually go under that name where literature is concerned .

		The normal writer of '' literary history '' chiefly asks himself : When did
Smith	PERSON	live ?

		What books did he write ?

		What style did he write them in ?

		Are they better or worse than the books of Jones ?

		Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	always asks : What did
Smith	PERSON	say ?

		Why did he say it ?

		Above all , why was
Smith	PERSON	?

		And the answer to the second and third questions is always found in other people than
Smith	PERSON	commonly in the Whig party or the English nation .

		This method , at its best profound and illumi - nating , sometimes gives odd results .

		For when we seek to learn not merely what but why , we are always in some danger of weaving illusory webs of explanation ; and certain of Mr.
Court	PERSON	- hope 's theories tempt the reader to recall the tour deforce of
DeQuincey	ORGANIZATION	's in which he proved that the character of Greek literature was de - termined by the fact that the Greeks wore cot - ton clothing -LRB- no linen rags , no paper ; no paper , no books ; no books , no written style -RRB- .

		It may be true that the movement of poetry from sym - bolism to realism was produced by the combined influence of encyclopaedic education , feudal insti - tutions , and the growth of civil order -LRB- vol .

		i. , chap .

		xii . -RRB-

		; but it is very difficult to prove it , and would be still more difficult to disprove any conflicting hypothesis .

		It may be true that
Walter Scott	PERSON	is to be explained by the `` happy mixture of Law and Liberty that enabled
Scotland	LOCATION	to play so leading a part in the history of the romantic movement , '' and that the character of the poetry of the age of Pope is due to the Whig Revolution of
1688	DATE	; even if these things are not true , the assertion of them is suggestive and enlightening .

		But one rubs one 's eyes a bit at the assertion that the formal epithets the dewy meads and conscious bosoms and all the rest of the neo - classical poetry `` reflect the change from the feudal absolutism of the Stuarts to the
Parlia	LOCATION	- mentary system of the eighteenth century '' -LRB- v. , 42 -RRB- , and is perhaps tempted to think , subse - quently , that Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	believes the peace - ful Cumberland country and quiet waters of
Wordsworth	PERSON	's childhood home were the result of '' the general peace and order which , since the Revolution of
1688	DATE	, had settled upon the con - stitution of society '' -LRB- vi. , 160 -RRB- , though all that he really says is that they reflected that peace and order .

		Another difficulty with this historical method is that its followers are in danger of forgetting that , after all , there arises every now and then a man who does and says things not in the least as a representative of national forces and move - ments , but because he happens to want to do and say them .

		Perhaps in the end we shall be forced to admit that this is an illusion that in the last resort no poet , however free he may seem , can escape the Zeitgeist .

		But some of the most interesting phenomena of literature are significant chiefly from their apparent indepen - dence .

		If ever there was a poet who , entering the firmament of lyrical expression , left on it a track of passionately personal utterance , that poet was
John Donne	PERSON	.

		You may explain the peculiarities of his style by the church fathers in his Catholic home , or the decayed symbolism of
Marino	ORGANIZATION	, or what you will ; the flaming , con - torted individuality of his work remains .

		Now if we seek for an account of this in Mr.
Court	PERSON	- hope , what has he for us ?

		Why , we learn that
Donne	PERSON	as an individual poet does not seem to him very important , but that '' to those who see in poetry a mirror of the national life , ... the work of
Donne	ORGANIZATION	will always be profoundly inter - esting '' !

		-LRB- iii. , 168 -RRB- .

		One might as well say that 48 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	,
Halley	PERSON	's Comet was truly interesting only to those who had figured its orbit or analyzed its spectrum .

		A final difficulty with this disregard of indi - vidualism is the slight opportunity it gives for emphasizing the most characteristic phases of romantic art .

		Here Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	, as has long been known , is finely consistent ; and when the last volume of his History drew near there was no little curiosity felt as to the treatment he would accord the romantic poets whose doctrines he had often so vigorously opposed .

		When it was published , he was seen to be able to discuss them with conspicuous fairness of tone .

		With
Keats	PERSON	, to be sure , and his contempt for the eighteenth century , Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	finds it diffi - cult to be patient -LRB- how inartistic , he tells us , is the '' languid trickle '' of his couplets when com - pared with those of
Goldsmith	PERSON	, whom Keats despised ! -RRB-

		; but of
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Shelley	PERSON	there are more than respectful accounts , and one is tempted to cry Bravo !

		when the critic permits himself so to warm to the lines `` To a Skylark '' as to call them '' divine . ''

		Two notes , notwith - standing , are always audible in Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	's story of the romanticists .

		In the first place , it is inevitably what they say that interests him , never the mere charm of form , the ravishing gratuitous beauty of detail , the '' mirific mo - ment , '' as Mr.
Saintsbury	PERSON	somewhere has it , which for true lovers of romantic art is always so large a part of the sum of pleasure .

		In the second place , the doctrines of the new school of poetry are nowhere approved , but , on the con - trary , the poets are represented as succeeding in spite of them .

		As in his earlier writings , Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	is inexorably set to combat the poetic movement inaugurated by
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	, because of its aim `` to exchange the ancient method , consisting in the ideal imi - tation of external objects , for an introspective analysis of the impressions of the individual mind '' -LRB- vi. , 192 -RRB- .

		And this teaching is further enforced by a new definition of poetry as '' the art of expressing imaginative ideas universally existing in any free society '' -LRB- vi. , 444 -RRB- .

		By reason of this faith , the author of the History a classicist in an age when classicism seems hopelessly defeated , and a spiritual Tory in a time when self-confessed Tories are no more views despondently the present state of poetry , and concludes his story by expressly declining to continue it beyond the time of
Scott	LOCATION	, because the romantic movement has separated poetry '' from the organized course of national life . ''

		A strange mishap this , to have so defined poetry that in the Victorian age it disappears from sight !

		On the other hand , for the classical age , the `` excellent and indispensable eighteenth cen - tury , '' Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	remains our best au - thority one may almost say our only authority .

		For many a day accounts of our eighteenth - century poetry have consisted chiefly of two parts : the explanation of why most of it is unreadable , and the recognition of exceptions in the case of the so-called heralds of romanti - cism .

		Wherever a writer exhibited any human sympathy , love of beauty , or sense of the eter - nities , or wrote in anything except the heroic couplet , he was a sign of the `` romantic revival . ''

		The rest was silence .

		Thanks to Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	, we now have the first real account of the most characteristic poetry of that age , what its numerous half - forgotten representatives really said , and why .

		He can read and interpret , without contempt , without even the gently deri - sive humor with which Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, for example , has gracefully described them , the poems on cider , on sheep-raising , on the imagination , on morals and politics , of which in general it may be said that none have named them but to jeer .

		-LRB- Nay , did not Mr.
Courthope	PERSON	himself , a year or two since , write an extremely interesting poem , reminiscent of the neo-classical manner , on the raising of hops and the mistakes of the Liberal party ? -RRB-

		His account of the poetical purposes of Crabbe -LRB- vi. , 365 -RRB- , of the development of `` classic purity '' of poetical expression -LRB- v. , 359 -RRB- , of the style of
Cowper	PERSON	-LRB- v. , 357 -RRB- , one can hardly conceive as being bettered .

		In other words , where the course of English poetry does run par - allel with that of English thought and society , and can be explained by national rather than individual facts , our historian is not only a safe but an illuminating guide .

		If some emphasis has been laid , then , on de - fects or idiosyncrasies of method , it is because they seemed to be instructive , not to detract from the value of the whole .

		They result from the intense unity and singleness of purpose which at the same time give this book its power .

		They can be corrected by the intelligent reader ; and the History is not meant for any other .

		For some of us the continuous development of its his - torical method seems so suggestive and enlight - ening that we may well prefer it to works -LRB- like the
Cambridge	LOCATION	History , for example -RRB- made on the patchwork plan , despite the greater accur - acy of detail which in our time only composite scholarship can hope to give for so large a field .

		THE DIAL 49 CONTROLLING MAN 'S EVOLUTION .

		* In respect of material things the progress of the world during the
last half century	DATE	has admit - tedly been almost incomprehensibly rapid .

		It is sometimes urged , however , that the advance has been only material that neither ideas nor ideals have even measurably kept pace .

		The validity of such an assertion is doubtful on many grounds .

		But certainly one of its neatest refutations is to be found in the eugenics move - ment .

		Fifty years ago the intellectual world was profoundly concerned in the discussion of whether there was such a process as organic evolution , and whether man was a product of it , through the operation of natural -LRB- as opposed to supernatural -RRB- causes .

		To-day the eugenics movement takes as its fundamental aim and pur - pose the conscious and deliberate control and direction of human evolution , physical , mental , and moral .

		What a change of outlook this im - plies !

		The aeroplane and the stage-coach are not more widely separated than are the ideas of eugenics from those held by the majority of edu - cated men regarding evolution at the time when the '' Origin of Species '' appeared .

		And withal , eugenics is being taken quite as a matter of course ; it is `` catching on '' to an extraordinary degree with radical and conservative alike , as something for which the time is quite ripe .

		The leader in the study of eugenics in this country is Dr.
C. B. Davenport	PERSON	, the versatile Director of the Carnegie Institution 's Station for Experimental Evolution at
Cold Spring Harbor	ORGANIZATION	, and his new book on `` Heredity in Relation to Eugenics '' is altogether the best introduction to the new science that has yet appeared .

		As the title implies , the chief stress in his treatment of the subject is on the side of inheritance .

		Following a brief introductory account of the elementary principles of heredity in general , a mass of material is presented to show how human traits are inherited .

		As some of this material is new , the book makes a real contri - bution to knowledge , an unusual thing , by the way , for a popular treatise to do even in a small degree .

		For these hitherto unpublished data the author draws on the Archives of the
Eugenics Record Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		formed , through the generosity of Mrs.
E. H. Harriman	PERSON	, is collecting and preserving in a man - ner to insure permanency , pedigree data regard - ing a wide range of human characteristics and their inheritance .

		Besides this original material , the biological , medical , and anthropological lit - erature is drawn upon for cases illustrating the inheritance of particular traits .

		In presenting the subject , free use is made of pedigree charts , which add greatly to the value of the book for the more or less casual reader who is not interested in minor details .

		These charts enable one almost at a glance to grasp the main features of a particular case of inheritance of a disease , a criminal tendency , or some other characteristic .

		Data are given respecting the inheritance of forty-one different human char - acters , including such things as eye-color , hair - color , ability , handwriting , pauperism , crimi - nality , feeble-mindedness , insanity , and a series of different diseases which includes one or more representatives of nearly all the different classes of afflictions to which flesh is heir .

		Whether this is to be regarded as entertaining reading depends a good deal on one 's point of view .


Bob Sawyer	PERSON	would no doubt have found it entrancing .

		But whether interesting or not , the array of evidence can not fail to be impressive to any thoughtful person .

		It brings home to one with really shock - ing force the tremendous importance of carefully choosing one 's grandparents .

		Since this is not an altogether easy thing for the individual to do , society for its own good must attend to it .

		Here lies the keynote to the eugenics propaganda .

		The
last quarter	DATE	of the book deals with some general topics , of which the most important is the eugenic significance of migrations , in their bearing upon the geographical distribution of inheritable human traits .

		A fairly extensive bibliography and an index complete the volume , which taken as a whole deserves high commen - dation as a vigorous , forceful , and sane presen - tation of a subject which must be given serious attention by everyone interested in the future of his race and his nation .

		The book is not with - out small faults : it bears plenty of evidence of having been produced under high pressure ; and the biologist will find instances where doubtful points are optimistically dodged , and statements made which would scarcely stand searching tech - nical criticism .

		But these are matters of detail , and will be freely excused by everyone in view of the excellence of the work as a whole . ''

		Biological Aspects of Human Problems '' is a posthumous work of the late Dr.
C. A. Herter	PERSON	, in whose untimely death scientific medicine 50 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, suffered severe loss .

		While not strictly a contri - bution to the eugenics movement , it nevertheless contains much material bearing directly on the problem with which this science is concerned .

		The standpoint from which the book is written is indicated in the following statement : '' Having reached a time of life when I began to feel confidence that the laws of biology might often prove reliable guides to the understanding of puzzling situ - ations in life , I experienced a desire to state my views to my children in a manner more definite than is possi - ble in conversation .

		I am now led to publish my inter - pretation of biological laws in their bearing on human life in the hope that they may prove of some service to persons who have faith that an understanding of such laws is frequently a help to more intelligent and humane conduct . ''

		This hope can not fail to be realized .

		Many per - sons have wished that there might be written just such a sane and temperate discussion of the bearing of biological laws on the problems of everyday life as this is .

		The first section deals with the animal body as a mechanism , showing that everything we now know of biology indi - cates that the functioning of the body , including every sort of mental activity , is determined and regulated by the operation of physical and chemical laws .

		If one chooses to believe in `` vitalism , '' `` free-will , '' or any form of super - naturalism in respect to matters spiritual , he is of course at liberty to do so , but he must base his belief on something other than scientific which is to say , rational grounds .

		The evi - dence in favor of fatalism , to which the author 's view leads , is presented with quiet temperateness and unfailing optimism .

		The discussion of this doctrine closes with these words : '' It teaches that each human being should have the best obtainable chance for self-development , and be - comes the enemy of social conditions which stand in the way of such opportunity .

		It teaches that an individual should be judged in relation to the chance he has had for self-improvement , and not by an arbitrary standard .

		But it does not teach that any two human beings are equal in potential for achievement .

		It expects many failures , but it judges them leniently .

		It counts on the emergence from time to time of human beings able to point out new relationships between old materials ; yet it does not overpraise these successes .

		It looks hope - fully to the future because it sees in the human germ plasm a tendency to improve in the presence of reason - ably friendly surroundings .

		It is the enemy of the doctrine of laissez faire , believing in intelligent interfer - ence and regulation in all directions .

		And finally , the doctrine of scientific fatalism looks only for results ex - actly proportioned to the factors which determine per - sonality the forces inherent in the germ plasm and the external forces which have been brought into action upon these primitive materials . ''

		The second part of the book deals with the self-preservative instinct .

		An examination of the facts indicates that there can be no single specific method whereby longevity may be cer - tainly attained .

		The factors which tend to cur - tail life are multifarious , and not less so must be any intelligent attempt to prolong the span of human life .

		Belief in personal immortality is regarded as a natural form of egotism grow - ing out of the instinct of self-preservation .

		The author 's discussion of the sex-instinct , which occupies the third part of the book , may be unreservedly commended .

		The final section discusses the relation of the fundamental in - stincts of self-preservation and of sex to the higher development of man in respect of religion and the fine arts .

		It is not difficult to show that a combination or fusion of these instincts has had much to do with such spiritual and idealistic activities of the human mind .

		An extremely fair and candid discussion of the vexed question of the education of the young in regard to matters of sex leads to the conclusion that such education is imperatively demanded , not merely on individualistic grounds , but for the good of the race .

		A final summarizing of the author 's whole philosophy of life brings to a close a not - able book .

		Professor
Kellicott	PERSON	's `` The Social Direction of Human Evolution '' is an expansion of a series of lectures on eugenics presented to a col - lege audience .

		The book stands in commend - able contrast to the bulk of popular writing on the subject .

		Equipped with a thorough tech - nical knowledge of biology , the author discusses the problems of race-betterment with good judg - ment and a keen appreciation of fundamental biological difficulties and opportunities .

		What has been accomplished in the study of human inheritance is briefly reviewed , with examples of pedigrees .

		A temperate outline is given of the possibilities of eugenics .

		Altogether , the book furnishes a useful and trustworthy survey of the eugenics movement , and what it has so far accomplished .

		The only technical point on which it is possibly open to criticism is in ac - cepting perhaps a little too unreservedly some of the results of the statistical school of eugenists .

		The book inevitably challenges comparison with that of Dr.
Davenport	PERSON	discussed above , and , it must be said , suffers somewhat in the compar - ison .

		It lacks the spontaneity , and with it the compelling grasp of the reader 's attention , which go with immediate personal research activity in the field discussed .

		Professor
Kellicott	PERSON	's book is a compilation of the study , carefully and thoroughly done , but discussing eugenics , after all , as a somewhat academic

		THE DIAL 51 problem ; Dr.

		STERNE AS A LETTER - WHITER .

		* It seems as if the neglect which
Sterne	PERSON	suf - fered for nearly a century after his death were being avenged upon the present generation , for within the last fifty years no less than seven considerable treatises more or less biographical and critical have appeared with him as their subject .

		Professor
Cross	PERSON	's `` Life and Times of
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	'' is a scholarly and interesting piece of work , written without pedantry and with a lively sympathy for its very lively subject .

		As a biography it has assuredly not been surpassed by Mr.
Melville	PERSON	's work , now published .

		More - over , it is confined to one volume of moderate size , and is sold at a reasonable price .

		Why Mr.
Melville	PERSON	or his publishers should spread his work over two volumes , each bulkier than Professor Cross 's and both containing only 673 pages in all , and then charge three times as much , passes comprehension .

		Have book-buyers sud - denly fallen into great wealth , that they choose to pay for thick paper and big type regardless of the matter ?

		Or do they want to fill their shelves with an imposing array of fat octavos ?

		It is this very cost of the book that militates against its chief claim to attention .


Sterne	PERSON	's letters are not cheaply and easily accessible , and the `` Journal to Eliza '' can be had only in Pro- fessor
Cross	ORGANIZATION	's edition of the works .

		It would therefore be well worth while to have a `` Life and Letters '' for a moderate sum , even though the letters were not complete .

		Mr.
Melville	PERSON	has given us the greater part of the letters and all the `` Journal , '' and to these he subordinates very wisely the actual biography .

		He makes
Sterne	PERSON	speak for himself .

		And
Sterne	PERSON	's letters are more interesting as biographical material than as epistolary litera - ture .

		In his letters we have him as the philan - derer , who is finally smitten himself , as the worldly ecclesiastic , and the boon companion of the notorious Demoniac ,
John Hall-Stevenson	PERSON	, but very little of him as an author of keen insight or even of deep humor .

		his life with the words of his undying devotion sounding in their ears , till
Eliza	PERSON	came and stayed till death took him .

		Married , though unhappily , he thus writes to Mile , de Fourmantelle : '' My dear
Kitty	PERSON	, I beg you will accept of the enclosed Sermon , which I do not make you a present of merely because it was wrote by myself , but because there is a beautiful character in it , of a tender and compassionate mind in the picture given of
Elijah	LOCATION	.

		Road it , my dear
Kitty	PERSON	, and believe me when I assure you that I see some - thing of the same kind and gentle disposition in your heart which I have painted in the Prophet 's , which has attach 'd me so much to you and your Interests that I shall Live and dye your affectionate and faithful
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	. ''

		It was the same
Kitty	PERSON	who obligingly wrote to Garrick at
Sterne	ORGANIZATION	's dictation in the following modest fashion : '' There are two Volumes just published here , which have made a great noise , and have had a tremendous run .

		... It is the ' Life and Opinions of
Tristram Shandy	ORGANIZATION	. '

		... If you have not seen it , pray get it and read it , because it has a great character as a witty smart Book , and if you think so , your good word in Town will do the Author , I am sure , great service .

		His name is
Sterne	PERSON	, a gentleman of great Preferment , and a Pre - bendary of the
Church of York	ORGANIZATION	, and has a great char - acter , in these parts , as a man of Learning and Wit ; the graver people , however , say ' t is not fit for young Ladies to read his Book , so perhaps you ' 1 think it not fit for a young Lady to recommend it ; however the Nobility and Great Folks stand up mightily for it , and some say ' t is a great Book , tho ' a little tawdry in some places . ''

		This was before
Sterne	PERSON	really had become a great man , and even
Kitty	PERSON	's services were acceptable towards his realizing his ambitions .

		And he was wise enough to know that a tang of naughtiness will help mightily to sell a book .

		Yet when he was actually charged with immorality in his book , see how he defends his spotless reputation : '' But for the chaste married , and chaste unmarried part of the sex they must not read my book !

		Heaven forbid the stock of chastity should be lessened by the ' Life and Opinions of
Tristram Shandy	ORGANIZATION	' yes , his opin - ions it would certainly debauch 'em .

		God take them under his protection in the fiery trial , and send us plenty of Duennas to watch the workings of their humours , till they have got safely through the whole work . ''

		After all ,
Sterne	PERSON	more truly expressed his intent in writing when he told
Bishop Warburton	PERSON	in a somewhat peppery letter , '' I will , however , do my best though laugh , my Lord , I will , and as loud as I can too . ''

		The last and greatest '' affair '' of
Sterne	PERSON	's life was with Mrs.
Draper	PERSON	, the
Eliza	PERSON	of the Letters and the Journal .

		Of his relation to her he makes a future editor of the '' Sentimental Jour - ney '' write the following note : '' Her name he will tell the world was
Draper	PERSON	a native of

		Mrs.

		Mr.
Draper	PERSON	dying in the year ***** This Lady returned to
England	LOCATION	, and Yorick the year after becoming a widower They were married and returning to one of his Livings in
York	LOCATION	- shire , where was a most romantic situation they lived and died happily and are spoke of with honour in the parish to this day . ''

		And the facts are that
Sterne	PERSON	died the follow - ing year , that Mrs.
Draper	PERSON	ran away from her husband
six years later	DATE	, and that she died in
1778	DATE	, ten years after
Sterne	PERSON	!


Sterne	PERSON	knew well enough that his disease was incurable and that he could never marry Mrs.
Draper	PERSON	, even if her husband were suddenly and obligingly to die , but it does not follow from his speaking of her as his second wife that all his affection was mere sentimental moonshine .

		There is a ring of sin - cerity , one must believe , in these words spoken so near the end of his fatal disease : `` Thou shalt lye down and rise up with me about my bed and about my paths , and shalt see out all my Ways adieu adieu and remember one eternal truth , My dear
Bramine	PERSON	, wch is not the worse , because I have told it thee a thousand times before That I am thine .

		.

		and thine only and forever . ''

		And again three months later he says : '' And now ,
Eliza !	PERSON

		Let me talk to thee But what can I say , what can I write but the yearnings of heart wasted with looking and wishing for the Return Return Return !

		my dear Eliza !

		May heaven smooth the Way for thee safely to us , and Joy for Ever . ''

		It is not a pleasant picture that we get of
Sterne	PERSON	in this Journal .

		His particulars about his ailments and their treatment by his physi - cians do not exalt him in our eyes , and make us wonder what exactly were his relations to his
Eliza	LOCATION	.

		Compared with
Swift	ORGANIZATION	's Journal to Stella it sinks into pitiable insignificance .

		Swift pre - served the decencies in writing to
Stella ; Sterne	PERSON	, improving upon his own advice to
Smollett	PERSON	in the well known incident in the `` Sentimental Journey , '' tells his ailments to his physician and then repeats to
Eliza	LOCATION	what he had said .

		If he is coarse in the Journal and elsewhere , he is profane in his letters to
John Hall	PERSON	-
Stevenson	PERSON	.

		Thus : `` Remember me sometimes in your potations bid Panty pray for me , when he prays for the
Holy Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	pre - sent my compliments to Mrs.
Ferguson	PERSON	and be in peace ^ and charity with all mankind And the blessing of God the Father , Son , and Holy Ghost be with you .

		Amen '' And this to the author of the '' Crazy Tales , '' as vile a collection of stories as were ever printed in English !

		The best side of the man is seen in his affec - tion for his daughter
Lydia	PERSON	.

		For her sake he would do anything , even be kind to his im - possible wife : '' But I think , my
Lydia	LOCATION	, that thy mother will survive me - do not deject her spirits with thy apprehensiveness on my account .

		I have sent you a necklace , buckles , and the same to your mother .

		My girl can not form a wish that is in the power of her father , that he will not gratify her in and I can not in justice be less kind to thy mother . ''

		One is almost sorry to have read these letters .

		They seem like '' Tristram '' and the ''
Sentimen	PERSON	- tal Journey '' without the humor that makes these works unsurpassed in their kind .

		Sterne could transmute into art thoughts and feelings that are perilously near the common and the unclean .

		It is not by the eccentricity of his style , for that would soon pass away into the limbo of freaks and follies , but by his surpassing humor and his knowledge of the human heart that he holds his readers at any rate his mas - culine readers ; but in these letters we have no distinguished style , no real humor , no convin - cingly genuine feeling throughout .

Letchworth	PERSON	's successful and profitable connection with the
Buffalo	LOCATION	firm of
Pratt	PERSON	and
Letchworth	LOCATION	, hard - ware dealers , was but preliminary to his far more im - portant labors in the cause of public charity , which he entered upon when , in
1873	DATE	, at fifty years of age , he found himself pecuniarily able to retire from busi - ness and devote himself to benevolence .

		It was in that year that he was appointed by Governor Dix to membership on the
New York State Board of Charities	ORGANIZATION	, a position most honorably and usefully filled by him for twenty-three years , after which he
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 53 continued to the end of his life , in
1910	DATE	, to concern himself with the causes that had become of such en - grossing interest to him in the preceding decades .

		His work and his writings for the amelioration of the lot of the unfortunate are widely known and of course form the chief theme of Mr.
Larned	PERSON	's carefully - written chapters .

		But the glimpses afforded of the more intimate and personal side of Mr.
Letchworth	PERSON	's character will give the book its chief charm to many readers .

		Of
Letchworth	LOCATION	the man we read : `` His enjoyments were of the sweeter and gentler sort .

		The lovelier sides of nature , the finer things of art , the generous exhibitions of humanity , appealed to him most .

		He was exceptionally fond of poetry , and , with a catholic taste , delighted in reading it and having it read to him , and carried in memory a large store of it , which he had begun to accumulate in his youth .

		To know him in this character , and to have acquaintance , at the same time , with the strenuous business man that he was for thirty years and the strong state official that he was for twenty-three more , vigilant , decisive , resolute , practically saga - cious , successful beyond the common , in both exhibi - tions , was to have a revelation of character that is exceedingly rare in its combination of qualities , and exceedingly fine . ''

		Commendation of Mr.
Larned	PERSON	's style and workmanship would , of course , be superflu - ous .

		Illustrations , a list of Mr.
Letchworth	PERSON	's writings , and an index , are duly provided .

		Chapter , on the Zt uld Seem to the Student of the broiderer 's art broiderer 's art that little could be in
England	LOCATION	.

		gained by the division of the history of that art in
England	LOCATION	into two parts ecclesiastical and secular .

		It is not always readily determined to which class an ancient embroidery may be assigned , as in the case of the richly wrought palls or hearse cloths belonging to the old
City Companies	ORGANIZATION	.

		There were times , furthermore , when the custom prevailed of converting wearing apparel into ecclesiastical vestments .

		Even in recent times religious symbols have been freely used in embroideries intended for secular use , and in the history of the development of needlecraft no such distinction as that above referred to appears .

		The superiority of the English ecclesiastical embroidery , about which much has been written , is universally acknowledged : that a like excellence was attained in the production of embroideries for other purposes than for the enrich - ment of the church and church services , might have been generally taken for granted .


M. Jourdain	PERSON	, however , in the eleven chapters of his book on `` English Secular Embroidery '' -LRB- Button -RRB- , finds much to contribute to our knowledge of the history and technique of embroidery in
England	LOCATION	from a study of the embroideries which were not at all intended for ecclesiastical enrichment , and which were produced in greater quantity than we have been wont to suppose .

		Aside from this interest to the embroiderer , these chapters throw valuable sidelights upon the domestic and economic life of the peoples of the
Saxon	LOCATION	,
Tudor	LOCATION	, and
Stuart	PERSON	periods and of later times .

		The book is full of information regarding the different materials used and the technique em - ployed at different times , and regarding the various styles or fashions having their peculiar vogue at various periods ; and the wealth of illustration en - hances the value of this information to those who at the present day are interested in needlecraft .

		Of especial interest is the final chapter on Samplers .

		Originally these were patterns of embroidery on strips of linen , hence the name sampler exemplar or ensampler .

		Later they came to be used in the instruction of the young women of
England	LOCATION	, not only in needlecraft but in morals and religion , and even in history and geography as a number of map samplers still extant attest .

		There are several good biographies `` Le'TaSurne . ''

		of
William the Silent	ORGANIZATION	in English , but Mr.
Jack Collings Squire	PERSON	, late Scholar of
St. John 's College	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	, now gives us a `` Life '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- which makes use of material that Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	and
Miss Putnam	PERSON	, not to speak of
Motley	ORGANIZATION	, were unable to take advantage of .

		His volume is thus richer by the inclusion of cer - tain minor details that his predecessors were ignorant of , and is moreover interesting from beginning to end .

		Mr.
Squire	PERSON	's point of view is not a new one , except perhaps in so far as he maintains that the devoted and judicious leader 's life was a continuous development , and not a series of separate and incon - sistent phases .

		Though educated into the
Catholic Church	ORGANIZATION	in youth , every drop of blood in his body was Protestant , and it was inevitable that he should sooner or later come into his own religiously .

		Though a loyal subject of
Philip	LOCATION	, if
Philip	LOCATION	had given him the slightest hint of a chance to remain so , he was a man who could see far into the future ; and whereas Motley asserts that '' his treasonable thoughts '' began with his discovery , in 1 566 , that
Philip	PERSON	was secretly planning to overthrew his sister 's `` Accord '' and root out every vestige of liberty , Mr.
Squire	PERSON	has been able to show that `` treasonable thoughts , '' the suspicion , that is , that since the
Netherlands	LOCATION	were unalterably Protestant and Philip a tyrant whose nature was absolutely incapable of yielding , violent resistance might one day be inevitable , had been in the back - ground of his mind from his very early manhood .

		Mr.
Squire	PERSON	characterizes his hero happily in the term , `` wonderful opportunist genius , '' and dwells de - lightedly on what may well be the most striking evi - dence of that quality in his history .

		The Protestant majority in
Antwerp	LOCATION	, maddened by the disgraceful butchering of their co-religionists in a one-sided struggle which had occurred without the walls , were in imminent danger of wreaking revenge on their Catholic fellow-citizens .

		Antwerp was prevailingly Calvinist .

		William `` knew and regretted the enmity which subsisted between the Calvinists and the
Luth	PERSON	- erans .

		Since , however , it was there , he determined to make use of it ... he had conversations with the leading Lutherans ... His own notions leaning toward the
Augsburg	LOCATION	Confession served him well 54 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, ... he persuaded the good men that , for the mo - ment , the cause of the Catholics was theirs ... The Catholics and the Lutherans were now united on the side of the authorities , '' and the Catholics were saved .

		It is this sort of skilful choice of the essential and the strikingly illustrative that makes the book both read - able and useful .

		Mr.
Herbert Croly	PERSON	's faithful and readafte account of ''
Marcus Alonzo Hanna	PERSON	: His Life and Work '' -LRB- Mac - millan -RRB- is especially commendable for its frank acceptance of Mr.
Hanna	PERSON	's limitations , its freedom from hero-worship , its truthful presentation of the real
Mark Hanna	PERSON	, successful business man and shrewd politician .

		In the following passage , for instance , briefly characterizing the able worker for his party , there is no attempt at idealization : `` In order , consequently , to understand
Mark Hanna	PERSON	's point of departure in politics we must bear in mind -LRB- 1 -RRB- that he was an industrial pioneer , and instinct - ively took to politics as well as business ; -LRB- 2 -RRB- that in politics as in business he wanted to accomplish results ; -LRB- 3 -RRB- that politics meant to him active party service ; -LRB- 4 -RRB- that successful party service meant the acceptance of prevailing political methods and abuses ; and -LRB- 5 -RRB- finally that he was bound by the instinctive consistency of his nature to represent in politics , not merely his other dominant interest , but the essential harmony between the interests of busi - ness and those of the whole community . ''

		He was not , however , Mr.
Croly	PERSON	does his best to prove to us , `` unscrupulous , inhumanly selfish , the sweater of his own employees , the relentless enemy of organized labor , the besotted plutocrat , the incarnate dollar - mark , '' as his enemies were fond of representing him .

		The best side of the man shows itself in his attach - ment to Mr.
McKinley	PERSON	.

		`` He had in the first place a veritable gift for friendship .

		His personal rela - tions with other men constituted the very core and substance of his life .

		He had served Mr.
McKinley	PERSON	, as he had served so many others , because of disin - terested personal devotion ; but in the case of Mr.
McKinley	PERSON	the personal devotion was heightened by feelings derived from another source .

		This partic - ular friendship had awakened his aspirations .

		His general disposition was such that an ideal could make a peculiarly strong appeal to him only when it was embodied in a human being .

		Mr.
McKinley	PERSON	's finer qualities aroused in him the utmost admira - tion . ''

		There was a vast deal of human nature in Mr.
Hanna	PERSON	, and his biography , well written and suit - ably illustrated , impresses that fact on the reader .

		In writing his `` Short History of the Scottish People '' -LRB-
Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Dr.
Donald MacMillan	PERSON	has rendered a distinct service to the history of his native land : he has given us a readable and reason - ably accurate account of Scottish development , in a single volume of moderate compass .

		Except for sketchy compilations of the text-book type , our historical literature has no other treatment of this subject in one volume .

		To tell the story of ten troubled centuries in fewer than five hundred pages is a difficult undertaking ; but , everything consid - ered , the author has achieved a signal success .

		The annals of
Scotland	LOCATION	are replete with dramatic inter - est ; they are full of thrilling episodes , and teem with striking personalities .

		Dr.
MacMillan	PERSON	appre - ciates this fact : he knows the literary values of certain classes of episodes and writes accordingly .

		In grouping the events about certain dominant personalities , he has been able to unify his work and to invest it with an interest that an impersonal story can not have ; but at the same time he fails to do justice to the great popular movements , which are , after all , the essential facts in the history of a `` people . ''

		It would also have been well if the author had broken with the British habit of telling the story by reigns .

		Almost every chapter is headed by the name of the sovereign ; but there are times when the sovereign is of small importance com - pared with certain other chiefs in the kingdom .

		An attractive feature of the narrative is the liberal spirit in which the author treats the long conflict with the southern kingdom .

		While truly patriotic , he realizes that the union has been a blessing to Scotchmen as well as to Englishmen .

		His work is consequently free from such superfluous outbursts as are sometimes found in Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's history .

		The author practically closes his account with
1745	DATE	; a concluding chapter carries the story on to
1843	DATE	, but in the form of a summary only .

		A handbook '' The British We .

		st Indies , '' by Mr. to the British
Algernon E. Aspinall	PERSON	, is the fourth
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		volume in what is known as the '' All Red Series '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- covering the different parts of the
British Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volumes already published deal with
Canada	LOCATION	,
Australia	LOCATION	, and
New Zealand	LOCATION	.

		As with its predecessors , this book on the
West Indies	LOCATION	is the work of a competent man , thoroughly in touch with his subject .

		Mr.
Aspinall	PERSON	is the Honorary Secretary to the
West India	LOCATION	Commit - tee , and has therefore had exceptional opportunities for informing himself as to the political and com - mercial history of the
West Indies	LOCATION	.

		Opening with a chapter on the discovery of the islands , he sketches rapidly their history , physical features , flora and fauna , the social and industrial life of the people , religion , education , local government , railways , bank - ing , agriculture , and concludes with several very interesting chapters on the future of this important group of British colonies , how they may be affected by the opening of the
Panama Canal	LOCATION	, their relations with
Canada	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, and the move - ment toward confederation into one strong common - wealth .

		There are obvious difficulties in the way of bringing into one political union such scattered colonies as
Jamaica	LOCATION	, the
Bahamas	LOCATION	,
Trinidad	LOCATION	,
British Guiana	ORGANIZATION	, the
Leeward Islands	LOCATION	,
Barbados	LOCATION	, and British
Honduras	LOCATION	, not to mention
Bermuda	LOCATION	; nevertheless the advantages would be enormous , both from an

		THE DIAL 55 international and an inter-imperial point of view .

		As Mr.
Aspinall	PERSON	points out , at the last Imperial Con - ference in
London	LOCATION	,
New Zealand	LOCATION	, with a population of 1,000,000 , and
Newfoundland	LOCATION	, with a population of less than 250,000 , took an active part in every discussion , while the
West Indies	LOCATION	, with a population of 2,000,000 , were not represented at all , as they were not among the self-governing commonwealths .

		Index and digest What ''
Poole	PERSON	' S Inde .

		x '' is to the g en '' of our periodical eral student searching the files of library literature , miscellaneous periodicals for matter on any given subject , `` Library Work '' successfully strives to be for the person interested in the maga - zine literature of library economy and library his - tory .

		In a large octavo of four hundred and nine double-column pages , the
H. W. Wilson	PERSON	Company of
Minneapolis	LOCATION	has brought together '' in one alphabet the entire contents of ` Library Work ' since its beginning -LSB- as a quarterly -RSB- in
1905	DATE	; also new ma - terial bringing it to the close of
1911	DATE	. ''

		Miss
Anna Lorraine Guthrie	PERSON	has edited the work , assisted by competent helpers .

		An important feature of this index is that it is much more than a simple index : digests of the more noteworthy articles cited are generously supplied , especially in the case of foreign and other less-known and less easily accessible periodicals .

		Thirty-two of these periodical pub - lications devoted to library interests have been con - sulted in preparing the work , and an alphabetical list of them is given , showing that they represent the library activity of this country ,
England	LOCATION	,
Spain	LOCATION	,
Italy	LOCATION	,
Germany	LOCATION	,
Holland	LOCATION	,
Denmark	LOCATION	, Nor - way , and
Sweden	LOCATION	; but
France	LOCATION	, somewhat to one 's surprise , is unrepresented , as also is
Belgium	LOCATION	, two countries that have contributed in later years toward the advancement of library science .

		The sub-title of this useful work describes it as `` a biblio - graphy and digest of library literature , '' which in the full sense of the words it is not , since that con - siderable and most important store of such literature to be found in book form is disregarded .

		The addition of the two words `` in periodicals '' to the sub-title would have made it conform , in genuine - ness and accuracy , to the character of the book it now imperfectly describes .

		Fishers and
Gra	ORGANIZATION	y weather , fog , winter storms , fighters of and the ceaseless struggle with the the
North Sea	LOCATION	.

		elements in their wildest moods , are the lot of the North Sea fisherman .

		The reader of Mr.
Walter Wood	PERSON	's `` North Sea Fishers and Fight - ers '' -LRB- Button -RRB- finds himself at once in this atmos - phere of `` hard gray weather that breeds hard Englishmen '' and discovers throughout the book that ring of genuineness which comes only from intimate knowledge of these turbulent waters and the hardy breed of men who by strenuous toil reap a rich har - vest from this sea and feed
England	LOCATION	's millions .

		Over twenty-two million hundred-weight of fish -LRB- largely from the
North Sea	LOCATION	-RRB- are landed annually in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, valued at over ten million pounds sterling .

		Worthy descendants of those whom the Roman poet characterized as '' sea - wolves that live on the pillage of the world , '' the modern British sea-rover gleans the fertile waters of the
North Sea	LOCATION	with powerful machinery , reaping a profit undreamed of a few decades past .

		The author 's account of the deep-sea trawling , of life on ships and shore , of the fishermen and their work , is intimate , accurate , and illuminat - ing .

		The illustrations in color and pencil by Mr.
Frank H. Mason	PERSON	are both artistic and instructive , and the photographs also enhance the value of the work .

		The account is largely historical , and abounds in note and anecdote of famous captains , fights and fighters , wrecks , and heroes whose names add lustre to
Britain	LOCATION	's greatness .

		Collectors of finely-printed books have loB S felt the need of a conven - ient check-list , in a single volume , to the output of the various private presses established during the past quarter-century .

		This need has now been well met in a volume published by Mr.
Philip Lee Warner	PERSON	for the
Medical Society	ORGANIZATION	,
London	LOCATION	, and entitled : '' The Revival of Printing : A
Bibliographi	PERSON	- cal Catalogue of Works Issued by the Chief Modern English Presses . ''

		Detailed lists of the productions of ten English presses -LRB- the
Daniel	PERSON	,
Kelmscott	LOCATION	,
Vale	ORGANIZATION	,
Eragny	LOCATION	,
Ashendene	LOCATION	,
Essex House	ORGANIZATION	, Doves ,
Cuala	LOCATION	,
Florence	LOCATION	, and
Riccardi	PERSON	-RRB- and one American press -LRB- the Merrymount -RRB- are given ; besides an account of the publications printed in the
Cambridge	LOCATION	type and Mr.
Proctor	PERSON	's Greek type .

		Eighteen reproductions -LRB- half of these being collotype facsimiles -RRB- of the most notable type faces used by the presses represented add greatly to the interest of the work .

		Mr.
Robert Steele	PERSON	contributes an extended introduction , outlining the history of printing in
England	LOCATION	and the general characteristics of the best modern work , with brief sketches of the various Presses included in the
Bibli	LOCATION	- ography .

		Along with much that is unimpeachable , Mr.
Steele	PERSON	expresses several rather dogmatic opinions that are open to question .

		For example , that `` the secret of the beautiful book was lost until
William Morris	PERSON	revived the art '' will seem to many a state - ment of doubtful accuracy .

		This volume is itself a piece of exceptionally handsome book-making , being printed in the
Riccardi	PERSON	type designed by Mr.
Herbert P. Home	PERSON	.

		The edition is limited to 350 copies .

		To each of her admirers
Paris	LOCATION	speaks with a vari
US	LOCATION	charm > but to n ne is her voice more eloquent than to the student of history and the lover of the past .

		He alone really knows the city who knows it as a scholar and an antiquarian , since only such appreciate to the full that wealth of story and tradition which has overlaid it like the rich patina on a Roman bronze .

		Hence the fascination of a book like
M. Georges Cain	PERSON	's '' Byways of
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Duffield	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Curator of the Mus ^ e Carnavaletandthe historical collections of the French capital ,
M. Cain	PERSON	has already given us many delight - ful pages on the Old
Paris	LOCATION	that he knows and loves 56 THE DIAL -LSB-
July 16	DATE	, so well , and his latest volume proves anew his power to unite erudition and literary qualities .

		It makes very interesting reading this sprightly combina - tion of history , antiquarianism , reminiscence , and actualites , and the hundred and thirty-odd illustra - tions , many of which are taken from old maps and prints , add to the vividness of its gossippy learning .

		Anecdotes of
Prudhon	PERSON	and
Talma	PERSON	, the Mask of Richelieu , the old
Vaudeville Theatre	ORGANIZATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	seen from a halloon ,
Paris	LOCATION	at night ,
Balzac	LOCATION	's house , the true
Butte Montmartre	ORGANIZATION	, the story of the fourth of
September	DATE	, the inundations , the dancing classes of the Opera these are among the most noteworthy chapters in a series of twenty cursory promenades through the
Paris	LOCATION	of to-day and yesterday .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''

		Cadillac and
Early Detroit	LOCATION	'' is the name of an at - tractive , appropriately-illustrated pamphlet devoted to the bibliography of the founder of the Queen City of the Straits and the years of its infant struggles with the surrounding wilderness .

		The
Detroit Public Library	ORGANIZATION	issues the pamphlet , and the bibliography is based chiefly on the material to be found within its walls .

		Number two of the '' Publications of the
Newberry Library	ORGANIZATION	'' consists of a descriptive list of '' The Arabic and Turkish Manuscripts in the
Newberry Library	LOCATION	, '' the compiler being Professor
Duncan Black Ma.cdona.ld	PERSON	, occupant of the chair of Semitic Languages in the
Hartford	LOCATION	Theological Seminary .

		The manuscripts number twenty-two , and their titles and descriptions fill , with generous spacing , an eighteen-page pamphlet . ''

		The White Hills in Poetry '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Mr.
Eugene R. Musgrove	PERSON	, is an anthology which will be welcome to all
New Englanders	LOCATION	, for whom the
White Mountains	ORGANIZATION	enshrine so many associations endeared to memory .

		All the
New England	LOCATION	poets sang of these hills , and their choicest songs upon this theme are gath - ered together into the present volume , which has clearly been a labor of love to its compiler . ''

		The Forester 's Manual , '' by Mr.
Ernest Thompson Seton	PERSON	, is a book prepared for the use of boy scouts .

		It gives a brief description , with illustrative cuts , of every forest tree at all common in the eastern part of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		The means of identification are thus sup - plied , as well as the facts of chief economic importance .

		The distribution of every species is shown by a shaded map , and this is one of the most helpful features of the book .

		Messrs.
Doubleday	PERSON	,
Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the pub - lishers .

		The
Virginia State Library	ORGANIZATION	has sent out the eighth and ninth volumes of the '' Journals of the
House	ORGANIZATION	of Burgesses of
Virginia	LOCATION	. ''

		These volumes cover a period from
1712	DATE	to
1740	DATE	; the seven volumes proceeding extend to
1776	DATE	.

		The printing of the Journals has been done in the reverse chronological order .

		The eighth volume , covering the period from
1727	DATE	to
1740	DATE	, is based in part upon the first of the original printed Journals , which began only with 1732 , and in part upon manuscript sources from the British public record office .

		Volume IX .

		is based entirely upon the manu - script journals which are found only in the British public office .

		The editor has made no change of style , but has followed the manuscripts exactly , mistakes and all , pursuing the editorial policy adopted in the begin - ning of the undertaking .

		In the introduction to each volume are published lists of the Burgesses for each assembly , an account of the sources upon which the present edition is based , a brief historical setting , and the history of each assembly by sessions .

		It is not necessary to say more than has already been said in commendation of the excellent work of both editor and printer of this series , which must prove of great value to the historian of American institutions .

		The series of Introductions supplied by
E. P. Whipple	PERSON	to a well-known American edition of Dickens nearly forty years ago have now been brought together in two small and beautifully-printed volumes as the latest title in the Riverside Press Editions -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Arlo Bates	PERSON	contributes an excellent introduction dealing with
Whipple	PERSON	personally as well as critically ; and each volume contains a photogravure portrait and engraved vignette title-page .

		Devout Dickensians every - where will be glad to have these brilliant studies in such compact and handsome form .

		The edition to be sold is limited to five hundred copies .

		In the new batch of thirty-nine volumes just added to '' Everyman 's Library '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- we are especially glad to note the inclusion of Mr.
William Canton	PERSON	's ex - quisite revelation of child-life , `` W. V. : Her Book , '' with its companion pieces , '' The Invisible Playmate '' and '' In Memory of W. V. '' Other welcome volumes are Mr.
Bolton King	PERSON	's fine life of
Mazzini	LOCATION	; a new ver - sion , for modern readers , of ''
Piers Plowman	PERSON	, '' made by Mr.
Arthur Burrell	PERSON	; and a collection of '' Arthurian Tales and Chronicles '' represented by
Wace	ORGANIZATION	and Lay - amon , translated by Mr.
Eugene Mason	PERSON	and edited by Miss
Lucy A. Paton	PERSON	.

		With this new instalment , '' Everyman 's Library '' rounds out a total of six hun - dred volumes .

		The twenty-first annual Report of the
Seattle Public Library	ORGANIZATION	shows clearly that the library of our fastest - growing city is not itself standing still .

		Twenty-two thousand volumes have been added in the past year , bringing the total collection up to one hundred and fifty thousand ; the charging system and the open-shelf ar - rangement have been simplified or otherwise improved ; the daily fine on overdue books has been reduced from
two cents	MONEY	to
one cent	MONEY	, and the deposit required from non-residents has been likewise diminished , being now two instead of
five dollars	MONEY	.

		In other quiet but effective ways the library is striving to improve on its already excellent system in serving , with a minimum of red tape and friction , the great and growing public that enjoys its facilities .

		A county library in
Ohio	LOCATION	, founded eleven years ago , considerably in advance of the now famous
California	LOCATION	county library system , issues its annual report in a read - able pamphlet entitled `` The Brumbach Library of
Van Wert County	LOCATION	. ''

		Especially notable in this eleventh annual record of progress is the largeness of result as compared with the smallness of outlay .

		At an expense of only
seven thousand dollars	MONEY	-LRB- or
$ 7,013.64	MONEY	, to be exact -RRB- , the activities of the central library at
Van Wert	LOCATION	and of its fifteen branch stations and twelve school libraries have gone on for a year .

		It is true that the entire county numbers less than thirty thousand inhab - itants , but even so the maintenance of so good a library service -LRB- including purchase of new books and payment of all other expenses -RRB- at so small a cost to those served is worthy of note .

		The Van Wert library workers de - serve , of course , more generous financial support .

		`` Taking writers generally throughout the world , what does the literary mind contribute to the world 's thought now ?

		Can you point to any one writer , anywhere in the world , whose thoughts about the world are really worth read - ing ? ''

		Thus questions one of the characters in Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	's `` Multitude and Soli - tude , '' and , although it is not fair to ascribe to a novelist the random opinions expressed by his characters , there seems to be something of a direct personal element in this utterance , the voicing of at least a temporary mood .

		Another of the characters thus amplifies the argument : '' I feel this about modern artists , that , with a few exceptions , they throw down no roots , either into national or private life .

		They care no more for
the State	ORGANIZATION	, in its religious sense , than they care -LRB- as , say , an Elizabethan would have cared -RRB- for conduct .

		They seem to me a company of men without any common principle or joint enthusiasm , working , rather blindly and narrowly , at the bidding of personal idiosyncrasy , or some aberration of taste .

		A few of you , some of the most determined , are interested in social reform .

		The rest of you are merely photo - graphing what goes on for the amusement of those who can not photograph . ''

		These remarks seem to us to point a fundamental misconception of a function of literature .

		The novelist , the dramatist , and the poet are the last persons in the world whom we should expect to '' contribute to the world 's thought . ''

		That is the business of the scientific investigator and the philosopher , not of the imaginative shaper of speech into enduring forms .

		The latter may be a propa - gator of thought , its clarifier and expositor , an extractor of the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge , but not an originator of new ideas .

		He is concerned with expression , and not with revelation , except in the sense that his form of statement may open the eyes to the hitherto unapprehended implications of some truth that has long been in the possession of mankind .

		To speak plainly , contributions to thought are among the rarest things in human expe - rience .

		It is a fertile century that can boast of two or three .

		Copernicus made one , and
Adam Smith	PERSON	another , and Kant another , and
Darwin	PERSON	still another ; but the Greeks did not leave very much for the modern world to do in this direc -
64	DATE	THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, tion .

		Refinements and elaborations and special applications of old established principles are our task , and we are amazingly active in its pursuit .

		We sometimes almost convince ourselves that we are on the track of something that is really new , and call it pragmatism , or theosophy , or social - ism , or give it some other pretentious name , but analysis always shows it to be a thing of shreds and patches , its basic material fetched from remote periods in the history of culture .

		The roaring loom of time weaves countless new in - tellectual patterns , but the same old fibres are wrought into them ; and the poet fashions the fabrics into new living garments of divinity , but they drape the limbs of the same old gods .

		We frequently hear a poet , a
Wordsworth	PERSON	or a
Browning	PERSON	, for example , spoken of as a pro- found thinker .

		But what does it all mean ?

		Who can point to an original thought , a `` con - tribution to knowledge , '' in either of these great poets ?

		The former has for us a serene philo - sophical wisdom , the product of intuition com - bined with ripe reflection upon human conduct , and the prophetic vision which does not mean , as the foolish fancy , the power of peering into the future , but is the power of seeing beneath the surface of things and illuminating the secret recesses of the mind .

		The latter is probably one of the shallowest thinkers who ever won fame as a poet , and his helplessness , when he confronts any real intellectual problem , is nothing less than pitiable .

		He champions with fervor the validity of passion , and blurts out an instinctive but unreasoning optimism .

		The subtle dra - matic power with which he makes the most diverse types of character express themselves is beyond praise , but this , while it deepens our insight into human nature , does not do much of anything to enlarge the sphere of the rational life .

		As far as the assimilation of the conquests of human thought is concerned , the making of them a part of the individual intellect ,
Browning	PERSON	is far inferior to
Tennyson	LOCATION	, although the latter is frequently disparaged , on the count of intel - lectual grasp , when brought into comparison with
Browning	PERSON	, for the sole reason that he obeys the promptings of the artist , and distils from the raw material of thought its purest essence .

		What `` contributions to knowledge '' do the famous poets of the older world bring us ?

		They may reflect the form and vitalize the spirit of an age , as Homer and Spenser do ; they may write the epic of the heroic life , as do Tasso and Camoens , or of the spiritual life , as do
Dante	ORGANIZATION	and
Milton	PERSON	.

		But how is abstract thought the gainer from all the tale of Troy or of the Crusades , from the grandiose cosmogonies of the `` Divine Com - edy '' or of '' Paradise Lost '' ?

		These men inter - pret the pageant of life and the conflicts of the soul in terms of imperishable beauty , and it is doing them no dishonor to deny them kinship with
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	and
Kant	PERSON	.

		Was Shakespeare a thinker ?

		Only in the sense that his plum met went deeper than any other into human character , and that no human motive was too intricate for his an - alysis .

		Perhaps the only world-poet who was a thinker in the higher sense was Goethe , in whom poetic faculty and intellectual power both reached their highest pitch , and were so fused in the same personality as to work in mutual harmony .

		If anywhere in literature , we might reason - ably look to the f ramers of Utopias or ideal com - monwealths for an exhibition of original and constructive thought .

		There is much helpful counsel for the conduct of the
State	ORGANIZATION	and of the individual life in the imagined communities of Plato and More , of
Comenius	ORGANIZATION	and
Campanella	PERSON	, of Hobbes and
Holberg	PERSON	.

		But they give us no new ethics or politics , but only the old ones inculcated by novel examples .

		And so with the petty Utopias of the modern writers down to the ingenious Mr.
Wells	PERSON	: they may make fruitful ap - plications of accepted moralities , but we should search them in vain for any fundamentally new idea .

		Those who are looking for genuine novel - ties in thought are most likely to find them in the writings of such champions of the paradox - ical as Messrs.
Shaw	PERSON	and
Chesterton	PERSON	, or such iconoclastic philosophers as Messrs.
James	PERSON	and
Bergson	PERSON	; but their ways are those of perplexity , and their methods those of deliberate mystifica - tion , not to be recommended to souls in search of truth .

		A & for the writers who provide us from day to day with the staple of our reading , they will do well to leave the work of making `` contributions to knowledge '' to the scientist in his laboratory and the university student at work upon his doctoral dissertation .

		They still have all the material of accumulated human thought to deal with , in its infinite permutations and combinations ; and the setting forth of its incidence upon human life , in the everyday world , is a big enough task for any poet or novel - ist or dramatist that we are likely to produce .

		THE LITERARY ACTIVITIES OF A VERSA TILE SCOTCHMAN .

		Antisthenes , as we read in
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	's life of
Pericles	LOCATION	, when told that Ismenias was an excellent flute-player , replied that he could not be good for anything else ; otherwise he would not play so
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 65 well on the flute .

		Anyone reading
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's fairy tales would be tempted to conclude , unless he had further knowledge of the writer , that Mr.
Lang	PERSON	could not amount to much in other walks of litera - ture , so whole-heartedly did he throw himself into the amusement of children with his many-colored series of fairy-books .

		And on listening to his flow of brilliant conversation , an unguarded stranger would have said to himself that so lavish a spender of good things in talk could not have anything left to put into writing .

		But the books that have made
Andrew Lang	PERSON	famous in two hemispheres number almost as many as the years of that amazingly in - dustrious life now closed at the age of sixty-eight .

		Born at
Selkirk	ORGANIZATION	, a short distance from Edin - burgh , on the
last day of March , 1844	DATE	,
Lang	PERSON	pre - pared for the university at the
Edinburgh Academy	LOCATION	, proceeded thence to
St. Andrews	LOCATION	, and afterward rounded out his education at
Oxford	LOCATION	, studying at
Balliol College	ORGANIZATION	, winning an honorary fellowship at
Merton	LOCATION	, and especially distinguishing himself in the classics .

		An assured income seems in his case to have been no bar to early and energetic endeavor to make for himself a name in literature .

		From the appearance of his '' Ballads and Lyrics of Old
France	LOCATION	, '' in
1872	DATE	, his work , both prose and verse , was in constant demand .

		Succeeding
William Black	PERSON	as leader-writer to the
London	LOCATION	`` Daily News , '' he acquired the knack of expressing himself with fluency and charm on the most varied range of subjects , from cricket and golf to philosophy and religion .

		In illustration of the astonishing facility he devel - oped as a contributor of miscellaneous articles to the periodicals , it is said of him that he would , when pressed for time , scribble his `` copy '' for the waiting printer between the courses of a dinner to which he had been invited .

		He certainly had a larger store of encyclopaedic learning to draw from than almost any other writer of his time .

		Among his favorite subjects , on which he wrote in masterly fashion , prominent mention must be made of Homer , whom he never tired of defending against the attacks of those critics who would per - suade us of the conglomerate authorship of the '' Iliad '' and '' Odyssey . ''

		His book on '' Homer and his Age '' appeared only six years ago , as the ripe fruit of its author 's Homeric studies .

		His transla - tions of the two epics , in collaboration with Profes - sor Butcher -LRB- on the `` Odyssey '' -RRB- and Mr.
Ernest Myers	PERSON	and Mr.
Walter Leaf	PERSON	-LRB- on the '' Iliad '' -RRB- long ago established his reputation as a Homeric scholar .

		Another subject that fascinated him was the tragic fate of
Mary Queen of Scots	ORGANIZATION	, on which he wrote a book , `` The Mystery of
Mary Stuart	PERSON	, '' in
1901	DATE	.

		His work on ``
John Knox	PERSON	and the Reformation '' and his `` History of
Scotland	LOCATION	from the Roman Occupation '' also attest his lively interest in themes near home .


Walter Scott	PERSON	, too , he delighted to make the theme of his discourse , whether oral or written .

		Such books as his '' Custom and Myth '' and '' Myth , Ritual , and Religion '' show him in still another light , as a delver in folk-lore and an inquirer into the origin of religion .

		No more impressive testimony to Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's ver - satility and industry can be found than is furnished by the simple list of his published works ; and even that list does not include the miscellaneous and uncollected newspaper and magazine articles that dropped from his pen in a continuous shower for many years .

		In his early prime the number of books put forth by him in a single twelvemonth was re - markable .

		For instance , in
1884	DATE	we find credited to his pen the following : '' Ballads and Verses Vain , '' '' Rhymes a la Mode , '' `` Princess Nobody , '' and `` Cus - tom and Myth . ''

		In
1886	DATE	he published `` Books and Bookmen , '' `` In the Wrong Paradise , '' `` Letters to Dead Authors , '' `` The Mark of
Cain	PERSON	, '' and `` The Politics of Aristotle . ''

		At the time of his death , as we learn from a
London	LOCATION	news item printed only a few days before the tidings of his end reached us , he was about to undertake a `` History of English Literature from
Beowulf	LOCATION	to Swinburne . ''

		Possibly some part or the greater part of this may already have been written ; for Mr.
Lang	PERSON	was so rapid in his work that little time intervened between the con - ception and the execution of a literary project .

		English literature can not number
Andrew Lang	PERSON	among its immortal poets or historians or romancers or essayists ; but its roll contains few if any names that stand for so wide-ranging , facile , and often bril - liant work as made this gifted Scotchman a marvel and a delight to those who read him .

		Of late years his vogue has perhaps suffered some decline , for he seemed to be a little out of sympathy -LRB- to his credit be it said -RRB- with certain passing tendencies in our litera - ture .

		All the more hope , therefore , may be cherished of his survival as a writer of varied learning and pecu - liar charm .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		MB .

		SHAW 'S CONQUEST OF
GAUL	ORGANIZATION	has thus far been considerably less complete than
Caesar	PERSON	's , though that , everyone now admits , was incomplete enough .

		Really , however , it was only
Paris	LOCATION	that the redoubt - able
G. B. S.	PERSON	set out to subdue ; but
Paris	LOCATION	is
France	LOCATION	, as has been maintained from time out of mind .

		It was with a characteristic letter to his translator , reproduced on yellow posters and placarded all over the French capital , that Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	began his recent campaign .

		`` My dear
Hamon	PERSON	, '' ran this noteworthy pronouncement , ''
Paris	LOCATION	is always the last city in the world to discover and accept an author or a composer of international reputation .


London	LOCATION	is twenty-five years behind the times , and
Paris	LOCATION	is ten years behind
London	LOCATION	.


Paris	LOCATION	is a marvellous city .

		But Parisians have not yet discovered
Paris	LOCATION	.

		It is not surprising , then , that they have not yet discovered me .

		In ten years
Paris	LOCATION	will discover me . ''

		Following this pro- clamation , hostilities began simultaneously on both banks of the river `` Arms and the Man '' at the largest theatre on the rive gauche , and `` Mrs. War - ren 's Profession '' on the most literary stage that the other side can boast , that of the Thedtre des Arts .

		The invaded city seems to have held out manfully 66 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, against anything like unconditional surrender , though the Shavian plays and the Shavian philosophy appear to have made a decided impression , and all
Paris	LOCATION	- all literary and artistic and critical
Paris	LOCATION	was set to talking and writing about the many won - derful ideas thrust upon their unprepared minds .

		Possibly in the ten years so generously allowed them by Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	the Parisians will either have digested them , or , whi < 5h is more likely , abandoned the at - tempt .

		`` Such plays , '' says one of the friendliest of their French critics , '' require the collaboration of the audience , and this takes time to cultivate .

		He has against him the very novelty and profundity of his ideas . ''

		... THE SIFTING OF MANUSCRIPTS that goes on day after day and year after year among editors and publishers ' readers presents itself to the imagination as a task in comparison with which the twelve labors of Hercules dwindle to insignificant proportions .

		The great mass of manuscripts submitted must , in mining phrase , assay at only a very few dollars ' worth of precious metal to the ton ; but there is always the chance of finding a splendid nugget , and hence the need of caution .

		Few who have the handling of this mountain of written matter would think it wise or businesslike to follow the example of the famous theatrical manager who has recently excited the indignation of would-be playwrights by announcing that he will henceforth consign to the oblivion of the waste-basket all unsolicited manu - scripts thrust upon him .

		One can imagine the dis - appointments and disgusts that have led up to this decision ; for disappointments are not all on the unsuccessful writer 's side .

		If it be true that not a hundredth part of the manuscripts offered for publi - cation actually achieve that desired end , and if the complaint that our busy printing-presses are turning out a deplorable quantity of rubbish be not ill - founded , what incredible degrees of unreadability must be attained by the worst of the ninety-nine rejected hundred ths of '' unavailable '' literary off er - ings !

		Undoubtedly too many of these manuscript - producers are more fired with zeal than informed with wisdom , are lacking in years what they so abundantly possess in courage and confidence .

		They desire and expect to arrive before they have fairly started .

		It is characteristic of the young writer to imagine himself much nearer the goal of ideal excel - lence than he will after he has , as a matter of fact , travelled a considerable distance toward that elusive end of all his striving .

		HlGH HOPES FOR THE FUTURE OF EDUCATION were of course voiced by more than one speaker at the late fiftieth annual convention of the
National Education Association	ORGANIZATION	, in session at
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		The spectacle of a man ardently enthusiastic for and splendidly confident in the cause to which he has devoted his life is surely a refreshing and inspiring one .

		Mr.
Albert E. Winship	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	attained to something like the sublime in an address on the final day of the conference .

		`` Why should not this meeting , '' he asked , `` in its closing moments here highly resolve that education shall become the lead - ing American profession ?

		New times demand new men and new measures .

		The new times are surely here .

		The profession that meets the demands of these times will be the leading American profession , and education can meet these demands better than law , medicine , and the ministry ... The coast is clear .

		Education can be the leading profession of the country .

		It is the only profession that can devote itself exclusively to childhood and youth , to the making of manly men and womanly women .

		Education was the first profession .

		May it not be the greatest ?

		It is the only learned profession whose leaders in scholarship are ` professors , ' and the one man who met all the needs of all time was the Great Teacher . ''

		And so on , in high-hearted strain and with the impassioned orator 's proper disregard of prosaic exactness in statement of facts , but with a magnificent conception of the educator 's mission and a fine appeal to his hearers to show themselves worthy of their high calling .

		The in - spiration of such annual addresses ought to go far toward carrying the hearers bravely through the daily round , the common task , of the ensuing year .

		EMERGING FROM THE SHELTER OF ANONYMITY , the writers for the `` Edinburgh Review '' will hence - forth , under its new editor , Mr.
Harold Cox	PERSON	, sign their names to their weighty pronouncements on the worth of current books and on such other questions of public interest as the ``
Edinburgh	LOCATION	'' has so long treated with distinguished ability , and , now and then , in a tone of such magisterial authority .

		The Macaulayesque style of review and the frequent use of the editorial `` we '' seemed almost to carry the assumption that no single pen of any single fallible mortal was responsible for the grave utterances marshalled so imposingly in the customary `` Edin - burgh '' article .

		The
august	DATE	authority of the mighty quarterly itself was back of every word and sentence .

		But the atmosphere now enveloping the world of books and writers is unfavorable to the further pros - perous growth of this assumption .

		Too many of our best and brightest critics and essayists write unblush - ingly in the first person singular , and the
august	DATE	personage behind the editorial '' we '' is losing those vague and majestic outlines that formerly inspired awe in the timid reader .

		The change of policy on the part of the ancient quarterly is in harmony with the modernity and versatility of its new editor , whose varied experience as member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, as writer on economic and political questions , and as a man of affairs rather than of the study and the li - brary , promises well for the revivifica tion of the ven - erable review under his management .

		DISCOVERING THE PUBLIC LIBRARY , and learning with surprise that it is free and for the use of the people , is what some persons are doing even now in this advanced era of enlightenment and culture .

		Hence the need of advertising itself which every wide-awake library has for some time recognized .

The Dallas Public Library	ORGANIZATION	issues an attractive little pamphlet on `` How Libraries Advertise ; as shown by the library material exhibited as a part of the Display of Advertising at the
Eighth Annual Convention of the Associated Advertising Clubs of America	ORGANIZATION	, held at
Carnegie Hall	ORGANIZATION	of the
Dallas	LOCATION	Pub -
lic Library	ORGANIZATION	,
Dallas	LOCATION	,
Texas	LOCATION	,
May 19-27	DATE	,
1912	DATE	. ''

		In this matter of advertising there is an increasing num - ber of libraries that not only advertise themselves but also spread abroad the fame of their respective cities and agitate for all sorts of municipal improve - ments and reforms .

		For instance , as the
Dallas	LOCATION	pamphlet says , '' St.
Joseph	PERSON	,
Mo.	LOCATION	, a city with a bold front , has an energetic and stentorian branch of li - brary publicity that makes an impression , and they talk right out about the things they are going to have .

		Among these are public baths , more boulevards , a greater St. Jo club , public playgrounds , and other examples of municipal attractiveness . ''

		Advertis - ing the helpfulness of the library to the immigrant is made a specialty by certain libraries that minister to the needs of a large alien population .

		The Provi - dence Public Library does notably good work in its capacity of `` melting-pot , '' and its officials can tell some interesting things about the conduct and the growing popularity of its foreign-literature de - partment .

		Not much longer , it is to be hoped , will it be possible to assert with truthfulness what the
Dallas	LOCATION	librarian now makes bold to declare , that '' strange as it may seem , there are a lot of folk who do n't realize yet that libraries are free .

		They think there is a string to it somewhere . ''

		WHITEWASHING
BACON	LOCATION	, as
Edward FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	expressed it , was the task to which his -LRB-
FitzGerald	ORGANIZATION	's -RRB- friend
Spedding	PERSON	devoted his best years and energies , when he might better , it was thought , have given the world something of originality and value in some other department of literature .

		Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	has been again applying the whitewash brush to the great English philosopher and statesman in a eulo - gistic speech at the unveiling of the
Bacon	LOCATION	statue at
Gray	ORGANIZATION	's Inn , three hundred years after
Bacon	PERSON	's admission to the Inn .

		As a statesman , he had , the orator declared , a breadth of view and a strength of spirit that might have altered the history of his own country and of all
Europe	LOCATION	, had his advice been heeded .

		In his personal relations and his private life he was not , if we are to believe his eulogist , nearly so reprehensible as it has been the fashion to represent him .

		But Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	did not feel moved to enlarge on this aspect of the man .

		More congenial did he find it to dwell on him as a writer and scholar , a historian and a philosopher , the mas - ter of a noble prose style , and endowed with such gifts that his writings may be regarded as marking the beginning of a new epoch .

		That he has of late been vulgarized and his name made a mockery by some of his too ardenjtand ill-balanced admirers , few thoughtful persons will dispute .

		A prophet and a seer , according to Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	, he pointed the way to true scientific research , and created the atmos - phere in which alone it could flourish .

		Surely that is glory enough , without the ascription to him of an impossible authorship of works quite outside of his vein ... AN ALBEMARLE STREET CENTENARY of interest to the English-reading book world has just been celebrated in the quiet and dignified manner befit - ting the celebrants .

		One hundred years ago the publishing house of
Murray	ORGANIZATION	, already half a century old and enjoying an enviable repute , took possession of its present quarters or , more accurately , the building next to its present quarters , number 50 being now used for domiciliary purposes by Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	the Fourth and his son , while 50A , next door , is devoted to business .

		The aristocrat of English publishers , as he is not unaptly called , Mr.
Murray	PERSON	by his dignified presence and his con - servative business methods attracts authors who know the value of the
Murray	PERSON	imprint .

		So wedded to the good old ways of doing business is the house of
Murray	PERSON	that even so time-saving an appliance as the typewriter was late in effecting an entrance at No. 50A .

		In the drawing-room of No. 50 are to be seen not a few reminders of the long connection with famous authors enjoyed by the Murrays .

		To mention but one , there is the silver loving-cup sent a century ago by
Lord Byron	PERSON	from
Greece	LOCATION	to his pub - lisher , and containing some hemlock seeds gathered in
Athens	LOCATION	by the poet , who thus inscribed the gift : `` Hemlock gathered by me for you under the walls of
Athens	LOCATION	; possibly the same from which the leaves that poisoned Socrates were plucked . ''

		Grimly sug - gestive contents for a loving-cup , surely ; but there seems to be no reason at present why the descend - ants of the
John Murray	PERSON	who received the gift should take the suggestion seriously .

		A PLUCKY YOUNG AUTHOR of
Kansas	LOCATION	, a
Mitchell County	ORGANIZATION	girl of spirit and determination and perse - verance , has achieved at least local fame by pleading and winning , in a court of law , her case against her publishers , who , if report speaks truly , seem not to have borne themselves with the utmost chivalry toward the young lady .

		Miss
Lizzie Wooster	PERSON	, for that is the fair plaintiff 's name , fired with a desire to improve on the school primers in general use , prepared one which met with the publishers ' ap - proval and appears also , on publication , to have enjoyed a wide acceptance .

		But when she applied for her just share in the pecuniary proceeds of the venture , a cold refusal , on technical grounds , was the response .

		Filled with indignation at this in - justice , and laying her plans for revenge on a broad and deep foundation ,
Miss Wooster	PERSON	entered a law school , pursued the course to the end , was ad - mitted to the bar , and then , with a legal mastery of her own case in its every detail , brought suit against her unkind publishers , appearing in court as her own counsel , and procured a decision in her favor .

		Little need , now and henceforth , has she of the pro- tection of any
Society of Authors	ORGANIZATION	.

		They do some things very well in

		68 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, SHAKESPEARE IN RELIEF .

		* While the patient diggers for facts continue to add their grains to the molehill of Shake - speare 's biography , it is gratifying to know that those who prefer to climb for vision have not been discouraged .

		The names of Professors
Bradley	PERSON	,
Raleigh	LOCATION	, and
McCallum	PERSON	are alone suffi - cient to remind us of the advance that aesthetic and philosophical criticism of the dramatist has made in the last few years .

		Men like
Kreyssig	PERSON	and Hudson are being steadily distanced ; and if the newer leaders were less gifted with the scholar 's virtue of modesty , we could almost imagine them ready to adopt a slogan from our present political campaign and boast of '' catch - ing up with Shakespeare . ''

		Mr.
Darrell Figgis	PERSON	, the young English poet , makes no boast in the volume which he entitles '' Shakespeare : A Study , '' but he has accepted the challenge which lies implicit in certain late criticisms of Shake - speare conspicuously Mr.
Bernard Shaw	PERSON	's and has come to the defense of the dramatist with a treatise which may reasonably make some pre - tensions to catching up with
Coleridge	PERSON	.

		Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	is not disposed to attach great importance to logical processes .

		He leans dis - tinctly toward divination , a quality which he ascribes to
Fleay	PERSON	among biographers and denies to Halliwell-Phillipps .

		He begins by saying that in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	, as in Nature , we feel a synthesis , though we can not think it out .

		One may hesitate to infer that Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	believes himself to have actually grasped this synthesis , but he has made a bold and impressive attempt .

		`` Synthetic '' is eminently the word to describe his treatise .

		Striking , as it does , midway be - tween the methods of those who are concerned primarily with details of biography or technique , and those who devote themselves to analyses of characters and plays , it gives a vivid picture of a real man a man disencumbered of non - essentials , boldly outlined against his surround - ings , acting and reacting upon circumstances that time and again synchronized , by some happy dispensation , with his own mental development , and so fulfilling a life that for completeness of inward experience and outward artistic expres - sion remains unparallelled .

		It is not a book to begin one 's study of Shakespeare with , but for gathering into a single fairly consistent concep - tion the multifarious impressions inevitably * SHAKESPEARE : A Study .

New York	LOCATION	:
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	.

		created by the myriad-minded one , it would not be easy to name its equal .

		Whether that con - ception be the true one is another question , not to be settled here .

		Following an Introduction that descants pleasingly upon the functional importance of the lavish waste in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's work , that makes a tilt at the dusty delvers in '' archival darkness '' who have '' obscured the fair land - scape of his country by chimney-stacks and fac - tories , '' and thrust him `` like a wronged Deity into buildings and technicalities , '' and that gives Mr.
Shaw	PERSON	, with all his perversity , credit for driving us back upon the vital question and reopening the discussion of what drama is , Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	sets forth his argument in six chapters , dealing respectively with the dramatist 's Life , Stage , Craft , Art , Thought , and Personality .

		The biographical chapter attempts no general picture of the age , but keeps close to the man
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, following him from theatre to theatre and through his more important prac - tical affairs with the realizing touch of a quick imagination .

		Naturally much of this matter is controversial or conjectural .

		Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	thinks that in
1587	DATE	Shakespeare joined
Leicester	ORGANIZATION	's company at
Stratford	LOCATION	, and by linking up the facts into a `` clear and logical sequence '' he claims to have virtually reconstructed the account of the succeeding five years of obscurity .

		He con - troverts in particular Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	's account ; but it should be noted that Mr.
Fleay	PERSON	long ago wrote : '' At
Stratford	LOCATION	, in my opinion , Shake - speare joined them -LSB-
Leicester	ORGANIZATION	's players -RSB- . ''

		The most interesting feature of this chapter is the synchrony traced between outward events and the dramatist 's maturing powers his removal , for instance , at just the critical moment , from the Theatre , '' the resort of the hurly-burly ap - prentices , '' to the Globe on the
Bankside	LOCATION	, where a gentler audience could be counted on to appre - ciate subtler plays ; and the accession , also at a critical moment , of
King James	PERSON	, with his gen - uine concern for higher dramatic art .

		The student of technique will find interesting matter in the chapters on '' Stage '' and '' Craft . ''

		But it is not until we reach the chapters on `` Art '' and `` Thought '' that Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	is found at his best .

		They are replete with sug - gestive and illuminating judgments , both upon Shakespeare himself and the nature of drama .

		For example ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's bombast , and his rapid and violent metaphor , often out of char - acter , are defended as the dramatist 's `` sub - conscious method of striking us to emotional sympathy with the Action '' ; they are to be

		THE DIAL 69 judged , not by themselves , but by their service in procuring the total effect .

		The question of verse and prose is admirably handled .

		As op - posed to
Ben Jonson	PERSON	's characters , whose speeches were written in prose and turned into verse , ''
Shakespeare	PERSON	's characters did not speak verse by acci - dent or from discipline : they were conceived as speaking verse ...
King Lear	PERSON	,
Hamlet	LOCATION	, and
Macbeth	ORGANIZATION	,
Romeo	PERSON	and
Juliet	PERSON	, .

		.

		in prose would simply not be the people we now know them to be .

		It is a thing impossible to define ; but it is a thing quite unmistakably real to the imagination .

		The essence of the matter lies in the con - ception of the thinking mind .

		Shakespeare conceived poetically or in prose , as the case may be ; with the result that his characterization rings inevitably , in the main , in the language chosen ... Fat Sir
John	PERSON	,
Dogberry	ORGANIZATION	and Verges , Sir
Toby Belch	PERSON	, the egregious
Malvolio	ORGANIZATION	, .

		.

		are born in prose , and live all their lives in that medium .

		In the case of those who have no lives to live , but only parts to play , the servitors , soldiers , and other such accessories , it is easy to understand why they should stand so completely in prose .

		As said , they have no lives to live , and therefore have never the opportunity of springing to the intensity of poetry , whatever their potentialities be . ''

		It is in consonance with this view that Lady Macbeth on the one hand , when deprived of her real self her Will by sleep and delirium , should lapse into disjointed , unrhythmic utter - ance , and that
Beatrice	PERSON	and
Benedick	PERSON	on the other hand , when Love finally comes to them , should be drawn up into the general plot of the play and '' pass to poetry . ''

		Interwoven with this discussion is a plea for the poetic drama , which , it is virtually maintained , is and can be the only great drama .

		This , however , is still but to hover on the outskirts of Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	's far-reaching inquiry .

		He closes at length with the fundamental prob - lem of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's dominant thought .

		This he finds in his preoccupation , not primarily with men , but with the workings of Destiny ; the dramatist became in a high yet entirely earthly and human sense one of God 's spies , who took upon him the mystery of things .

		And this preoccupation grew with his growing powers ; so that his characters , even as they grew to greater strength and richness , are seen to en - tangle themselves more and more inextricably in the meshes of fate , because the dramatist who sits behind them is more and more `` thinking past men to God . ''

		Now Destiny is defined as '' Divinity in action , '' and
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's mental progress may be traced by the position that is assigned to the Divinity in his succeeding plays .

		It is a position that advances steadily from that of a God in the machine a Divinity constantly intruding and controlling so as to shape things , after the manner of comedy or melodrama , to a mechanically neat conclusion to that of a Divinity waiting at the end of the play to botch things up with what patchwork he can , until finally the imperious strength of the characters drives him '' off his post at the end of the five acts to some position in the further Beyond . ''

		But , be it remembered , though in the great tragedies the Divinity is driven by the charac - ters quite out of the play , it is still the Divinity that is dominant in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's thought , and also in ours : a Divinity , too , that is no longer a mere deus , but the inscrutably and ineffably Divine .

		And this is the solution of the strange paradox that Shakespearean tragedy , although in it Righteousness is constantly baffled , is per - sistently regarded as the highest of morality .

		In the working out of this thesis , one may demur to some of the details .

		In modification , for instance , of the statement that in `` Romeo and Juliet '' there are no responsible beings , and that accidents capriciously directed from above determine the issues , it should be remembered that
Romeo	PERSON	, after all , presumptuously takes his fate into his own hands .

		And the author needs to correct his surprising impression that in `` Lear ''
Goneril	LOCATION	and
Regan	PERSON	are left alive -LRB- p. 229 -RRB- .

		But the thesis as a whole is well sustained , and is presented with a combined lucidity , strength , and even splendor of expression , worthy of its great subject .

		It is less easy to appraise the concluding chap - ter , which deals with
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's personality , and enters again upon more debatable ground .

		So admirable is the author 's synthesis in its main outlines that it is to be wished he had not imperilled it by coveting perfection .

		In the endeavor to make his wheel come full circle , he resorts in the end to paradox , with a distinctly disquieting effect .

		Some distrust , too , is occa - sioned by the way in which the Sonnets are kept out of sight until the end of the volume , though the course of the argument is easily seen to be shaping itself toward a final proof in their nature and contents .

		Perhaps Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	was prompted to this by his dramatic sense , though he could easily put up a logical defense .

		But to anyone sufficiently familiar with the Sonnets to detect what is coming , the apparent artifice tends to defeat its purpose , that of producing a con - vincing argument .

		Apart from all questions of method , one may or may not be convinced .

		However reluctant we may be to think that a certain dark experience in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's rela - tions with a friend and a mistress not only pro- foundly affected his personal life , but practically determined his entire mental and dramatic pro- 70 THE DIAL , -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, gress , through
Romeo	PERSON	and Falstaff to
Hamlet	LOCATION	,
Othello	LOCATION	, and
Lear	PERSON	, it is undeniable that various threads of argument and speculation have of late been converging steadily toward this as to a focal point .

		It is impossible to foretell the out - come .

		Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	has added his thread , ap - proaching the matter in his own way , and with a force and dignity that are bound to command respect for his argument , though it is not impos - sible to pick some flaws .

		For instance , dating -LRB- along with Mr.
Frank Harris	PERSON	-RRB- the dire event at 1597-8 , Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	observes that `` soon after the unfaithfulness occurred , we find Jaques . ''

		Perhaps it is nothing to the point to object that we also find
Benedick	PERSON	and the Duke of
Illyria	LOCATION	, seeing that we have been carefully provided beforehand with the clue that it is Jaques who reflects
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and not these others .

		But what shall be said of this further statement , that '' when
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's naturally reflective nature has carried the mischief through his whole blood in sheer disgust , we find Hamlet '' ?

		Five years for a moral cataclysm like that to breed disgust in outraged blood !

		Great indeed , then , is the virtue of a `` naturally reflective nature . ''

		Of course this does not overthrow the argument , and Mr.
Figgis	PERSON	leads it to a fairly effective close .

		But the chapter strikes a lower level than those just preceding it ; and both writer and reader breathe more freely on the Coleridgean heights .

		THE LURE OP THE FAR NORTH .

		* Six hundred years ago the Norse author of '' The King 's Mirror '' answered the query , which ever recurs at each new sacrifice of human en - deavor and life claimed by the North from those who brave its rigors , as to the reasons impelling men thus to imperil their lives .

		It is , he says , the three-fold ambition of man which draws him thither : emulation and the desire of fame , the desire of knowledge , and the desire of gain .

		The history of polar exploration is indeed a striking manifestation of the power of the unknown over the mind of man , ever enticing new recruits in the endeavor to stretch once more the limits of the world and to taste the joys of discovery .

		expeditions have certainly brought material advantages to the human race , such as rich fisheries , whaling and sealing , and so on ; they have produced scientific results in the knowledge of hitherto unknown regions and con - ditions ; but they have given us far more than this : they have tempered the human will for the conquest of diffi - culties ; they have furnished a school of manliness and self-conquest in the midst of the slackness of varying ages , and have held up noble ideals before the rising generation ; they have fed the imagination , have given fairy-tales to the child , and raised the thoughts of its elders above their daily toil .

		Take arctic travel out of our history , and will it not be poorer ?

		Perhaps we have here the greatest service it has done humanity . ''

		.

		Fantastic illusions of open polar seas , and of short cuts to the riches of Cathay , drew explor - ers again and again to essay in vain the secrets of the Arctic .

		But the idealistic motives have always played a large part in arctic exploration .

		A Pytheas steers north from the Pillars of Her - cules , the Vikings with a
Lief Erickson	PERSON	at their head cross the
Atlantic	LOCATION	in undecked boats and find a new world - only to lose it again , and a Hudson gains a lonely grave on an uncharted and deserted shore .

		But bit by bit the map of the North has been sketched , and in the end the Norse flag floats at the Antipodes .

		Some years age Professor
Nansen	PERSON	promised his friend Dr.
J. Scott Keltie	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	that he would contribute a volume about arctic explora - tion to Dr.
Keltic	PERSON	's series of books on geographi - cal exploration .

		How well this promise has been fulfilled may be judged by the two large volumes now published , in which the foundation has been laid for such a history .

		A foundation only , since Dr.
Nansen	PERSON	's treatise brings the subject down only to the time of
John Cabot	PERSON	's voyages and the ill-fated ships of the Cortereals in
1502	DATE	, to the point in fact where the average reader would expect the history of arctic explo - ration really to begin !

		And even then the au - thor laments the fact that '' the majority of the voyages , and those the most important , on which the first knowledge was based , have left us no certain record . ''

		Ancient records , manuscripts , sagas , and the earliest attempts at charts of the north and the new world , have been assembled and passed under critical inspection , to winnow the wheat from the chaff and to trace wherever possible the motive forces instrumental in discovery .

		Professor
Nansen	PERSON	was trained as a biologist , and won his first scientific spurs in animal mor - phology .

		The scientific method acquired in this and in his later work in oceanography is clearly seen in the thoroughness with which he has taken up the accumulation of materials -LRB- over 250 titles appear in his bibliography -RRB- , and in the critical

		THE DIAL 71 sifting to which he has subjected his data in his efforts to arrive at stable fact .

		The first recorded northern voyage , about 330 B. c. , is that of
Pytheas	LOCATION	, an ancient astrono - mer and geographer of the Phocaean colony at
Massalia	LOCATION	, the first person in history to intro - duce astronomical measurements and to deter - mine latitude by the gnomon .

		His interest in astronomy led him to push his expedition north past
Britain	LOCATION	, the Scottish islands , and
Shetland	LOCATION	to the
Arctic Circle	ORGANIZATION	, where he found the land of
Thule	LOCATION	.

		This land , the author goes to great length to prove , was
Norway	LOCATION	.

		The jealousy and ignorance of later writers tend to belittle the achievements of this , the most intrepid and capa - ble as well as the earliest of Arctic explorers .

		From this early voyager down through the period of
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	and
Ptolemy	PERSON	, through the darkness , confusion , and uncertainty of the Middle Ages , to the period of the Vikings , the growth of knowl - edge of the North , the evolution of the Viking ship , and the voyages of the Norsemen , are traced with much archaeological detail and thor - oughness .

		The decay of the
Greenland	LOCATION	settlements , and the extinction of the connections between the Norse colonies and the fatherland , are traced to the decline of the Vikings and difficulties at home with the Hanseatic league .

		There ap - pears , however , to be historical evidence of voy - ages to
Greenland	LOCATION	as late as the early part of the fifteenth century .

		The expeditions of the Norwegians into the Polar Sea , and the growth of the whaling and sealing industry , led to great advances in knowledge of the North ; but royal monopolies of trade by southern nations laid their paralyzing hands upon private enterprise , and all that the Norsemen had learned of the secrets of the ice-bound seas and coasts was to a great extent forgotten and had to be re-learned at great cost .

		The author devotes an extensive chapter to cartography to the early maps of the North , the wheel maps of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, the works of the Arabs , and the compass charts of later centuries , giving his results not in exact repro - ductions of these early works but in interpreta - tive maps relieved of the confusing networks of compass lines which obscure the originals .

		In the same free manner , he presents translations of his sources or interpretations of their con - tents .

		His book is not , then , to be regarded as a collection of sources , but rather as a free and critical discussion of a subject wrapped in fogs of obscurity , approach to which by the historian is made doubly difficult by the conflicting cross - currents of evidence . ''

		Through all that is uncertain , and often apparently fortuitous and checkered , we can discern a line , leaning toward the new age , that of the great discoveries , when we emerge from the dusk of the Middle Ages into fuller daylight .

		Of the new voyages we have , as a rule , ac - counts at first hand , less and less shrouded in medie - valism and mist .

		From this time the real history of polar exploration begins . ''

		Throughout antiquity the North was con - cealed in a twilight of legend and myth , and the twilight thickens into darkness at the beginning of the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	.

		Then the intermingling of the nations , the new trade routes , and finally the excursions of the Norsemen , revealed the White and Polar Seas .

		Colonies were planted in
Iceland	LOCATION	,
Greenland	LOCATION	, and
North America	LOCATION	; then the mists closed again , and the sons of the Vikings forgot their achievements .

		But En - gland 's sailors had their earliest training in the
Norseman	ORGANIZATION	's school , and even the distant Portu - guese received impulses from them .

		It is at this point that the real history of polar explo - ration begins .

		Impelled by two great illusions the
Northwest	ORGANIZATION	and
Northeast	ORGANIZATION	passages explorers for a century sought trade routes to the riches of the Orient , and the sea power of
England	LOCATION	drew vigor from these dreams .

		`` To riches men have seldom attained , to the
Fortu	LOCATION	- nate
Isles	LOCATION	never : but through all we have won knowledge . ''

		The volumes are freely illustrated by a num - ber of boldly-drawn sketches from ancient maps and monuments , as well as by other sketches , including several rather sombre colored plates by the author .

		72 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, been made for it .

		The story of the incuba - tion of ideas is now told for us by a French - man looking on from a safe distance across the Channel , and by a member of Parliament who helped to shape public opinion and to enact the measures .

		M. Cazamian traces the struggle between traditional instinct and modern rationalism .

		He thinks that Englishmen do not act upon theory , but meet issues which are forced upon them by the needs of the hour and solve their problems by practical common sense .

		The real British genius is best represented by conservatives , land - lords , and snobs .

		The discussion closes with a note of skepticism : `` Will England consent , will she be able , to undergo without injury the social and psychological transformations which seem to be demanded by international competi - tion ?

		Will her empiricism know how to rise above itself , and fearlessly to enter the higher sphere of meditated readjustments , without los - ing the benefit of its blind and groping infalli - bility ? ''

		This French observer has examined the main facts in the development of industry , political philosophy and legislation during the nineteenth century , the industrial revolution and its effects , the creed of liberty and individualism , the teachings of
Darwin	LOCATION	, the ecclesiastical move - ments , the rise of trade unions , the protests of
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	and
Ruskin	PERSON	, the development of Social - ism , and the recent philosophical tendencies .

		Certainly
England	LOCATION	was not without a philoso - phy , such as it was ; and she was attached to a theory as with an obsession .

		Her statesmen were firmly and sincerely convinced that indi - vidual liberty and free competition would give to the world all possible health , vigor , happiness , and virtue .

		No doubt this theory fitted well into the assurance of the land-owners and great capitalists that
Providence	LOCATION	had chosen them to rule the vulgar crowd in mills and in
Parliament	LOCATION	.

		It was heresy to dispute this theory .

		Some of the economists assumed this creed as the founda - tion of their speculations , and they arranged tables of statistics to give it support .


Herbert Spencer	PERSON	evolved a philosophy of evolution in the known universe which was glorified laissez faire .

		As the shadows gathered about him , and he dimly saw the modern world moving away from him , he prophesied at least temporary ruin ; and he believed himself .

		It would be false to assert that
Great Britain	LOCATION	was inferior in its humane impulses .

		It was the classic land of the poor-law and endowed charities .

		The philanthropist ,
John Bright	PERSON	, was one of the most powerful antagonists of the
Earl of Shaftesbury	ORGANIZATION	; yet he honestly thought that governmental legislation would be a curse to the wage-earners .


John Bright	PERSON	is a typical form in British life .

		Excellent bishops stood on the side of the
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	orator , and supported his eloquent pleas for the slaves of other countries , though blind to the thralls in their own iron mills and agricultural laborers ' cottages .

		There was abundance of literary protest .

		Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	's `` Cry of the Children , ''
Dick	PERSON	- ens 's exposure of the misery in
East London	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	's keen thrusts at snobbery ,
Ruskin	PERSON	's passionate protests against current notions of political economy , all had a part to play in awakening the nation .

		All these together , however , would have failed to destroy the ancient philosophy had they not been supported and their demands reinforced by medical and social science .

		It is true that
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	was not stirred to definite action alone by morals and by blue books , but also by the scare which
Germany	LOCATION	gave it .

		British merchants and manufacturers found new competitors in their monopolized markets , and these competitors were guarded on the high seas by men-of-war built in German ports .

		Parliament sent men to
Germany	LOCATION	to discover what had happened , and the messengers came back with accounts of German chemistry , scien - tific politics , and technical education .

		Aroused by the primitive passion of fear , the British rulers of both parties were made docile enough to inquire of medical men and social investi - gators as to the facts in the situation .

		The accepted systematizers of doctrine had told them that the world of free competition is the best and most just of all possible worlds ; that the British constitution was infallible ; that gentlemen were the wisest and truest friends to vote laws for the ignorant poor ; that if govern - ment were confined to simple police duties the children would grow up to be healthy and useful citizens and sorrow would be no more .

		But when the rulers were humbled by foreign com - petition they began to listen to the recruiting officers , who informed them that laissez faire had unfitted the lads of English cities for soldier service ; that millions of men and women were in revolt against the government , and deter - mined to take matters into their own hands .

		Scientific investigations gave the lie to the d priori theories produced by ingenious specula - tors to justify hoary outrages against common rights .

		National neglect had not done what these philosophers had solemnly promised for it .

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 73 These investigations , however , were made effec - tive because in the mean time men had gained a voice and vote in Parliament who really knew the situation of the masses of people belonging to the industrial groups .

		Let us turn to the book of the member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	, and read his description and ex - planation of the new movement .

		The author of '' Democratic England '' started with a uni - versity education , and a life purpose to improve the conditions of existence for wage-earners .

		He went to share their fortunes in
East London	LOCATION	, and
Mansfield House	ORGANIZATION	Settlement be - came his training school .

		Quietly and ear - nestly he studied the needs of his neighbors , and helped to build up their institutions , their schools , trades unions , church , and recrea - tions .

		He won the confidence of his constitu - ency , and at last found himself in
Parliament	LOCATION	, where he has utilized his long experience and study for the benefit of the people .

		His book is an interpretation of the creed and aims of his political associates , and an argument for their wisdom and justice .

		It is a statement also of what will soon be practical politics in the
United States	LOCATION	, where the rapid development of industrial centres causes the same difficulties and compels the nation to revise its economic and legal ideas to conform to new demands .

		The agitators who represent the wage-earners do not create these urgent problems ; they merely make the comfortable ruling classes aware of them .

		The happy possessors of land , privilege , places of honor and gain and title , naturally op - pose resistance and prophesy all sorts of evil to the nation .

		Feudalism has still enough energy in
Great Britain	LOCATION	to hold the titles to 3,000,000 acres of deer forests in
Scotland	LOCATION	as sacrosanct , while many millions of men have no claim to daily bread which might be grown on the waste land .

		In
1872	DATE	half the enclosed land of En - gland and
Wales	LOCATION	was monopolized by
2250	DATE	persons .

		It is a little better now , and yet the overwhelming majority of the people of
England	LOCATION	possess no right to their native soil .

		Mr.
Alden	PERSON	estimates that from 5000 to 6000 clergymen are appointed to their livings by the great land - owners ; and without accusing these clergymen of being hypocrites , we can easily see that their sermons would not touch upon the iniquities of the land monopoly , however severe they might be on the subject of foot-binding in
China	LOCATION	.

		It required nearly a century to make the rul - ing classes believe that the
State	ORGANIZATION	had any duty toward children ; under the impulse of the new ideas
England	LOCATION	has developed a children 's code which does it honor .

		Mr.
Alden	PERSON	supplies the detailed information which the French work omits .

		He analyzes more fully the chief measures representing re - cent advance toward scientific legislation for the welfare of the nation : the Children 's Act of
1908	DATE	, the Trade Boards Act of
1909	DATE	, the Un - employment and Sickness Insurance Acts , old age pensions , housing the poor , municipal owner - ship , and recovery of common land for the land - less .

		But in the main the books corroborate each other .

		CHARLES
RICHMOND HENDERSON CALIFORNIA	LOCATION	IN THE CIVIL WAR .

		* It is refreshing to the student now and then to read a book whose author has never been disillusioned , one whose faith in the absolute righteousness of his side and his party has never been shaken , and who is certain that all those who were on the other side from his heroes were wicked and treacherous , fit for conspicuous places in
Dante	ORGANIZATION	's inferno .

		Such an author can write with certainty , with a conviction as to the moral values of past acts not readily to be found in the writings of the more skeptical historians of recent decades .

		Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	, author of the work on `` The Contest for
Calif	LOCATION	ornia in
1861	DATE	, '' is of the former class , and his book is a frank spirited eulogy of his hero ,
Colonel E. D. Baker	PERSON	, killed at the battle of Ball 's Bluff in
October , 1861	DATE	.

		There are interesting chapters on early
California	LOCATION	his - tory , on social and economic conditions on `` the Coast '' during the years just preceding the Civil War ; and there are other valuable chapters on
Senator Broderick	PERSON	, who lost his life in so tragic a manner , on the early life of Colonel
Baker	PERSON	when he was a friend of
Abraham Lincoln	PERSON	and a Member of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	from
Illinois	LOCATION	, and on the efforts of shrewd Southerners like `` Jim '' Lane and
William Gwin	PERSON	to turn over the
Coast States	LOCATION	to the Confederacy in 1860-61 .

		In all of this , Mr.
Kennedy	PERSON	is but clearing the ground for his real work the portrayal of the truly noble leader whose fame he intends to establish and vindicate ; but to the historical student these preliminary chapters are quite as important as the main story .

Baker	PERSON	.

		No Confederate flag was ever actually unfurled in
California	LOCATION	, and no body of Confederate troops ever actually assembled in arms before any

Chicago	LOCATION	:

		It is a novel of style , character interest , and stimu - lating ideas .

		The ideas are found chiefly in the speech of
Massingdale	LOCATION	, the central figure , a man of amazingly vital volubility of discourse .

		He wants to be an artist , but fate prompted by paternal pres - sure has made him a barrister .

		He finds an outlet for his social predilections by collecting weekly in his chambers an interesting crowd of unconven - tional people , who talk about everything under the sun from fresh points of view .

		Making the acquaint - ance of a nice girl , he is on the point of becoming domestic and rang6 , when she throws him over be - cause he indiscreetly kisses an actress on a public thoroughfare .

		The act is innocent enough , in all conscience , and prompted by altruism rather than affection , but he is too proud to explain , and becomes the victim of his betrothed 's sensitive and offended maidenhood .

		This is the turning-point , for he there - upon chucks the respectable life , escorts the actress to
Paris	LOCATION	-LRB- still in all innocence -RRB- , and becomes a strug - gling artist in a
Montmartre	LOCATION	garret .

		The scene pres - ently shifts to an artist colony in the wine district , and culminates in a riot , with the siege and burning of a chateau , and a narrow escape for its defenders .

		The girl who has discarded him is a guest at the chateau , and her former lover saves her from outrage at the peril of his life .

		Matters are thus smoothed for a reconciliation , and the now successful painter gets the reward which is even more to him than his art .

		The word `` joyous '' in the title is particularly apt , for joyousness , in the serious sense , is the dom - inant note of the book .

		It is a remarkably interest - ing and unusually readable piece of fiction .


Sylvanus de Bohun	PERSON	, who has great possessions , and is the head of one of the oldest families in
England	LOCATION	, prefers the cloistered life of a scholar at
Cambridge	LOCATION	to the conspicuous place in society which he might claim .

		He has been an impractical dreamer from his childhood , and the interests and ambitions of most men seem to him quite meaning - less .

		So his estates are left in the charge of agents , while he devotes himself to writing the '' Social History of the Roman People , '' and thereby wins a great reputation for scholarship .

		Once he ventures forth into the larger world , and has some interesting if disastrous experiences .

		He kisses a woman , and '' suddenly innumerable things became clear .

		He understood now why some people could listen to music and look at pictures .

		In a flash he realized why the third volume had failed .

		It was not alive .

		A machine must have written it .

		Half a dozen Latin poems came to mind : they meant something entirely different from what he had supposed .

		Those poets had been men like himself ; they , too , must have experienced this extraordinary transfer - ence to the high mountains . ''

		The experience changes his outlook upon life , and leads to marriage , the assumption of his rights and duties as a country gentleman , and the old , old discovery about the frailty of woman when his wife deserts him one fine morning , accompanied by his rascally brother - in-law , who has been bleeding him for years .

		After
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 75 this , the scholar 's life at
Cambridge	LOCATION	is again taken up , and we leave him on the eve of election as Master of his college .

		This is the outline of the story told us by Mr.
Ralph Straus	PERSON	in '' The Prison Without a Wall . ''

		It is a richly human and whim - sically humorous story of the most delightful inter - est , reminding us in many ways of the best work of Mr.
W. J. Locke	PERSON	, and inviting quite as close an attention to its details .

		It is a work in which the characters are all real and the happenings are all significant .

		Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	is an expert craftsman , and we open '' The Turnstile '' with reasonable assurance of entertainment .

		Our expectations are fully justi - fied until about half way through the book , when the romantic material upon which the earlier chap - ters are based gives way to a dull and complicated account of a political struggle in
England	LOCATION	, having for its substance a hotly contested election and a parliamentary struggle .

		The hero is a successful Antarctic explorer who seeks and wins political advancement .

		The heroine is a girl of English extraction , who has spent her early life upon an Argentine estancia , adopted by its English owners from a foundling 's home in
Buenos Ayres	PERSON	.

		Deserted by her worthless father , she had when an infant been deposited in the turnstile of this institution whence the title of the novel .

		The reappearance of the disreputable father , threatening to make trouble , decides her adoptive parents to return with her to
England	LOCATION	, and thus are we brought to the second stage of the narrative .

		Her marriage to Captain
Ranes	PERSON	is a disappointment , for she has idealized him in his character as an explorer , and he turns out to be a politician of the time-serving and opportunist type .

		Her ideal is in a measure restored , when , at the end , the call of the pole decides him to give up politics , and reengage upon the quest which has all the time been his sub-conscious ambition .

		Mr.
John Masefield	PERSON	, who is one of the most vital and serious of the younger English writers , has taught us to expect something unusual whenever he gives birth to a book , be it play , poem , or novel .

		He has a curiously inquiring and reflective mind , engaged usually in contemplation of the most serious problems of life and character , and its output has compelling significance , whatever the theme of its preoccupation .

		His '' Multitude and Solitude '' deals with the sleeping-sickness , that scourge of the African wilderness , and it affords him material for a grim and intensely vivid picture of life -LRB- and death -RRB- in an African village .

		The hero is a
London	LOCATION	man of let - ters , too conscientious in his art to win popular success , whose life is darkened by a shipwreck in the
Irish Channel	LOCATION	, which is fatal to the woman whom he loves and upon whom all his hopes are built .

		He becomes possessed of a commanding impulse to cut away from literature and do something which may contribute more directly to human service .

		His attention is accidentally called to the subject of sleeping-sickness , and he prevails upon a young scientist of his acquaintance to accept him as a fellow-worker , and to take him to
Africa	LOCATION	upon his next expedition .

		The book is half-finished when this point is reached ; the remaining half takes us to the scene of his new labors , and has much to do with cultures , and media , and seras , and trypanosomes .

		Technically , the matter is thoroughly worked up .

		The two men are robbed and deserted in the jungle by their native keepers , and are left in a stricken village deprived of their most essential specific against disease .

		They both nearly succumb to the terrible ailment which they are engaged in fighting , but are saved by discovering the secret of the serum which will cure it .

		The story is told with a force and insight which remind us strongly of the work done by Mr.
Conrad	PERSON	in this tropical field .

		Mr.
Rider Haggard	PERSON	's '' Red Eve '' represents a re - version to the hopelessly unreal ultra-romantic type of historical fiction cultivated by the imitators of
Scott	PERSON	.

		It is one of the misfortunes of genius that it sets a shining example for the emulation of third-rate followers in its footsteps , and the atrocities that have been committed in the name of Sir
Walter	PERSON	are almost enough to make one wish that the great romancer had never lived .

		Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	's romance is of En - gland in the days of the French wars and the
Black Death	ORGANIZATION	.

		It takes us from the Southern counties to the field of Crecy , and thence to
Venice	LOCATION	and
Avignon	LOCATION	.

		The hero , whose affianced bride is tricked into a sham marriage by a French knight who is a black - hearted villain , pursues his enemy through
Europe	LOCATION	to the papal court , and finally wreaks vengeance upon him .

		Mr.
Haggard	PERSON	's predilection for the uncanny is illustrated by the superhuman figure personifying Death , who comes from far Cathay bearing with him the seeds of the pestilence which he scatters over the Western world , and intervening at critical junc - tures in the fortunes of the lovers .

		It all attempts to be very impressive , and signally misses its aim .

		The story of
Martin Luther	PERSON	and the launching of the Reformation has been made into a very accept - able historical novel , entitled '' The Friar of
Witten	PERSON	- berg , '' by Mr.
William Stearns Davis	PERSON	.

		The narrative is fully documented , and keeps close to historical fact .

		For a reader whose knowledge of the subject has been based upon boyhood reading of d'Aubigne * , which knowledge has grown somewhat hazy with the lapse of years , it serves to freshen the familiar facts , and give them renewed vitality .

		They are all here
Tetzel	PERSON	and his indulgences , the nailing up of the theses , the controversy with
Eck	PERSON	, the Diet of Worms , and the Wartburg .

		We are also given a vivid picture of Roman life , its sophisticated society , its pseudo - classical culture , and its Renaissance morals .

		This is needed to give point to the German revolt , and to enlist the fullest sympathy in behalf of the reform movement .

		The private interest of the story centres about a nobleman half-German , half-Italian whose early nurture has been all Italian , but who is driven forth to make a home upon his ancestral estates in the
Harz	LOCATION	country .

		Here he comes under the spell of Luther , is attracted to his cause by the Tetzel affair , and becomes his ardent champion in 76 THE
DIAX	ORGANIZATION	, -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, the events which follow .

		A fair German maiden becomes the object of his adoration , and his passion for her persists after she has been persuaded to take the vows of the religious life .

		The breaking up of the old order sets her free , and she is in the end united to her lover .

		But the private interest , al - though well sustained , is throughout subordinated to the interest of the great religious and political issues that are at stake , and Luther fills a larger part in the reader 's consciousness than the Graf von
Regen	ORGANIZATION	- stein .

		Some of the scenes notably the one at Worms supported as they are by the historical record of things said and done , are very impressive , as is also the picture of the decay of Christianity in its ancient seat .

		We have often thought , during our reading , of the historical novels of Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	, and the author of `` The Crisis , '' had he taken up the tale of the Reformation , would have produced much the same sort of a book .

		There is the same skilful weaving of a private plot with affairs of public import , the same effective use of salient historical episodes , the same wide knowledge of the period concerned .

		There is also the same lack of finish in the detail and the same rather commonplace style .

		The matter of the work is so big that the man - ner can do without overmuch of artistic elaboration .

		The author 's attitude toward the controversial mat - ter involved is , of course , strongly Protestant , and therefore biassed as compared with that of the strictly dispassionate student of history , who must needs take into account , in judging the Reformation , of its two centuries ' legacy of religious warfare , no less than of its immediate provocations and defences .

		Another historical novel of marked excellence is `` The Shadow of Power , '' by Mr.
Paul Bertram	PERSON	.

		It has for its theme the attempt to force the Nether - lands into subjection to the Spanish yoke under Philip II .

		Neither the
Duke of Alva	ORGANIZATION	, leader of the persecution , nor the spider-king , weaving his webs in the seclusion of the Escorial , appears upon the scene , but we are all the time conscious of their sinister presence somewhere in the background .

		The
Prince of Orange	ORGANIZATION	is the only important histor - ical character figuring in the narrative , appearing at the time when the hero transfers his allegiance to the Dutch cause .

		This hero is a noble Spaniard , sent to govern the town of
Geertruydenberg	LOCATION	; and he makes his entry just in time to rescue a damsel , bound to the stake , and about to be burned on a charge of witchcraft .

		It is a perilous act , for it brings him into disfavor with court and clergy , and in its ultimate consequence , leads to his deposition .

		He has in the meanwhile , married the daughter of a wealthy Dutch burgher , but it has been a con - strained union on her part , and it does not bring him her love .

		When the crisis comes in his fortunes , he is unable to rescue her , because she suspects him of seeking to betray her and her father as Protestants .

		Thus she passes out of his life and of the story when he joins forces with
William the Silent	ORGANIZATION	.

		The woman whom he has saved from the flames remains for the author 's use in making the needed romantic settle - ment of the plot .

		In a very general way , this book resembles `` The Friar of
Wittenberg	LOCATION	, '' both in the fact that it deals with the period of religious perse - cutions in
Europe	LOCATION	, and in the further fact that the hero turns his back upon the cause with which he has been allied by race and circumstance .

		He be - comes a valiant fighter for Dutch freedom , and in the end wins the woman whom he loves .

		He is a strong figure , and a fine opportunity for psycholog - ical study is offered by the gradual alienation of his sympathies from the Spanish side to that of the em - battled Dutchmen .

		He becomes technically a traitor , but he carries with him our respect and admiration .

		This is not as partisan a story as is usually written upon the theme which the author has chosen .

		He is as unsparing of Protestant as of Catholic bigotry , and is not blind to the faults of the people whose champion he becomes .

		His style is very good almost distinguished and the mastery of his his - torical material is thorough .

		Although there are considerable elements of introspection and analysis in the book , the action is on the whole swift and dramatic , and the plot is of pronounced and exciting interest .

		It is so much more than the ordinary tale of intrigue and adventure that it makes a strong ap - peal to the intellectual interests of the reader , while at the same time gratifying his artistic sense .

		The theme of the disdainful maiden , who scorns the hero who has rescued her from her plight , and withholds for long years the reward that is roman - tically his due , meets us once more in Mr.
Frederick Palmer	PERSON	's '' Over the Pass . ''

		The agony is rather over - done , for there is no reason why the heroine should have been so stand-offish when she must have known in her heart that she was destined to make a full surrender .

		It all happens in
Arizona	LOCATION	, where
Jasper Ewold	PERSON	, disgusted with the ways of civilization , has taken refuge , and becomes the founder of a town of which he is the recognized leader and patriarch .

		His daughter
Mary	PERSON	is the heroine , and her rescuer is
Jack Wingfield	PERSON	, once a `` lunger , '' but now in vigorous health , who saves her from the unwelcome attentions of the `` bad man '' of the town .

		Jack , nothing dis - couraged by the maiden 's coldness , determines to become a rancher , and sets himself to the cultivation of alfalfa and such truck .

		But he is called to the
East	LOCATION	, where his father , the owner of a large depart - ment store and many times a millionaire , wants him in his business , now that he is restored to health .

		He makes a valiant effort to adapt himself to the new life , but
Arizona	LOCATION	calls to him , and for her sake which is a euphemistic way of saying for
Mary	PERSON	's sake he renounces position and fortune for the ranch .

		In an exciting episode he rounds up the '' bad man '' and his pals , and eliminates them from the situation .

		After that , it is easy work to placate the father who has borne a grudge against his family and bring the girl to her senses .

		It is a blithe story , told with much animation and whim - sical humor .

		The subject of fire insurance does not exactly ap - peal to the romantic imagination , and it is surpris -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 77 ing to find how interesting a novel has heen written about it by Messrs.
Kennedy	PERSON	and Noble .

		The hero , a young man with the prosaic name of
Smith	ORGANIZATION	, is engaged in the business , and is enthusiastically devoted to his occupation .

		To him the work of underwriting is rich in dramatic human interest , besides leading into the most delightful by-ways of scholarship .

		The Conservative Company of which he is an officer is attacked by unscrupulous rivals and undermined by treachery upon the part of its own vice-president .

		Its affairs are in a desperate condition , when
Smith	PERSON	is given charge , and energeti - cally sets things to rights .

		The final blow is dealt the enemy by fate , when a disastrous conflagration sweeps through the business heart of
Boston	LOCATION	, creat - ing liabilities which force the rival organization to retire from the field .

		Smith finds an ally and sym - pathizer in an attractive young woman who wants to learn about the business , and applies to him for information .

		Under his tutelage she acquires -LRB- and incidentally the reader -RRB- a surprising amount of technical knowledge about agencies , and separation rules , and other matters , which are plainly set forth from a knowledge of the subject which is both intimate and intelligent .

		`` White Ashes '' is the appropriate title of this exceptionally clever and well-written piece of fiction .

		The author of `` The Inner Shrine '' and `` The Wild Olive '' has given us , in `` The Street Called Straight , '' a third novel of ingeniously contrived plot , incisive characterization , and sustained interest .

		The interest is essentially psychological , and the situation may be thus outlined : A
Boston	LOCATION	girl of high social standing and patrician instincts has be - come engaged to an English army officer who has a record for heroic achievement and the most brilliant prospects of advancement .

		The wedding is immi - nent , awaiting only his arrival in
Boston	LOCATION	, when it transpires that the girl 's father has been an em - bezzler of trust funds to the amount of half a million , and that his exposure and disgrace can no longer be averted .

		Then comes the intervention of a Bostonian whose suit the girl once rejected , and who has since `` cleaned up '' half a million by specu - lating in copper mines .

		He learns of her predica - ment , and , asking no reward , quixotically comes to the rescue with his half million .

		At first , the offer is declined by both father and daughter , but reflec - tion causes them to accept it after some days of irresolution .

		Then the Englishman arrives , is ap - prised of the exact situation , refuses the girl 's offer to release him and offers to assume the burden by the sacrifice of his own property .

		This the girl refuses , preferring to become beholden to the American , in the disinterestedness of whose motive she has come to have faith .

		A protracted deadlock follows , he refusing to accept happiness at the cost of a stranger , she refusing to accept him at the cost of his own financial ruin and clouded prospects .

		Then the American has a brilliant idea .

		The girl has a wealthy aunt , an expatriate and the widow of a French Marquis , and to her the American appeals , stating all the facts , and urging her to assume the obligation .

		She hastens to
America	LOCATION	, makes the offer , and the path to the girl 's marriage seems to be cleared .

		Neither she nor the Englishman can urge any valid objection to aid that comes from her own family .

		Here is where the psychological situation becomes intense , for when this point is reached , the extraordinary generosity and self-effacement of the American have made such an impression on both of them , that she has come to regard him in a more than friendly way , and he finds himself incapable of thwarting the happiness of the man who has shown himself capable of such devotion .

		He would feel himself under a heavier burden of obligation than before , when it is a merely a question of accepting money , and his conscience finds it intolerable .

		His renunciation follows , after a struggle , and the way is cleared for the girl 's union with the man who had not dared to dream of such an outcome .

		The workings of these three people 's minds , in the successive stages of this complication , is analyzed with masterly insight , and therein lies the strength of the work .

		That the Englishman may not go entirely unre - warded , he is given a sort of consolation prize in the rather colorless woman who is one of the minor figures in the narrative .

		This is anything but con - vincing , and noticeably weakens the story at its close .

		Mr.
Randall Parrish	PERSON	always tells a good story , although he has no gifts of style or characterization to speak of .

		His `` Molly McDonald '' is a tale of
1868	DATE	in the West , when the Indian uprisings en - gaged the attention of the
United States	LOCATION	forces under
Sheridan	PERSON	and
Custer	PERSON	.

		The hero is of the type dear to the romantic heart of youth , who accomplishes great deeds of daring , and rescues the heroine from all sorts of perils .

		He is an enlisted soldier , and had previously been an officer in the Confederate army .

		He is under a cloud , owing to the treachery of a former friend , and he gets revenge upon his enemy at the same time that the evidence turns up that is needed to clear his name .

		He gets the girl , as a matter of course .

		The sensational newspaper reports of the wreck of the Titanic bear but the faintest resemblance to the sober and careful narrative of the event from the pen of Mr.
Lawrence Beesley	PERSON	, one of the survivors and a person well quali - fied to treat the theme with accuracy and in minute detail .

		Mr.
Beesley	PERSON	is a young English - man , a
Cambridge	LOCATION	scholar , and has been a teacher of physics , as his narrative shows ; so that his powers of observation and habit of scientific inference are precisely those required in one attempting a faithful account of this memorable shipwreck .

		The great size and many decks of the Titanic , the exceeding slightness of the shock of collision with the iceberg , the prevalent belief in the unsinkability of the mon - ster vessel , and the comparative slowness of its actual sinking , these were important factors in preventing panic or confusion among the passengers .

		Tales of pistol-firing , of suicide on the part of officers , of melodramatic exhortations from captain to crew to `` be British , '' and other newspaper fabrications , are pronounced false by the calmly observant author .

		His own rescue resulted from a very matter-of-course and all but inevitable chain of events , and with a rather remarkable unawareness on his part that any loss of life whatever was threatened .

		In this one particular in failing to appreciate the inadequacy of the ship 's life-saving equipment he falls below one 's concep - tion of his observing powers .

		But of course no ex - pectation of disaster had been entertained by him .

		Of his narrative in general it is safe to say that no single survivor could have furnished a better or more trustworthy history of the stupendous event ; but it would be strange if some few occurrences that went to make up the whole catastrophe had not been inad - vertently slighted or distorted , minimized or exag - gerated by him .

		What one observant and careful narrator could do , however , he has admirably done .

		The book is published , with illustrations , by
Hough	PERSON	- ton
Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Expert advice '' How to Plan a Library Building about library for Library Work '' comes from the architecture .

		p en o f one w h o to fa e infectious enthusiast of an amateur joins the knowledge and experience of the professional library worker .

		Mr.
Charles C. Soule	PERSON	has been an active member of the
American Library Association	ORGANIZATION	almost from its foun - dation , was its vice-president in
1890	DATE	, a member of its
Publishing Board	ORGANIZATION	for eight years , of its Council for two terms of three and five years , a trustee of its Endowment Fund for twelve years , and has been a member of the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	since its formation .

		Eleven years of service as trustee of the
Brookline Public Library	ORGANIZATION	are also to be placed to his credit .

		He has made a careful study of library architecture , especially from the inside , from the viewpoint of the working librarian , and he naturally and rightly insists on the primary importance of utility .

		His book , which shrinks not from handling the prosaic details of plumbing , drains , sewers , fire-buckets , vacuum cleaners , and so on , is divided into five main divisions , with many sub-sections .

		The Introduction touches on the history and literature and main out - lines of the general theme ; then comes a fuller treat - ment of `` Principles '' ; after that a section devoted to `` Personel '' ; next a consideration of `` Features '' ; and finally a four-part discussion of '' Departments and Rooms . ''

		An appendix containing `` Concrete Examples '' and other useful matter follows , and an index completes the volume .

		The author takes extraordinary pains to fortify every position with corroborative opinions from other writers .

		After stating in conclusive terms the obvious desirability of consulting an expert librarian before planning one 's library building , he hardly needed to quote , with chapter and verse , an imposing array of au - thorities ; but perhaps the point can not be too strongly emphasized .

		His disapproval of the com - petition method of securing architectural plans seems a bit excessive .

		Open competition in compli - ance with expert specifications , prepared beforehand in detail , sometimes produces results of value in the way of originality and novelty that can not be bar - gamed for from a hired architect of even the highest standing .

		The author and his publishers , the
Boston	LOCATION	Book Company , invite a free expression of opinion as to the desirability of issuing a supplementary volume of plates .

		If enough requests for such a volume are received , it will be published .

		Also any other criticisms or suggestions , of a constructive nature , are solicited from the public .

		So well - considered and well-executed a treatise as Mr.
Soule	PERSON	's can hardly be much improved upon except by the addition of illustrative plates .

		Further Those who are interested -LRB- and who f noted IS not ? -RRB-

		m tne personal peculiarities journalist .

		and the informal conversation of the famous , will greatly enjoy Mr.
George W. Smalley	PERSON	's second series of `` Anglo-American Memories '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		Reprinted chiefly from the
New York	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' these genially reminiscent chapters treat of persons who either now are or lately have been much in public notice ; as , for example , Mr.
Winston Churchill	PERSON	, Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	, Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	,
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	, Sir
Edward Grey	PERSON	,
Count Witte	ORGANIZATION	,
Goldwin Smith	PERSON	,
Whistler	LOCATION	,
Henry Irving	PERSON	, Mme.
Bernhardt	PERSON	, and Mile .

		Descle'e , on the other side of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	; and on this , Mr.
J. Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	, Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	,
Colonel Roosevelt	PERSON	,
Thomas B. Reed	PERSON	, and Mr.
White	PERSON	- law
Reid	PERSON	.

		A significant utterance from our strenu - ous Colonel will attract attention .

		`` You think I am impulsive , '' said he , `` and perhaps I am .

		But I will tell you one thing .

		Never yet have I entered upon any great policy till I was satisfied I had be - hind me a great body of public opinion . ''

		There speaks the astute opportunist .

		Recalling the earlier years of his acquaintance with Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, the author says : `` The two or three days I spent with Governor
Roosevelt	PERSON	at
Albany	LOCATION	left me with the im - pression that his masterful good intentions would lead him far .

		We all now know that they did , though whether we have even yet measured the whole dis - tance may be a question .

		For the considered judg -

		THE DIAL 79 merit of the community embodied in statutes he seemed to have less respect than for his own indi - vidual opinion .

		He had , I thought , less reverence for law than most Americans have ; or once had . ''

		And in the eyes of
Europe	LOCATION	we have always been an awful example of disrespect for law .

		Concerning the Russo-Japanese treaty for which such high credit has been accorded to the then President of the
United States	LOCATION	, Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	, who was at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	all the time the diplomatic negotiations were in progress , has much to say that is well worth reading . ''

		I sum it all up in this way , '' says he in conclusion .

		`` It was Count
Witte	PERSON	who , with that ` fortunate astute - ness ' which is
Machiavelli	ORGANIZATION	's ideal in The Prince , brought the American people back to their ancient friendship for
Russia	LOCATION	, and with them the President .

		It was Count
Witte	PERSON	who formed that body of Ameri - can opinion without which Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	, as I have elsewhere related , never , he said , entered upon a great policy .

		... It was therefore first of all Count
Witte	PERSON	, and perhaps secondly the Russian Emperor , who were the real authors of the Peace of Ports - mouth .

		President
Roosevelt	PERSON	's intervention was use - ful and was made with great courage and judgment at the right moment .

		But of itself it would not have availed . ''

		The wide range of Mr.
Smalley	PERSON	's acquaint - ance among the great , his good taste and excellent discretion in reporting their talk and their actions , and the pleasing quality of his style , make these `` Anglo-American Memories '' most agreeable read - ing .

		In a significant and closely-reasoned work entitled '' The Sociological Study of the Bible '' -LRB-
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , Mr.
Louis Wallis	PERSON	has traced the rise of the Christian religion from its embryonic beginnings among the Hebrews , and traced it , for the first time , under its sociological aspects .

		The rise of the unique religion of
Israel	LOCATION	and its flowering in Christianity has been interpreted as a develop - ment from the worship of a purely tribal god ,
Yahweh	LOCATION	, to that of a universal god who set the interests of universal justice over all merely tribal or national interests .

		When asked , however , why the worship of Yahweh should thus develop , rather than the worship of his neighboring and once just as powerful god Chemosh , the higher critics have had to fall back on some such explanation as `` the genius of the Hebrew prophets . ''

		But even personal genius can not
spring	DATE	up out of relation to the social and other environmental forces around it .

		It is , then , in terms of those forces that Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	seeks to show how the religion of the
Bible	LOCATION	grew .

		He finds the explanation in the collision and gradual amalgamation of the wandering Canaanitish clans , with their mountain god Yahweh and their nomadic code of ethics which recognized the brotherhood of all men in the clan , and the settled Amorites who occupied Canaan , lived in independent cities , and had a code of ethics which recognized class distinc - tions and regarded the serf classes as having few or The social genesis of the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		no rights .

		As soon as the Hebrews settled down in this land they took over these sophisticated and aristocratic ideas .

		The new status of affairs natur - ally bore down heavily upon the poorer Israelites , and so their hill prophets came to associate their tribal god Yahweh with their old nomadic ideas of brotherly justice , and to oppose that conception to the '' Baal worship '' of the cities with its attendant love of luxury and ceremony .

		Hence arose the fusion of the idea of justice with that of the
Israel	LOCATION	- itish god .

		Then came conquest and the
Exile	ORGANIZATION	, a national experience which showed the greatest of the prophets that their god 's idea of justice was not confined to the well-being of
Israel	LOCATION	but meant a universal justice which
Israel	LOCATION	as well as the other nations of the earth had to acknowledge .

		Re - demption then became the watchword of the Jewish religion , and the redemptive idea gradually took on the characteristics which Jesus and
Paul	PERSON	found ready to their hands and of which they made so revolutionary a use .

		Mr.
Wallis	PERSON	does not confine himself to the rise of Bible religion only , but traces the social factor in the later growth of Christianity , through the Reformation , and on to the contemporary situation .

		Although his book is for the layman , he writes in a thoroughly scientific manner , and the lesson he draws from this great development is that the church of to-day should recognize the bearings of the social problem on religion , and while avoiding all fixed programmes of reform , see to it that the church , made in part as it is by social pressure , should react on the social situation and impress it with the idealism whose sanctuary the church is meant to be .

		`` A
Chance Medley of Legal Points fheTaw	ORGANIZATION	.

		f and Le 8 al Stories '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , composed of extracts from '' Silk and Stuff '' in the Pall Mall Gazette '' -LRB-
1893	DATE	-
1909	DATE	-RRB- , appears with no indication as to whose diligence in searching the annals of English juris - prudence has placed us under obligations for so en - tertaining a collection of not too familiar anecdotes .

		To be sure , we find
Disraeli	PERSON	's well-known saying if
Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	ever said it , which the compiler gravely doubts , and he gives the reason for his doubts : `` Everybody knows the stages of a lawyer 's career : he tries in turn to get on , to get honors , to get hon - est. '' But we also find many other equally good and more authentic witticisms as , for example : '' An at - torney died so poor perhaps it was he of whom it was said that he had so few effects because he had so few causes that his friends had to make a shil - ling subscription to bury him .

		One of them asked
Curran	PERSON	for that contribution .

		` Here 's a sovereign , ' was the answer ; ' bury twenty ! ' ''

		That was an apt reply , too , which
Lord Chief Justice Russell	ORGANIZATION	made , in his pre-judicial days when he was only a stuff - gownsman and a brother barrister asked him in court what was the extreme penalty for bigamy .

		`` Two mothers-in-law , '' came the ready answer .

		The same 80 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 1	DATE	, kind of wit , but unintentionally displayed , marked the reply of a pi'isoner who was pleading in his own defense but failed to make himself distinctly heard by the judge . ''

		What was your last sentence ? ''

		asked his honor . ''

		Six months , '' respectfully returned the prisoner at the bar .

		Let it not be inferred , however , that the book is wholly devoted to such tit-bits of humor ; many incidents and cases are cited for the sake of their bearing on present-day events , and ap - parently to encourage the reader to do a little serious thinking for himself .

		Incidentally the book cites some cases that might serve as good illustrations to Mr.
Samuel B. Chester	PERSON	's recent `` Anomalies of the English Law . ''

		Possibly the anonymous compiler is Mr.
Chester	PERSON	himself .

		At all events , `` A Chance Medley '' is a curiously learned and well-edited piece of work .

		Memories of Southern writers on Civil War sub - Gen.
Wheeler	PERSON	's .

		, j , j , , .

		.

		.

		Confederate jects have devoted their attention cavalrv .

		largely to the
Army of Northern Virginia	ORGANIZATION	, somewhat to the neglect of the other armies of the Confederacy , although the task be - fore the armies of the West was in some respects even greater than that set for the army of Lee .

		General
Basil Duke	ORGANIZATION	's Reminiscences , published last year , was devoted to an account of soldier life in the Western army .

		Mr.
DuBose	PERSON	's book on `` General
Joseph Wheeler	PERSON	and the
Army	ORGANIZATION	of
Tennessee	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Neale -RRB- deals largely with matters of tactics and strategy .

		The author , with his four brothers , served in
Wheeler	LOCATION	's cavalry .

		Consequently the volume is , to a certain extent reminiscencial ; but the author has also made considerable use of historical sources , and the result is a work of considerable value .

		Of particular interest is the author 's estimate of the value of the cavalry arm to the Confederate cause .

		It is his theory that although the Confederate cavalry was on the whole superior to the Federal cavalry , its extraordinary value was not understood by the Confederate authorities during the early years of the conflict , and therefore the peculiar military capacity of the Southern people was not fully de - veloped .

		Numerous private letters throw interest - ing side-lights on many phases of the conflict .

		The primary purpose of the book , however , is to give an account of the military career of General
Joseph Wheeler	PERSON	as commander of the cavalry in the
Army of Tennesse	ORGANIZATION	.

		Particularly clear is the author 's ac - count of the misfortunes which resulted from the change of Confederate commanders at
Atlanta	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
DuBose	PERSON	evidently approves the policy of General
Johnston	PERSON	, not that of General Hood and the Con - federate president .

		Judge
Oliver Perry Temple	PERSON	, of
Knox	PERSON	- ville >
Tennessee	LOCATION	, who died in
1907	DATE	, had long been devoted to the study of the history of
East Tennessee	LOCATION	.

		During his life - time he published two historical works , '' The Cove - nanter , the Cavalier , and the Puritan , '' and ``
East Tennessee	LOCATION	and the Civil War , '' of which the latter especially was a work of considerable merit .

		Now there appears from the Cosmopolitan Press of
New York	LOCATION	a posthumous work , compiled and arranged by
Judge Temple	ORGANIZATION	's daughter ,
Miss Mary B. Temple	ORGANIZATION	, which bears the title `` Notable Men of
Tennessee	LOCATION	from
1833	DATE	to
1875	DATE	, Their Times and Their Contem - poraries . ''

		Had the words `` East Tennessee '' been used instead of ``
Tennessee	LOCATION	'' the title would have been a more accurate one ; for , with one exception , all the leaders in politics -LRB- about thirty in number -RRB- whose lives are sketched by
Judge Temple	ORGANIZATION	lived and were active in the
Eastern	ORGANIZATION	section of the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		It should have been indicated , also , that only Unionist `` notables '' are included : there is no biography , for example , of
Landon C. Haynes	PERSON	.

		Some of the sketches cover not more than a page or two , but those of
William G. Brownlow	PERSON	and
Andrew Johnson	PERSON	are of considerable length .

		As might be expected from the circumstances of its preparation , the book suffers from some discursiveness of style and some repetition of facts .

		The author was a partisan in times when feeling ran high , and his likes and dis - likes remained strong .

		But the recollections are those of an honest and able observer and a consci - entious narrator , and the book , despite the limitations suggested , and the absence of an index , constitutes a valuable contribution to the history of East Ten - nessee .

		NOTES .

		The very effective set of drawings of the
Panama Canal	ORGANIZATION	made by Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	for '' The Century , '' some of which appear in the
August	DATE	issue of that mag - azine , has been purchased by the government for the print collection of the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	.

		The his - torical value of Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's pictures is increased by the fact that with the letting in of the water the picturesque - ness of this part of the Canal work will be largely obliterated .

		After eleven years of deliberation the
San Francisco Board of Supervisors	ORGANIZATION	has voted to accept the three - quarters of a million dollars offered by Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	as a contribution toward a new library building .

		No city could stand in much greater need of such a building , and , consequently , of the funds wherewith to erect it , than
San Francisco	LOCATION	.

		Thus one can surmise the weighti - ness of the scruples so long delaying a glad acceptance of the money .

		A new series of selections from the letters and diaries of
Queen Victoria	PERSON	, with an introduction by
Lord Esher	PERSON	, has been sanctioned by
King George	ORGANIZATION	.

		The pub - lication will take the form of two illustrated volumes , entitled `` The Girlhood of Queen Victoria , '' and will give interesting glimpses of the royal author from her thirteenth year to the time of her marriage in
1840	DATE	.

		Mr.
John Murray	PERSON	, the publisher of the first series , will publish also the second .

		The recent unveiling of the allegorical figures , `` Science '' and `` Art , '' now at last in place on their long-expectant pedestals in front of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, marks the completion of that fine building as projected a quarter of a century ago by the architects .

		The late
Augustus Saint-Gaudens	PERSON	had originally been commissioned to furnish the statues , but his untimely
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 81 death made necessary the engagement of another sculp - tor .

		To Mr.
Bela Pratt	PERSON	the task was finally assigned , and the fine bronze figures that have now come from his hand give the noble building 's front that finishing touch it has so long wanted .

		Endowment of the
Mark Twain Memorial Library	ORGANIZATION	, at
Redding	LOCATION	,
Connecticut	LOCATION	, with a sufficient fund to provide for its support is now , thanks to Mr.
Carnegie	PERSON	, an ac - complished fact .

		The history of this interesting library is briefly as follows .

		When Mr.
Clemens	PERSON	took up his abode at Redding he gave the town a collection of sev - eral thousand volumes from his own library , and placed them in a small vacant chapel for public use .

		These temporary quarters soon gave place to a more suitable building , erected by him as a memorial to his daughter Jean ; and after his death the greater part of his own remaining library was added to the collection .

		Hitherto it has been from voluntary contributors that this me - morial library has received its support .

		The untimely death of an eminent French scientist and author is reported from
Paris	LOCATION	in the passing away of
Jules Henri Poincoire	PERSON	' , a cousin of the French premier , on the seventeenth of
July	DATE	, from the bursting of an artery .

		A serious surgical operation had been undergone by him two weeks earlier , with every pros - pect of recovery .

		Poincoire ' was born at
Nancy	ORGANIZATION	in
1854	DATE	, and had devoted his life largely to mathematical studies , holding chairs in the
University of Paris	ORGANIZATION	and the
Polytechnic School	ORGANIZATION	.

		One of his earliest and most popular books was '' La Science et PHypothese , '' which soon reached a circulation of twenty thousand copies in his own country and was republished abroad .

		Among the stories illustrating the bent of his genius , there is an especially pleasing one which describes his infant ecstasies 011 first viewing the starry heavens .

		Astronomy became later one of his favorite studies .

		A long-desired biography , that of the late
Walter Bagehot	PERSON	, who has been dead thirty-five years but is still remembered as one of the best talkers of his day and one of the best writers of any day , is to be undertaken at last .


R. H. Button	PERSON	, friend of
Bagehot	PERSON	and editor of '' The Spectator , '' would have been the one best equip - ped for the task ; but as he left the work undone , Mrs.
Russell Barrington	PERSON	, known for her studies of
Watts	LOCATION	and
Leighton	PERSON	, comes forward to supply the omission .

		The author of '' Lombard Street '' and a treatise on the En - glish Constitution is now best remembered for his shorter pieces , such as his biographical studies of leading Vic - torian statesmen .

		His brilliance and stimulus as a talker may be surmised from the aptness and originality of phrase that mark his written style . ''

		The cake of cus - tom '' is perhaps his most familiar contribution to our phraseology ; `` animated restraint , '' as the characteristic of good writing , will also be cherished in remembrance , and likewise his expression of regret that those who write have seldom done anything worth writing about , while those who do things worth recording are com - monly disinclined to spread them on paper .

		109 ANONYMITY AND PSEUDONYMITY .

		Certain recent anonymous or pseudonymous books `` One Way Out , '' for instance , and `` The Corner of Harley Street '' and `` A Living Without a Boss , '' and a little earlier `` The In - ner Shrine , '' and a number of others illustrate the ease and freedom and un-selfconsciousness which a writer is at liberty to enjoy , if he will , when he gives expression to his thought or invention , his whim or his fancy , without being saddled by that Old Man of the Sea , his own personality in the form of an irrevocably unal - terable name , with all that that name has come to stand for in his own mind , in the mind of others , and in the mind of the supreme intelli - gence that knows him for what he really is .

		Like little children who play with the keenest zest and the completest abandon when they are `` making believe '' and impersonating other characters , most imaginative authors like to indulge , now and then if not habitually , in just this sort of innocent make-believe .

		To objectify or dramatize oneself before putting pen to paper seems to promote a freer flow of words , to bring a richer supply of images , to fertilize the invention and stimulate the fancy .


Charles Lamb	PERSON	's most sympathetic biographer , Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	, suggests that possibly in the pseudonym `` Elia '' may be found a reason for the difference between the comparative thinness of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's earlier or pre-Elian productions and the richness and color of his famous Essays .

		There are some writers , he remarks , who , para - doxical though it may seem , can never express themselves so freely as when , adopting a dra - matic standpoint , they affect to be some one else .


Goldsmith	PERSON	is pointed to as one who `` was always happier in his work when he imagined his pen to be held by another . ''

		The harmless imposture lends courage , emboldens diffidence , and begets a fine carelessness of criticism .

		Under a euphonious and dignified name , who could not give better expression to exalted sentiments than under one of trivial and com - monplace character ?

		If a lover of his country burns with a desire to deliver himself of an eloquent philippic against the arrogant pre - tensions of the Prince of
Patagonia	LOCATION	, into how much finer a frenzy will he work himself as `` Demosthenes Philopatris '' than as -LRB- let us say -RRB- 88 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	,
Abner E. Small !	ORGANIZATION

		Or if the ardent swain wishes to pen a lyric in praise of his sweetheart 's blue eyes and descriptive of the passion they inspire in his breast , small headway will he make until he ceases to think of himself as
George Griggs	PERSON	and assumes the character of some imaginary Launcelot or
Alphonso	PERSON	or
Francesco	PERSON	.

		A marked example of that reluctance often felt by a writer of imagination and wit to be known as the father of his own literary offspring is furnished by the lamented
Edward Rowland Sill	PERSON	, the premature silencing of whose graceful and sprightly pen will ever be a cause for keen regret .

		Near the end of his too-short life , and after he had proved himself a master in both prose and verse , he wrote to a friend : `` When anything of mine is to be printed I have often a horrid sense now the fingers of the whole uni - verse will be pointing at this fellow as an example of a wretch that has mistaken his vocation .

		When it is once printed , I feel instantly relieved , in the knowledge that nobody reads things after all or cares whether they are good or not .

		The fingers I perceive to be all point - ing at more conspicuous objects , or being harmlessly sucked in the mouth : so I do n't care a bit till the next thing is about to be printed ... You would not believe how I have actually shuddered internally each month with fear that now I am going to be stuck up on a post without a rag on me at last , and my nightmare was to come true . ''

		Again he writes , with something of the same amusing exaggeration which self-contemplation tends to produce in many another besides him - self : '' The trouble about signing one 's name to poems is , that stupid people -LRB- and we are all pretty stupid some - times -RRB- persist in thinking every word literally autobio - graphical .

		I have had enough annoyance from that to sicken any one of ever writing verse again , or anything else but arithmetics and geographies .

		Even then some one would hate you for your view of the Indian Ocean , or fear the worst about your character because of your treatment of the
Least Common Multiple	ORGANIZATION	.

		People are getting to write anonymously now and then .

		-LRB- You did n't write ' The Breadwinners , ' did you ?

		Perhaps the Janitor at
the University	ORGANIZATION	did or Bacon the printer , or Hy .

		Ward
Beecher	PERSON	. -RRB- ''

		Sill 's parenthesized query brings to mind in - stances of that false or hypocritical anonymity which really seeks greater glory for the author , through a preliminary mystery and its adroit exploitation , than would have come to him had he simply and honestly avowed his authorship at the outset .

		Of course the anonymous issue of `` The Breadwinners '' is now known to have been dictated by no such paltry motive ; but there is reason to suspect that
Samuel Warren	PERSON	allowed the general curiosity aroused by the anonymity of `` Ten Thousand a Year '' to min - ister to its author 's vanity .

		Beginning its serial appearance in `` Black wood 's Magazine '' for Oc - tober ,
1839	DATE	, it continued its anonymous course up to
August , 1841	DATE	, evoking many conjectures as to its authorship .

		Warren himself is said to have kept the conjecturers busy by asking everybody he met , '' Who do you suppose wrote ' Ten Thousand a Year ? ' '' '

		At last one discern - ing person , upon being thus importuned , replied in a confidential whisper , '' Well , my dear fellow , if you wo n't let it go any further , I '11 confess to you in private that I wrote it . ''

		Undoubtedly the `` Letters of Junius '' owe a large part of their fame to the mystery enveloping their au - thorship .

		Whether Sir
Philip Francis	PERSON	wrote them , and whether he or whoever did write them foresaw the vogue which their anonymity would help to give them , who shall say ?

		It is certainly one of the best-kept secrets in literary history .

		In choosing a pseudonym , as in naming a child , there is need of wisdom .

		To have been projected without one 's consent into this world of sorrow and sin and strife is bad enough .

		To be handicapped after one 's arrival by being tagged with an unprepossessing or ridiculous or otherwise objectionable label is an addition of insult to injury .

		Therefore , since we can not choose our ancestors or our baptismal names , there is all the more reason why one should pro- ceed cautiously in selecting the pen-name that is to help make or mar the fortunes of one 's literary efforts .

		It is well known that our fore - most humorist deeply regretted in later years that he had not chosen for himself , in addition to the whimsical pseudonym now forever asso - ciated with `` Innocents Abroad '' and `` Rough - ing It , '' a second and less oddly suggestive name for works of serious thought and purpose .

		Read - ers persisted in laughing over anything signed ``
Mark Twain	PERSON	, '' whether there was anything funny in it or not .

		There is something truly pathetic in the wail he uttered over the re - ception accorded to his first essay in a serious vein .

		`` Well , in due course of time the book -LSB- ` The Prince and the Pauper ' -RSB- came out .

		To me it was a crucial point in my life .

		My anxiety over its reception at the hands of the literary critics was so great that I could n't sleep or eat .

		It will not be hard to imagine my chagrin , then , when they came out with yards of slush in which they called this , my first serious work , my masterpiece of humor said it was just about the funniest thing that had ever come off a press .

		Mind you , this was not the verdict of one or two or three of these literary know-it-alls it was unanimous ... By the time I had been assaulted and battered in seven or eight
Ian	PERSON	-
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		89 guages by this literary riffraff I gave it up and decided that there was no remedy for their kind of mania .

		The only satisfaction I ever had out of it is in holding that I was right and they were all wrong .

		I have never altered that opinion . ''

		The history of pseudonymity is enlivened with many anecdotes illustrating the danger that a pseudonym , or any fictitious name used in story - writing , however odd and however carefully chosen , may prove to be the name of a real living person who will turn up some day and make trouble for his literary namesake .

		A curious and indeed an almost incredible in - stance of this nature , having to do with the assumed name of a person and the assumed name of a town , is related by Mr.
J. Henry Harper	PERSON	in that recent treasury of literary his - tory and anecdote , `` The
House of Harper	ORGANIZATION	, '' which also gives in full the
Mark Twain	PERSON	incident referred to above .

		One day there came by mail to Dr.
Irenaeus Prime	PERSON	, in his capacity as editor of `` The Drawer '' in ``
Harper	PERSON	's Magazine , '' a story containing a personal name and a geo - graphical name , but of so richly humorous a character that , despite its indulgence in a per - sonality that might give offense , supposing it to be a true story , he decided to publish , first however changing both personal and geograph - ical names for the sake of greater safety .

		To his astonishment and chagrin , after publication there came a letter to the publishers couched in the most abusive and threatening language , and vowing that the house of
Harper	PERSON	should be made to pay dearly for its unauthorized printing of the incident in question .

		It was afterward ascertained that the contributor of the anecdote had himself substituted fictitious for real names , and Dr. Prime , with too great precaution , had inadvertently , and by something little short of a miracle , changed the fictitious names back to the real ones .

		But this is a digression .

		The charm of the unknown will continue , as long as anonymous and pseudonymous literature is written , to ap - peal more or less potently to the reader ; while the sense of having created a mystery , of hav - ing erected a more or less impenetrable screen between himself and his public , will tickle the author 's fancy .

		Of course in many depart - ments of authorship the writer 's real name ought to appear and in most instances will ap - pear .

		But to the airy creation of a poet 's or a romancer 's or a humorist 's fancy it will often seem more appropriate to assign a fictitious authorship , or to leave the authorship entirely a matter of conjecture .

		GAS
UAL	ORGANIZATION	COMMENT .

		THE PUERILITIES OF GENIUS reach their limit in the silly devices by which , as the Baconians would have us believe , the real authorship of the Shake - speare plays is half concealed and half revealed in the wording of certain passages , in the arrangement of the lines as printed in the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	, and even in the minutest details of typography sometimes so minute as to require a microscope for detection .

		That untiring advocate of the Baconian cause , Sir
Edwin Durning	PERSON	-
Lawrence	PERSON	, ingenious author of ''
Bacon	PERSON	is Shakespeare , '' has followed up his larger work -LRB- which did not quite convert the world to his faith -RRB- with an entertaining pamphlet , `` The Shake - speare Myth , '' wherein if any remaining doubters fail to find that which shall forever remove their lingering hesitations , they are certainly beyond praying for and deserve no further attention at the hands of Sir
Edwin	PERSON	.

		In speaking of the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	, the writer says , among other memorable things : `` I must also inform my readers that every page is divided into two columns , and it is abso - lutely certain that the author himself so arranged these that he knew in what column and in what line in such column every word would appear in the printed page . ''

		Thus it was by
Bacon	PERSON	's express design that in the opening scene of `` The Tempest '' there was a certain arrangement of lines that gave , by putting together three initial letters and reading them upward and also using the first word of one of these lines , `` hang 'd hog , '' which , as mistress Quickly has reminded us in `` The Merry Wives of
Windsor	LOCATION	, '' is Latin for bacon .

		Elsewhere in the Folio , Sir
Edwin	PERSON	discovers '' hang sow , '' which he gravely assures us `` is just as much Bacon as Hang hog . ''

		And again , in `` Antony and Cleopatra '' three words -LRB-
Pompey	LOCATION	, in , and got -RRB- are found in such a position as obviously to stand for pig , `` which is what we were looking for , '' triumphantly declares Sir
Edwin Burning-Lawrence	PERSON	.

		Coming to graver issues , he informs us that '' all writers are agreed that our language of to-day is founded upon the English translation of the Bible and upon the Plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Every word of each of these was undoubtedly written by , or under the direction of ,
Francis Bacon	PERSON	. ''

		So industrious , inventive , and en - tertaining a writer as Sir
Edwin Durning-Lawrence	PERSON	deserves our gratitude for the amusement he fur - nishes , and our admiration for his zeal and perse - verance in the face of a doubting and even derisive public ; but if the author of `` Hamlet '' and `` Othello '' was really capable of all the puerilities he so labor - iously brings to our attention , we prefer , for our own enjoyment of the plays and poems , to remain erroneously persuaded of their Shakespearean origin .

		INSPIRATIONAL TOXINS , such as alcohol , opium , hashish , and tobacco , have long been known to and more or less used by literary and other creative artists ; but probably few if any of these men of 90 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, genius have been inclined to regard as aids to in - spiration those natural toxins of the body that are generated by tuberculosis , asthma , gout , and other diseases .

		Nevertheless , when one recalls the bril - liance and the creative energy that have charac - terized many a consumptive writer
Stevenson	PERSON	and
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	, for instance the asthma that accompanied
Macaulay	ORGANIZATION	's prodigious accomplishment as reader and writer , and that was powerless to impair the masterly statesmanship of
William the Third	ORGANIZATION	, and the gout that seemed but to steady and strengthen the purpose of
Gibbon	PERSON	in his formidable undertaking , and when one looks back upon innumerable other instances of signal achievement , in letters and in other walks of life , in the face of pronounced physical disability , one may well feel tempted to believe with Dr.
Charles B. Reed	PERSON	, whose thoughtful and interesting article on `` Toxemia as a Stimulus in Literature '' has been much discussed , that toxins , both natural and arti - ficial , do play an important part in the work of the world , especially in the work done by men and women of genius .

		One might even go so far as to query whether anything of brilliance and genuine originality and power is to be found in the absence of some inspirational toxin .

		On the other hand , however , there are instances in plenty of genius unaccompanied by any apparent poisoning or intox - icating affection
Scott	PERSON	and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, for example .

		But no one knows exactly what help they received from artificial toxins , or what natural toxins may have been generated in their systems .

		Perhaps we shall know more about these things some day , and it may be that inspirational toxins , of specific kinds , will be injected in infancy to produce poets , novel - ists , musicians , sculptors , and so on , much as among the honey bees the queen is produced by certain methods of treatment applied in the earliest stages of the insect 's formation .

		THE APPRAISAL OF CONTEMPORARY GREATNESS , whether in literature or in other departments of worthy achievement , is a difficult and more or less invidious task .

		Nevertheless the
Modern Historic Records Association	ORGANIZATION	, in undertaking to collect auto - graphic utterances on parchment '' from men and women of genius throughout the world , '' has asked its secretary , Mr.
W. T. Lamed	PERSON	, to prepare '' a list of names that shall include all living men and women whose reputations are likely to endure , '' as Mr.
Lamed	PERSON	expresses it in a letter to the
New York	LOCATION	`` Sun '' in which he asks for help in his difficult task .

		A tentative list of about two hundred names is submitted by him , naturally `` with considerable diffidence , '' and of course it is impossible to glance over the list without noting many surprising omis - sions and almost as many astonishing inclusions .

		It could not be otherwise .

		For example , though the head of the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	is on the list , the name of
Abdul Baha	PERSON	, the Persian religious reformer whose followers already are counted by the millions , in re - sponse to whose teachings a third of the population of
Persia	LOCATION	has renounced Mohammedanism for Baha - ism , and whose disciples are found all over the world , including this country , which he has recently visited , does not appear ; and while Colonel
Henry Watter	PERSON	- son is included , Mr.
Whitelaw Reid	PERSON	is excluded ; and it seems strange to find the name of Mr.
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	unaccompanied by that other with which we are wont to see it linked .

		In general the perspective is emphatically that of the
Occidental	ORGANIZATION	rather than of the Oriental .


Japan	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
India	LOCATION	, and all the rest of the
Far East	LOCATION	, are ignored ; while contrariwise
America	LOCATION	looms large and
Europe	LOCATION	-LRB- or at least western
Europe	LOCATION	-RRB- suffers no very serious eclipse .

		It is a pleasant enough diversion that the
M. H. R. Association	ORGANIZATION	is engaged in , and one wishes it every success ; but it ought not , perhaps , to be viewed with quite the seriousness that Mr.
Larned	PERSON	's letter assumes .

		However , we are glad to quote in conclu - sion this passage from his letter : `` The attempts to obtain these inscriptions , which are meant to embody a brief but permanent expression of each man and woman 's preeminent gift or attainment , is meeting with some interesting responses .

		The opinion ex - pressed by Ambassador
Bryce	PERSON	that the collection we are making ` will be of the greatest interest in years to come ' seems to be shared more especially by emi - nent men in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		For example , Sir
William Ramsay	PERSON	has sent us a striking epitome of his career as a scientist ; Dr.
Alfred Russel Wallace	PERSON	a resound - ing paragraph from one of his most eloquent essays ; Mr.
Maeterlinck	PERSON	a passage from his ` La Vie des Abeilles ' ; Sir
Arthur Wing Pinero	PERSON	and Mr.
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	some characteristic thoughts on dra - matic workmanship . ''

		Any helpful suggestion , or other communication , on parchment or more perish - able paper , that the reader of this may feel moved to send to Mr.
Lamed	PERSON	, will reach him , we doubt not , if addressed to the
Modern Historic Records Asso	ORGANIZATION	- ciation , 14
Gramercy Park	LOCATION	,
New York City	LOCATION	.

		THE PENSIONING OF WORN-OUT LIBRARIANS has certainly as much to be said in its favor as the pensioning of retired college professors and other teachers .

		It is indeed cause for surprise that our millionaire benefactor of public libraries should have established a professors ' pension fund but taken no step to make comfortable the declining years of those who serve the needs of the great book-reading and book-borrowing public , and preside over , or otherwise give their best years to , the institutions of that class to which he himself has so generously contributed .

		As a matter of fact , the library worker is even less liberally paid for his toil than the teacher , his term of daily service is longer , and his vacations are very much shorter .

		The trustees of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	urge the necessity of some adequate pension system for its employees .

		They well say , in their latest Report : `` A large part of library service is specialized work .

		It is very desirable that persons who enter the library profession should remain in it , and after they have been in this profession long enough to be of the best service to it they are prac -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 91 tically unfitted for any other work .

		The margin between the salaries which can be paid them within the library appropriation and their necessary ex - penses for reasonable and decent living is very small .

		... The necessary result of this condition is that persons are retained in the library service after they cease to be able to do the best work , because they can not be retired from it without becoming objects of charity or requiring the assistance of others for their support .

		The public service suffers from this because the worn-out employee can not do as good work as ought to be done .

		The expense of the pub - lic service is also increased because it is necessary to have more employees if a portion of them are unable to do the best work .

		Merited promotion is also often delayed , and the tendency is to weaken the library service where it should be strengthened .

		A worn-out tool is the most expensive tool for use , whether it be a combination of merely material things like wood and metal , or a living human being . ''

		And so on .

		Legislation to meet the exigencies of the case is asked for ; but legislative machinery is slow , and legislative grants for worthy causes are notably small and tardy .

		Here is a chance for some philan - thropic multi-millionaire to immortalize his name by establishing a great national Librarians ' Retirement Pension Fund .

		... THE ARTISTIC ATTITUDE TOWARD LITERATURE , as distinguished from the scientific or coldly critical at - titude , is very much what the artistic or sympathetic attitude toward life and mankind is as distinguished from the rigidly dogmatic or moralistic attitude .

		This is rather clumsily and inadequately expressed , but perhaps a few illustrations and analogies may make the meaning clearer .

		We have all had experi - ence of the irritating self-righteousness of those who pride themselves on making their conduct square with a hard-and-fast rule , without regard to the claims or the feelings of those about them .

		Their morality is static , not dynamic .

		They are moral pedants and mental sluggards .

		They have classified and labelled all the objects of their little world once and forever , with scientific precision .

		In one 's bear - ing toward literature , and toward art in general , it is not uncommon to fall into the scientific rather than the artistic way of looking at things .

		One too easily forgets that reality is always dying and being re - created .

		Even the very words with which truth is expressed , or faintly adumbrated , are continually suffering decay and undergoing revivification .

		The literary artist , the merest framer of verbal para - doxes , helps to keep the pulse of life in our language and to save us from the indolent use of phrases chunks of sound , as
Stevenson	PERSON	has called them to avoid the trouble of original and sympathetic thought .

		The poet is the consummate literary artist ; his mind is cleared of cant , and he faces every new situation with fresh receptivity .

		Pater and others have warned us that what is done from habit is likely to be done mechanically and meaninglessly ; and habits of speech , still more habits of thinking , are spiritual death .

		This and other points that might well be touched upon here are more fully treated by Mr.
E. F. Carritt	PERSON	in the current `` Hibbert Journal , '' in an article entitled `` The Artistic Attitude in Con - duct , '' which closes with Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's acute re - marks , preserved by
Fanny Burney	ORGANIZATION	, on the subject of literary criticism : `` There are three distinct kinds of judges : the first are those who know no rules but pronounce entirely from their natural taste and feel - ings ; the second are those who know and judge by rules ; and the third are those who know but are above the rules .

		These last are those you should wish to satisfy .

		Next to them rate the natural judges ; but ever despise those opinions that are formed by the rules . ''

		... LIBRARY PLANNING FROM THE INSIDE , or from the experienced librarian 's standpoint , rather than from the outside that is , from the ambitious and splendor-loving architect 's point of view is one of the many topics intelligently and fully treated by Mr.
Soule	PERSON	in his manual on library-building , already noticed -LRB- too briefly -RRB- by us .

		`` The exterior should not even be considered , '' he maintains , '' until the interior has been entirely mapped out . ''

		This advice will be found easier to follow than the old rule for the manufacture of cannon first make your hole , then cast the metal around it ; and the uniting of utility with ornament need not necessarily be at the expense of the latter .

		Indeed , some of the least pleasing library buildings , to those who fail to find any satisfying aesthetic - effect where there is unfit - ness of structure , are the very ones that have been designed from the outside with a view to external effect .

		Therefore let the architect take counsel at every step with the trained librarian .

		But it is quite true , nevertheless , as Mrs.
Elmendorff	PERSON	took occasion to point out at one of the annual library conferences , that `` a very good librarian may yet have no great fitness for the task of planning a building , '' and hence some other than the local librarian may best be called upon to advise with the architect .

		Mr.
Soule	PERSON	utters a warning '' not to take your local librarian at his own valuation .

		He is most likely to assume the function of an expert in building when he is least fitted .

		The really ex - perienced librarian is apt to be modest and to ask assistance , in the belief that ` two heads are better than one . ' ''

		But let not the `` local librarian '' whose eye may chance to rest on this paragraph take umbrage .

		There are local librarians and local librarians .

		In fact , when you come to think of it , how many librarians are there of any other sort ?

		A LIBRARY BURGLARY EXTRAORDINARY Was re - ported , under conspicuous scare-lines -LRB- `` 45,000 Vol - umes Missing from Library '' -RRB- , in a
Los Angeles	LOCATION	newspaper recently .

		In substance , the whole aston - ishing affair , as printed whether as a deliberate hoax , or a misprint , or a piece of careless reporting , or a fact having some basis of truth reduces itself to this , in the language of the journal itself : `` There were 190,000 books in the library three years ago , according to an inventory taken then .

		There were 92 THE DIAJL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, but 145,000 when the count was completed yester - day . ''

		And yet this disappearance of forty-five thou - sand volumes is not attributed to deliberate theft , but rather to mere '' carelessness of public property , ... in the opinion of Mr.
Perry	PERSON	, '' the librarian ; and the good citizens are requested to look through their bookshelves and see whether any forgotten library books are lurking there .

		No mention is made of the three years ' accessions of new books , as if one were to understand that the collection had been undergoing steady and rapid depletion with no re - plenishing whatever which is much too marvel - lous , especially for the swiftly growing city of
Los Angeles	LOCATION	, to gain credence .

		To the modern vigilant librarian , an annual loss of even a score of volumes is a scandal and a disgrace ; but fifteen thousand a year for three successive years ! ''

		Obstupui , steteruntque comae , et vox faucibus hcesit . ''

		THE FAME OF STATIONERS ' HALL IN
LONDON	LOCATION	, where for more than three hundred years registry has been made of books claiming copyright protec - tion , will long survive the cessation of that custom which marks the going into effect , this
summer	DATE	, of the new English copyright law .

		`` Entered at
Stationers	ORGANIZATION	' Hall '' is a familiar legend that we shall fail to find in the printed works of the future , publication under the terms of the statute sufficing henceforth for the publisher 's protection against piracy .

		The invaluable register of English books , from Elizabethan times to our own , will , it is rea - sonable to hope , be transferred now to the manu - script room of the British Museum , where it would be an object of interest to all students of English literature and could be more conveniently consulted than at present .

		The
Stationers	ORGANIZATION	' Company itself , which has a curiously interesting history , and for a long time enjoyed a monopoly in the publication of almanacs in addition to its other rights and digni - ties , may now find itself left with nothing to justify its existence unless it enters the regular publishing field , which might not be unfitting in view of its position in the neighborhood of
Paternoster Row	ORGANIZATION	,
Amen Corner	ORGANIZATION	, and
Ave Maria Lane	PERSON	, names that carry with them ancient associations of a more or less bookish and book-publishing nature .

		* THE CLEANNESS OF AMERICAN FICTION as COm - pared with English is asserted by a high Canadian authority , Dr.
George H. Locke	PERSON	, librarian of the
Toronto Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		In an address at the late annnal meeting of the
Ontario Library Association	ORGANIZATION	, Dr.
Locke	PERSON	said : `` There is one thing I have to say , and I am sorry to say it , and that is that you can trust American fiction to be clean rather than En - glish fiction .

		There is no necessity to demonstrate except to step into my office and see the list of En - glish fiction that is nasty , unnecessarily nasty .

		It is hard to have to say that .

		Certain publishers you can rely on implicitly .

		In regard to your fiction , when you find a book is a good book buy another copy of it .

		Restrict your range , but be careful that the books you have are good books , books that are worth while . ''

		Some practical advice to librarians on the purchase of new books is worth quoting also : `` Do n't order fiction until the work has been out long enough to have adequate reviews of it .

		It is not wise to trust the ordinary reviews , or excerpts -LSB- of those reviews -RSB- published by the ordinary pub - lishers .

		You can take part of a recommendation and make a man out of anything from an angel down . ''

		ONE OF THE MAKERS OF
MASSACHUSETTS	LOCATION	.

		* In the list of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	colonial govern - ors , many of whom were able and forceful men and interesting characters , there is none that appeals more strongly to the imagination or ex - cites a greater admiration than the lawyer-soldier who came over from
England	LOCATION	in
1731	DATE	to throw in his lot with the young colony , who three years later became the `` King 's only Advocate - General in
America	LOCATION	, '' was appointed Governor in
1741	DATE	, wrested the fortress of
Louisburg	LOCATION	from the French in
1745	DATE	, reestablished the finances of his colony by redeeming its paper money in En - glish coin in
1749	DATE	, thus giving
Massachusetts	LOCATION	an enviable reputation as `` the hard-money col - ony , '' exerted himself strenuously in the face of insurmountable obstacles for the entire expulsion of the French from
Canada	LOCATION	, only relinquished the post he had so creditably held when the home government recalled him in
1756	DATE	, and finally returned to die in the land of his adop - tion fifteen years later .

		This eminently successful man of action who , by the way , was helped in his rise to dis - tinction by a clever and appreciative wife has not unnaturally made romantic appeal to the
Colonial Dames of America	ORGANIZATION	, and under their auspices his correspondence , to the extent at least of two substantial volumes , has been pre - pared for publication by Dr.
Charles Henry Lincoln	PERSON	, whose previous studies in our Revolu - tionary and pre-Revolutionary history give as - surance of fitness for the task .

		duction , frequent footnotes , and a fourteen-page index , are added .

		What is most striking in a general survey of
Shirley	PERSON	's life is the generous breadth , the all - roundness , so to speak , the open-mindedness and many-sidedness , of the man .

		Above all , he seems to have preserved his name untarnished amid all the inevitable jealousies and contentions inseparable from high public office .

		His sense of honor appears in his refusal , in
1733	DATE	, of the post of Judge of Admiralty , an office that he felt he could not accept because its incumbency de - pended on the good will of the local legislative assembly , and he therefore feared he could not impartially maintain the rights of the Crown . ''

		So that , '' he says in his letter of declination to the
Duke of Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	, `` to have accepted this post in it 's present situation , would have reduc 'd me to the hard Choice of sacrificing the Court to a mean popularity , or making a sacrifice of myself in the defence of it ; the first neither hon - ourable nor honest , and the last not prudent . ''

		The letters selected for publication cover the period from
1731	DATE	to
1760	DATE	, and are written to and from the
Duke of Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	, the
Lords of Trade	ORGANIZATION	, the
General Court	ORGANIZATION	of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, Sir
William Pepperrell	PERSON	, Governor
William Greene	PERSON	of
Rhode Island	LOCATION	, Sir
William Johnson	PERSON	, and many others .

		There are also letters between Mrs.
Shirley	PERSON	and the
Duke of Newcastle	ORGANIZATION	in reference to the advancement of
Shirley	PERSON	's fortunes in the administration of the colony .

		Under date of
August 23 , 1741	DATE	, we find a letter of acknowl - edgment from the newly appointed Governor to the English minister whose influence with the Crown had secured him the post .

		After express - ing his sense of obligation to
Newcastle	LOCATION	, the writer continues in a strain that gives some idea of the difficulties and vexations he had to en - counter in accepting the proffered position .

		In one sentence of portentous length , and in the epistolary style of his time ,
Shirley	PERSON	thus depicts the situation : '' I am sensible , My
Lord Duke	PERSON	, that I am now ent - ring upon the Governmt of a province , where Col.
Shute	PERSON	quitted the Chair , & Mr.
Burnett	PERSON	broke his heart thro the Temper and Opposition of the people ; & Mr.
Belcher	PERSON	in the midst of his Countrymen fail 'd of carry - ing any one of those points for the Crown , wch might have been expected from him ; and that I enter upon it at a time , when an empty
Treasury	ORGANIZATION	, an Aversion in the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	to supply it conformably to his Majy 's last Instructions ; a weak and Ruinous Con - dition of their Fortifications , a bad Spirit rais 'd through - out the Country by the
Land Bank Scheme	ORGANIZATION	, by means of it 's being conniv 'd at here in it 's first rise , remaining uncheck 'd so long , that the imprudt manner of endeav - ouring to check it here afterwards by those who were 94 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, at the same time endeavouring to support & countenance it at home thro Mr.
Partridge	PERSON	, only inflamed it ; & Mr.
Belcher	PERSON	's constant acceptance from year to year of a Diminished Salary , after he had obtained leave to take it without insisting upon his Majesty 's Instruction on that head , the value of wch is by that means sunk from abt

		wch had been allow 'd by the
Genl Court	ORGANIZATION	to

		wch seems to have been done by him with some particular View of his own , to secure his station by the smallness of his Salary ; are what make up the present Scene of Affairs in the pro- vince , whereupon the
House of Representatives	ORGANIZATION	tell me in their Address , that they are concern 'd my Accession to the Chair should be attended with such Difficulties . ''

		The next event of supreme importance touched upon in the letters is the capture of
Louisburg	LOCATION	, a difficult military operation in which little aid was received or indeed ex - pected from the mother country , and which owed its success chiefly to
Shirley	PERSON	's ability in arousing the martial enthusiasm of New En - gland , in adjusting the differences between Admiral Sir
Peter Warren	PERSON	and Sir
William Pepperrell	PERSON	, and in conceiving and causing to be executed a bold and brilliant plan of attack .

		`` Probably every prudent strategist would have deemed the scheme foolhardy , '' says Mr.
J. A. Doyle	PERSON	in his sketch of
Shirley	PERSON	's life ; and
Shirley	PERSON	himself allows his sense of the splendid success achieved in the face of formidable obstacles to appear underneath the modesty and restraint of his language in communicating the event to the
Lords of Trade	ORGANIZATION	.

		He says , in concluding his brief account of the action : '' Upon the whole , I hope when it is considered that 3,600 raw
New England Troops	ORGANIZATION	, supported by
His Majesty	ORGANIZATION	's Ships to the seaward , have reduc 'd one of the French King 's strongest and most important
Fort	LOCATION	- resses , having in it a Garrison of near 600 regular Troops , and about 1400 Effective Men under Arms besides , with the Loss of not quite 100 men on our side , and killing near the same number of the Enemy within the Walls during the Siege -LRB- many of them with their Small Arms -RRB- I may be permitted to say in Justice to His Majesty 's
New England	LOCATION	Subjects that their be - haviour has done no dishonour to his Arms . ''

		In far more self - applausive vein , knowing the temper of those he is addressing , does Gov - ernor
Shirley	PERSON	proclaim to the
Penobscot	LOCATION	and
Norridgewock Indians	LOCATION	the signal victory of the English and colonial forces over the perfidious French , and the expectations entertained as to the future policy of the red men .

		He thus con - cludes : `` This Intelligence we Send you that you may not be deluded by the French or
St. Johns & Nova Scotia Indians	ORGANIZATION	that may Sollicit you to break your Friendship with us to your own ruin .

		We have been your faithful Friends , and your Traffick with us has been much more for your Advantage than your Trade with the French and you may still live easy with us , & free from the distress & danger of War if you please but if not , & you will let the French & the Indians in their Interest deceive & Seduce you & you will perfidiously break your Solemn League with us , we doubt not but the Great God who is the Avenger of all such Wickedness and has so remarkably punished our Treacherous Enemys the French will stand by us & give us Success for the punishing your perfidiousness , but if you are willing to Enjoy the Benefits of peace with us , we Shall Expect that you will Send two or three of your chief Captains to Confirm the Friendship between Us , and if any of your people stand in fear of the French and therefore want protection for themselves and their Familys and will come to
Boston	LOCATION	, we will take care of them , I Expect that you Send me your answer without delay . ''

		After General
Braddock	PERSON	's untimely end , the command of all the British forces in
America	LOCATION	devolved upon
Shirley	PERSON	, who just then was per - sonally engaged in leading the unsuccessful expedition against
Fort Niagara	LOCATION	.

		He seems to have had friction in his relations with the masterful Sir
William Johnson	PERSON	, and as even a jaundiced view of our hero may help to a better knowledge of his character , let us quote a few lines , here and there , from
Johnson	PERSON	's indignant appeal to the Lords of Trade . ''

		Govr .

		Shirleys conduct not only shook the system of Indian affairs , gave me fresh vexation and perplexity , but occasioned considerable and additional Expenses which would otherwise have been saved ; ... From Govr .


Shirley	PERSON	's late Behaviour and his Letters to me I am under no doubt that he is become my inveterate enemy and that the whole weight of his Powers and abilities will be exerted to blast if he can my Character here and here only am I anxious .

		Gross Falsehoods -LRB- such as he has already asserted in his letters to me , -RRB- artful misrepresentations , Deliberate malice , Resent - ment worked up by People in his confidence , whose Interest , nay whose very livelihood depends upon their inflaming him these my Lords are circumstances which I own disturb me ... From Govr .

		Shirley 's ill grounded resentment , from the imperious stile he writes to me since Genl .


Braddock	PERSON	's death , from his threatning intimations and his temper , I am confirmed in this lesson , that a subordinate power here with regard to Indian Affairs ... will be incompatible with my abilities and inclinations to conduct them . ''

		Evidently there was not room on the same con - tinent for both
Shirley	PERSON	and
Johnson	PERSON	, although
Shirley	PERSON	's relations with other prominent men and high officials in the colonies were remark - ably harmonious .

		His requests for advice from
Franklin	PERSON	and the latter 's high opinion of him help to establish his reputation as a wise and just administrator .

		The circumstances of his recall and his attitude toward both his successor and the home government also go far to confirm our favorable opinion of him as one who con - trolled his passions and nursed no ignoble resent -

		THE DIAL 95 merits .

		His subsequent governorship of the
Bahamas	LOCATION	, and his return to
Massachusetts	LOCATION	to pass the last year of his life in the then rural seclusion of
Roxbury	LOCATION	, are matters not touched upon in Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's volumes , except that one short letter from the
Bahamas	LOCATION	is printed at the very end , and brief mention of
Shirley	PERSON	's last years is made in the Introduction .

		That portion of the public whom the
Colonial Dames	ORGANIZATION	and Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	seek to interest in this conspicuously able and energetic colonial gov - ernor will not be disappointed in the manner his letters have been presented for their enter - tainment and instruction ; and the volumes will be the more welcome since , apart from his own correspondence , no extended account of
Shirley	PERSON	's life and public services is to be found in print .

		The preparation of a formal biography has been greatly facilitated by Mr.
Lincoln	PERSON	's labors .

CANADA	LOCATION	'S REMOTE FRONTIERS .

Canada	LOCATION	; from the valley of the Yukon to
Cape Chidley	LOCATION	at the entrance to
Hudson Straits	LOCATION	.

		Though they vary greatly in everything else that goes to make up the real value of a book , they all possess at least the merit of being first-hand narratives .

		Mr.
Tollemache	PERSON	's book describes his hunting and trapping experiences on the upper waters of the Yukon ; Sir
John Rogers	PERSON	tells us of his sporting adventures on
Vancouver Island	LOCATION	and Newfound - land ; Mr.

Hutton	PERSON	reveals the life of a doctor among the

		Taken as contribu - tions to literature , the first may be described as poor ; the second as mediocre ; the third as good ; and the last as a book in a thousand .

		All four writers have chosen fields that had been already visited and described by others , but the results are vastly different .

		something new , and worth while , to the sum of human knowledge .

		Mr.
Tollemache	PERSON	admits that many books on the Yukon had appeared previous to his own , and that the subject had become somewhat hackneyed ; but he urges , modestly enough , that he had become acquainted with incidents and methods of life in that remote region which he had not seen printed in other volumes .

		His narrative hardly bears out the promise .

		It is for the most part an account of trapping adven - tures , fur-trading and travelling on the
Pelly	LOCATION	,
McMillan	PERSON	, and other upper waters of the Yukon , which have been at least as well described by other travellers .

		His account of the Klondyke boom , the mining camps , the dance-halls in
Dawson	LOCATION	, and other features of
Yukon	ORGANIZATION	life a few years ago , has of course been covered by a score of earlier writers .

		Finally , when he deals with facts outside his own particular line of vision , Mr.
Tollemache	PERSON	is all at sea .

		He expresses amazement at the sale of
Alaska	LOCATION	by
Russia	LOCATION	for `` such an absurdly small figure , '' evidently alto - gether ignorant of the history of that interest - ing transaction .

		He tells us that `` the term ' capitalist ' is a common denomination in
Canada	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	, and may include anyone possessing
$ 100	MONEY	or more in ready cash . ''

		Fi - nally , he affords the interesting bit of informa - tion that ``
Quebec	LOCATION	, in
Eastern Canada	LOCATION	, forms the principal resort of the French Canadians . ''

		`` Sport in
Vancouver	LOCATION	and
Newfoundland	LOCATION	'' is essentially the narrative of an enthusiastic fisher - man .

		To anyone interested in sporting adven - tures in out-of-the-way corners of the earth , Sir
John Rogers	PERSON	's book can not prove otherwise than entertaining .

		He is not only a keen sportsman , with all the true sportsman 's relish for the de - tails of fishing-tackle , weather conditions , camp equipment , and weight of fish , but he has also a thorough appreciation of scenery .

		This passage , written after an unsuccessful day with the sal - mon , is a good example of his descriptive style . ''

		The row home that evening compensated for every - thing .

		The sun was setting behind the snow-covered peaks of the
Vancouver Mountains	LOCATION	, bare and cold below the snow-line , but gradually clothed with foliage down the slopes until the dense pine forest of the plain be - tween the mountains and the sea was reached , from which the evening mists were beginning to rise .

		In the foreground , the sea , like molten glass , reflected the exquisite colouring of the northern sunset , its surface broken by the eddies of the making tide , or the occa - sional splash of a leaping salmon .

		Across the straits on the
Mainland	ORGANIZATION	, the tops of the great mountains clothed with eternal snow were lit up a rose-pink by the rays of the setting sun .

		I have seldom seen a more beautiful scene , or one which gave such a deep sense of peace . ''

		96 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, `` It has been said by someone , '' says Mr.
William Brooks Cabot	PERSON	, `` that all the places now unexplored were so miserably bad that no one would care to have anything to do with them . ''

		Mr.
Cabot	PERSON	found the caribou country of northeastern Labrador not a bad region to wander in , and the natives well worth visiting .

		These two motives the call of the wilderness , and especially the unexplored wilderness , and the fascinating study of a race still in almost its primitive state drew Mr.
Cabot	PERSON	to Labrador year after year between
1904	DATE	and
1910	DATE	, and furnished the very interesting material which he has embodied in his book .

		He has not only given us a great deal of really valuable infor - mation as to the geography of a little-known region , but he has brought together much that was new as to the character and customs of the Indians of Labrador , '' a little group of a race high in personality , yet living substantially in the pre-Columbian age of the continent , '' and he has added materially to what was known of the fauna of that region .

		Incidentally , he speaks feelingly and eloquently of the numbers , enterprise , and penetrating qualities of the Labrador mosquito .

		But perhaps more than all else he is filled with the lure , the charm of wild places , and he is able to bring much of it home to his readers .

		In taking leave of the bleak , inhospitable land , which nevertheless he had found so full of interest and fascination , he says : '' It was a time of reckoning for me , the turning over of what had been in my Labrador years the stringing of beads that should always a little shine .

		Some of these had seemed clouded in the gathering , but in the reverie of those final days they were lighted all .

		Though never the world again were young , there had been days .

		Coast and inland inland and coast .

		The early hard days on the mainland , the hills and valleys alone , the calm of the noble bays ; their silence , broken only by the rise of wings ; Tuh-pungiuk and Un ` sekat and Opetik ; and the strong opposing sea .

		The rolling barrens , the hills of the height of land .

		The tall , grave people there , the smiling strong ones here ; the aurora and the bergs and the innumerable insect foe .

		Long days and twilight nights , dark nights and stormy days ; the sunshine on the sea and the white-backed eiders ' charge .

		So my string was strung .

		Always for me now would return the gray barrens , stretching far and on , always the lakes and the lodge-smokes on their shores .

		Always would the people watch the deer , always stand silent at the shore , as friends would wave as they go ; the land be ever theirs .

		The light that has been never quite fails the wilderness traveller ; his feet may remain afar , but his mind returns ' Where the caribou are standing : On the gilded hills of morning , Where the white moss meets the footstep And the way is long before . ' ''

		Dr.
Hutton	PERSON	's book , '' Among the Eskimos of Labrador , '' is a rare interpretation of a most interesting type of mankind the Eskimo of the Moravian Missions .

		One feels instinct - ively , without knowing anything more of him than is revealed in his book , that Dr.
Hutton	PERSON	is very much such a man as Dr.
Grenfell	PERSON	strong , manly , sympathetic , gifted with plenty of common-sense , with the elusive quality that wins confidence everywhere , and with that salt that adds a savor to every character , redeeming the mean or poor , enriching the good , human - izing the great the saving gift of humor .

		That he can also write a book that is worth while , we now have evidence .

		He has indeed given us something that will live when thou - sands of contemporary books have been for - gotten .

		And this is not because his book has any marked literary charm , or elaborates any particular theory of human conduct ; but rather because it is a true , simple , and direct narrative of the life of a good and strong man , and of the child-like people to whom he ministered .

		Dr.
Hutton	PERSON	has shown us the inner life of the Eskimo , and his real personality the life and personality which are hidden from the casual vis - itor to the Labrador ; he has shown us his home , his family , the things that are vital to him , his outlook upon his own small world and the mys - terious beyond ; and he has succeeded in making the Eskimo of
Hebron	LOCATION	and
Nain	LOCATION	and
Raman	PERSON	and Okak an altogether likable personality .

		Dr.
Hutton	PERSON	's book is one that lends itself peculiarly to quotation .

		In fact , it is in this respect embarrassing to the reviewer .

		One finds so much that would bear repeating , that it is difficult to pick and choose .

		The building of the hospital was a great event at Okak , and brought a curious medley of patients .

		Says Dr.
Hutton	PERSON	: '' I remember how old
Rebekah	PERSON	came one day , nurs - ing a wounded hand .

		She is one of the stateliest of the village grandmothers , an active old woman of sixty-five , with her teeth nearly worn to the gums ; but , old as she is , she is well able to take an oar in a boat or a pair , for the matter of that and thinks nothing of trudging to and from the woods , five miles away , to fetch broken branches to replenish her stove .

		With proper Eskimo dignity she came in and sat down , and composed herself to tell her tale ; and all the while she was hugging her left hand , swathed in a red bandanna handkerchief . '' '

		I was making boots just now , ' she said , ` and the leather-knife slipped and cut my thumb .

		Ai-ai , it bled very much , and it was nearly cut off ; but I had my boot-needle threaded with isalo -LRB- reindeer-sinew -RRB- , and I sewed my thumb with that , so that it no longer bleeds ; and now I have come to let you bind it up . '

		And there and then the old woman unwrapped her handker -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 97 chief and displayed her hand , with a long wound neatly sewed up , stitch upon stitch , in proper bootmaker 's style . ''

		This serves to illustrate the native indifference to pain ; and even in the worst of sufferings their attitude is the same .

		I have seen them , men and women , in dingy little huts and in leaky calico tents , lying on rough beds of moss and reindeer skins , silent and uncomplain - ing , though their faces were blanched and the beads of perspiration stood out under the strain of physical suf - fering .

		The very thought calls forth one 's sympathy ; and the pictures that crowd before me as I write pic - tures of people toiling up the steps of the new hospital , with the marks of pain on their faces and a dumb and eager hopefulness shining in their eyes has left an impression on my mind that time will never efface .

		A strangely attractive folk : with children 's fears and child - hood 's quaint ideas , and childhood 's whims and fancies and unreasoning demands , but with a manly bravery in the face of pain or danger , and a manly mastery of the terrible rigours of their daily work , that call for admir - ation . ''

		On another occasion , Dr.
Hutton	PERSON	was in
Nain	LOCATION	, and an urgent message came from Okak that a boy had been brought in to the hospital with a compound fracture .

		It was important to go at once , but the dogs were out of condition , and a bad storm was coming up .

		The old Eskimo schoolmaster urged him not to attempt the journey .

		`` You will all be lost , '' he said . ''

		His concern was real , so I called my drivers .

		` What do you say ? '

		I asked them .

		` Are you willing to go ? ' '' '

		Illale ' -LRB- of course -RRB- , they said . '

		Ready , ' said I , ' go ahead . '

		The dogs slowly raised themselves on their legs , and whined as they trotted along the bumpy path toward the sea-ice ; and the heavy wrack of the north - ern storm came bowling along to meet us .

		< Aksuse ! '

		shouted the people , ' be strong ' ; and we waved our hands and shouted back .

		Then they began to sing . ''

		There is a lump in my throat and a mist in my eyes even now , when I think of that scene : just a crowd of rough Eskimos , people whose grandfathers had been heathen and wild , singing a hymn of ` God-speed as we set out on our dangerous errand . '' '

		Takkotigelfirminiptingnut Gude illagilisetSk , ' they sang , and the charmingly balanced harmony came fainter and ever fainter as the wind began to sigh about us and the snow to beat on our faces . '

		God be with you till we meet again , ' - - and we settled confidently to our task . ''

		It is one of many interesting points brought out in Dr.
Hutton	PERSON	's narrative , that the Eskimos , although they have no native music , no tradi - tional tunes , no folk-songs of their own , have a natural taste for music , with good voices and an instinctive feeling for harmony .

		Jerry the native Okak organist , is described as a really clever musician , with a remarkable command of several instruments besides his organ ; while
Nathaniel	PERSON	, the
Nain	LOCATION	schoolmaster , one of the most cultured of the Eskimos , has composed an anthem in four parts , which was sung by the Eskimo choir .

		Dr.
Hutton	PERSON	concludes : '' I lay my pen aside with my mind still full of the memories that are so vivid to me .

		Brown , smiling faces pass before me ; familiar names sound in my ears ; bright eyes look into mine ; musical voices sing outside my window ; gruff shouts echo as the boys come sliding down the hill ;
Jerry	PERSON	and his bandsmen march along , waking the village with their trumpet notes ; the poor girl on the bed of reindeer skins whispers her '
Nako	PERSON	- mek ' -LRB- how thankful -RRB- ; the crowd on the slope of the frozen beach sings me off into the storm ; the voice of little
Johannes	PERSON	calls aboye the whining of the dog ; and as I bid adieu to my neighbours the Eskimos , I pass on to my reader the noble old greeting that I heard so often ' Aksunai . ' ''

		One or two quotations such as these can give but a very inadequate idea of what is really a remarkable narrative ; but they may at least serve to suggest the character of the author , and of the curious little community clinging so ten - aciously to its rocky and desolate-looking home on the extreme north-eastern coast of
America	LOCATION	.

		* May a kindly fate deliver our descendants from stale and flat uniformity of language , dress , and manners , in all regions of the earth .

		Though few nooks and corners of the world are still unvisited by the prying eyes of the explorer and the glob-trotter , we are yet free from that uniformity which seems to threaten the twenty - first century .

		The polar regions are to-day sternly alluring to bold hearts .

		There are re - gions of
Asia	LOCATION	and
Africa	LOCATION	still unexplored .

		And the perennial fascination of the peculiar and the picturesque still inheres in the less forward na - tions of the world .

		That special sort of romance belonging to the story of the adventurous trader in far seas and remote lands bids fair soon to vanish in the presence of steamship , railway , and other universal levellers , but it has thus far not quite disappeared .

		Just because it is about to die out of the world , we take added delight in present-day instances of merchant-mariner 's romance .

		A most interesting example is the life-story of
John Dill Ross	PERSON	and his son and namesake , traders in the Indian Ocean from the
early decades of the nineteenth century	DATE	almost until the present .

		`` Sixty Years ' Life and Adven - ture in the Orient '' professes to be an account of the life of Captain
John Dillon Northwood	PERSON	and of that of his son up to his retirement from * SIXTY YEARS ' LIFE AND ADVENTURE IN THE FAR EAST .

		98 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, the oriental trade ; but the modest disguise does not conceal the true persons , Captain
Ross	PERSON	and the author , Mr.
John Dill Ross	PERSON	, now of
London	LOCATION	.

		Beginning with a history of the British influence in
Borneo	LOCATION	in the person of that remarkable
Rajah Brooke	PERSON	, the book relates in vivid and always entertaining manner the life-story of Captain Northwood from his birth on an island in the
China Sea	LOCATION	, his schooling in the home of a clergyman in
Australia	LOCATION	, his marriage and first romantic sea-venture a voyage in a diminutive sailing vessel from the
China Sea	LOCATION	to
Australia	LOCATION	through his merchant career as trader and ship - owner doing business between
Borneo	LOCATION	, the
Moluc	PERSON	- cas , and
Singapore	LOCATION	.

		After the death of
Captain Northwood	ORGANIZATION	the son continued his father 's career through a number of years filled with pictur - esque experiences , until he was stricken down by deadly tropical fever and invalided home .

		The story of the elder North wood 's career never flags in entertainment .

		He was a man fit to have sailed with
Drake	PERSON	in pursuit of Spanish gal - leons , bold , quick-witted , ready in emergency , persistent always till he gained his prize .

		But his personality is delightful not because of these traits alone , but by reason of their constant asso - ciation with generosity , fair-mindedness , and the manners of a gentleman .

		The story is replete with episodes of keen interest or amusement , and the shrewd and magnanimous Captain always proves equal to the occasion , whether it be fight - ing pirates without killing any if he could avoid it or gracefully getting rid of the viva - cious wife of a Dutch planter and capitalist after
Captain Northwood	ORGANIZATION	had sailed away from
Borneo	LOCATION	, unaware that the lady had been rendered drowsy by wine , and , instead of accompanying her lord and his party off the ship , had remained asleep on a lounge in the saloon .

		The Captain develops , as the story proceeds , into an admir - able personification of the best British virtues , and the biographer wins the sympathy of the reader for the tough and yet tender old sea - man when his large fortune is suddenly lost , and holds an ever deepening interest to the end of his heroic and honorable struggle to restore the loss .

		The story of the author 's own career in the
Orient	LOCATION	is also entertaining , but it lacks the two elements of interest inhering in that of the father remoteness in time and picturesque character .

		Indeed , it might have been wiser to make two books instead of two volumes .

		The unity of each would have been more satisfac - tory , and the antique nature of the first would not have detracted from the modern quality of the second .

		As the two volumes , however , are easy reading , one can heartily commend the story to summer readers in the mountains , and especially by the sea , with which it is so intim - ately concerned .

		ATHENS IN DECLINE .

		* Historians of
Greece	LOCATION	usually close their nar - rative with the death of Alexander the Great -LRB- 323 B.C. -RRB- , the date from which foreign influ - ence began to work more and more powerfully in Hellas until the over-lordship of
Rome	LOCATION	was clinched by the capture of
Corinth	LOCATION	by the con - sul Mummius -LRB- 146 B. c. -RRB- and the sack of
Athens	LOCATION	by Sulla -LRB- 86 B.C. -RRB- .

		This intervening period of nearly two centuries was , for
Athens	LOCATION	particu - larly , marked by a steady decline in military and political prestige .

		We see the once imperial city coquetting with the various successors of
Alex	PERSON	- ander , surrendering item after item of her ma - terial strength , and retaining only the intellectual and artistic primacy of which neither
Antioch	ORGANIZATION	nor
Alexandria	LOCATION	nor
Pergamon	LOCATION	could deprive her .

		In Professor
Ferguson	PERSON	's substantial volume on '' The Hellenistic Commonwealth , '' this transfor - mation of the city-state
Athens	LOCATION	into a municipal - ity under tyrannical and imperial rule is traced with much industry and learning , and with great minuteness of detail .

		He objects to the dictum of
Freeman	PERSON	that `` we owe it to the great - ness of
Athens	LOCATION	to study the story of her miser - able fall , '' and insists that '' no one would now think of approaching a book on
Hellenistic Athens	LOCATION	to discover the secret of Athenian de - cline ... that the fate of
Athens	LOCATION	was settled by the Peloponnesian war ... and that who - ever believes with
Freeman	PERSON	that history is first of all past politics must no longer look for the supreme crisis in Athenian affairs after
Alexan	PERSON	- der 's time . ''

		Hence the compelling interest of the Hellenistic period will attach to the above - mentioned transformation and to the social and economic conditions which grew out of it .


Athens	LOCATION	was still , and increasingly , the centre of culture ; but with politics reduced to a futil - ity , our attention is fastened on the changes in thought and life which now became manifest .

		The revelations of the New Comedy the comedy of manners show with painful mon - otony how latent or subterranean features of Athenian life were brought to the surface with tropical rapidity under the tyrannies of the two * The Hellenistic Commonwealth .

		THE DIAL 99 Demetrii -LRB- of Phalerum and Poliorcetes -RRB- .

		In - stead of a Xenophon or a Thucydides we have the plays of Menander or the ' Characters ' of Theophrastus as our guides through the `` far - rago of Attic life . ''

		But the nobler side of the Attic genius is not neglected ; and to Professor
Ferguson	PERSON	we owe a luminous description of the four great schools of philosophic thought
Plato 's Academy	ORGANIZATION	,
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	's Peripatos , Epicurus 's Garden , and
Zeno	ORGANIZATION	's
Porch	LOCATION	; as well as of their successive periods of influence , when philosophers like Xenocrates andCarneades -LRB- the `` pragmatist / > ar excellence '' -RRB- were placed at the head of dip - lomatic embassies , and ideal systems of thought were appealed to for practical guidance .

		.

		A vivid though somewhat sketchy picture of the
Athens	LOCATION	of 200 B. c. is afforded in an extract from the `` Notes on Greek Cities '' of
Hera	LOCATION	- cleides the Critic , cited at some length by Profes - sor
Ferguson	PERSON	, but too long for the reproduction of more than a sentence or two . ''

		The Athenians are great-souled , simple in their man - ners , reliable custodians of friendship .

		Some informers run about in the city , harassing wealthy visitors ; but should the people catch them , theirs would be a hard fate .

		The genuine Athenians are keen art critics , and unwearying patrons of plays , concerts , and lectures .

		In a word ,
Athens	LOCATION	surpasses other cities in all that makes for the enjoyment and betterment of life , by as much as other cities surpass the country . ''

		Professor
Ferguson	PERSON	's summary of the whole pas - sage is suggestive .

		``
Athens	LOCATION	is neither lawless , provincial , nor romantic .

		She has high-minded gentlemen and a waspish populace ; a constant round of gaiety and ever - threatening hunger ; mean , dusty streets and noble public buildings ; good taste and critical acumen ; crowds of foreigners , busy schools of philosophers , and , implicit in all else , the blessings of peace . ''

		Most informing , perhaps , is the chapter on the relations of
Athens	LOCATION	and
Delos	PERSON	.

		The famous little island , home of the worship of Apollo and
Artemis	ORGANIZATION	, was secured to
Athens	LOCATION	by the estab - lishment , in 166 B. c. , of an Athenian cleruchy , or colony .

		To the islet 's religious importance was now added commercial prosperity ; but the masterful Romans soon interfered , dissolved the Athenian cleruchy , and took over the adminis - tration of Delian affairs .

		The result was to make Delos entirely cosmopolitan .

		Then was seen , in greater measure than ever , that curious intrusion of strange Oriental cults on the `` pure '' Hellenic faiths .

		On the little area of about three square miles , Apollo and
Artemis	ORGANIZATION	found themselves crowded by Sabazius ,
Osiris	LOCATION	,
Astarte	LOCATION	,
Serapis	LOCATION	, and
Isis	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the elucidation of these matters Professor
Ferguson	PERSON	has been greatly aided by the work of the French scholars who have been working at Delos for the past forty years .

		The author has made excellent use of the orig - inal and secondary sources the great corpora of inscriptions , the writings of Menander ,
Poly	LOCATION	- bius ,
Plutarch	ORGANIZATION	, and
Pausanias	PERSON	, as well as of all modern scholars who have dealt with Hellenistic themes .

		Citations occupy a portion of almost every page , and make the book an admirable directory for students of the period .

		There is a general bibliography , an excursus on the instru - ments of Athenian government , and a satisfac - tory index .

		The latter affords an opportunity for correcting a twice-repeated misprint ; others might be mentioned on pages 63 , 328 , 414 , and 438 .

		IM THE JUNGLES OF TROPICAL ,
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* The rapid increase of automobiles in civilized countries in the
last decade	DATE	has tremendously en - larged the consumption of rubber , advanced its price , and stimulated the search for new sources of the crude gum and the fuller exploitation of known fields of production .

		The effort to find by synthetic chemistry an adequate substitute which is commercially available has thus far failed .

		As a pebble thrown into a pond creates rip - ples which in ever - widening circles press toward the remoter parts and reach finally every nook and corner , so the demand for rubber has carried the civilization of today into the most distant parts of the tropics , diluted , weakened , distorted , but still effective in shaping the activities and directing the daily life of the remotest savage tribe , and taking here , as in furnace and factory , its toll of human lives .

		To what an extent the demand for rubber has developed commerce , opened the jungle , carried men of force and education as well as the trader and the half-civilized native into the tropical wilderness of the head-waters of the
Amazon	LOCATION	, may be gathered from a perusal of Mr.
Algot Lange	PERSON	's `` In the
Amazon	LOCATION	Jungle . ''

		100 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, season Mr.
Lange	PERSON	assures us that the ''
Maure	PERSON	- tania '' could sail up this great river to
Remate de Males	ORGANIZATION	at the Peruvian frontier .

		During this season immense tracts of the tropical jungle are under water , and fevers , the omnipresent mala - ria , the fatal yellow fever , and the mysterious beri-beri , rule the land .

		In common with frontier towns in our own land ,
Remate de Males	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- `` Culmination of Evils '' -RRB- and its Peruvian neighbor ,
Nazareth	LOCATION	, are deco - rated , when not submerged , with a motley array of tin cans of American origin and empty bot - tles from all nations .

		The rubber gatherer is handsomely paid , even by our standards , and the jungle traders see to it that his wages are quickly spent .

		With American foods go some of our modern inventions , the inevitable gramo - phone , and even , on remote jungle paths in the native huts perched high in the trees , the Amer - ican sewing machine !

		The author penetrated the remote jungle , with an exploring party sent out by one of the larger rubber `` estates '' in search of new forests to tap , or to ruthlessly fell , as is sometimes done .

		The expedition was a fatal one , fever , beri-beri , and deadly snakes claiming their victims , till alone in his delirium the author fell in with a commu - nity of the savage Mangeroma cannibals who nursed him back to health , taught him their lan - guage and customs , and even took him with them on an ambush for a party of raiding Peruvian rubber gatherers who furnished the piece de resistance at the feast which folio wed the victory .

		Armed only with poison darts and blow guns , war clubs and spears , they overcame and com - pletely destroyed the party armed with firearms .

		This novel experience convinced our author that `` our earth has not been reduced to a dead level of drab and commonplace existence , and that somewhere in the remote parts of the world are still to be found people who have never seen or heard of white men . ''

		It is an extremely interesting picture which is here portrayed of the life in the frontier rubber trading-post and in the tambos of the darkened trails through the dense tropical jungle , of the life of stream and forests , of pungent rubber smudges , and of gold to be picked up till all the negative boxes are rilled , only to be thrown away again in the delirious race with hunger and fever back toward the outposts of civilization .

		The book is well written and handsomely illus - trated with unique photographs of the
Amazon	LOCATION	jungle .

		RECENT POETRY .

		* A noteworthy literary phenomenon is that pro- vided by the novelists who have turned poets or , to speak more exactly , by the writers who , after achiev - ing success as novelists , have surprised their readers by the revelation of a marked poetic faculty .

		That one must have something of this faculty to be a writer of enduring fiction is a thesis that has often been maintained ; and it is not surprising , when we come to think of it , that so many novelists have won no mean measure of success in the production of verse .

		Scott and
Meredith	PERSON	are the striking exam - ples in English literature , although in their cases the poetic gift was the first to be revealed .

		Both
Thack	PERSON	- eray and
Dickens	PERSON	were poets , of a sort ; and even more distinctly so were
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Bulwer	PERSON	, the
Bronte * Sisters	ORGANIZATION	,
Kingsley	PERSON	, and
Blackmore	PERSON	.

		In more recent years , Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	has provided con - firmation of the thesis in question , both by assert - ing the principle and by illustrating it in practice .

		`` The Dynasts '' will , we firmly believe , come to be regarded as one of his most significant works , and many of his shorter poems have a grip and a vitality that will prevent them from being forgotten .

		Amer - ican examples are
Poe	ORGANIZATION	,
Harte	PERSON	, Mr.
Howells	PERSON	, and Mr.
A. S. Hardy	PERSON	.

		The Germans and Scandinavians rec - ognize the principle instinctively by failing to pro- vide in their vocabularies words which are restricted in their meaning to compositions metrical in form .

		Dichtung and Digtning mean imaginative writing of any sort , prose or verse ; the name Dlchter be - longs as fully to
Hauptman	PERSON	and
Sudermann	PERSON	as it does to Goethe and
Schiller	PERSON	; and both
BjOrnson	PERSON	and
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	would be known as Digter if they had never written a page in measure and rhyme .

		Quite a number of present-day English novelists are now essaying the poetical form .

		Mr.
Maurice Hewlett	PERSON	and Sir
Arthur Doyle	PERSON	have recently en - gaged our attention , and now come Mr.
John Mase	PERSON	- field and Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	with volumes of poetry in the restricted sense which the English lan - guage attaches to the word .

		THE DIAL 101 consists of two narrative rhymed poems of arresting quality , `` The Everlasting Mercy '' and `` The Widow in the Bye Street . ''

		We must admit that they are tracts as well as poems , and that their obtrusively didactic quality is against them as literary produc - tions .

		One is the tale of a drunken ruffian who gets evangelistic religion by the process of `` conversion '' made familiar by `` revivalist '' meetings and other illustrations of '' corybantic Christianity . ''

		The other is a brutal tale of lust and crime , telling how an English peasant lad is ensnared by a light woman , and is impelled by jealousy to commit a murder for which he is quite properly hanged .

		Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	enlists our sympathy for both of these degenerates , and would seemingly have us believe that they are not beyond the pale of either human or divine for - giveness .

		He enforces this teaching by making both poems reek with sentimentality , and by a rather nauseous blend of religious symbolism with plain speech .


Saul Kane	PERSON	, the ruffian of `` The Everlasting Mercy , '' has been marking his carousings with such discourse as this : '' Come on , drinks round , salue , drink hearty , Now ,
Jane	PERSON	, the punch-bowl for the party .

		If any here wo n't drink with me I '11 knock his bloody eyes out .

		See ?

		Come on , cigars round , rum for mine , Sing us a smutty song , some swine , '' which is a comparatively restrained specimen of his reported speech , when the reproaches of a
Quaker	ORGANIZATION	missionary sink into his soul , and he rushes out into the night filled with such thoughts as these : '' glory of the lighted mind , How dead I 'd been , how dumb , how blind .

		The station brook , to my new eyes , Was babbling out of
Paradise	ORGANIZATION	, The waters rushing from the rain Were singing Christ has risen again .

		I thought all earthly creatures knelt From rapture of the joy I felt .

		The narrow station-wall 's brick ledge , The wild hop withering in the hedge , The light in huntsman 's upper storey Were parts of an eternal glory , Were God 's eternal garden flowers .

		I stood in bliss at this for hours . ''

		It is sentimentally and even dramatically effective , but we are afraid that it is not good psychology .

		Before his `` conversion , ''
Saul	PERSON	has a colloquy with the parson , which might have come straight from Ibsen 's '' Brand , '' so exactly does it reproduce the terse rhythm , the argumentative manner , and the fiery indignation of that great poem .

		Says Saul : '' The English church both is and was A subsidy of Caiaphas .

		I do n't believe in Prayer nor
Bible	LOCATION	, They 're all lies through , and you 've a libel , A libel on the Devil 's plan When first he miscreated man .

		You mumble through a formal code To get which martyrs burned and glowed .

		I look on martyrs as mistakes , But still they burned for it at stakes ; Your only fire 's the jolly fire Where you can guzzle port with
Squire	PERSON	, And back and praise his damned opinions , About his temporal dominions . ''

		The parson 's rejoinder is in the following strain : '' States are not made , nor patched ; they grow , Grow slow through centuries of pain And grow correctly in the main , But only grow by certain laws Of certain bits in certain jaws .

		You want to doctor that .

		Let be You can not patch a growing tree .

		Put these two words beneath your hat , These two : securus judicat .

		To get the whole world out of bed , And washed , and dressed , and warmed , and fed , To work , and back to bed again , Believe me ,
Saul	PERSON	, costs worlds of pain .

		Then as to whether true or sham That book of Christ , whose priest I am ; The Bible is a lie , say you , Where do you stand , suppose it true ?

		Good-bye .

		But if you 've more to say , My doors are open night and day .

		Meanwhile , my friend , ' t would be no sin To mix more water in your gin .

		We 're neither saints nor
Philip Sidneys	PERSON	, But mortal men with mortal kidneys . ''

		It sounds like a parody of the dialogues between Brand and the mayor .

		These narratives by Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	are virile , slapdash stuff , but it is only in spots that they deserve to be glorified with the name of poetry , and the streaks of deep feeling and im - aginative power do not fuse with the sordid matrix of realism .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	speaks to us with the accent of the authentic poet , albeit he chooses the modest style of '' Moods , Songs , and Doggerels '' for his title .

		Now a large part of Mr.
Masefield	PERSON	's volume must be described as doggerel , but this seems too harsh a term even for Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	's trifles .

		Such lines as these , surely , deserve a gentler name : `` Life ?

		What is Life ?

		The leaping up of level wave ; The flaring of an ashy fire ; The living wind in airless grave ! ''

		Death ?

		What is Death ?

		The dying of immortal sun ; The sleeping of the sleepless moon ; The end of story not begun ! ''

		`` Love '' is the title of the following poignant distillate from the alembic of experience : '' Love !

		that love which comes so stealthily , And takes us up , and twists us as it will What fever 'd hours of agony you bring I How oft we wake and cry : ' God set me free Of love to never love again ! '

		And still We fall , and clutch you by the knees , and cling And press our lips and so , once more are glad ! ''

		And if you go , or if you never come , Through what a grieving wilderness of pain We travel on !

		In prisons stripped of light We blindly grope , and wander without home .

		The friendless winds that sweep across the plain The beggars meeting us at silent night Than we , are not more desolate and sad ! ''

		The lines called `` Errantry '' give voice to an ideal - ism which never fails the poet who has the true 102 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, conception of his mission as an inspiring interpreter of life . ''

		Come !

		Let us lay a crazy lance in rest , And tilt at windmills under a wild sky !

		For who would live so petty and unblest That dare not tilt at something ere he die Rather than , screened by safe majority , Preserve his little life to little ends , And never raise a rebel battle-cry ! ''

		Ah !

		for the weapon wistful and sublime , Whose lifted point recks naught of woe or weal , Since Fate demands it shivered every time !

		When in the wildness of our charge we reel Men laugh indeed the sweeter heavens smile , For all the world of fat prosperity Has not the value of that broken steel ! ''

		One thinks of innumerable parallels to th , is expres - sion of lofty thought from
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Sill	ORGANIZATION	,
Arnold	LOCATION	,
Dobson	PERSON	, and many others but of none more per - suasive and sincere .

		Mr.
Galsworthy	PERSON	is not alone a poet of abstract ideas , as the indignant lines en - titled ``
Persia Moritura	LOCATION	'' may testify . ''

		Home of the free !

		Protector of the weak !

		Shall We and this Great Grey Ally make sand Of all a nation 's budding green , and wreak Our
winter	DATE	will on that unhappy land ?

		Is all our steel of soul disolved and flown ?

		Have fumes of fear encased our heart of flame ?

		Are we with panic so deep-rotted down In self , that we can feel no longer shame To league , and steal a nation 's hope of youth ?

		Oh !

		Sirs !

		Is our Star merely cynical ?

		Is God reduced ?

		That we must darken truth , And break our honour with this creeping fall ? ''

		Is Freedom but a word a flaring boast ?

		Is Self-Concern horizon 's utter sun ?

		If so To-day let
England	LOCATION	die , and ghost Through all her godless history to come !

		If ,
Sirs	ORGANIZATION	, the faith of men be Force alone , Let us ring down The farce is nothing worth .

		If Life be only prayer to things of stone , Come Death !

		And let us , friends , go mocking forth !

		But if there 's aught , in all
Time	ORGANIZATION	's bloody hours , Of
Justice	ORGANIZATION	, if the herbs of Pity grow O Native Land , let not those only flowers Of God be desert-strewn and withered now ! ''

		If the crime against
Persia	LOCATION	be finally consummated by
England	LOCATION	's connivance with the monstrous des - potism of the Muscovite , these lines at least will remain to show that the hideous wrong was not ac - complished without a protest .

		`` Charmides and Other Poems Chiefly Relating to Oxford '' is an exquisite volume of verse by Mr.
Gascoigne Mackie	PERSON	.

		The titular piece , pictorial and elegiac , consists of sixteen verse sections , in three groups of sixteen each , invoking the spirit of `` Char - , mides '' with an appeal to old-time memories .

		We quote one of the most beautiful of these sections .

		`` Long gaps of lingering splendour but no sun Now from the heights the hieratic tints Fade slowly , like the fervour from life 's dream : And every valley veiled in violet bloom Lies hushed ; till lo , from out her vestal shrine
Heaven	ORGANIZATION	's inmost penetralia of peace Upon the bosom of maternal night
Passionless Hesper	PERSON	, like a kneeling child , Glimmers : and soft as dew , the far off hills Drop down divine nostalgia on my soul That homeward turns at last .

		Dear Charmides , Still be thou near me , wheresoe'er I walk , The motive and the charm of solitude : Close as a shadow let thy memory cling And deepen round me ; till the shadows break And on the golden bough the thrush begins . ''

		An earlier version of this poem was published in
1898	DATE	, but it has now been re-written .

		The same subdued strain of reflection characterizes the other poems of this collection .

		These stanzas come from '' Oxford at
Night	TIME	. '' ''

		Austere she stood in ancient times , A refuge for the pure in heart , And still the music of her chimes Peals from a world apart . ''

		And when we hear those cloister 'd bells After long years , or absence long , With what high hopes and proud farewells Their haunting echoes throng ! ''

		Until it seems as if she brings -LRB- To mock the pride of lonely men -RRB- , Only the tears of mortal things That cloud our mortal ken . ''

		Mr.
Mackie	PERSON	has both technical skill and the gift of subtle harmonies of word and thought .

		His work is the expression of a temperament finely attuned to spiritual beauty .

		These little books of verse that so frequently come to us from
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	are apt to be pleasant surprises , revealing talents deserving of a wider fame than they are likely ever to win .

		We always open them with pleasant anticipations , and are rarely disap - pointed .

		Mr.
Brett-Smith	PERSON	's '' Poems of the North '' are not , for the most part , upon Oxonian themes , but reveal instead a spirit that ventures far afield , notably into the realm of Scandinavian legend and mythology .

		This is `` The Steering Song of
Olaf Tryggvason	PERSON	. '' ''

		Kinar .

		see : Rush of waves in the sloping sea Flying , flying swift and free !

		Oegir 's daughters , lest they charm To their harm .

		Hearts of all the men who roam On the swan 's path of the deep Down from rugged lands and steep , Veil their heads in white sea foam . ''

		Einar , hear : Storm winds gathering far and near Sweep the spume from the fretting mere !

		Through the shrouds the breezes ring , Whirr and sing , Like the hiss of an arrow 's flight When the quivering bows are bent afar And through the hush of the breaking war Warriors ' eyes are dimmed in night . ''

		These lines on `` The Death of Colonel Brett , '' an Elizabethan seaman slain in
Portugal	LOCATION	, and presum - ably one of the author 's ancestors , are singularly impressive . ''

		Nay , lad , 't is mortal : do not weep , but mark , I will not lie among these Portingales The sea being ours ; take me a fishing barque

		Mute spouse of God , upon whose bosom lies Time like a child , time of the fevered heart , Out of this moment of mortality Toward thee , O mild Unchangeable , we lift Our hands , our faces rmitable uplift , Like waves that turn their pallor to the moon , And plead in passing for thy kiss , Peace .

		Sage dweller on the sacred frontiers Of realms the armoured years shall enter not , Aloof from all the clangorous march of time , From riot , and the ravishments of men , 0 , patient listener to the Innermost , Flow from the noiseless places of the world I From the deep valleys ` mid a thousand hills Where silence sits forever ` mong her rocks Poring upon impermanence , flow thence , Flow from all haunted places where abides The hush primeval . ''

		And so on , for some two hundred lines .

		This Emersonian jingle introduces '' The Hill of Vision , '' by Mr.
James Stephens	PERSON	: '' Everything that I can spy Through the circle of my eye , Everything that I can see Has been woven out of me ; I have sown the stars , and threw Clouds of morning and of eve Up into the vacant blue ; Everything that I perceive , Sun and sea and mountain high , All are moulded by my eye : Closing it , what shall I find ?

		Darkness , and a little wind . ''

		It is spiritual and imaginative vision , rather than physical , that Mr.
Stephens	PERSON	prefers to impart .

		This is his view of what shall be in `` The Fulness of Time . '' ''

		On a rusty iron throne Past the furthest star of space I saw Satan sit alone , Old and haggard was his face For his work was done and he Rested in eternity . ''

		And to him from out the sun Came his father and his friend Saying , now the work is done
Enmity	ORGANIZATION	is at an end : And he guided Satan to Paradises that he knew . ''

		Gabriel without a frown ,
Uriel	PERSON	without a spear ,
Raphael	PERSON	came singing down Welcoming their ancient peer .

		And they seated him beside One who had been crucified . ''

		Mr.
John G. Neihardt	PERSON	is master of a rugged dic - tion , marked by forceful metaphors and a somewhat recondite allusiveness .

		His meaning is not always clear , and seems to be expressive of an emotional state rather than of an imaginative vision .

		Many of the pieces in `` The Stranger at the Gate '' are nature lyrics , not so much descriptive as interpreta - tive in a spiritual sense .

		This , for example : '' Over the steep cloud-crags The marching day went down Bickering spears and flags , Slant in a wind of Doom !

		Blear in the huddled shadows Glimmer the lights of the town ; Black pools mottle the meadows , Swamped in a purple gloom . ''

		Is it the night wind sobbing Over the wheat in head ?

		Is it the world-heart throbbing Sad with the coming years ?

		Is it the lifeward creeping Ghosts of the myriad dead , Livid with wounds and weeping Wild , uncleansing tears ? ''

		Of course it is not any of these things , but the poet is licensed to suggest them , for his revelation is not of nature , but of his own soul .

		We are much im - pressed with `` The Poet 's Town , '' describing the boy who is at heart a poet , living his own life amid commonplace surroundings . ''

		Rich with the dreamer 's pillage , An idle and worthless lad , Least in a prosy village , And prince in
Allahabad	LOCATION	; '' Lover of golden apples , Munching a daily crust ; Haunter of dream-built chapels , Worshipping in the dust ; '' Dull to the worldly duty , Less to the town he grew , And more to the God of Beauty Than even the grocer knew ! ''

		Indignation at the present scheme of things in
America	LOCATION	, and the cry for social justice , are voiced in the poems at the close of the volume . ''

		No longer blindfold
Justice	ORGANIZATION	reigns ; but leers A barefaced , venal strumpet in her stead !

		The stolen harvests of a hundred years Are lighter than a stolen loaf of bread ! ''

		pious Nation , holding God in awe , Where sacred human rights are duly priced !

		Where men are beggared in the name of Law , Where alms are given in the name of Christ ! ''

		The Country of the Free !

		wretched lie I The Country of the Brave Yea , let it be 1 One more good fight , O
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, ere we die And this shall be the Country of the Free ! ''

		The freedom here invoked seems to be freedom to pillage the possessors under the mob-banner of socialism .

		`` The Red Wind Comes , '' from which we have quoted , and the '' Cry of the People , '' which follows it , are quite in the vein of
William Morris	PERSON	.

		104 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, '' I am in poetry what
Strauss	PERSON	is in music ,
Rodin	PERSON	in sculpture , and Stuck in painting a cerebral impressionist . ''

		`` I have found myself as a poet . '' ''

		My own emotions are too elusive and too complex to be capable of expression or understanding beyond where I have gone .

		If I lived in
Europe	LOCATION	, if mine were the freedom of
Wedekind	PERSON	and the audience that hails him and goads him , I might still go on .

		But I realize that I am too far ahead of the pageant of American life to go one step further . ''

		`` The torch of our lyric fire still burns and will continue to burn when it has passed from my hands into those of a younger poet . '' ''

		I have given a new lyric impetus to my country .

		I have loosened the tongue of the young American poets . ''

		`` I may safely say that I am one of the leaders of the lyric insurgents who , inheriting the technique of
Poe	PERSON	and the social conscience of Whitman , have added the new note of passion . '' ''

		I am perhaps the only American poet whose book of lyric verse made money for himself and his publishers . ''

		These are excerpts from the lengthy introduction to `` The Candle and the Flame , '' Mr.
George Sylvester Viereck	PERSON	's new book of poems .

		Their incredible egotism is very amusing when we realize upon how slight a foundation of achievement it is based .

		For the author is a very minor poet , distinguished chiefly by an erotic mania and a pre - dilection for toying with unclean themes , and his poetical output thus far includes , besides the present volume , '' Nineveh and Other Poems '' and a slender sheaf of `` Gedichte . ''

		He is the avowed enemy of the `` Puritans '' among our poets , among whom he includes most of our shining names , from
Emerson	LOCATION	,
Longfellow	LOCATION	, and
Lowell	LOCATION	to
Gilder	PERSON	,
Stedman	PERSON	, and
Moody	ORGANIZATION	.

		This attitude he puts into a neat epigram : `` Phryne is preferable to a
New England	LOCATION	spinster , but
Aspasia	LOCATION	is more desirable than
Phryne	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Viereck	PERSON	's quality as a singer may be illustrated by the closing stanzas of the poem which gives this col - lection a title . ''

		Perhaps the passions of mankind Are but the torches mystical Lit by some spirit-hand to find The dwelling of the Master-Mind That knows the secret of it all , In the great darkness and the wind . ''

		We are the Candle , Love the Flame , Each little life-light flickers out , Love bides , immortally the same : When of life 's fever we shall tire He will desert us , and the fire Rekindle new in prince or lout . ''

		Twin-born of knowledge and of lust , He was before us , he shall be Indifferent still of thee and me , When shattered is life 's golden cup , When thy young limbs are shrivelled up , And when my heart is turned to dust . ''

		Nay , sweet , smile not to know at last That thou and I , or knave , or fool , Are but the involitient tool Of some world-purpose vague and vast .

		No bar to passion 's fury set , With monstrous poppies spice the wine : For only drunk are we divine , And only mad shall we forget . ''

		These verses represent Mr.
Viereck	PERSON	at his best , and be has many more of stimulating quality and pas - sionate appeal .

		His thought is often far from clear and indeed some of his ideas have to be discreetly veiled but he is thoughtful enough to provide for us a marginal commentary which is quite as good reading as the poems themselves .

		As he says , '' We may give a clue now and then which can direct the mind of the reader and perhaps prevent critics yet unborn from wasting marvellously ingenious devices upon the erection of spurious pyramids on the base of a fatal misprint or a mistaken assumption .

		Neither Goethe , nor
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, it may be urged , was his own commentator .

		The resultant loss , however , was both theirs and the world 's . ''

		Mr.
Viereck	PERSON	sees to it that the world shall suffer no such loss in the case of his own immortal works .

		A single quotation from the '' Marginalia '' will exemplify their galvanic character : `` I once made the reckless remark that the three men I most admired were Christ ,
Napoleon	PERSON	, and
Oscar Wilde	PERSON	, each a martyr to his creed , the ethical , the dynamic , and the aesthetic .

		After calm reflection I can not find three men who typify more perfectly the great intellectual and temperamental world-currents .

		Recently in
Paris	LOCATION	I visited the graves of
Napoleon	PERSON	and Oscar Wilde .

		As
Jerusalem	LOCATION	was too far away , I paid my devotion to the founder of Christianity , not at
Notre Dame	LOCATION	, but at the tomb of another intellectual of the race of Christ
Heinrich Heine	PERSON	. ''

		Mr.
Robert Haven Schauffler	PERSON	is the author of a striking poem called `` Scum o ' the
Earth	LOCATION	, '' suggested by the hordes of immigrants landing at
Castle Garden	ORGANIZATION	.

		As they pass in procession before him , the various nationalities suggest to the poet 's vision their racial potentialities for the enrichment of our nat - ional life .

		An Italian boy , for example , suggests these lines : '' Genoese boy of the level brow , Lad of the lustrous , dreamy eyes Astare at
Manhattan	LOCATION	's pinnacles now In the first , sweet shock of a hushed surprise : Within yoiir far-rapt seer 's eyes I catch the glow of the wild surmise That played on the
Santa Maria	LOCATION	's prow In that still gray dawn , Four centuries gone , When a world from the wave began to rise .

		Oh , it 's hard to foretell what high emprise Is the goal that gleams When
Italy	LOCATION	's dreams Spread wing and sweep into the skies .

		Caesar dreamed him a world ruled well ;
Dante	ORGANIZATION	dreamed Heaven out of Hell ; Angelo brought us there to dwell ; And you , are you of a different birth ?

		You 're only a ' dago , ' and ' scum o ' the earth ' ! ''

		So he takes them , Greeks and Poles and Czechs and Jews , and urges that the dreams they bring with them constitute their real value to us , far more than
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 105 offsetting their ragged habiliments and pitiful store of worldly goods .

		The broad humanity of this view is very appealing , no doubt , yet the poet who wrote `` Unguarded Gates '' represented a point of view that needs to be considered also .

		As becomes a musician , Mr.
Schauffler	PERSON	finds in his own special art the inspiration for some of his finest verses . ''

		Is music ' love in search of words ' ?

		Not so .

		For love well knows he never may express In words a tithe of all his tenderness , Nor paint in human speech a passion 's glow Lit by his flame .

		Too deep and still , too low Even for angels ' ears , the saeredness Of meaning when two hearts together press And feel from eye to eye love 's secret flow . ''

		But music is a house not made with hands , Built by love 's Father , where a little space The soul may dwell ; a royal palace fit To meet the majesty of its demands .

		The place where man 's two lives unite ; the place To hold communion with the infinite . ''

		Most of Mr.
John Kendrick Bangs	PERSON	's verses prove their right to be called `` Echoes of Cheer , '' and none more so than this pair of stanzas on `` The Optimist . '' ''

		Care came first and laid his siege , Laid his siege at my front-door ; Then the
Wolf	PERSON	, the Lord and
Liege	LOCATION	Of all Trouble , brought his score .

		Well , I ' sicked ' the
Wolf on Care Wolf	ORGANIZATION	was hungry past all doubt ; Chewed old Care up hide and hair , Left no sign of him about . ''

		Then I took my faithful gun , Cheerfulness , from off the rack ; Loaded it with Wholesome Fun , Let Wolf have it front and back ... Made a fur coat of his hide He was quite a shaggy beast And the rest of him we fried For our glad Thanksgiving Feast . ''

		We best know Mr.
Bangs	PERSON	as a professional jester ; but this book of his verses reveals the serious vein that lies beneath his merriment , expressing the simple faith and trust of a man at peace with him - self and the scheme of things entire .

MORTON PAYNE	PERSON	.

		The spell of the
White Mountains	LOCATION	.

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		Although no book has yet caught the
White Mountains	LOCATION	wholly in its toils -LRB- and it is to be hoped none ever will -RRB- , there comes occasionally a book with power to raise the image of them before the mind 's eye , and to satisfy somewhat the mountain-lover 's perpetual longing .

		Such a book is Mr.
Winthrop Packard	PERSON	's '' White Mountain Trails '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , with its rather desultory but always delightful text , and its many wonderful illustrations .

		The writer takes his leisurely way over the best-known trails , apparently with no time-card but the sun , no map but the peaks and gullies of the mountains them - selves , and no set purpose but enjoyment .

		When a white admiral butterfly `` politely shows the wrong road as a start for the trail up
Bartlett	PERSON	, '' and then '' leaves him in a wild tangle of slash to get up the mountain the way the bear does , on all fours , '' he does not even feel himself under obligation to learn wisdom from experience .

		Instead , he trusts a mountain brook to show him the way down , only to find that though `` mountain brooks do not run away from you as mountain paths do , it is as well not to trust them too much , after dark . ''

		But Mr.
Packard	PERSON	's wandering is not aimless , for in the course of it he accomplishes
Carter Notch	ORGANIZATION	and
Crawford Notch	ORGANIZATION	, sees the world from the peaks of
Chocorua	LOCATION	,
Iron Mountain	LOCATION	,
Kearsarge	ORGANIZATION	,
Carragain	LOCATION	,
Madison	PERSON	,
Mount Jackson	LOCATION	, and several others , and has four clear days on the top of Mount Wash - ington , `` such as the fates in kindly mood sometimes deal out to fortunate mortals . ''

		He knows each of the mountains by itself , for `` they have personality and grow to be individual friends , as well loved and ardently longed for when absent as any human neighbor or associate . ''

		Indeed , the aim of his ap - parent aimlessness is to catch each '' individual '' off guard , to surprise it from every angle , to come upon it if possible unexpectedly to himself and so to get at the very secret of its character .

		Be - cause he often succeeds , his book is worthy of its subject .

		Besides , it is to be doubted if any other writer about the
White Mountains	LOCATION	has seen so much by the way .

		The reader must be a very wise person indeed who does not envy Mr.
Packard	PERSON	his ability to enjoy with full knowledge all the flowers and ferns , birds and trees , butterflies and mosses , and even the frogs and hedgehogs , he finds in each day 's climbing .

		As a final excellence , the volume has some forty reproductions of skilfully - taken photographs , showing not only the looming grandeur of the mountains both in clear air and shrouded in mist or cloud , but much of the cher - ished detail of nearer views .

		Some well-told Not since th .

		e English-reading world tales of simple was filled with delight by the scenes
Cornish	PERSON	folk .

		of humble Scottish life depicted by the Rev.
John Watson	PERSON	has it been treated to any - thing of so marked excellence and striking original - ity in the same domain of realistic reproduction of the humors of the lowly as in Mr.
Charles Lee	PERSON	's Cornish tales now introduced to the American public by
Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, in three volumes with the title , `` Our Little Town , '' ``
Paul Carah	PERSON	,
Cornish	PERSON	- man , '' and `` The Widow Woman . ''

		The first vol - ume takes the form of separate sketches and stories , the other two of continuous narrative ; but so little does Mr.
Lee	PERSON	's art depend upon plot , upon the mere machinery or frame-work of story-building , that he is equally enjoyable in either manner .

		Cornishnaan to the very heart of him he must be , to write so sympathetically of the Cornish fisherfolk , and with so keen a relish for all their oddities of tempera - ment and peculiarities of speech .

		Dialect he can not avoid using in letting his characters play their several parts , but it is nowhere overdone , nowhere 106 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, beyond the ready comprehension of the reader .

		Let us quote from a dialogue between `` Bessie 's Tom '' and `` stuttering
Orlando	LOCATION	'' in ' `` Our Little Town . ''


Orlando	LOCATION	, in an unguarded hour , has been beguiled into matrimony , and his wife proves to be such a talker that he himself hardly gets a chance to open his mouth . ''

		Have n't spit out a c-clean word for weeks , '' he moans .

		`` Do n't get t-time . ''

		Tom tries to comfort him , and asks : `` Have ' e tried swearing ?

		If I mind right , your dees were always better gressed , like , than your Christian speech . ''

		`` T-true , '' replies the other , mournfully .

		`` So they were .

		But now they 'm like the rest snails crawl - ing through t-tar . ''

		Here is a bit of shrewd wisdom from `` Uncle Hannibal '' in '' The Widow Woman . ''

		He stands , pipe in hand , in his doorway , filling the space with his generous bulk and watching the dis - comfiture of
John Trelill	PERSON	at the hands of a coquet - tish young woman . ''

		When a chap an ' a maid do come together , '' comments
Uncle Hannibal	PERSON	, `` chap shuts his eyes tight : maid aupens hers a bit wider .

		How should chap look to have a chanst ?

		Man 's human , but woman 's woman ` at 's what I d' say in my smart way . ''

		But
John	PERSON	wins the maid in the end , and the story of the courtship , with its very unusual complications , is admirably told .

		Another original and amusing love story , contained in '' Our Little Town , '' has to do with two maiden ladies in their fifties and a sixty-year-old suitor to the twain .

		Impartial in his affections , he begs them to decide between themselves which of the two shall be the one to accept him .

		The outcome is a little unex pected . ''


Paul Carah	PERSON	'' is the story of a good-natured and amusing braggart who has lived some years in `` the States '' and returns to astonish the natives .

		As in the other books , both scenes and characters are drawn by the hand of a master .

		There are hours of solid enjoyment in these three volumes .

		Excellent line-drawings and a colored frontispiece are provided by Mr.
Charles E. Brock	PERSON	for `` The Widow Woman . ''

		Mr.
Gordon ' Browne	PERSON	illustrates ``

Hosmer	PERSON	s death , at the age or seventy -
Harriet Hosmer	PERSON	.

		8ev en ; and the interval has sufficed for collecting her more important correspondence and preparing therefrom and from other sources a good account of her life and work . ''


Harriet Hos	PERSON	- mer : Letters and Memories '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by her friend Mrs.
Lucien Carr	PERSON	-LRB-
Cornelia Carr	PERSON	-RRB- , forms a substantial volume of nearly four hundred pages , well-printed , well-illustrated , and teeming with matter of interest to all who take pleas - ure and pride in the achievements of this brilliant American woman and famous sculptor .

		It is true that she seemed to make herself , by expatriation for her art 's sake , almost more of a European than an American .

		How she impressed the world abroad is partly shown in
Frances Power Cobbe	ORGANIZATION	's descrip - tion of her : '' She was in those days the most be - witching sprite that the world ever saw .

		Never have I laughed so helplessly as at the infinite fun of that bright Yankee girl .

		Even in later years , when we perforce grew a little graver , she needed only to begin one of her descriptive stories to make us all young again .

		I have not seen her since her return to
America	LOCATION	, nor yet anyone in the least like her .

		It is vain to hope to convey to any reader the contagion of her merriment .

		Oh !

		what a gift be - yond rubies are such spirits ! ''

		Mrs.
Carr	PERSON	gives us some admirable specimens of Miss
Hosmer	PERSON	's fun , and among them a few stanzas of delicious French doggerel composed at Mrs.
Sedgwick	PERSON	's school at
Lenox	LOCATION	, where
Fanny Kemble	PERSON	made friends with her and used to say to her of an evening , `` Come ,
Hatty	LOCATION	, do give us some fun to-night . ''

		Most numerous and most characteristic are the letters to her old friend and patron , Mr.
Wayman Crow	PERSON	, of
St. Louis	LOCATION	, father of her favorite classmate , and greatly helpful to her in procuring her admission to the course in anatomy at the medical school of the
State University of Missouri	ORGANIZATION	.

		Miss
Hosmer	PERSON	's Italian years fell in the time of the Brownings , and of course they and a host of other notables figure in her letters .

		The editor has done well to let her sculptor friend tell her own story , in large part ; and it is one well worth reading .

		Born in
1853	DATE	, the Right Hon.
George W. E. Russell	PERSON	lays early claim to the privilege of age in writing his remi - niscences .

		`` One Look Back '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- traces in highly agreeable fashion the first half-century or so of the life of one who , near the close of his book , declares himself ignorant of the sensation of dul - ness .

		Already , in his two series of '' Collections and Recollections '' published in
1898	DATE	, and in his `` Pocketful of Sixpences '' and `` Sketches and Snapshots , '' Mr.
Russell	PERSON	has shown his talent as a raconteur ; and the present volume will certainly do nothing to lessen his reputation .

		Proudly trac - ing his descent from that of
William Lord Russell	PERSON	who laid down his life in the cause of constitu - tional liberty in
1683	DATE	, the author gives us pleasing glimpses of his boyhood home , his school and uni - versity days , his life in
London	LOCATION	society , his jour - nalistic and public activities , and his labors of love as a zealous Churchman .

		Eulogizing the past with a pessimistic contemplation of the present that strangely contrasts with the general cheery tone of his book , he occasionally indulges in such strains as the following concerning his degenerate fellow - countrymen : `` They do not care for the country in itself ; they have no eye for its beauty , no sense of its atmosphere , no memory for its traditions .

		It is only made endurable to them by sport and gambling and boisterous house-parties ; and , when from one cause or another these resources fail , they are frankly bored and long for

		THE DIAL 107 with alien millionaires in the sumptuousness with which they ` do you ' delightful phrase , they prefer not to entertain at all .

		An emulous osten - tation has killed hospitality .

		All this is treason to a high ideal . ''

		Among the author 's many friend - ships he notes with especial gratitude his obligations to the brilliantly gifted
James Payn	PERSON	, whose love of anecdote called forth , first orally and then in literary form in the columns of the Manchester `` Guardian , '' the `` Collections and Recollections `` mentioned above .

		There is also related the course of events leading up to Mr.
Russell	PERSON	's connection with this '' best news - paper in
Great Britain	LOCATION	, '' as he calls it .

		To that for - tunate connection we owe , humanly speaking , these subsequent anecdotal and autobiographic chapters .

		A few appropriate illustrations accompany the read - ing matter ... The Cabinet Professor
Henry Barrett	PERSON	Learned 's as a branch of book on `` The President 's Cabinet '' Government .

		and Dr
Mary L Hinsdale	PERSON	's `` His - tory of the President 's Cabinet '' treat of the same subject , but in different ways .

		Professor Learned 's book begins with a chapter on the Cabinet in En - gland , and proceeds to elaborate at some length the evolution of the Cabinet in the
United States	LOCATION	, from the days of the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	through the period of the Confederation to the establishment of presidential government under the Constitution .

		After a careful account of the creation , in
Washing	LOCATION	- ton 's time , of the first and more important secretary - ships , and after an essay on the term `` Cabinet '' as used in the
United States	LOCATION	, Professor Learned passes to a discussion of the offices of Attorney General , Secretary of the
Navy	ORGANIZATION	, Postmaster General ,
Secre	PERSON	- tary of the Interior , Secretary of Agriculture , and
Secretary of Commerce and Labor	ORGANIZATION	.

		A concluding chapter gives an historical summary and a brief analysis of the relations between the different cab - inet officers and the President .

		This volume , we are told , is intended to cover only the formation and structure of the Cabinet ; but Professor Learned promises a second part of the work which is to treat of the `` Practices and Personnel '' of that body .

		It is this element , the personal , which characterizes the book of Dr.
Hinsdale	LOCATION	.

		This is deliberately ar - ranged upon an annalistic plan .

		The origin of the Cabinet is here very briefly treated , and the author proceeds to an account of the Cabinet of each ad - ministration , from
Washington	LOCATION	's first term in
1789	DATE	to the presidency of Mr.
Taft	PERSON	in
1909	DATE	.

		Each of these chapter is accompanied by a valuable table showing the original make-up of the Cabinet , and the changes which took place in its membership .

		Around this personal framework , Dr.
Hinsdale	PERSON	builds her account of the activities of the Cabinet , treating from this view-point many of the events and problems which are discussed topically in Professor Learned 's book .

		At the close of the volume Dr.
Hinsdale	PERSON	adds three analytical chapters , on the general principles of cabinet making , the relation of the Cabinet to Con - gress , and the relation of the Cabinet to the Presi - dent .

		The two works admirably supplement each other .

		Each is scholarly in execution , each is ade - quately equipped with bibliographical material and an index .

		Both appeal especially to the student of American history and government ; but , particularly in this `` presidential year , '' both should also win the attention of the `` general reader . ''

		Advances A. significant indication of the ever - tn medical > j < .1 research in widening consequences of the Amer - the tropics .

		ican occupation of
the Philippines	LOCATION	and other tropical possessions of
Spain	LOCATION	, and of the sanitary developments in the
Canal Zone	ORGANIZATION	, is to be seen in the recent work of Captain
Charles F. Craig	PERSON	, of the Medical Corps of the
United States Army	ORGANIZATION	, entitled `` The Parasitic Amrebae of Man '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- .

		Time was when an army billet was a sine - cure not sought for purposes of medical research , though not a few illustrious names of army and navy physicians are to be found in the annals of natural history .

		To-day , in
England	LOCATION	,
France	LOCATION	, and
Germany	LOCATION	, and also in our own land , the advances in tropical medicine are largely made by physicians who find both opportunity and stimulus for research in the contact with disease , epidemics , plagues and para - sites of tropical peoples .

		Dr.
Craig	PERSON	's contributions in this field have long been known to specialists , and are now made readily accessible to all in his illustrated monograph on the parasitic amosbse which worked such dread havoc on our soldiers in
the Philippines	LOCATION	and threaten all who travel in tropical lands .

		The ease of transportation to and from the south and the Orient brings their plagues to our doors , and too often within them ; so that the infec - tions here treated have become of widest general interest both to our own practitioners and to all who are concerned with the protection of public and private water-supplies against pollution .

		The book is replete with the latest discoveries of investigators in this field , in all lands ; and discusses fully the distinctions between the abundant but innocuous amoebae of streams and reservoirs and the so-called `` benign '' parasites and the pathogenic ones .

		Abun - dant illustrations and a full bibliography of the widely scattered literature of the subject add to the value of this representative work of American scholarship and the only monographic work in En - glish upon the subject .

		In a stately quarto of 278 pages en - agefnnessaiv .

		titled '' Prehistoric Thessaly '' Messrs.
A. J. B. Wace	PERSON	and
M. S. Thompson	PERSON	have published through the
Cambridge University Press	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
New York	LOCATION	: Putnam -RRB- an account of recent ex - cavations and explorations in
Northeastern Greece	LOCATION	, from
Lake Kopais	LOCATION	to the borders of
Macedonia	LOCATION	.

		The volume is an expansion of previous reports by the same authors ; and presents in a convenient form all the ai \ Ideological evidence as yet available for the prehistoric age in
Thessaly	LOCATION	.

		It is thus a contribution to the constantly-growing structure of our knowledge of ^ Egean civilization .

		By obvious cleavage the book 108 THE DIAL -LSB-
August 16	DATE	, falls into two divisions : the first ten chapters describ - ing exhaustively the excavations by the authors , together with summaries of other men 's work .

		The concluding seven chapters contain the theories and conclusions based on their finds , to be modified or verified by future discoveries .

		As was to be ex - pected , the pottery , found in great abundance , was their chief and safest guide : `` the history of any site which has a deep undisturbed deposit can be read in its pottery . ''

		Comparative archaeologists will fol - low these elaborate lists of sherds , vases , jugs , and other ware with keen interest , and will note the paral - lelism between the Thessalian decorated work and that from
Crete	LOCATION	, the JEgean islands , and Mycenaean sites generally .

		The chapter on the `` prehistoric history '' of
Northeastern Greece	LOCATION	is an interesting example of the archaeological method .

		Using only the evidence dug out of the earth , and rigorously ex - cluding all racial and legendary names , the authors have reconstructed a Thessalian culture which they divide into four periods .

		None of these is marked by any splendor ; the decorated ware adheres to simple geometric patterns , while the statuettes and figurini are highly grotesque . ''

		Only at the end of the pre - historic age did Mycenaean culture really reach
Northern Greece	LOCATION	; but before it could supplant the older cultures and gain a firm hold on
Thessaly	LOCATION	, it was itself swept away by the northern invasions that mark the dawn of historic
Greece	LOCATION	. ''

		The book is profusely illustrated from photographs and drawings in the body of the text , and by half-a-dozen fine col - ored plates .

		The matter of transliteration has been carefully attended to , and every needful help pro- vided in index , appendix , and references to the works of other authors .

		It is inevitable that such books as these three should call to mind and invite comparison with Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's '' Breakfast Table '' series ; for there is not a little of the same whimsical humor in the obser - vations and meditations of each of these Bostonians professional men , both of them , and writers by avocation .

Josephine	PERSON	, with whom I was discussing the subject '' -RRB- has in it the same abrupt challenge to one 's interest that is familiar to the Autocrat 's readers .

		`` Convictions '' is rather too strong a word to apply to the views of this grand - father ; he is by no means dogmatic or opinionated , and one of the charms of his book is that it leaves so many questions open for further debate .

		The questions themselves are not abstruse , but deal chiefly with such topics as automobiles and the increasing cost of living , old-age pensions , the mod - as national pastimes .

		ern woman , present-day culture and conversation , European travel , the contesting of wills , and certain other matters of not too severely legal a nature .

		The grace and fluency and charm of the author 's style hardly need our commendation , at this late day .

		To those who have begun to make a serious study of pastimes , and are trying to put play into its proper rela - tion to the affairs of life , Mrs.
Mary	PERSON	Master Need - ham 's `` Folk Festivals '' -LRB-
Huebsch	PERSON	-RRB- will come as an inspiration , a guide , and a help .

		The book is based upon the author 's personal experiences in utilizing the almost universal love of the people for self-expression and correlating it with the work of the school in the teaching of history ; and it not only tells what folk - festivals are , and by way of illustration describes the more important Old World festivals and some successful experiments in
America	LOCATION	, but it shows how folk festivals may be given in this country , and how we may thereby revive an interest in festal days which are ours by inheritance , infuse some life and enthusiasm into our so-called national holidays , and learn how to celebrate them in a sane and appropri - ate manner so that their meaning may not be lost .

		Emphasis throughout the book is laid on the folk character the self-expression of the people in their celebrations of festival days .

		The book is written in an entertaining manner , but is thorough and com - plete ; and for those who desire to pursue the sub - ject further , an exceedingly helpful bibliography is appended .

		NOTES .

Mahan	PERSON	's book on '' Sea Power '' is said , on the authority of a British naval officer , to he the most generally read book in the libraries of war vessels in the

		Mrs.

		It is , in effect , a new edition of

		An early contribution to the literature of the Presi - dential campaign is '' The Democratic Mistake , '' by Mr.
A. G. Sedgwick	PERSON	, which Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	publish this month .

		Another timely book from the same house is '' Majority Rule and the Judiciary , '' by Mr.
W. L. Ran	PERSON	- som , a
New York	LOCATION	lawyer , with an introduction by Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		The reproduction of English and continental litera - ture in
Japan	LOCATION	is steadily increasing .

		Among works recently translated into Japanese are
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	's '' Man and Superman , ''
Hauptmann	PERSON	's '' Weavers , ''
Flaubert	PERSON	's `` Salambo , ''
Daudet	PERSON	's `` Sapho , ''

		The hundredth anniversary of the ''
Fort Dearborn Massacre	LOCATION	, ''
August 15	DATE	, fitly commemorated by the
Chicago Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	with appropriate ceremonies , is the occasion also of a new popular account of that historic tragedy '' The Story of Old
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	, '' written by Mr.
Seymour Currey	PERSON	and published by
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume is illustrated .


Nashville	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, is the home of a number of authors of recent successful fiction .

		Mrs.
Cora Harris	PERSON	, who wrote `` The Circuit Rider 's Wife '' and `` The Recording Angel , '' Mr.
F. P. Elliott	PERSON	, who wrote '' The Haunted Pajamas , '' and Mr.
John Trotwood Moore	PERSON	, au - thor of '' The Summer Hymnal , '' etc. , are among those who are making of that old Southern city a new centre of literary activity .

		A new book by Mr.
Harold Bell Wright	PERSON	, the famous producer of '' best selling '' novels , is announced for the coming fall .

		Its title is '' Their Yesterdays , '' and the preliminary announcements claim for it a wide range of literary qualities , from those of '' The Lady of the Decoration '' to `` The Reveries of a Bachelor '' and '' Letters from a Self-made Merchant to his Son . ''

		The average annual expenditure , on the part of our public libraries , for books , periodicals , and binding , has been made the subject of some careful study by the librarian of the
James V. Brown	PERSON	Library of
Williams	ORGANIZATION	- port ,
Pa.	LOCATION	.

		From his researches it appears that for every hundred thousand volumes circulated in the one hun - dred and seven libraries of the
United States	LOCATION	that issue that number in the course of a year , there is annually spent
$ 3,199.00	MONEY	for the above-named purposes .

		Put in another form , this means that one dollar a year , wisely spent , will provide good reading matter for more than thirty persons .

		How to spend one 's vacation , and where to go to school or college after it is spent , are among the practi - cal concerns about which the Grand Rapids Public Li - brary offers to advise all comers .

		In its
July	DATE	`` Bulletin '' it calls attention to its guide-book collection whereby `` you can readily plan your vacation so as to get the most out of it for the least money , '' and to its stock of school and college catalogues from which '' one may learn some - thing of the character of the several institutions as well as the expenses . ''

		A new story entitled '' My Lady 's Garter , '' soon to be published by
Messrs. Rand McNally & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, derives a pathetic interest from the fact that its author , Mr.
Jacques Futrelle	PERSON	, lost his life in the Titanic disaster .

		The same firm will bring out Mr.
Eden Philpott	PERSON	's '' The Lovers , '' a tale of English prison life during the Revolutionary War ; `` Stories of the Pilgrims , '' a book for children , by Miss

		This it is which has set them in the vanguard of modern civilization , and made them the fount of vivifying and compelling ideas upon the highest of human concerns , the leaders of the world 's thought in matters of religion , ethics , and political contrivance .

		It is one aspect of this general truth which
Wordsworth	PERSON	so finely expressed in the lines : '' We must be free or die , who speak the tongue That Shakespeare spake ; the faith and morals hold Which
Milton	PERSON	held , '' and other aspects of the same truth will readily suggest themselves to the reflective mind .

		In the plays of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and the Authorized Version of the Bible we who are of English origin can boast possessions of richer value than are to be found in the literature of any other modern people , and should any branch of the English race forget to prize them at their true worth , or cease to hold them as inestimable trea - sures , such a lapse would be an ominous mark of spiritual decline , and of the breaking up of a solidarity as significant for the modern world as that of the .

		Roman genius was for the world of antiquity .

		There are signs that in this country we are losing our hold upon the English Bible , but
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	seems still to keep a secure place in our thought .

		Speaking of educational pro- grammes , Sir
Sidney Lee	PERSON	the other day urged the paramount importance of teaching Shake - speare in every school and college , no matter what else might or might not be taught .

		We are still reasonably faithful in following this pre - scription , although our schools show an alarming drift away from humanism into the bog of prac - ticality in their chase of the '' vocational '' will o ' the wisp .

		Our national record of devotion to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is fairly creditable , all things con - sidered .

		The puritan blight prevented his benign influence from making itself felt in our consciousness until something like a century ago , but when we found our way to him we took him 120 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, to our heart .

		The accomplished scholarship of
Verplanck	LOCATION	,
Hudson	LOCATION	, and
Richard Grant White	PERSON	was applied to his exposition and elucidation , and such men as
Emerson	LOCATION	and
Lowell	PERSON	paid him their tribute of belletristic appreciation .

		The greenest laurels of the American stage are those which have graced the brows of his interpreters .

		On the other side of the shield -LRB- but equally showing the extent to which he has occupied our minds -RRB- , we may instance
Whitman	PERSON	's rejection of him as the poet of '' feudalism , '' and the per - verse ingenuity of the adherents of the
Bacon	LOCATION	- ian delusion -LRB- cradled in this country -RRB- , of all mare 's - nests surely the most extraordinary to be found in the annals of human aberration .

		At the present day , the world of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	is busily explored by many thousands of school children and college students , and edition after edition of the plays come from the American press .

		Finally , it is to the researches of the American Professor
Wallace	PERSON	that we owe the most important of recent contributions to our knowledge of the poet 's life .

		These reflections are occasioned by the neces - sity for recording the death of our most distin - guished Shakespearean scholar , Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	, who passed away on the thir - teenth of
August	DATE	, at the age of seventy-eight .

		A son of
William Henry Furness	PERSON	, the famous Unitarian divine ,
Emerson	PERSON	's contemporary and friend , he was born in
Philadelphia	LOCATION
November 2 , 1833	DATE	.

		Graduated from
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	in
1854	DATE	, he numbered among his classmates
Charles Russell Lowell	PERSON	, General
John W. Ames	PERSON	,
Bishop W. S. Perry	PERSON	, Professor
Truman H. Safford	PERSON	, and many other distinguished men .

		A period of European travel followed , and then he returned to take up the study of law in his native city .

		He was admitted to the bar in
1859	DATE	, and the next year opened an office for the practice of law .

		He was eager to enter the army , but was prevented by the deafness which was to cut him off in such large measure from human intercourse for the rest of his life , and to make possible that concentration upon scholarly pursuits to which he was to owe his fame .

		He was by no means wholly removed from the affairs of men , and took a leading part in the relief work of the army and in the organization of the sanitary commission , besides carrying on his law busi - ness for some years .

		He was married in
1860	DATE	, and became the father of three children , all of whom have become distinguished .

		In his later years , he was the recipient of many honors , American and foreign , including the presidency of the German
Shakespeare Society	ORGANIZATION	, and mem - bership in the
American Academy of Arts	ORGANIZATION	and Letters .

		For the
last half century	DATE	, his life has been typically that of the scholar , tempered by sufficient outside interests to give it a pleasing variety ; and working quietly in his library , he has accomplished the monumental work to which he owes his fame . ''

		I 've acted merely as a pair of scissors '' was his own modest description of that work , of which he further spoke as '' serving excellently to keep an old fellow out of mischief . ''

		The world has taken it more seriously than that , and
America	LOCATION	points to it with pride as one of her greatest contributions to culture .

		His love of Shakespeare dated from his childhood . ''

		I was a boy in my teens , '' he said , '' when I first heard Mrs.
Kemble	PERSON	read
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, and from that moment I belonged to Shakespeare . ''

		As early as
1850	DATE	, he made a special study of `` Hamlet , '' collecting and collating for his own use the views of the earlier commentators , thus f oreshadowmg the plan which he was later to apply to the pro- duction of the great '' Variorum ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		The work gradually took shape in his mind , but he spent a score of years in study and the collec - tion of materials before he was ready to publish his first volume .

		That volume was the ''
Romeo	PERSON	- and Juliet '' of
1871	DATE	, foUowed by '' Macbeth '' in
1873	DATE	, '' Hamlet '' in
1877	DATE	, '' King Lear '' in
1880	DATE	, '' Othello '' in
1886	DATE	, The Merchant of
Venice	LOCATION	'' in
1888	DATE	, `` As You Like It '' in
1890	DATE	, `` The Tempest '' in
1892	DATE	, `` A
Midsummer Night	ORGANIZATION	's Dream '' in
1895	DATE	, '' The
Winter	DATE	's Tale ' * ' in
1898	DATE	, '' Much Ado about Nothing '' in
1899	DATE	, `` Twelfth Night '' in
1901	DATE	, `` Love 's Labour 's .

		Lost , '' in
1904	DATE	, and ''
Anthony	PERSON	and
Cleopatra	ORGANIZATION	' r in
1907	DATE	.

		The '' Variorum ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, as it now stands , consists of these fourteen plays , to - gether with the ''
Richard III	PERSON	. ''

		of
1908	DATE	, edited by Mr.
H. H. Furness	PERSON	, Jr. .

		The son , for some years past trained to collaborate with the father , may be trusted to carry on the work upon the same plan and in the same spirit .

		Let us trust that a descendant in the third generation will be ready to complete it fifty years from now .

		The volumes which we already have are marvels of exhaustive scholarship and models of conserva - tive critical judgment .

		The task of reading all that has been written about even a single play of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, of weighing it all and selecting what is worth preserving , and then presenting this sifted residuum in orderly arrangement , would seem to be a fair work for a lifetime .

		But Dr.
Furness	PERSON	did this fourteen times over , and with an intelligence , an authority , and a nicety of judgment that are likely to be the despair of
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 121 generations of scholars to come .

		It was a colos - sal achievement , and is not matched by many , either in this country or in any other .

		Dr.
Felix Schelling	PERSON	, who knew him well , thus writes of him in `` The Nation '' : ''
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	was an old-fashioned scholar , and an old-fashioned man .

		He recalled at all times that leisure is an essential of sound scholarship , not leisure to dawdle , but leisure to do what is to be done wholly and completely no matter what the time involved , leisure to read , to know , to be infinitely more than the narrow specialist , digging one ditch in oblivion of the world about and the sky above .

		His was the old-fashioned courtesy that has time to remember trifles and to be kindly to unconsidered persons .

		... I have never seen him angry save where some act of oppression or ungenerosity was in question and then his indignation knew no bounds .

		For the arrogance of petty scholar - ships he had an amused smile ; for even small , if genuine , accomplishment an ungrudging and instant recognition .

		His affections were always on the side of justice . ''

		This personal tribute fitly supplements the esti - mate of Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's scholarship ; for those who were privileged to know him , or even to hear him upon the rare occasions when he was per - suaded to read in public from his beloved poet , got an impression of a personality which over - shadowed even his immense reputation for learn - ing the personality of a kindly , genial , and benignant spirit .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		THE GENIAL MANNER OF A GREAT SHAKESPEARE SCHOLAR may do more to promote the study of `` Hamlet '' and `` Othello '' and all the rest of the imperishable thirty-seven plays -LRB- if that is the exact number -RRB- than will be accomplished by any amount of learning and critical acumen displayed in editorial prefaces and notes .

		But Dr.
Horace Howard Fur	PERSON	- ness , whose recent death in his seventy-ninth year is cause for deep regret , had both erudition and charm .

		Those who were privileged to know him in life can never forget the cheer and inspiration of his pres - ence ; those who have heard his public readings of his favorite poet will bear witness that they have carried thence a wonderfully quickened appreciation of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's genius ; and those who have read his commentaries -LRB- or any random passages of them -RRB- on the fourteen plays that came from his editorial hand in the great Variorum Edition now left in charge of the son , can not have failed to find a new and perhaps unexpected delight in those bugbears of the impatient , introductions and footnotes .

		Un - fortunately , the price of the Variorum volumes is such as to have rendered their popular purchase impossible , and not even all public libraries possess them ; and where the library does own them they are not seldom withheld from free circulation .

		Con - sequently many readers who would have enjoyed them have not yet had a taste of their fine quality .

		This may be a fitting occasion for giving a specimen of Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's art as Shakespeare-interpreter chosen from the last volume that bore his name as editor , the `` Antony and Cleopatra . ''

		Commenting upon the excessive ingenuity of some Shakespeare scholars , he exclaims , `` Much learning has made us mad ! ''

		and then continues : `` Even with more rea - son than in
Caesar	LOCATION	's character , is it necessary that we should accept Cleopatra , at
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's hands , with minds unbiased by history .

		We should know no more of her than we hear on the stage .

		Of her past , of her salad days , we should know nothing but what we are told .

		The first words that she and An - thony utter tell of boundless , illimitable love , and this love is maintained to the last throb of life in each of them ... Even in the scene with
Caesar	PERSON	's ambassador ,
Thidias	PERSON	, who comes to Cleopatra with overtures of peace and favour on condition that she will give up
Anthony	PERSON	, we knowing ones , crammed with history as pigeons are with peas , tip each other the wink and lay our fingers on our shrewd noses at
Cleopatra	ORGANIZATION	's evident treachery when she sends word that she kisses
Caesar	PERSON	's conquering hand , and kneels , with her crown , at his feet .

		But those who read the Queen only by the light thrown by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, see clearly enough that at this lowest ebb of
Anthony	PERSON	's fortunes this was the only course she could prudently take ; to gain time for him she must temporise with
Caesar	PERSON	. ''

		Has it ever before been
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's lot to fall into the hands of so richly appreciative an edi - tor , an editor so gifted with insight and humor and interpretative skill ?

		ARTISTIC DETACHMENT , or sufficient severance of self from the product of one 's pen -LRB- or brush , or chisel , as the case may be -RRB- to enable one to attain the impersonal standpoint and to view with equal calm both praise and censure of one 's work , can only come with entire and unselfish devotion to art .

		In literary squabbles , of which the history of litera - ture is full , are to be found many striking examples of the inartistic attitude , the grievous lack of artistic detachment .

		When
Poggio Fiorentino	PERSON	and
Georgios Trapezuntios	PERSON	fell out -LRB- as we read of their doing in
Symonds	LOCATION	's `` Renaissance in
Italy	LOCATION	'' -RRB- over
Poggio	LOCATION	's translations from
Diodorus	PERSON	and
Xenophon	PERSON	, the two mighty scholars allowed their personal feelings to get terribly tangled up with what was at first a purely literary question .

		The Florentine seems first to have lost his temper .

		`` You lie in your throat ! ''

		he shrieked in an apoplexy of passion , whereupon the Greek boxed his ears ; then Poggio caught
Georgios	PERSON	by the hair , and the two learned professors fell to pommelling each other until they were separated by their respective pupils .

		In what delightful contrast to this stands , for example , Mr.
A. C. Benson	PERSON	's urbane attitude toward certain outrageously harsh critics of his '' Beside Still Waters '' !

		It is in a later book -LRB- `` At Large '' -RRB- that he ventures to offer a few remarks in reply .

		His unfailing good humor , even when he indulges in a little gentle sarcasm , is admir - 122 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, able .

		The passage is no longer brand - new , but is still worth quoting , even at some length .

		`` The book was carefully enough written , '' says Mr.
Benson	PERSON	, '' and I have been a good deal surprised to find that it has met with considerable disapproval , and even derision , on the part of many reviewers .

		It has been called mor - bid and indolent , and decadent , and half-a-hundred more ugly adjectives .

		Now I do not for an instant question the right of a single one of these conscien - tious persons to form whatever opinion they like about my book , and to express it in any terms they like .

		... I do not dispute the possibility of their being perfectly right .

		An artist who exhibits his paintings , or a writer who publishes his books , chal - lenges the criticism of the public ; and I am quite sure that the reviewers who frankly dislike my book , and said so plainly , thought they were doing their duty to the public , and warning them against teach - ing which they believed to be insidious and even immoral .

		I honour them for doing this , and I ap - plaud them , especially if they did violence to their own feelings of courtesy and urbanity in doing so . ''

		And after another half-page in similar vein , he con - cludes : `` I have no intention of trying to refute or convince my critics , and I beg them with all my heart to say what they think about my books , be - cause only by the frank interchange of ideas can we arrive at the truth . ''

		On paper , this sort of thing may look easy enough ; but when it is one 's own skin that is pricked the situation assumes a different complexion and one is more inclined to play the part of a Poggio than of a dispassionate lover of truth .

		.

		MEREDITH AND HIS MUSE , or , better ,
Meredith	PERSON	's attitude toward his muse , will engage the interest of those readers of his letters -LRB- now appearing , in selec - tions , in '' Scribner 's Magazine '' -RRB- who care for some - thing besides mere personalities in literature of this sort .

		His first love , poetry , was for obvious reasons often forced to give place to prose .

		In a letter of
1861	DATE	to the Rev.
Augustus Jessopp	PERSON	he says : '' As to my love for the Muse , I really think that is ear - nest enough .

		I have all my life done battle in her behalf , and should , at one time , have felt no blessing to be equal to the liberty to serve her .

		Praise sings strangely in my ears .

		I have been virtually propelled into a practical turn , by the lack of encouragement for any other save practical work . ''

		And a few years later to the same confidant : `` As to the Poems : I do n't think the age prosaic for not buying them .

		A man who hopes to be popular , must think from the mass , and as the heart of the mass .

		If he follows out vagaries of his own brain , he can not hope for general esteem ; and he does smaller work . ''

		Fur - ther on in the same letter : '' Between realism and idealism there is no natural conflict .

		This completes that .

		Realism is the basis of good composition : it implies study , observation , artistic power , and -LRB- in those who can do more -RRB- humility .

		Little writers should be realistic .

		They would then at least do solid work .

		They afflict the world because they will at - tempt what it is given to none but noble workmen to achieve .

		A great genius must necessarily employ ideal means , for a vast conception can not be placed bodily before the eye , and remains to be suggested .

		Idealism is an atmosphere whose effects of grandeur are wrought out through a series of illusions , that are illusions to the sense within us only when divorced from the groundwork of the real .

		Need there be exclusion , the one of the other ?

		The artist is incom - plete who does this .

		Men to whom I bow my head -LRB-
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Goethe	LOCATION	; and in their way ,
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	,
Cervantes	PERSON	-RRB- are Realists au fond .

		But they have the broad arms of Idealism at command .

		They give us earth , but it is earth with an atmosphere .

		One may find as much amusement in a Kaleidoscope as in a merely idealistic writer ; and , just as sound prose is of more worth than pretentious poetry , I hold the man who gives a plain wall of fact higher ` in esteem than one who is constantly shuffling the clouds and dealing with airy , delicate sentimentalities , headless and tailless imaginings , despising our good , plain strength . ''

		... THE TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF THE .

		HISTORY OF ART will be held this autumn some time in
October	DATE	, one infers from published announce - ments in the halls of the Royal Accademia de ' Lincei in the
Palazzo Corsini	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	.

		It is expected that the papers to be read will interest not only art - ists and students of art history , but also those who concern themselves with the spread of art instruc - tion in universities and schools generally .

		Papers and discussions will be grouped under four heads : 1 .

		The history of early Christian and mediaeval art to the end of the fourteenth century .

		2 .

		The fifteenth century .

		3 .

		The history of art from the sixteenth century to the present time .

		4 .

		Historico - artistic methodology ; care of works of art ; historical researches in technical methods ; general organiza - tion of the work of the congresses .

		In languages allowed , it will be a penteglot conference , Italian , French , German , English , and Spanish being the permitted tongues .

		Of especial interest to librarians , and to others who give their attention to the litera - ture of art , will be four expositions to be held in connection with the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, of photographic reproductions in one or more colors for the illustra - tion of works on art history ; of Italian periodicals , whether in course of publication or not , on the his - tory of art ; of publications not on the market , such as catalogues of private collections and sale cata - logues ; and , finally , of kinds of paper adapted for use in histories of art , such as insure , that is , dura - bility and neatness of photographic reproductions .

		Reductions in railway fares and free entrance to all government and municipal museums and galleries for the whole month of
October	DATE	are promised to members of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, subscription to which is twenty-five francs , or , to ladies accompanying a mem - ber , ten francs .

		Communications from those desiring to read papers , and from other would-be attendants , are invited by the executive committee , whose secre - tary is

		1912 . -RSB-

		123 THE AMAZINGLY PROLIFIC '' IBID , '' to whom we see more works attributed -LRB- in the footnotes of every third book we take up -RRB- than are now ascribed to Bacon by even the most zealous Baconian , has caused one of our correspondents so much bewilderment and such fruitless searching of biographical dictionaries and histories of literature that she appeals through us for any information concerning him that any of our readers may be able to furnish .

		She says in her letter : '' Some one told me one day , with a quizzical look which I could not understand , that Ibid was a half-brother to the Vide sisters
Vide Supra	LOCATION	and Vide Infra ; but that did n't help me much , since these same Misses Vide have caused me hardly less perplexity than has Ibid himself .

		Another informant assured me that ' Ibid ' was not a real name , but the pseudonym of Op
Cit	ORGANIZATION	, who was a Chinese -LRB- or was it Siamese ? -RRB-

		sage of the fortieth century
B.C.	LOCATION	, and great-grandfather of the almost equally famous Loc
Cit	ORGANIZATION	.

		But why do n't the reference books tell us some - thing about him ?

		Can you tell me whether there is any uniform and not too expensive edition of his works , and if so by whom it is published ? ''

		Pending more definite information , our correspondent will perhaps be glad to learn that she has companions in her perplexity .

		Not long ago a
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	student approached
Miss Mendenhall	PERSON	, of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, with just the same wrinkle in his forehead that ruffles our fair correspondent 's brow .

		Miss
Mendenhall	PERSON	relates the incident in ''
New York	LOCATION	Libraries . ''

		She says : '' The other day a student from
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	came into the library for help on a list of references in history which he was to read before writing a thesis -LSB- for a doctor 's degree ? -RSB-

		.

		He said , ' I have found most of the books in the
Colum	PERSON	- bia library , but there is one author I ca n't find any - where , and I have spent a good deal of time looking .

		He has a strange name and I have never heard of him as a historian , but he has written a good many of the books on my list ; his name is '' Ibid . '' '

		Strange that there should be such a conspiracy of silence concerning this able and eminent author .

		AN ENVIABLE READER , a reader with vision so quick , with retina of the eye so receptive , as to be able to take in a whole page at a glance , and with a memory capable of holding and repeating all that is read , is made the subject of an article in the `` Journal of the
American Medical Association	ORGANIZATION	'' by Dr.
George M. Gould	PERSON	, whose writings on eye-strain , as well as on
Lafcadio Hearn	PERSON	and other topics , have made him well known in the book-world .

		The reader he now describes is certainly of the sort to which most of us would like to belong in this age of more books , more really good books , than one can find time to do more than glance at .

		But that glance would suffice if one were like Dr.
Gould	PERSON	's `` Mr.
C.	PERSON	, '' who is said to be able to read several books at a sitting and to repeat without error all that he has read .

		Fond of poetry and novels , what a banquet of books he must have as he sits before his cheerful fire or steam radiator of a winter 's evening !

		As to Mr.
C.	PERSON	's peculiar eye-structure , it appears that some time in middle life he suffered a destruction of the central or '' macular '' portion of the retina of the right eye from inflammation due to eye-strain .

		The `` fixing '' part , that is , of the retina was obliter - ated , and a round blind space was left .

		The other eye remained unaffected , and the patient continued to enjoy something like normal vision , until `` by long , unconscious and forced exercise , the healthy zone of the right retina surrounding the macular was educated to such a degree that it could , when unmoved , receive and transmit to the brain the im - age of the entire page , except that part falling upon the central portion , which had been destroyed , '' but which , of course , was helped out by the undiseased left eye .

		Here , then , is indicated a means whereby anyone might , perhaps , become a reader of more than Macaulayesque rapidity if he chooses to sub - mit to a little doctoring '' of one eye and to educate that eye in the proper manner afterward .

		A `` CLASSICAL FOUNDATION '' AS A `` PRACTICAL EQUIPMENT FOR LIFE 'S JOURNEY '' may to the `` prac - tical '' man sound too absurd even to laugh at .

		And yet so strenuously active and wide-awake and un - visionary a person as Mr.
James O. Fagan	PERSON	, railroad man , telegraph operator , traveller in two hemi - spheres , and `` self-made '' -LRB- as the saying goes -RRB- from boyhood , deliberately acknowledges his supreme in - debtedness to classical study as the groundwork of his training for the work he was to find to do in the world .

		In the
August	DATE	instalment of his '' Auto - biography of an Individualist '' in `` The Atlantic Monthly , '' dwelling on that part of his storm-and - stress period that was passed at
East Deerfield	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, he says : '' In presenting an argument , stating a case , or pleading a cause , other things being equal , I always attributed my intellectual advantage to the fact that in my youth I had received a thorough drilling in
Latin	LOCATION	and Greek , while my companions as a rule , in my line of life , had not .

		As a simple practical equipment for life 's journey , what may be called my classical foundation seems to me now to be worth all the other features of my school educa - tion put together . ''

		Readers of Mr.
Fagan	PERSON	's variously interesting and color-abounding chapters may thank fortune that his boyhood antedated the vocational school and the era of industrial training .

		A PROBLEM IN TRANSLATION that in all likelihood will never be satisfactorily solved has been attacked afresh by an English aspirant to honors in the field of Bible literature .

		Sir
Edward Clarke	PERSON	, an eminent barrister whose serious hours have been spent `` in endeavouring to put logical thought into clear , forci - ble , and harmonious language , '' regards this training as one qualifying him to render with precision and grace the Epistles of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	.

		Retaining , as he has tried to , the virtues of both the Authorized Version of
1611	DATE	and the Revised Version of
1881	DATE	, and avoid - ing their vices , he has produced a hybrid that can hardly fail to displease both those who cling fondly 124 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, to the familiar King James phraseology and those few who ask for a thoroughly modern style in their English Bible .

		Meanwhile the whole question at issue is well discussed by Mr.
Ernest E. Kellett	PERSON	, a schoolmaster and a student of literature , in a '' Lon - don Quarterly Review '' article entitled `` The Trans - lation of the New Testament , '' which scores a good point in calling attention to the substantial inaccuracy that often accompanies a slavishly literal rendering of a work in an alien tongue , and that does in many instances mar both the Authorized Version of our Bible and all versions that , like the Revised , are based upon it .

		Another point of Mr.
Kellett	PERSON	's is that the archaic style of both these versions , while generally appropriate to the Old Testament , is not the manner suited to the New , which is written in a dialect of Greek that was the vernacular of the time and place of writing as , it is claimed , certain re - cently discovered Egyptian papyri have proved .

		Yet , after all is said , it will be long before the ear will receive willingly any conspicuously modern idi - oms in the Gospels , or , indeed , elsewhere in the
Bible	LOCATION	.

		A modernized version of Shakespeare would not elicit more vehement protest . ''

		AN EPOCH OF SOLEMN AND INSANE TRIFLING '' is what ours is declared to be by the diverting and fertile author of `` Tremendous Trifles , '' `` The Man Who was
Thursday	DATE	, '' `` All Things Considered , '' and sundry other books .

		In this epoch , to which our brilliant paradoxologist must , chronologically at least , be said to belong , the late
Andrew Lang	PERSON	, he goes on to remark -LRB- in his
Lang	PERSON	obituary in `` The Illustrated London News '' -RRB- , labored under three disadvantages : he was universal , he was amusing , and he was lucid .

		As to universality , a quality less valued and under - stood now than in
Queen Elizabeth	LOCATION	's time , he pro- ceeds to say , in true Chestertonian vein : `` It would be useless , I suppose , to tell the modern critics that a man can not really be interested in Homer without being a little interested in Chinese teapots .

		It would be called paradoxical to say that every man who really thinks about the Stuarts must sometimes think about Spiritualism ... Folklore and fishing are really very near each other , both in the deeper mys - teries of nature and the superficial developments of lying . ''

		What a quantity of hitherto unsuspected resemblances and differences we should have gone to our graves without knowing anything about , had not Mr.
Chesterton	PERSON	been sent in the nick of time to point them out !

		After reading him , who is there but must feel , with
Stevenson	PERSON	, that in a world so full of a number of things we all of us ought to be happy as kings ?

		... A NEW LIBRARY BUILDING FOR HARVARD has at last been provided through the generosity of Mrs.
George D. Widener	PERSON	of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, mother of the late
Henry E. Widener	PERSON	who with his father went down in the sinking of the
Titanic	LOCATION
last April	DATE	, and whose bequest of his valuable library to the univer - sity from which he was graduated five years ago is already well known .

		One of the conditions of that bequest , it will be recalled , was that proper housing and care of the bequeathed library should not be lacking ; and this condition is now fulfilled by the testator 's mother , who will make the long-needed building a worthy memorial to her son by expending
two million dollars	MONEY	, if necessary , in its erection .

		Already the architects and the university authorities have consulted together over the location and general plan of the new building , and a site has been fixed upon extending from the present library southward .

		Mr.
Horace Trumbauer	PERSON	, architect to the
Widener	PERSON	family , is said to have been commissioned to draw the plans .

		And thus
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	's most urgent need in fact , the most urgent need one could point to in the whole library world after years of weary wait - ing is to be adequately , even magnificently , met .

		THE DEATH OF
JOHANN MARTIN SCHLEYER	PERSON	is announced by recent despatches from
Constance	LOCATION	; and so from this Babel of multitudinous tongues is removed the enthusiastic linguist who , a third of a century ago , conceived in one sleepless night the general outlines of what he hoped would prove a uni - versal medium of communication , binding all nations in a linguistic brotherhood .

		And , indeed ,
Volapiik	PERSON	did make rather astonishing headway at first , its grammar being translated into thirty-five languages , and its literary use extending into the magazine field until twenty-five periodicals could be pointed to as printed in this wonderful Weltsprache .

		ButSchleyer was not allowed to enjoy a monopoly in this tempting domain of world-language-making , and to-day the most vigorous rival of

London	LOCATION	,
August 14 , 1912	DATE	.

		Since I first began to write for a living -LRB- it is more years ago now than I care to set down in print -RRB- , a good many changes have overtaken the
London	LOCATION	journalist .

		Time was , in the early nineties , when the editor of a big daily made something of a figure in the land .

		He was the Editor : that was enoug ' * .

		When the brilliant amateur -LRB- myself for example -RRB- had an idea for a series of bright and epoch-making articles , it was into the Editor 's more or less receptive ear that he poured his tale .

		True , that gentleman was not always very accessible : even now , with his glory so sadly shorn , he occa - sionally thinks it good for the aspirant 's health to
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 125 keep him waiting half an hour or more in an outer room before admitting him into the majesty of the Presence ; but at all events , in those days , he was in command .

		He could do things on his own respon - sibility .

		I forget who it was who made the astounding discovery that the important man on a daily paper was not the editor but the business manager .

		Pos - sibly the business manager discovered it himself ; no doubt he had long suspected it , and doubt be - came certainty when he beheld the remarkable influence wielded by the late Mr.
Moberley Bell	PERSON	, then manager of `` The Times . ''

		For many years that remarkable man controlled the destinies of what we used to consider the first newspaper in the world ; and seeing the success with which he con - ducted its affairs it was not surprising that several owners of other journals began to dream of the simple economy of discharging their editor and appointing in his place the gentleman who looked after the advertisements .

		The natural result was a certain decentralization , a delegation of power to subordinates .

		The Sports Editor , the Literary Editor , the Art Editor , the Society Editor , all assumed an importance that they had not possessed before .

		With their rise the glory of the Editor - in-Chief has somewhat faded .

		And then , too , there were the leader-writers , now a decaying race .

		Time was when the young man , fresh from the university , looked toward journalism as a possible profession , or at the worst as a support while he was making his way to fame and fortune with the novels and poems that he wrote to please himself and posterity .

		The position of leader-writer on a big morning paper was one of the prizes of the profession ; grave and reverend elders were pointed out to him as having attained to this Olympian height , drawing handsome salaries for the privilege of instructing some thousands of breakfast-tables three mornings in the week .

		The good journalist then was the man who could be trusted to write on any given subject with an air of omniscience , an occasional touch of scholarship , and a graceful turn of wit , all in three paragraphs of approximately equal length .

		The leading article was heavy , and heaviness is now the unforgivable sin .

		Compulsory education and the cheap press have produced between them a class of reader who is incapable of assimilating a paragraph containing more than a single sentence .

		The old style of leader still drags on a precarious existence in one or two papers like `` The Times '' or `` The Morning Post '' ; the other papers have pro- duced a different and much shorter substitute , under a head-line that catches the eye of the most careless reader .

		For the morning journalist has had to find a form that would appeal not only to the leisurely citizen who can afford to give an hour to his paper after breakfast , but to the far more common case of the man of business who wants to learn as much as possible in the twenty minutes journey underground to his city office .

		And before this gentleman ap - pears upon the scene , there is the crowd of working - men who board the early trains , the throng of clerks and office-boys and shop-girls who have a halfpenny to spare for amusement and information .

		All of these want something that they can understand , and at a glance .

		The direct and simple appeal to them ; they are not yet capable of appreciating a closely reasoned argument .

		And one consequence of this is , that modern jour - nalism no longer affords a field for the accomplished writer .

		It is a commonplace that the man with uni - versity training is at a discount on the daily press of to-day .

		Literature is not wanted , but a well-known name at the head of a few disjointed notes is worth money .

		And this is how the Expert came into his own .

		Your well-equipped journal now must have its staff of Experts , qualified by actual experience to criticize the daily performances of golfers , cricketers , football-players , and other gentlemen who are in the public eye at the moment .

		Obviously it is far more interesting to the general public to know that the ac - count of the Test Match against
Australia	LOCATION	or
South Africa	LOCATION	is from the pen of some brilliant professional or amateur who has himself taken part in similar contests than to read some anonymous description , even by a master of the reporting art .

		But some of the players who have been dragged into the service of the cheap press for this purpose find considerable difficulty in stringing together the few simple sen - tences that are required .

		It is not unamusing to note the air of relief with which they employ , now and again , some outworn journalistic tag that has stuck in their memory .

		As to the golf expert , his name is legion .

		Mr.
H. H. Hilton	PERSON	, winner of championships at home and abroad , must be one of the busiest journalists alive , if we are to judge by the number of articles bearing his name that appear day by day in various papers .

		Yet it may be said for some of these golfing writers , at least , that they do not disgrace their new profes - sion .

		Some of them can handle the pen as well as the putter , or nearly .

		Indeed , Mr.
Horace Hutch	PERSON	- inson , the first of the tribe to adopt the journalistic habit , has written novels of some merit .

		He is a writer who happens also to be a prominent player of the game ; it is probable that in any case he would have produced books on something .

		But the editing of the Badminton book on golf was placed in his hands , and from that day his career was made .

		Golf had become an obsession ; golfers all over the coun - try demanded reams of gossip about their favorite pursuit ; to many , the name of
Horace Hutchinson	PERSON	stood for more in the world of letters than that of
George Meredith	PERSON	or of
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	.

		It must be confessed that the lot of the golf ex - pert is not an easy one .

		However well a man may know the game , however often he may visit new courses and play with local cracks , there must come a time when the task of turning out a column a week in two or three different papers begins to pall .

		He must long for a change of subject .

		Yet many of these gallant fellows carry on their business week 126 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, by week without a break for years .

		It is a making of bricks without straw , or , let us say , of soup without stock .

		For their business is not the mere reporting of games , but the collecting of gossip ; they have to start the golfing world talking on some new topic ; it is theirs to provide conversation for the club-houses of the kingdom .

		We need not be surprised that they occasionally take up curious theories .

		In a sort of despair , as the fateful day comes round , they will clutch eagerly at anything to fill out a paragraph .

		From the realms of sport , the Expert gradually made his way into other journalistic fields .

		About the beginning of this century , when the South African war was on , the craze for military experts on all the papers became ridiculous .

		Every little periodical must needs have its War Editor ; never before in the history of the world had there been so great a demand for military writers .

		Naturally , most of the officers in the regular army being away on service or on duty at home , the demand consid - erably outran the supply , and the strangest specimens were employed as military experts , men who had been in the ranks , or had held a commission in the volunteers , or perhaps had joined the college cadet corps when they were at school .

		The few real sol - diers who were about could almost command their own price .

		Those were great days for the man who had once been through a course of drill .

		I suppose it is much the same in all professions and in all countries .

		The general practitioner must give way to the specialist , and the man who intends to succeed in modern journalism does well to select some subject as early as possible and make it his own .

		Let him travel to
Asia	LOCATION	Minor or to the islands of the
Pacific	LOCATION	, to
Siberia	LOCATION	or the Argentine -LRB- for it is useful to have that touch of authority that comes alone from personal experience -RRB- , choose his district , and set to work to become the recognized oracle on his little portion of the earth 's surface .

		Or again , let him specialize on some such subject of general inter - est as airships or volcanic eruptions .

		He has but to read some standard work , to subscribe to a press - cutting agency , and to file his information neatly : in due course he will find his opportunity of enlighten - ing the world .

		Some day he may even write a book on his pet subject , and put up his prices accordingly .

		Most of the golf experts have done so already .

		That the trained writer should specialize , is well enough ; but I have some little grudge against the journalist who can not string together a couple of sentences without some blunder in the elements of construction .

		Modern journalism , I think , employs too many men who have nothing to recommend them but a certain proficiency at other pursuits .

		And these find their way not only into the daily press , but into monthly periodicals ; they even invade the domain of printed books .

		A cricketer takes out a team to
Australia	LOCATION	or the
Cape	LOCATION	, and on his return must needs publish a fat volume to celebrate the occurrence .

		There is enough bad writing in the world already , from various causes ; book-buyers are a steadily diminishing class ; they should be pro- tected from the assault of the incompetent amateur .

		Or perhaps it would serve if the Expert were taught the main principles of syntax .

		He has , in general , something to say , if he could say it without harrow - ing the soul of the grammarian .

		I am inclined to think , sometimes , that a standard should be set for all who aspire to see themselves in print ; there should be examinations held annually at local cen - tres , and no journalist or author should be permitted to practise without a diploma .

		The dentist , in this country , must have his license : the writer may set the teeth of the whole nation on edge without hindrance .

		LIBRAKIANS ' PENSIONS A LIBRARIAN 'S VIEW .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Permit me to offer a few remarks on the subject of pensions for superannuated librarians , as discussed in your '' Casual Comment '' of
August 16	DATE	.

		Neither legislative enactments nor the philanthropy of the millionaires offers even a flicker of expectation to librarians in need of pensions .

		In ihe case of legis - lation , the Public will see no reason why librarians , before other public servants , should be pensioned out of public funds .

		It would be very difficult to prove that librarians occupy a position that renders them sufficiently distinctive , whether qua invalids from stress and strain or in the role of martyrs to a system of insufficient remuneration , to deserve a benefit not gen - erally enjoyed by other educational workers .

		As for the philanthropy of the millionaires , let me say that while we librarians choose to be servants servants to our great cause , servants to the Public , servants even to the individuals amongst the Public we also hope to prove ourselves free men and women ; and to such the acceptance of personal charity is quite as painful as is the deprivation of opportunities for a full enjoyment of legitimate earnings .

		Most of us are plain persons with scant claims for distinction of any kind .

		Few among us possess a degree of scholarship equal to that of the average member of the learned or literary republic .

		But what - ever we are , is it not evident that we choose our vocation , and like it , and submit to the conditions that surround it ?

		Every calling has its own joys and sor - rows .

		We do not expect to have the former sharpened , or to have the latter blunted , through the spasmodic leniency of a moneyed power .

		I sincerely believe that the greater number of us will not await the maturation of a pecuniary endowment before undertaking some useful but unremunerative work .

		I likewise hope we shall not be found lingering at the door of men who are responsible for the very social conditions through which our wages , otherwise a fair recompense , are ren - dered insufficient for our decent wants .

		The problem of pensions for librarians had best be solved in the natural manner of cooperation .

		So much is known on the subject of old-age pensions and in - surance against invalidism , that a single and efficient system could easily be found .

		Libraries as institutions , and librarians as individuals , could by their own efforts
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 127 build up a pensioning agency which would accoinodate us all in a business way , on the evil day when we are graciously classed with '' worn-out tools '' a term that we may properly recognize by reminding its users of the fact that our toleration , through long exercise , has grown quite unlimited .

		The details of such a pension - ing system do not pertain here ; only let me say that they include a fund preferably formed by initiation fees , an institutional membership contributing in proportion to number of employees , a personal membership con - tributing in proportion to salary .

		Some compulsory features might attach to these memberships , and the business organization of the system might be vested with our very efficient national
Library Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		In some such way we might obtain what is admitted to be a dire necessity as long as the rule of millionaires prevails and our insane social conditions prevent us from personally providing for a care-free old age .

		It remains to be seen whether the necessity is strong enough to impel action .

		I freely admit that some of us are tired of awaiting remote possibilities , and are ready to apply business principles where tears and hopes hitherto have been idly wasted .

		A LIBRARY IN A POWDER MAGAZINE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The curious beginning of the
Chicago Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, which , according to an interesting note in THE DIAL of
July 16	DATE	, was once housed in an abandoned water-tank , is matched by the Library of the
Louisiana State Uni	LOCATION	- versity , which had its first quarters in an old powder - magazine .

		The
State University	ORGANIZATION	occupies the buildings and grounds of the old army post at
Baton Rouge	LOCATION	, which was abandoned as a result of the electoral contro - versy of 1876-1877 .

		The following extract from Fay 's '' History of Education in
Louisiana	LOCATION	'' gives a description of the library as it was from
1886	DATE	to
1903	DATE	. ''

		Far off to the northeastern corner of the garrison inclos - ure is a long , low building , entirely without windows , save for two small grated apertures at each of the narrow ends , while for entrance a heavy iron door is swung in the center of the southern front , a place more like a prison-house than a scholar 's quiet domicile among books .

		Few have ever seen such a building ; and as you enter for the first time it fairly oppresses you to observe that you pass through a doorway whose walls are five or six feet thick .

		Within , the room represents an equally strange sight .

		Along the walls book - shelves extend around the whole parallelogram , save for the trifling space of the small windows .

		The ceiling is so low that you can almost touch it at the bookcases , but it rises in low heavy arches , only to sink again archwise on massive square pillars in the center of the room .

		Thus are formed two long corridors with low arches that fall into a succession of vaults down the passage .

		The central pillars are girt around with square bookshelves , all with their burden of volumes . ''

		The building was the old powder-magazine of the bar - racks when soldiers , and not scholars , were stationed there .

		You would think it dark ; but the whiteness of the ceiling counteracts in some measure the deficiency of appertures for light , and on fair days , at least , one reads without difficulty until after sunset .

		So thick are the walls that it is cool there on hot
summer	DATE	days , and never very cold on the rawest days the
Southern	LOCATION	winter affords . ''

		Since the books have been removed to a more modern structure , the old powder magazine has been used as a storage place for agricultural implements , farm pro- duce , and Experiment Station publications .

		THE YOUNGER LIFE OF
FKIEDKICH NIETZSCHE	ORGANIZATION	.

		* From the all-alive and handsomely presented record of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's first thirty-two years , as given by his sister
Frau Forster	PERSON	-
Nietzsche	PERSON	, many will gain a new impression of a figure which popular imagination has vested with a somewhat sinister cloud .

		Everyone must be grateful for this proud and lofty nature , that '' never fell into the clutches of a great passion or of a vul - gar love , '' that gave the impression , at the time of its fullest maturity , of '' a being who had come direct from God 's hands , and was not yet soiled by the dust of the world . ''


Elizabeth Nietzsche	PERSON	, well known as the most consistent advocate and furtherer of her brother 's mission , is at her very best in this intimate story of the life she knew so well ; she unites a sweetness and vivacity of temper to frank reasonableness , and if she idealizes at times in showing too ample a belief in the plenary sufficiency of
Friedrich	PERSON	's message , it must also be noted that she nowhere intrudes her own personality into the well-proportioned portrait of the philosopher .

		In all that touches birth and breeding ,
Nietzsche	PERSON	was a Brahmin of the Brahmins : his family record showed a long line of gifted , high-minded , cultured ancestors , loyal and con - servative ; his earliest years were spent in an `` ideal parsonage '' at Eocken .

		The humbly - proud traditions of a family which '' found its pleasure in its own resources , '' which held its stock `` too good to lie , '' were fully sustained , in all their unpretentious aloofness from vul - garity , in the home of the widowed mother , who never spoiled her son by a blind maternal love .

		There were no peremptory commands laid upon the boy , whose innate purity , nobility , and profundity kept him from cheapening the family ideals .

		The household was completely dominated by a religious spirit , and at the close of his career
Nietzsche	PERSON	could say , `` The most earnest Christians have always been kindly disposed to me . ''

		It was the boy 's intention to become , like his ancestors , a Protestant pastor .

		His childhood was indeed enviable , rich in affection , responsiveness , variety .

		A certain melancholy and love of solitude was funda - mental to his nature , and a serious-mindedness in his studies which did not lead to priggishness .

Sturgis & Walton Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		128 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, Nowhere is there the record of more beauti - ful human relations than the perfect companion - ship always existing between
Friedrich	PERSON	and his sprightly and gifted sister , two years younger than himself , a partnership in plans , thoughts , and interests , passing the comradery between
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Cornelia	LOCATION	, or of Tom and
Maggie	PERSON	in `` The Mill on the Floss . ''

		At the age of ten ,
Nietzsche	PERSON	was already a boy of extraordinary gifts , a composer of plays and of serious music ; at a very early period we find the works of Goethe being used by his wise guardian to give him a feeling for what is high - est in language and rhythm an element in
Nietzsche	LOCATION	's subsequent power which can hardly be overestimated .

		At fourteen comes a distinct change in his course of life , in his departure for
Pforta	LOCATION	, the Rugby of
North Germany	LOCATION	.

		The educational ideals of this manly institution may well excite the envy of those who have at heart the education of American boys .

		About the time that young Nietzsche entered , the Rector wrote : `` Every Pforta boy leaves the institution with the definite stamp of a certain sound efficiency which lasts him throughout life ... Its pupils become complete men ; they are taught to obey the command and the will of their superiors , and are used to the severe and punc - tual fulfilment of duty , to self-control , to earnest work , to original personal initiative , as a result of individual choice in their work and their love of it .

		They are ac - customed to thoroughness and method in their studies , to rules in the division of the time at their disposal , and to a certain self-confident tact and fairness in intercourse with their equals . ''

		It need scarcely be added , in the words of Nietz - sche 's sister , that `` Pforta was not a school for softness , and under no circumstances flattered its gifted scholars . ''

		As in the English colleges , a wide independent reading of the classics was considered `` the thing '' by the pupils themselves .

		Many years after leaving the place ,
Nietzsche	PERSON	wrote of it : '' The most desirable thing of all is to have severe discipline at the age when it makes us proud that peo - ple should expect great things of us .

		... The same discipline makes the soldier and the scholar efficient ; and , looked at more closely , there is no true scholar who has not the instincts of a true soldier in his veins . ''

		With what avidity the boy craved after uni - versality is plain from the interests of which he writes : nature , art , languages , classical antiq - uity , natural sciences , and religion appeal to him , for he was `` a reverent animal . ''

		Before he was seventeen years old , he thus records his re - pugnance to attacking the foundations of current belief : `` Oh !

		destruction is easy , but construction !

		and even destruction seems a lighter task than it really is .

		... Force of habit , the need of striving after a lofty goal , the breach with every existing institution , the dissolution of every form of society , the suspicion of the possibility of having been misled for two thousand years by a mir - age , the sense of one 's own arrogance and audacity all these considerations fight a determined battle within us , until at last painful experiences and sad occurrences lead our hearts back to the old beliefs of our childhood . ''

		A few years later he puts the tragic modern crisis before his sister : '' Is it really so difficult simply to accept everything to which one has been brought up , everything which has gradually struck deep roots into one 's being , which passes for truth not only amongst one 's relatives but also iu the minds of many good men , and in addition to this , really comforts and elevates man ?

		... It is here then that man comes to the cross-roads .

		Do you desire spiritual peace and happiness ?

		very well , then , believe !

		Do you wish to be a disciple of truth ?

		so be it ; investigate ! ''

		The most important elements which came into young
Nietzsche	PERSON	's life at
Pforta	LOCATION	were his friend - ships for gifted and serious boys , and his pas - sion for Greek philology , for poetry and music ; he leaves the royal school in
1864	DATE	, un jeune homme bien eleve .

		His first university year , eagerly pursued in
Bonn	LOCATION	, showed an interesting attempt to iden - tify himself with the typical student-life , and a resultant moral recoil from the coarseness and `` beer-materialism '' of the group .

		At the Uni - versity of
Leipzig	LOCATION	, which he entered in the
fall of 1865	DATE	, his rich temperament came into posses - sion of its own under the nourishing influence of congenial professors and students .

		Two of the notable forces which wrought here were the play-house and the writings of
Schopenhauer	PERSON	, the prophet of sensibility and subjective emotion .

		During the intolerable months of service in the Horse Artillery , and while doing the hardest work of the stable , he writes : '' Concealed be - neath the belly of my steed , I whisper , '
Schopen	PERSON	- hauer , help ! ' '

		At twenty-four years of age the professorship of classical philology at
Basel	LOCATION	is thrust at him , so to speak , and the authorities at
Leipzig	LOCATION	award their brilliant pupil his Doctor 's degree without thesis or oral examination , on lui donneralt le bon Dieu sans confession / The productive and enthusiastic first years at
Basel	LOCATION	are adequately shown , with full indications as to
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's devoted activity .

		As a scholar he was intensely serious , but devoid of the slight - est vein of ponderousness ; he `` detested every kind of pose . ''

		We have a vivid picture of his service as attendant upon a military ambulance during the French war , with a significant experi - ence which throws a flash-light upon his later development : `` At last came the infantry , advancing at the double !

		The men 's eyes were aflame , and their feet struck the
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		129 hard road like mighty harnmer-strokes . '

		Then , ' said he , ' I felt for the first time , dear sister , that the strong - est and highest Will to Life does not find expression in a miserable struggle for existence , but in a Will to War , a Will to Power , a Will to Overpower ! ' ''

		Until his health began to fail -LRB- about 1875 -RRB- , these were full and most happy years ; it is pleasant to know that during the latter part of this professorship his devoted sister was able to provide him a thoroughly comfortable home , which was a hearth-side for the sprightly inner circle of friends , a group , by the way , which significantly enough got endless entertainment from Mark Twain : something which the body of professional `` scholars '' could not understand at all -LRB-
Emerson	LOCATION	, it might be added , had stood first on
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's reading-list at
Pforta	LOCATION	, and we find occasional mention of
Longfellow	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		With - out fuller discussion of the details of his work , it should be noted that his science , classical philology , was to him `` the serious aim of a life , pursued with ardor and devotion '' ; more partic - ularly was it his life-work to evolve the total ultimate significance of Hellenism for the race , when brought into vital relation to `` the true and pressing problems of life '' ; he had an insuper - able hatred for all `` philological '' pedantry .

		His first book -LRB- `` The Birth of Tragedy '' -RRB- bitterly opposed by many of the leaders of classical stu - dies , was an attempt to re-appreciate the entire Greek soul .

		Another of his most trenchant '' Thoughts out of Season '' `` called down '' Ger - man inflation at the close of the war .

		Through these happiest years of his life his crown of rejoicing was his friendship for
Richard Wagner	PERSON	.

		The gradual breach is well accounted for , and makes some sad chapters : not to speak of the contemptible professional jealousies of
Wagner	PERSON	-LRB-
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	dared not accept a congenial invitation to travel with a son of
Felix Mendels	PERSON	- sohn ! -RRB-

		, his demand was for a complete absorption of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's personality .

		The great disillusion came during the rehearsals at
Bayreuth	LOCATION	in
1876	DATE	: he found the Ring des Nibelungen `` simply exalted intoxication with no suggestion of ex - uberant Dionysian vitality '' ; he was thoroughly repelled by `` the preponderance of ugliness , grotesqueness , and strong pepper . ''

		With this great disappointment the first volume closes .

		The whole document impresses us with its truth , freshness , and immediateness of effect .

		The `` ruthless ''
Nietzsche	PERSON	appears always full of delicate consideration for those about him , always insistent in his demand for whole-hearted friendship ; most characteristic and ingratiating is his almost miraculous gift of piano-playing a deeper index of his soul , perhaps , than many printed books .

		It is true that we see him be - coming the prophet of the glorification of self - sufficiency , protesting against `` smug routine and things allowed , '' impatient of any confu - sion of Immortals and groundlings .

		If we com - pare the bitter class-consciousness of socialistic labor-organs with the proud Will-to-Power of
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	, we may be terrorized at the prospect of an Armageddon which is to try out these colliding principles .

		But it is not necessary to take
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	's gospel too seriously ; it is sus - piciously akin to his `` intuition '' of an untamed strain of noble Polish blood in his veins ; it may better be thought of as the fling indulged in by the highly-wrought scion of a long strain of blameless pastors and model citizens .

		As a mat - ter of fact , our ruddy drop of common humanity far outweighs all the surging sea of social dif - ferences and contentions .

		Nietzsche was , in a word , a sensitive impres - sionist from the womb : impressionist in his idealizing of friendships , even in his reaction under the stimulus of a German corps-fest !

		He took over from here and there much more than he created out of his own vitals ; he is a sensitive recorder of fleeting moods , but none of these facts obscures the moving sadness of this man 's place in modern thought : '' between two worlds , one dead , The other powerless to be born . ''

		The translation is to be commended for its freshness and the movement of its style , though it now and then condescends to trivialities in diction , is somewhat uncertain in its English idiom , and often exhibits the British dislocation of the adverb `` only . ''

		Those trite stumbling - blocks pathetisch and genial appear serenely as `` pathetic '' and `` genial '' wie gebrduchlich ; on page 209
Burckhardt	PERSON	's name is spelled wrongly ; at the close of page 252 the unrecog - nized quotation from
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's Hqffnung is grotesquely mistranslated .

Chicago	LOCATION	:
A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		130 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, in that time , the industrial heart of the nation and the fifth metropolis of the world .

		Some there are still with us who recall vividly how in
1832	DATE	the inhabitants of the little settlement fled in terror to the sheltering walls of
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	before the threatened attack of the Indian , and then fled forth again in even wilder alarm before the deadlier peril of the Asiatic cholera .

		Red man and cholera alike have vanished in a transformation as astonishing as any in all world 's history .

		Probably no other event in the city 's past so appeals to the imagination of the Chicagoan of the present as does the
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	massacre .

		The force of this appeal is due to the fact that no other event so visualizes the gulf which lies between the conditions of the present and those of the past , so near in point of time , so remote in all other respects .

		To the many narratives of the massacre already in print has now been added another ; for approximately two-thirds of Mr.
Seymour	PERSON	's `` Story of
Old Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	'' is devoted to the story of the massacre and of the conditions attendant upon it .

		It may be pertinent to con - sider , therefore , whether the progress which has been made in other ways since the occurrence of the tragedy is reflected in the accounts which have been written of it .

		Aside from brief con - temporary notices , the first of these to see the light was the narrative of Mrs.
John H. Kinzie	PERSON	, which appeared anonymously in pamphlet form in
1844	DATE	, and was incorporated a dozen years later in the author 's more ambitious literary ven - ture , the book '' Wau-Bun . ''

		For a variety of reasons this narrative soon acquired an unusual prestige .

		By the massacre , the
Chicago	LOCATION	of
1812	DATE	had been blotted out ; the gulf between it and the bustling young city of the mid-century was bridged only by the representatives of the family into which the author had married .

		Socially prominent , her husband a charter member of the
Chicago Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, not backward about pressing the family claims to recognition , wielder of a captivating pen , claiming as no other could to speak upon the authority of participants in the massacre , there was none to rival her narrative .

		It was frequently paraphrased and quoted by other writers , and seems to have been regarded as containing all that could be known on the subject .

		For a generation after its first appearance its validity was not publicly challenged , although it is worthy of note that the indefatigable
Lyman C. Draper	PERSON	procured for preservation in his col - lection the judgment of the wife of Captain
Heald	PERSON	, who died in
1857	DATE	, that Mrs.
Kinzie	PERSON	's account was '' exaggerated and incorrect in its relation of the
Chicago	LOCATION	massacre . ''

		At length , however , some dissent from the general chorus of approval of its validity was manifested .

		In his quaint '' Chicago Antiquities , ''
Hurlbut	PERSON	some thirty years ago wrote himself down as a heretic in the matter in question , and a dozen years later
Kirkland	PERSON	's `` Chicago Massacre '' ex - pressed the conviction that Mrs.
Kinzie	PERSON	's narra - tive '' reads like a romance and was meant so to be read . ''

		Since then no other historian has entered the lists in support of these two , and the vogue of the `` Wau-Bun '' narrative still per - sists .

		No one who would understand the lit - erature of the
Chicago	LOCATION	massacre , including the present work , can ignore it , for it is the fountain - head from which practically all other accounts have proceeded ; while locally the public mind has become obsessed with it , as formerly on a national scale with the stories of the youthful
Washington	LOCATION	told by
Mason Locke Weems	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet from the serious historical viewpoint , the defects of the work are numerous and glaring .

		The perspective is distorted , the language extrava - gant , the antipathies displayed are violent .

		Motives are explained , orders reported , and con - versations retailed , which if they ever had a basis in fact could not possibly have been known to the author , in a way which might well excite the envy of the sober historian whose activities are limited by the necessity of finding an authority for his statements .

		To estimate `` Wau-Bun '' is to estimate the present work , for , the introductory portion aside , it is for the most part but a paraphrase of the earlier account .

		Rarely does the author 's con - fidence in his leader falter .

		In many instances even errors of detail , which might readily have been corrected by reference to well-known sources , are repeated .

		He finds a qualified justification for the course of Captain
Heald	PERSON	-LRB- pp. 55-56 , 105-106 -RRB- , but there is no more basis for the judgment expressed of him than for the sweeping condemnation by Mrs.
Kinzie	PERSON	.

		Even the most fanciful portions of the earlier narrative cause the author no hesitation .

		He repeats the grotesque story of the experiences of Sergeant
Griffith	PERSON	-LRB- pp. 161-162 -RRB- , and defends the cruel and incredible tale of the death of Doc - tor Van Voorhis -LRB- pp. 143-145 -RRB- .

		His mental atti - tude is perhaps best illustrated by his treatment of the evacuation order .

		If it be conceded that his excuse of ignorance of the character of the order offered in behalf of the mistatements of Mrs.
Kinzie	PERSON	which are based upon it is a valid
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 131 one , no such defense can be advanced for the author himself , who , in the face of full knowl - edge of the wording of the order , persists in re - peating a number of these misstatements .

		Since the order enjoined the destruction of the arms and ammunition , it is obvious that the story that
Heald	PERSON	promised to distribute the latter to the Indians , from which piece of folly he was diverted only by the remonstrances of
Kinzie	PERSON	-LRB- pp. 110-111 -RRB- , together with the statements concerning the resentment of the Indians over
Heald	ORGANIZATION	's `` deception '' when they discovered that they were not to receive the ammunition -LRB- pp .

		118-119 -RRB- , are inventions .

		The book abounds in errors of detail .

		La Salle reached the mouth of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	on
April 9	DATE	instead of
April 7 , 1682	DATE	-LRB- p. 9 -RRB- ;
Fort St. Joseph	LOCATION	was within the limits of the modern town of
Niles	PERSON	instead of at the mouth of the
St. Joseph River	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- p. 21 -RRB- ; the construction of thefirst
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	did not begin on
July 4	DATE	-LRB- p. 22 -RRB- , for the troops arrived at
Chicago	LOCATION	only on Aug - ust 17 ; nor was the fort ready for occupancy `` later '' in the
summer	DATE	-LRB- p. 25 -RRB- .

		On the con - trary , in
December	DATE	the soldiers were still living in temporary huts , and the fort was reported as `` not much advanced . ''


John Whistler	PERSON	did not remain in
America	LOCATION	at the close of the Revolution and marry in
Maryland	LOCATION	-LRB- p. 34 -RRB- ; rather , he re - turned to
England	LOCATION	on his release from captivity , where he eloped with a neighbor 's daughter and came again to
America	LOCATION	.

		After leaving
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	in
1810	DATE	he was transferred not to Fort
Wayne	PERSON	-LRB- p. 34 -RRB- but to
Fort Detroit	LOCATION	.

		The services of
General Dearborn	LOCATION	on the
Niagara	LOCATION	frontier were doubtless `` distinguished '' -LRB- p. 50 -RRB- , but hardly so in the sense intended by the au - thor .

		The battle of the Thames occurred Octo - ber 5 instead of
October 6	DATE	-LRB- p. 67 -RRB- ; the murders at the Lee farm were on
April 6	DATE	instead of
April 7	DATE	-LRB- p. 75 -RRB- ; and the name of the Frenchman who was killed there was not Debou but
John B. Cardin	PERSON	.

		The news of the declaration of war reached
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	some time before
August 7	DATE	-LRB- p. 102 -RRB- , and
Winnemeg	PERSON	did not arrive with the evacuation order until
August 9	DATE	.

		Instead of being nearly as old as Captain
Wells	PERSON	-LRB- p. 141 -RRB- , Mrs.
Heald	PERSON	was but twenty-two in
1812	DATE	.

		Mrs.
Helm	PERSON	does not mention any fighting done by Van Voorhis -LRB- pp. 143-144 -RRB- , whether `` gallantly '' or otherwise .

		Lieutenant Helm was not a prisoner prior to the general surrender -LRB- p. 147 -RRB- .

		Surgeon
John Cooper	PERSON	was not accompanied '' by his wife and two young daughters , '' nor was he among the slain -LRB- p. 153 -RRB- ; on the contrary he was un - married , he had resigned the service and left
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	over a year before , and he died peacefully in
Poughkeepsie	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, fifty-two years later .

		Let it be understood , however , that our gen - eral estimate of the book is not determined by these and other errors of detail which space fails us to mention ; rather it is conditioned by the author 's attitude toward his subject , which reveals no evidence of the exercise of a critical faculty .

		It can hardly be supposed that the last word on the
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	massacre was spoken by the first person who undertook to narrate its story .

		Handicapped as she was by the absence of libraries and the collections of historical societies , without access to government archives , relying for her information upon the recollections and traditions current in a single family , herself in no sense a trained investigator , it would be remarkable indeed if such were the case .

		The historian who to-day assumes the attitude that it was , may perhaps entertain , but he can hardly instruct , his readers .

		THE LYRIC IN ENGLISH POETRY .

		* ,
Professor Edward Bliss Reed	ORGANIZATION	is the first critic to attempt to give an account of the history of the English lyric .

		We have volumes dealing with one aspect or another of the subject Sharp 's study of the sonnet , Professor
Schelling	PERSON	's Introduction to '' Elizabethan Lyrics , '' Mr.
Chambers	PERSON	's '' Essay on the Mediaeval Lyric '' ; but almost all such essays are prefaces to collec - tions of poetry , not historical studies .

		A certain trial has already been made of Professor
Reed	PERSON	's volume , for it is a working-over of lectures given , for a series of years , to college seniors .

		The arrangement of topics in the ten chapters is according to the periods of literary history Old English , Middle English ,
Tudor	LOCATION	, Elizabethan , and on to '' The Lyric of To-day , '' where
Steven	PERSON	- son ,
Henley	LOCATION	,
Francis Thompson	PERSON	,
John David	PERSON	- son , Mr.
Watson	PERSON	, Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	, and other poets , receive discriminating tribute .

		One is impressed immediately by the orderly arrangement of the volume .

		No personal enthu - siasms have led Prof essor Reed to over-emphasize any of the poets ; he has shown an admirable sense of proportion .

		Only in a few cases is a reader likely to take issue with the critic 's judg - ments , for time-honored favorites are given ap - * ENGLISH LYRICAL POETRY .

		From Its Origins to the
Present Time	ORGANIZATION	.

Edward Bliss Reed	ORGANIZATION	.

		New Haven :
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		132 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, preciative comment in a way which assures us that he has a keen and sensitive enjoyment of lyric poetry .

		Many passages there are which reveal his intuitive penetration , whether he is discussing `` The Seafarer '' or
Herrick	PERSON	's master - pieces ,
Blake	PERSON	's mysticism or
Landor	ORGANIZATION	's lonely classicism .

		Both for breadth of sympathy and for depth of knowledge of literature , Professor
Reed	PERSON	has the right to our most respectful atten - tion .

		He writes in an easy conversational man - ner , sometimes rising to passages of intensely interesting appreciation .

		One feels constantly that he knows his subject , that his observations are based upon long study of the poets as well as upon the judgment of other critics .

		At the pres - ent time , when there is such a decline in the pro- duction of the genuine lyric , it is pleasant to think that a book like this must of necessity quicken-appreciation of poetry and serve as guide to finer standards of taste .

		There is undoubted place for this history , not only in colleges but in the larger world .

		Anyone who publishes a work on the lyric must face the difficult task of so defining the type as to silence envious tongues .

		It is agreed that the lyric is our most perfect poetry .

		Pro- fessor
Reed	ORGANIZATION	's definition , as he summarizes it , is this : `` All songs ; all poems following classic lyric forms ; all short poems expressing the writer 's moods and feel - ings in a rhythm that suggests music , are to be considered lyrics .

		This threefold statement is not free from ambi - guity , and does not remove all the difficulties that arise in determining whether or not a given poem is to be con - sidered a lyric . ''

		And further : '' To sing with the infinite harmonies of rhythm and the melodies of rhyme ; to move by dim suggestion or to appeal with overpowering passion directly to the .

		feel - ings ; to present thoughts suffused with emotion or ideas that concern the reason chiefly ; to summon before the reader 's mind , by ' the magic incantation of a verse , ' ex - quisite colors and forms ; to touch the memory and stir the imagination this is but a faint description of the art of the lyric poet . ''

		In this charmingly phrased definition it is evident that the critic narrows his subject , em - phasizing the song quality overmuch ; and one is not surprised to find that he rules out of con - sideration such poems as `` Adonais '' and `` In Memoriam . ''

		Of course this has long been a debated question ; but if the lyric is an expres - sion , primarily , of emotion , can we classify these two poems as epic ?

		Length is no final criterion of the lyric .

		Regarding '' In Memoriam '' as a series of lyrics , do we not more fully grasp its true significance as a musical outpouring of
Tennyson	ORGANIZATION	's enduring feeling ?

		Grief as well as joy is the true matter of a lyric , and when we have love , grief , self-hate , a slowly dawning sense of brotherhood , and hope , all expressed in musical stanzas , with the aid of imagery subdued but always immediately effective , have we not lyric poetry ?

		And can those magnificent lines in `` Adonais '' that soar into the empyrean of im - aginative passion , be anything but lyric , as they set the reader quivering in an emotional response which transcends any effect known to the epic ?

		Depth and intensity belong to the lyric , and a strong note of ardent complex life often destroys the extreme clarity which to many people is an essential to true lyric poetry .

		Inasmuch as the lyric is personal , individual , temperamental , we can not hope for a philosophy of its evolution .

		Only here and there can we trace obligations such as that of
Herrick	PERSON	to
Ben Jonson	PERSON	, or
Keats	PERSON	to
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, or Arnold to
Wordsworth	LOCATION	; or such influences as appear at times when certain conventions are dominant in an age .

		The interdependences of the religious lyric in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, the vogue of the son - net in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's day , or the triumph of the ode in the eighteenth century , may receive atten - tion ; but there is absolutely no way of finding one central underlying principle of literary evo - lution in the lyric .

		A book dealing with that theme must be more or less mechanical , moving by decades rather than by analysis of the develop - ment and growth of a stated form .

		The sonnet , the ode , may be treated with close investigation of shaping artistic process ; but in the general subject of lyric it must be a study of men , iso - lated , more or less unrelated .

		It is in this biographical , historical side of criticism that Professor Reed excels , rather than in the more aesthetic examination of art-impulse and of art-product .

		Although he continually refers to the external art-form , he does not , in many places , give us exact analysis of the sources of our enjoyment of this special beauty .

		Idea , feeling , rather more than expression , is his con - cern , and one can not fail to be somewhat dis - appointed that so little is done to reveal this mystery of creation where the imagination is supreme .

		The typical creative process , through the medium of the concrete , be it by simile , metaphor , personification , or by simple allusion , should be expounded if we are to understand the real significance of the lyric .

		Close study , at the outset , of a few representative poems would have illustrated the fundamental truths of the lyric impulse and its expression , and the reader would have been quickened to appreciate the illumination of spiritual experience through
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 133 sensuous appeals .

		As it is , these things are taken too much for granted , so that the reader really zealous for understanding must work out his own salvation , if he is to gain a right con - ception of the quick , passionate , imaginative beauty of lyric poetry .

		Some critical training must be the prelude to the deeper enjoyment of any art ; and as knowledge of technique of line , color , grouping , increases the pleasure in a paint - ing , so a knowledge of how to read , with the imagination trained and alert , is a preparation for keener perception of poetic form .

		It occasionally appears that the critic himself fails , in this book , to respond to the appeals to eye and ear , and for this reason expresses opin - ions which may arouse dissent .

		In discussing
Donne	PERSON	,
Herbert	PERSON	, and Wither , there is too little said about the kind of imagery employed , too little effort to vitalize the wayward and pictur - esque beauty of the `` Metaphysical School . ''

		Undoubtedly it does err on the side of the gro - tesque , but there is a richness of sensuous per - ception and a lofty spirit of symbolic meaning which we should cherish .


George Herbert	PERSON	's poems are more full of keen and suggestive metaphor than the critic would lead one to sup - pose , and the conventional quotations from his work are not enough to illustrate his delight in symbolism , as in '' Man is no star , but a quick coal Of mortal fire ; Who blows it not , nor doth control A faint desire , Lets his own ashes choke his soul . ''

		Wither , too , is treated rather unkindly , for his work has constant surprises of challenging figure ; even when he pictures love he gives a `` metaphysical '' addition , '' Great men have helps to gain Those favors they implore ; Which , though I win with pain , I find my joys the more .

		Each clown may rise , And climb the skies , When he hath found a stair ; But joy to him That dares to climb , And hath no help but air . ''

		When we read that
Shelley	PERSON	's '' Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air '' is '' an immortal line '' and '' one of the treasures of English literature , '' there is justification for irritated denial .

		The line is one of
Shelley	PERSON	's weakest , offending the imagination by its ludi - crous personification of feeding buds , a figure which degrades nature .

		Mr.
Reed	PERSON	regards the musical element as predominant , and does not give due importance to the fact that there must be the appeal of visible and tangible as well as of audible in poetry .

		This lack of visualization is apparent when he quotes , '' When yellow leaves , or none , or few , do hang , '' and then refers to '' the grays and blacks '' of the poem .

		In placing
Keats	PERSON	's '' Ode to Sorrow '' above the ''
Grecian Urn	PERSON	, '' he exalts an abstract eighteenth-century manner and a jingling rhythm above a singularly poignant and imag - inative lyric , where a remarkable power of in - terpretative vision is allied with a serene and haunting music .

		So too , in the discussion of the sonnets of
Sidney	PERSON	and of
Rossetti	PERSON	, the extracts quoted are all too often the less tremendous instances of a power of lyric expression which seized hold upon concrete images and gave them matchless music .

		Sidney 's sonnet on the
Moon	LOCATION	, will by some critics not be considered '' his fin - est , '' but because of its artificial sentiment will be placed below that nobler one , '' Leave me , O Love , which reachest but to dust . ''

		In the case of
Rossetti	PERSON	, a somewhat unfair esti - mate is made of his art when the critic writes : ''
Browning	PERSON	's lovers meet under the open sky , but
Rossetti	PERSON	takes us to a dim room , where we are overpowered by the incense burning at a shrine to
Venus Victrix	PERSON	. ''

		It is true that the fervid Italian temperament of
Rossetti	PERSON	enjoyed a certain richness of effect , but in the '' House of Life '' the majority of the figures used refer to nature , and keep the reader surrounded by the appeal of sun and wind and wave .

		What could be more powerful and more dominated by the finest spiritual truth of love than the lines in `` The Dark Glass , '' '' Shall birth and death , and all dark names that be As doors and windows bared to some loud sea , Lash deaf mine ears and blind my face with spray ; And shall my sense pierce love , the last relay And ultimate outpost of eternity ? ''

		It is inexplicable that no mention is made of '' The Monochord '' or of `` The Portrait , '' where the mystic yearning of
Rossetti	PERSON	's love is revealed in utmost sensitiveness .

		It is odd , too , that in the account of
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, giving warm tribute to her superiority over Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	, the most musical of her lyrics is not quoted , those stanzas full of concrete appeal and of deep elemental feeling , '' When I am dead , my dearest , Sing no sad songs for me ; Plant thou no roses at my head , Nor shady cypress tree : 134 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, Be the green grass above me , With showers and dew-drops wet ; And , if thou wilt , remember , And , if thou wilt , forget . ''

		I shall not see the shadows , I shall not feel the rain ; I shall not hear the nightingale Sing on , as if in pain ; And dreaming through the twilight That doth not rise nor set , Haply I may remember , And haply may forget . ''

		There are destined to be omissions in a work as brief as this , and if
Emily Bronte	PERSON	is neglected while
Stevenson	PERSON	's '' Child 's Garden of Verses '' receives a surprisingly ample notice , one must be content .

		The vogue of
Ernest Dowson	PERSON	's facile verses hardly warrants including his name in a work which omits
Eugene Lee-Hamilton	PERSON	and Mr.
Stephen Phillips	PERSON	, who have a genuine hold on life .

		The rigid exclusion of Irish authors robs the history of what would have been particularly important , the interpretation of the grave preci - sion of
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	's work and an account of the symbolic , impetuous beauty in the poems of Mr.
William Butler Yeats	PERSON	.

		These poets are partly English , by traditions of lyric art .

		Even if the epic manner has been too frequent in this book on the lyric , readers will find it both stimulating and steadying .

		Every lover of lyric poetry ought to read it , and meditate over it , for it is a loyal voicing of faith that the beauty of the English lyric is imperishable , despite '' The wreckful siege of battering days . ''

		THE '' NEW IDEA '' IN STATE GOVERNMENT .

		* Something more than a hundred years ago , the government of the
United States	LOCATION	was set up by the privileged classes .

		Its constitutions were consciously and purposely shaped for the restraint of excessive democracy .

		Although they did this while talking of the right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness , it is not fair to assume that the Fathers were outright thieves or canting hypocrites .

		Probably the majority of them honestly believed that such an arrangement was for the best interest of all the people .

		Did they not say that every man should have a chance ?

		And did they not give every man at least most white men a chance , by * THE
WISCONSIN	LOCATION	IDEA .

New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		the absence of a caste system ?

		Land-ownership and all industries were open , and political power was neither hereditary nor subject to any reli - gious test .

		What more could the laissezfaire philosophy do ?

		It had taken away the legal right of the government to hold a man down by
Force	ORGANIZATION	and by the hereditary claim of some to ride on the shoulders of others .

		That one man might , through the possession of Force -LRB- economic power -RRB- , mount on the shoulders of others was no concern of the government .

		It had given them the legal right to dismount him and rise by the same Force if only they could get it .

		The great expanse of open land and the ap - parently unlimited resources of our country en - abled men to escape in part from this
Force	ORGANIZATION	for a time .

		But with the ever-narrowing frontier , and the rapid strides of inventions which were protected by government patent and increased the Force of the few , escape became more and more difficult .

		After the Civil War , the gov - ernment became still more closely allied with privilege .

		Indeed ,
Big Business	ORGANIZATION	stepped in and took charge , arrogating to itself special favors through the tariff , land grants , and banking privileges .

		Our government became , more dis - tinctly than ever , one of the people by and for the privileged few who wield the economic Force of the land .

		At last the people began to realize that they were not getting a square deal , and to demand that their governments , both state and national , be wrested from the hands of the privileged few .

		Many problems were thought to be beyond the competence of the states , and more and more was demanded of the national government .

		But some still had confidence in the states , and boldly struck out to obtain at least partial relief through them .

		Noteworthy achievements have been ac - complished in several states ; but nowhere have the results been more remarkable than in
Wis	LOCATION	- consin .

		That state has become an experimental laboratory , and the nation is looking on to see the process and obtain the results of the work - ing out of the
Wisconsin Idea	LOCATION	.

		So great is the interest in this that two books have appeared almost simultaneously with the design of par - tially satisfying the desire of the nation to know about this new Idea in government .

		What the
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Idea is , Mr.
Charles McCarthy	PERSON	, the author of one of these books , tells us in a few sentences .

		It is , in effect , that there should be no drones living off the toil of the many ; that `` prosperity exists for the benefit of the human being , and for no other purpose . ''

		`` If prosperity does not uplift the mass of hu -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		135 man beings , it is not true prosperity , however it may be counterfeited by a grand show of fair cities or the glory of its riches . ''

		Our civiliza - tion , he thinks , must be made to serve the wel - fare of each individual .

		The way to do this is to drive out the cheating rascals who have acted as judges ; protect the weak against the wielders of Force ; provide honest markets and exchanges and means of transportation ; and , finally , to teach the Man his rights as well as his duties as a citizen .

		Only a few of the things undertaken by
Wisconsin	LOCATION	for the realization of this end can be as much as named here .

		It has regulated the railroads and other public utility corporations so as to make them the servants and not the masters of the people .

		It has done this , not by prescribing in rigid law minute rules and regu - lations that all must follow whether applicable to them or not , but by creating a commission and empowering and requiring it to see that the corporations furnish adequate service at reason - able rates and without discrimination .

		Seventy -
five years ago	DATE	, in the Priestly case , the courts of
England	LOCATION	established the doctrine of assumed risks in industrial accidents , and this doctrine was quickly introduced by our courts into this country and by them was widely extended .

		At last
Wisconsin	LOCATION	created a commission to investi - gate the whole subject of personal injury , indus - trial insurance , and workmen 's compensation .

		After a painstaking study , it presented a report which resulted in laws shifting the cost of in - jury and pioneering the way for
State Insurance	ORGANIZATION	in
America	LOCATION	.


New York	LOCATION	enacted a Workmen 's Compensation act , only to have it declared unconstitutional on antiquated grounds .

		Wis - consin avoided the shoals of constitutionality by making it voluntary for employers to operate under the law , though virtually putting a pen - alty on them for not doing so .

		Her law stands , and has been copied by nine other states .

		Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	thinks the Employer 's Liability Law the `` greatest piece of legislation yet put forth in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	, and one which may be a long stride toward the solution of the whole indus - trial accident problem in
America	LOCATION	. ''

		Through the tax commission , and responsive legislation , tax burdens have been equalized with astonish - ing boldness and surprising justice .

		The latest experiment in taxation is the Income Tax law of
1911	DATE	, the outcome of which will be awaited with interest , since our state income tax laws have been failures almost without exception .

		To be awarded a gold medal by the
International Anti- Tuberculosis Association	ORGANIZATION	for the best law for the prevention or control of tuberculosis is an achievement worth while .

		Much of this has been accomplished by `` calling in the expert , '' as Mr.
Howe	PERSON	says .

		The experts have come mainly from the Uni - versity , which has become the '' nerve centre '' of the state , impelling it to intelligent action in many fields .

		It does this in two ways : by sending out graduates indoctrinated with the principles of good government , and filled with enthusiasm for it and by furnishing men for ex - pert administrative work .

		In
1910-11	DATE	, seven members of the instructional force were giving a part of their time to public service , and were being paid for both ; twenty-three others had definite official positions without any definite combination arrangement ; thirteen others , be - sides various members of the medical faculty , were serving the state bureaus in various ways when called upon ; and four state officers were serving on the
University	ORGANIZATION	staff without further compensation .

		Except from the members of the '' old guard , '' who do not like to see them - selves displaced , the chief complaint seems to be , not that these men are grafting , but that the stranger never knows where to find them whether at the statehouse or the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the greatest service of the
University	ORGANIZATION	has been in the democratization of learning and its application to the needs of everyday life .

		Its theory is that if the boy is to become a brick - layer he should be taught something more than how to lay bricks ; he should be taught buying , architecture , and the essentials which will pre - pare him for service in the civic body .

		After enumerating a dozen or more things such as improving seed-corn , grasses , orchards , the breed of horses and cattle , and giving a great impulse to the dairy industry Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	says : `` The question arises at once , ' But is n't all this materialistic ?

		Does n't the
University of Wis	ORGANIZATION	- consin spell ` cow ' ? ''

		With refreshing frank - ness , he answers : `` And what of it ? ''

		He is fully convinced that all this is worth while in itself , but that mere learning will be the gainer from it also .

		One of the remarkable things about the matter is that all of this has been accomplished without any such devices as the initiative , refer - endum , and recall , on which so much emphasis is laid in other progressive states , particularly
Oregon	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, and
Oklahoma	LOCATION	.

		Not until last year was an initiative and referendum amendment passed for submission to the people , and its form shows that it was designed merely to supplement , not to supplant , the legislature .

		136 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, Through the efforts of Mr.
La Follette	PERSON	and his co-workers , and by means of a primary-election law , the people recovered their state government several years ago .

		Now they have confidence in their legislature , because it goes about legis - lation in a scientific way and has accomplished good results .

		Both Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	and Mr.
Howe	PERSON	attribute this to the large German ele - ment in the state .

		These people fled from op - pression , and brought with them the scientific spirit .

		They saw that the great private interests won , not so much because of bribery as through the employment of experts who used skill in drafting bills and then backed them up with arguments which the ordinary legislator could not refute .

		The legislator was not hopelessly bad ; no one was there to answer specious argu - ments , or to point out the vicious features of bad bills .

		So the expert was called in against the expert , and a legislative reference library was created , where bills can be drafted with care , and information supplied on all sides .

		Probably more credit is due to this bureau than Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	, who has had charge of it since its creation , modestly claims .

		Both Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	and Mr.
Howe	PERSON	are filled with enthusiasm for their subject , and they have given us a very roseate picture of the results achieved .

		It does not appear that they have overdrawn the results in any case , but they have said very little about what yet remains to be accomplished .

		Both books furnish stimulative reading , and will be helpful to the serious stu - dent .

		Because he goes more into detail , and quotes more freely from statutes and reports , Mr.
McCarthy	PERSON	's work will be more helpful to the legislator seeking precedents ; but the latter will do well to have both books close at hand .

		class by itself .

		Since
Haeckel	PERSON	's early essays in this direction , no one has had the temerity to undertake the working out of so elaborate and comprehensive a family tree for the animal kingdom as is here set forth .

		While the main problem of this magnum , opus is the phylogeny of the vertebrates , the author finds it necessary or at least advisable before he finishes , to bring into the purview of his theory the whole animal world from the lowest to the highest forms .

		Briefly stated , Dr.
Patten	PERSON	's thesis , to the elaboration and support of which he has given the best part of his working life , is that those animals characterized by a backbone , or vertebral column , are the direct descendants , in the process of evolution , of the class of animals known as arachnids , which include such creatures as spiders , scorpions , and the horse - shoe crab .

		Now if one accepts the doctrine of evolution at all , as most people do , it is pefectly certain that the vertebrates must at some time have evolved from a preexisting invertebrate form .

		Various theories have been advanced from time to time in regard to which particular invertebrate class was thus distinguished in the evolutionary process .

		No one of these theories has ever found universal acceptance among zoologists , and Dr.
Patten	PERSON	's is not likely to be more fortunate than its predecessors , though it must be said that never has so cogent , com - prehensive , and well-sustained an argument been brought forward in favor of any particular invertebrate ancestor as that presented in this book .

		The difficulty confronting acceptance lies not in the argument so much as in the premises on which it is built .

		While Dr.
Patten	PERSON	argues vigorously , even at times warmly , in sup - port of the method of comparative morphology as a means of arriving at the truth respecting the course of phylogeny , it nevertheless remains a fact that biology gave this method a thorough and fair trial over a long period of years and found it essentially weak so far as concerns this particular point of phylogenetic synthesis .

		In the language of the bench , the data of com - parative morphology lack `` probative value . ''

		No biologist can fail to admire the patient , careful , and painstaking toil which has gone into the researches on which this book is based , nor the brilliant genius for morphological investi - gation which is displayed on nearly every page ; yet the final verdict on the main thesis , in spite of all this , must be '' not proven . ''

		`` Plant Life and Evolution , '' by Professor
Douglas Houghton Campbell	PERSON	, forms one of the volumes on `` The Philosophy of Nature '' in the
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL `` American Nature Series . ''

		The book is essen - tially an attempt to illustrate the general prin - ciples of organic evolution by reference to plants rather than animals .

		No American botanist is better qualified to undertake such a task than the author .

		The result is a valuable addition to the elementary popular literature on evolution .

		Following the introductory chapters on elemen - tary biological matters and the factors of evolu - tion , a rather detailed account is given of the course of evolution in the plant kingdom .

		In these chapters the author is at his best .

		A chap - ter on Adaptation gives an excellent review of the rich material offered by plants for the illus - tration of this fundamental characteristic of liv - ing things .

		This leads up to an account of the distribution of plants on the earth , and the fac - tors which have influenced it .

		The part which man has played , through his practise of the art of agriculture , in controlling the evolution of do - mesticated plants , is discussed .

		The final chap - ter deals in general terms , and very briefly , with the various general theories of evolution .

		To the series of ``
Cambridge Manuals of Science	ORGANIZATION	and Literature '' a volume entitled `` The Coming of Evolution '' is contributed by the dis - tinguished geologist , Professor
John W. Judd	PERSON	.

		The story of the part played by the geologists , particularly
Lyell	PERSON	, in laying the solid founda - tion for the idea of organic evolution , by demon - strating the fact of evolution in the inorganic world , is told in a very genial and entertaining manner .

		The last chapters review
Darwin	PERSON	's life and give a critical estimate of the significance of his work .

		`` The Theories of Evolution , '' by Professor
Yves Delage	PERSON	and Mile .


Marie Goldsmith	PERSON	, is an English translation of a work which has been very popular in
France	LOCATION	in the original
Flam	PERSON	- marian edition , and rather widely read elsewhere .

		The chief claim of the work to distinction rests on its detailed presentation of the Lamarckian viewpoint .

		This doctrine , which
Darwin	PERSON	once called `` nonsense '' -LRB- though he afterward appar - ently came to look more graciously upon it -RRB- , contends essentially that the direct effects of the environment on organisms not only may be inherited , but are inherited , and that in such inheritance is to be found a vera causa , if not indeed the chief cause , of organic evolution .

		It is to the French that we have long been accus - tomed to look for the most ardent advocacy of this viewpoint .

		All biologically inclined French - men appear to regard it a fundamental patri - otic duty to inherit their acquired characters .

		No more forceful presentation of the
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	- ian arguments has ever been made than that contained in this book , of which one of the most distinguished of French zoologists is the senior author .

		But still the case is just as weak as ever at the essential point namely , in concrete experimental demonstrations that acquired char - acters -LRB- in the technical sense -RRB- are really inherited .

		The evidence that they are has never yet been able to withstand completely and satisfactorily the searching criticism which has been brought to bear upon it .

		Mr.
Joseph McCabe	PERSON	, the well-known writer of popular treatises on evolution , and the trans - lator of
Haeckel	LOCATION	, has produced another volume , `` The Story of Evolution , '' which has a strong family resemblance to his previous output .

		This book aims to tell the story of evolution `` from the ground up . ''

		It begins , like Genesis , with primitive chaos , and ends with the future of man - kind .

		Like the traditional German definition of English philosophy , it has length and breadth .

		Written with a good deal of literary skill , it is `` easy '' reading .

		The field covered , however , is so wide including physical and geological evolution as well as organic that the treatment can not be , of necessity , anything but extremely superficial .

		The objectionable feature of this type of `` popular '' science is the altogether false perspective in regard to the method of science which it tends to emphasize .

		THE HISTORY AND ROMANCE OF FURNITURE .

		* Furniture , as the term is employed by mod - ern writers , is applied to those movable articles used in the home for personal rest , work , and pleasure , or for the storing of household requi - sites and ornament .

		These articles are almost invariably of wood , because of all the materials applicable to the interior construction and adornment of the home wood has been and still is man 's '' first favourite and proven friend . ''

		The history of furniture is therefore largely the history of man 's adaptation of wood to his home needs and adornments .

		This history begins with his initial step in the direction of civilization , and has developed with his home-making in - stinct .

		It has been influenced by climate , and * FURNITURE .

		138 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 1	DATE	, thus
Europe	LOCATION	rather than the Orient presents the chief field for its study .

		The Oriental still seeks rest upon rugs spread upon the floor ; and while floor coverings have been brought to the highest state of perfection in the
East	LOCATION	, little is to be found there in the way of furniture .

		Because of its close human association , fur - niture has become invested with a romance as well as a history .

		And because in its evolution it has engaged the attention of those skilled in the art of design , an added interest has been given to it , and thus it has become the object of the art student 's and connoisseur 's and col - lector 's zeal .

		So it has come to pass that of late years a literature of the subject has been developed , closely related to books on arts and crafts , though the sumptuousness of the volumes places them more in the category of art books .

		The two works now before us contain the latest word , full and complete , on the subject of historic furniture .

		Miss
Singleton	PERSON	is an acknowledged expert in this field .

		Of the numerous art guides she has written , five are upon furniture .

		Her present volume seems to be largely a compilation from her former books , intended to summarize and present a comprehen - sive view of the subject ; and she does this in a systematic and scientific manner .

		She is chiefly concerned with the classification of furniture by styles and schools ; and her first chapter , on that division of the subject , is as long as any two of the subsequent chapters .

		She finds furniture divisible , as architecture might be , into national styles , Egyptian , Greek , Roman ,
Byzantine	LOCATION	,
Romanesque	LOCATION	, and Gothic ; and the French and English styles are further capable of subdivis - ion by the political epochs in those countries .

		She also brings to notice a style called genre auriculaire , from the ear-shaped ornament em - ployed .

		The most interesting '' schools '' are named after the great eighteenth-century de - signers ,
Adam	PERSON	,
Heppelwhite	LOCATION	,
Sheraton	LOCATION	, and the three Chippendales .

		Her subsequent chapters are more specifically devoted to the development of the different articles of furniture , showing the evolution of one style out of its predecessor ; and the foreign influences , Chinese at one time , affecting the design of English furniture .

		Her final chapter , upon mirrors , screens , and clocks , exhibits the wide range of her subject .

		One hundred and nineteen full-page half-tones from photographs of furniture in the Metropolitan Museum and in the chief museums in
Europe	LOCATION	, and sixty-one text illustrations , help to make her volume a very satisfactory guide to a knowl - edge of the history of furniture .

		Mr.
Edwin Foley	PERSON	covers the same broad field , but in a different way , and apparently with a different object in view .

		He is an artist to whom the picturesque features of furniture make the strongest appeal , and emphasis is laid on the word `` Decorative '' in the title he has chosen for his two large volumes .

		Pie regards furniture chiefly as a manifestation of the art of the wood - worker , and aims to give a survey of the world 's beautiful woodwork .

		He gives an account of British domestic woodwork from the time of the introduction of printing into
England	LOCATION	and the building up of the home life , to the beginning of the nineteenth century ; with subordinate accounts of French , Italian , German , Flemish , Spanish , and Oriental furniture .

		His enthusi - asm for the English woodwork is manifest from his frequent reference to the eras of oak and walnut and mahogany in
England	LOCATION	, and the ex - tent to which he illustrates the different kinds of wood used in the construction and decoration of furniture .

		He scarcely refers to upholstery , or recognizes it as essential to furniture .

		The hundred full-page illustrations are from the au - thor 's own paintings , reproduced in color and mounted on gray cartridge paper ; and included among them are illustrations of different varieties of wood employed by the cabinet-makers , show - ing most accurately the peculiarities of their grain and color .

		The thousand text drawings are admirably illustrative of the different kinds of ornament and carving used .

		Further aids to a right understanding of the history of furniture are furnished in charts , tables , and diagrams , which show the evolution of the different articles of furniture , the different styles , the era in which each flourished , the different kinds of ornament employed , together with a glossary of terms and a bibliography .

		Altogether the volumes are made upon a very generous plan , with large pages , large type , and profuse illustrations .

		The lover of pictures , the connoisseur , the art stu - dent will find here much to interest and instruct .

		As reference volumes upon all matters connected with furniture , there can be no question of their

		THE DIAL 139 BRIEFS ox NEW BOOKS .

		`` The Strangling of
Persia	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Cen - .

		tu T Co ' -RRB- is a title th ^ t well describes the remorseless doing - to - death of constitutional government which Mr.
W. Morgan Shuster	PERSON	witnessed in the short term of his service as Treasurer - General at
Teheran	LOCATION	.

		Invited by the
Persian Cabinet	LOCATION	, through its
Minister of Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, to undertake the straightening-out of that country 's tangled revenue system , Mr.
Shuster	PERSON	, who had already had some years ' experience in the cus - toms departments of
Cuba	LOCATION	and
the Philippines	LOCATION	, pro- ceeded to
Persia	LOCATION	in the
spring	DATE	of last year , and with his assistants struggled against all sorts of vexatious and largely unforeseen obstacles until the combined opposition of the two European powers chiefly inter - ested in keeping
Persia	LOCATION	bankrupt and feeble com - pelled him to relinquish his hopeless task and return home .

		Eight months of intelligent and courageous striving against overpowering odds are to be placed to his credit , and his highly readable and apparently full and frank account of his peculiar experiences amid the jealousies and intrigues and multitudinous knaveries of an oriental capital shows him to be skilled in writing as well as in finance .

		In the story he has to tell ,
Russia	LOCATION	is of course the double-dyed villain ;
England	LOCATION	is the guilty accomplice , weak - kneed and thoroughly unheroic in every situation depicted ; and the liberty - loving constitutional party in
Persia	LOCATION	is the foully-wronged heroine calling in helpless agony for some hero to rush to her rescue .

		Five years of creditable effort at self-government preceded the tragic end ; but , as the author says , `` five years is nothing in the life of a nation ; it is not even long as a period for individual reform ; yet , after a bare five years of effort , during which the Persian people , with all their difficulties and har - assed by the so-called friendly powers , succeeded in thwarting a despot 's well-planned effort to wrest from them their hard-earned liberties , the world is told by two European nations that these men were unfit , degenerate , and incapable of producing a stable and orderly form of government .

		With a knowl - edge of the facts of
Persia	LOCATION	's downfall , the scales drop from the eyes of the most incredulous , and it becomes clear that she was the helpless victim of the wretched game of cards which a few European powers , with the skill of centuries of practice , still play with weaker nations as the stake , and the lives , honor , and progress of whole races as the forfeit . ''

		Mr.
Shuster	PERSON	prefaces his narrative with such brief outline of recent Persian history as its better under - standing requires , and appends various documents and other matter of a pertinent and interesting nature .

		Illustrations from photographs are lavishly supplied .

		To most readers the book will be an eye - opener , and it is hardly possible that its disclosures will not contribute in some measure to the right - ing of the grievous wrongs it so admirably , because tersely and without sensationalism , and with here and there a touch of grim humor , describes .

		Two books on a little-read author .


Thomas Love Peacock	PERSON	has a certain claim to immortality since his poems have been published among the cheap classics of the `` Muses Library , '' and two of his novels in `` Everyman 's Library '' ; but perhaps his especial glory is that reflected from his contribution to
Shelley	PERSON	's biography and to his being pilloried in the latter 's amusing letter to
Harriet	PERSON	, after the poet had run off with
Mary Godwin	PERSON	, as '' expensive , inconsiderate , and cold . ''

		Very few to-day read
Peacock	PERSON	's novels , and whoever went through his long poem `` Rhododaphne '' ?

		It is accordingly rather remarkable that two considerable books on his life and work should appear independently of each other at the same time , one entitled '' The Life of Thomas Love Peacock '' by Mr.
Carl van Doren	PERSON	-LRB- Button -RRB- , the other `` Thomas Love Peacock : A Crit - ical Study '' by Mr.
A. Martin Freeman	PERSON	-LRB- Kennerley -RRB- .

		As their titles indicate , the former is more especially a biography , the latter a literary appreciation .

		The former is much fuller in biographical detail , is more specific and more complete in its references to au - thorities , and it has a good bibliography ; the latter is more concerned with
Peacock	PERSON	's literary development through the phases of pseudo-classicism , satire , and romanticism , and shows less familiarity with the crit - ical work of his predecessors .

		The divergencies in matters of fact are comparatively slight .

		Both authors agree in regarding the two leading female characters of '' Nightmare Abbey '' as
Shelley	PERSON	's two wives , and not , as a writer in the '' Modern Lan - guage Notes '' -LRB- vol .

		xxv . -RRB-

		argues , as
Harriet	PERSON	and
Miss Kitchener	LOCATION	.

		Characteristically , Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	apparently does not know of this argument ; but his case in support of his interpretation is made more convincing than is Mr.
van Doren	PERSON	's for the same conclusion .

		The man
Peacock	PERSON	stands out more prominently in Mr.
van Doren	PERSON	's '' Life , '' and an exceedingly interesting character he is .

		`` Two neighbours were rowing by the house one evening , and ... one of them , not quite sure of their local - ity , asked the other in a tone of voice which should have been modified , ` Is this old
Peacock	ORGANIZATION	's ? '

		Before his companion could reply , a strong voice called from the garden , ' Yes , this is old
Peacock	PERSON	's , and this is old
Peacock	PERSON	, ' and ` old
Peacock	PERSON	' stepped irately out of the shadow . ''

		Mr.
Freeman	PERSON	, on the other hand , gives an excellent analysis of the significance in English literature of
Peacock	LOCATION	's novels . ''

		` Head - long
Hall	PERSON	, ' as it marked the author 's final stage from bondage to liberty , proclaimed at the same time the appearance of something absolutely new in English literature .

		... In style and manner , in the more restricted sense of the words , he still belongs to the eighteenth century , Fielding being his most obvious influence , especially noticeable in his careful and lucid accounts of unheroic events , in the epic style ... He belongs , in style and language , to a school ; but he borrows from no master .

		He lived intellectually , and , it is not too much to say , emotion - ally in ancient
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	and in
England	LOCATION	of the ` classical ' period . ''

Italy	LOCATION	,
Flanders	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
Persia	LOCATION	.

		She seems to be one of those `` tramp-souls , '' as she calls them , that '' have no home but the land which they never reach , '' although elsewhere she takes pleasure in regarding
Rome	LOCATION	as her abiding-place .

		Even the fatigues of travel in
Persia	LOCATION	, with its primitive modes of convey - ance and its still ruder hostelries , do but add zest to her adventures .

		Heat , cold , thirst , starvation , she says , fight with the body , but they are not enemies to the soul the spirit is free .

		One admires her stout heart and feels the warm human quality of the woman behind her gracefully-written chapters .

		Sor - row and suffering have been her schoolmasters , it appears , and have taught the lessons no others can teach .

		`` Fate has taken from me everything , '' she writes , but with some manifest exaggeration , `` every - thing that a human being can lose , and I can still say , ' Joy is mine , ' because I see the mountains around us are blue , ... '' The '' strangers '' with whom she makes acquaintance in her year of wandering , and with whom her pages make us acquainted , are of humble station and unbereft of charm and piquancy by any smoothing-out process of civilization .

		In fact , one of her chosen characters is a dog , and for the patient camels of the desert she cherishes a warm affection .

		Admirably executed are her brief impres - sionist sketches of all these personalities , and animal - ities , that appeal to her love of the distinctive , the picturesque , the unconventional .

		Entertaining , too , in a different way , are some of her passing reflec - tions .

		The unsettled and precarious condition of the Persian government strikes her as natural and salu - tary ; for '' governments , if allowed to keep in power too long , begin to take themselves seriously , to the detriment of the people .

		How wise the nations are who change them continually .

		How wise the Per - sians are ! ''

		By this token , then , the Latin Americans must be among the very wisest of the world 's nations .

		The author 's perfect command of English may be attributed to residence in
England	LOCATION	, which is referred to in her book .

		Her tasteful volume is a little mas - terpiece , in its way .

		Sources of religious insight and inspiration .

		The
Bross Lectures	ORGANIZATION	delivered every ten years at
Lake Forest University	ORGANIZATION	, and which have to deal with aspects of the philosophy and evidences of the Christian religion , were given last year by Professor
Josiah Royce	PERSON	of
Harvard	LOCATION	, and they are now published under the title `` The Sources of Religious Insight '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		By insight , Professor
Royce	PERSON	means `` knowledge that makes us aware of the unity of many facts in one whole , and that at the same time brings us into intimate personal contact with these facts and with the whole wherein they are united . ''

		By religion he means recognition of and reaction toward the fact that man needs to be saved .

		By salvation , however , the author does not mean escape from total depravity , but simply the gaining by man of `` some end or aim of human life which is more important than all other aims , so that , by comparison with this aim all else is secondary and subsidiary , or even vain and empty . ''

		As exploited in the pages of this book , this aim of life is loyalty to the uni - verse as the universe is conceived by the philosophy of idealism .

		Professor
Royce	PERSON	criticizes pragmatism at some length .

		While he acknowledges that all truth must `` work , '' or make some difference to our conduct , as the pragmatists assert , and that there are no pure operations of the intellect divorced from reference to action by the thinker , he claims that all these truths which do work do so in virtue of their agreement with a realm which is superhuman , above the level of individual caprice , the life , in short , of the world .

		And `` unless this life is more than merely human in its rational wealth of concrete meaning , we mortals have no meaning whatever . ''

		The problem of religion , then , is to come into the richest relations with this life of the whole .

		The path to such connection the author finds in the con - ception of loyalty .

		For loyalty is the one virtue which implies making the very best of one 's own powers , seeking all the self-perfection one can accomplish , and then using all one 's perfected self in the service of a power which is vast enough to claim the free allegiance of the whole soul .

		But temporal loyalties may conflict ; and so the further principle is deduced of loyalty to the cause of loyalty .

		Here , says Mr.
Royce	PERSON	, is a principle fit to be made the basis of a universal moral code .

		For through every special cause which claims the loyalty of the individual , his true cause comes to light as `` the spiritual unity of all the world of reasonable beings . ''

		While , of course , much of the work is conditioned by the au - thor 's philosophy which is by no means universally accepted the concrete character of much of it , and the spiritual fervor of nearly all of it , will commend it as a source of spiritual inspiration even to those who do not agree with its intellectual premises .

		Especially is this true of his chapter on Sorrow as a means of religious insight .

		of the ages .

		Those who have written on the essence of poetry fall into three groups : valorous critics who think they have at last captured the volatile spirit of poetry ; critics who utter what in them lies , without insisting that they have solved the mystery ; and , finally , critics who begin by maintaining that poetry can never be satisfactorily defined .

		Professor
Arthur Fairchild	PERSON	, in his `` The Making of Poetry '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , clearly belongs to the last of these three groups .

		Setting aside the attempt to define poetry , on the ground that poetry `` begins and ends in feeling '' and that the nature
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 141 of feeling forbids definition , Mr.
Fairchild	PERSON	proceeds to analyze the material and the processes of poetry .

		The material , he finds , is `` the mental image . ''

		Of the processes , the first is `` personalising , '' a self - projection which puts the poet , as it were , into the things and persons that environ him , this self - projection being manifested by the images he uses .

		The second process is the combining of these im - ages .

		The third process is versifying , which , in the last analysis , has an `` enforcing effect upon the groupings of images . ''

		The three chapters devoted to these processes are the longest and most important in the book .

		They are followed by '' The Nature of Poetry , '' which does not improve upon what has been said on the theme ; `` The Need and Value of Poetry , '' poetry being `` a biological necessity , '' or , as Professor
Mackail	PERSON	would put it , `` a function of life , '' and having its value mainly in the fact that it contributes `` to the continuity and unity of con - sciousness '' ; and lastly , `` Some Forms of Poetry Examined , '' an indirect repetition of all that has preceded .

		From the foregoing bald summary one may at least discern Mr.
Fairchild	PERSON	's method that of the abstract system .

		The strength of the method lies in its strict logic and clear outlines .

		The author has evolved a system that is undeniably self - consistent and everywhere luminous ; in particular , the chapter on `` personalising '' and the chapter on versifying are admirably done .

		The weakness of the abstract system , when applied to poetry , lies in its antipathy to the spiritual qualities of high poesy .

		In his preface the author trusts that he may make us see more clearly the `` morning radiance '' that a good poem casts over life ; but too often , in the pages that follow , the morning radiance resembles the hard blue flame of the bunsen-burner .

		Poetry in a test-tube proves to be `` a biological necessity '' rather than `` the breath and finer spirit of all knowledge . ''

		We watch the `` raw material , '' the mental image , subjected to various processes until it is poured out upon a sheet of paper in the form of a genuine poem , Hence the formula , x + y + z = poem .

		That .

		the formula is correct is a fact that does not , somehow , enable us to read poetry with the `` joyous yet discriminating '' attitude which our author holds to be proper .

		The value of the book , indeed , resides , not in the lucid exposition of the mysteries of poetry , but in the thoughtful frame of mind that it induces in the reader .

		Too rarely do we think about poetry .

		In the preface to his book entitled '' The Anarchists '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , Mr.
Ernest Alfred Vizetelly	PERSON	claims the unique merit of supplying `` a history of their doings from the days of Baktinin . ''

		The history of a move - ment can not well be written until the movement is past , and well past .

		This , Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	argues , is clearly the case with Anarchism , or at any rate with that militant anarchism which pushed what was called `` the Propaganda by Deed , '' and which was responsible for the deaths of Carnot and
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	,
King Humbert	PERSON	and the
Empress Elizabeth	PERSON	, the last of which outrages occurred more than a decade ago .

		The assassination of the King of
Portugal	LOCATION	and his son was not due to Anarchists , the author is sure , but to Republicans .

		The long struggle between Socialism and Anarchism for the favor of the dissatisfied lower strata of society has already resulted decisively in favor of the former , and the world is to be saved not by abolishing government but by repressing the individual .

		The sub-title announces the author 's in - tention of dealing both with the Anarchists ' faith and with their record .

		The former is treated in a lumi - nous Introduction of twenty pages .

		The remainder of the book is a painstaking chronological account , carefully indexed , of all important and many unim - portant Anarchist manifestations , from the begin - nings of
Bakiinin	LOCATION	, who by a lifetime campaign in favor of violence earned the title of `` the Father of Modern Anarchism . ''

		Everything is done with edi - fying detail : if the student wishes to know how much
Meunier	PERSON	paid for rum at
M. Vdry	ORGANIZATION	's restaurant in the
Boulevard Magenta	LOCATION	, or what
Czolgosz	PERSON	had for breakfast on the day he paid the penalty for assas - sinating
McKinley	ORGANIZATION	, this book has the information ready .

		There is , in fact , so much of detail and so little of generalization that it might be better to ignore the author 's own classification and place it among the reference books , although there are pages which are breathlessly , if unpleasantly , inter - esting .

		Mr.
Vizetelly	PERSON	, a great traveller with con - nections all over
Europe	LOCATION	, actually witnessed the killing of Carnot , as well as a number of the other incidents mentioned ; and being , moreover , a man of catholic interests and unusual powers of observa - tion and retention , he furnishes an amazing amount of evidently first-hand information on the most vari - ous subjects related to his main theme .

		presented literary studies have probably won him more readers than have his romances , exquisite `` prose poems '' though these products of his other self are acknowledged to be .

		The spirit of his criti - cism is well indicated in a few words of his own , prefixed to the present volume : '' When I speak of Criticism I have in mind not merely the more or less deft use of commentary or indication , but one of the several ways of literature , and in itself a rare and fine art : the marriage of science that knows and of spirit that discerns .

		The basis of Criticism is imag - ination , its spiritual quality is simplicity , its intellec - tual distinction is balance . ''

		In turning his pages one can not but note his partiality to the more melo - dious or sensuous element in poetry , and his conse - quent fondness for
Rossetti	PERSON	and
Swinburne	PERSON	, the latter of whom he praises for his '' magnificence of music and splendour of imagery . ''

		One might per - haps pardonably comment in passing on certain occa - sional mannerisms of Sharp 's ; for instance , his use of the cumbrous circumlocutions '' anterior to '' and `` posterior to , '' when he simply means `` before '' and `` after , '' lacks the quality of '' simplicity `` which he himself so highly commends .

		The book supplies a need in gathering together in suitable form these excellent critical essays . ''

		The Last Episode of the French Revolution '' -LRB- Small ,
Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is the somewhat questionable title which Mr.
Ernest Belford Bax	PERSON	gives to his history of '' Gracchus ''
Babeuf	PERSON	and the '' Conspiracy of the Equals '' ; an ungrateful subject even for a radical writer , because the socialistic schemes of Babeuf were crude and his personality uninteresting .

		Mr.
Bax	PERSON	undertook the task to carry out a wish expressed by the late
William Morris	PERSON	that there might be in En - glish a reliable biography of Babeuf and a statement of his theories .

		Babeuf 's sole claim to distinction is as a precursor of the nineteenth-century socialists of the Blanquist type .

		Like some of the militant syndi - calists of the present day , he proposed to seize power and transform society by one great act of revolu - tionary violence , accompanied by a holocaust of the minions of the existing order .

		The Directory and the two Councils were to be '' immediately judged by the people , '' and any official , high or low , who attempted any action whatever , should be slain , as well as foreigners found in the streets .

		Mr.
Bax	PERSON	transcribes this from the `` Act of Insurrection , '' but finds the informer
Grisel	PERSON	's description of Babeuf as a '' blood-thirsty tiger '' unjustifiable ; as perhaps it was , for Babeuf seems to have been suffering from lack of imagination rather that from natural ferocity .

		Mr.
Bax	PERSON	, however , takes a critical attitude toward his hero 's notions of social reorganization , `` as if , '' he says , '' society could be voluntarily built up over - night , based on abstract concepts , and finished off in its details by the artistic sense of a few capable leaders . ''

		The conclusions of this book are based especially upon the journals and pronunciamentos of Babeuf and the narrative of Buonarroti , a fellow - conspirator .

		In the study of contemporary public opinion , Mr.
Bax	PERSON	might well have used Professor Aulard 's excerpts from the reports of the secret police , which would have guarded him against ac - cepting
Babeuf	PERSON	's estimate of the strength of his following .

		The conspiracy seems to have collapsed amid public indifference .

		Old Testament That the Old Testament possesses resemblances in many characteristics in common with other literatures .

		other anc i ent or i en tal literature is clearly evident to any reader of Mr.
R. W. Rogers	PERSON	's '' Cuneiform Parallels to the Old Testament '' -LRB-
Eaton & Mains	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The wide range of its mythological , literary , and historical material is paralleled in a marvellous manner by some of the choicest bits of ancient Sumerian , Assyrian , and Babylonian liter - ature .

		The creation of man and animals , the clash of good and evil , the stories of the deluge , have their counterpart in the mythology of the early inhabitants of
Babylonia	LOCATION	.

		Some of the far-famed mythologies of
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	are tame and com - monplace by the side of the Babylonian myths of
Adapa	LOCATION	, of
Gilgamesh	LOCATION	, of Ishtar 's descent into Hades , and of
Nergal	ORGANIZATION	and
Ereshkigal	ORGANIZATION	.

		The hymns and prayers of those old Mesopotamean worthies and monarchs rank high in comparison with the psalms and wisdom elements of the Old Testament .

		They addressed the numerous deities of their pantheon , and have embodied in their prayers the chief attri - butes and powers of each deity .

		The chronological material supplied in the Babylonian and Assyrian lists is among the most useful in fixing some of the hitherto aggravating chronology of the Old
Testa	PERSON	- ment .

		But the real wealth of the cuneiform literature for the Old Testament is found in the numerous his - torical texts reaching from
Hammurabi	PERSON	of the first dynasty of
Babylon	LOCATION	, about
2000	DATE	B. c. , down to
Cyrus	LOCATION	, 538s .

		c. a period of nearly
1500	DATE	years .

		Of nearly all the translations , done anew in this volume , we have the transliterations in footnotes , and full refer - ences , to other treatments of the same text .

		Forty - eight half-tone plates and a map decorate and vivify the text , and help make this an indispensable new tool for students of the Old Testament .

		Rambling letters from a wayfarer ^ ^ `` Scented Isles and Coral Gar - dens , '' of Torres Straits ,
German NewGuinea	PERSON	, and the Dutch East Indies , are combined by Mr.
C. D. Mackellar	PERSON	with accounts of travel along the Great Barrier Reef of
Australia	LOCATION	, and sojourns in
Singapore	LOCATION	,
Macao	LOCATION	, Hong-Kong ,
Canton	LOCATION	,
Shanghai	LOCATION	, and
Yokahoma	LOCATION	.

		It is the traveller 's Orient , with its more or less familiar stories , gathered afloat and ashore , which is here revealed .

		The picture of life aboard a coasting steamer flying the German flag is a more intimate account , as is also the portrayal of Conditions in German
New Guinea	LOCATION	in
1900	DATE	, when the colonies were making their first considerable inroads upon the jungle and its head-hunters .

		The author is evidently a keenly observant traveller , quick to
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL .

		143 detect the whims and foibles of his fellow tourists , to criticize the political and industrial policy of
Great Britain	LOCATION	or , rather , of the English , for the writer never forgets that he is a Scot , to commend German enterprise , and to pass his casual comment upon the industrial , commercial , social , and political condi - tions and prospects of the communities and races with whom he came in contact .

		A considerable amount of guide-book information finds its way into the book , but this is everywhere enlivened by the colloquial style , or by anecdote , verse , or jest , so that the reader is loth to leave the tale .

		The illus - trations are abundant , and , barring the crudely colored plates , well executed ; but the type face and often over-crowded lines detract from the reader 's pleasure in the use of the book .

		-LRB-
Dutton	ORGANIZATION	. -RRB-

		No insects exhibit more beautiful col - moSoii '' ors and color patterns than the moths , especially the large night-flying ones ; and few animals offer so entrancing a field for the amateur naturalist to pry into the secrets of nature and not only to bring to light worlds of hidden and unsuspected beauty but also to add to the sum of human knowledge .

		Mrs.
Gene Stratton-Porter	PERSON	, in her `` Moths of the Limberlost '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- , has rendered both services for these too little-known but very interesting creatures .

		No one can read her full accounts of her experiences with them , in egg , cat - erpillar , pupa , and full-blown moth stages , without catching her enthusiasm and straightway wishing for a swamp equalling the Limberlost in its treasures .

		The illustrations are abundant , though some of the plates of scenery are scarcely germane to the work .

		The coloration in most of the reproductions of the moths and caterpillars is excellent , although in some instances a certain haziness , due to technique , obscures details .

		Some crudities should have been eliminated in editing , as , for example , the use of `` organism '' for organ , of `` close `` for close to , as well as certain grammatical inaccuracies .

		The au - thor exhibits a fine scorn for the scientist and his shortcomings , and holds a brief for the nature-lover .

		Her observations are scientifically valuable , however , her narrative is entertaining , her enthusiasm catch - ing , and her revelations so stimulating that one readily forgives some minor defects in bookmaking .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Professor
James W. Garner	PERSON	's '' Government in the
United States	LOCATION	,
National	ORGANIZATION	,
State	ORGANIZATION	, and Local '' -LRB-
American Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is a high-school text book of the typical sort .

		It emphasizes the actual workings of government , and in its '' research questions '' puts a good many subjects for discussion and argument up to the student .

		Before one begins a serious and systematic study of social science he may be helped on his way by a concise sketch which will indicate the general direction he must take and the value of the study in relation to his own activities and interests .

		But such a sketch is by no means a substitute for scientific investigation of the fundamental principles of economics , sociology , and law .

		The experience of Mr.
William M. Balch	PERSON	, author of `` Christianity and the Labor Movement '' -LRB-
Sherman , French & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , has enabled him to interpret the subject to religious persons who have not studied it in a sys - tematic way , and he has done his work in a clear and forcible style . ''

		Modern Drama and Opera '' is a reference reading list piiblished by the
Boston Book Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and prepared by Mrs.
Clara Norton	PERSON	, Mr.
Frank K. Walter	PERSON	, and
Miss Fanny Elsie Marquand	ORGANIZATION	.

		Texts and critical reviews are listed upon the following authors :
D'Annunzio	PERSON	,
Haupt	PERSON	- mann ,
Ibsen	ORGANIZATION	,
Jones	PERSON	,
Maeterlinck	PERSON	,
Phillips	LOCATION	,
Pinero	PERSON	,
Ros	PERSON	- tand ,
Shaw	ORGANIZATION	,
Sudermann	LOCATION	,
Debussy	ORGANIZATION	,
Puccini	ORGANIZATION	, and
Richard Strauss	PERSON	.

		In a volume styled `` The Poet 's Song of Poets '' -LRB- Badger -RRB- , Mrs.
Anna Sheldon Camp Sneath	PERSON	does once more what has been done several times already collects into an anthology the best-known pieces `` in which the poets express their appreciation and estimate of their fellow poets . ''

		The subjects of these estimates range through English literature from Chaucer to
Browning	PERSON	.

		The sixteenth chapter of Dr.
C. Alphonso Smith	PERSON	's Amerikanische Literatur -LRB- already fully reviewed in these columns -RRB- is perhaps the most interesting in the entire book .

		It is a luminous discussion of the structure , philosophy , and history of the American short story .

		A translation of this chapter into English has been pub - lished separately by
Messrs. Ginn & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and should find a welcome both with general readers and in the college classroom .


Andrew Lang	PERSON	's last book , the history of English lit - erature announced a few days before his death , was for - tunately finished before the pen fell from his hand , and proves to be a volume of 700 pages -LRB- Longmans -RRB- , written with the author 's characteristic lightness of touch and easy command of his theme , but also with those occasional slight misstatements and questionable judgments which could hardly fail to appear in the pages of so rapid and prolific a writer .

		His assertion that
Emerson	PERSON	is now a dead factor in American litera - ture will evoke quick contradiction from not a few of his readers ; and his passing misquotation from Long - fellow 's '' Psalm of Life '' will be noted , with other slips of a similar sort , as justifying the '' Athenaeum '' in its recent reference to the demon of inaccuracy that so often sat at his side .

		But any Dryasdust can give us accuracy of detail ; only here and there a writer can charm us into indifference toward such small matters .

		Miss
Jennette E. C. Lincoln	PERSON	's researches in the open - air revels and games of
Old England	LOCATION	, and the application of the results of her researches to her work as instructor in physical culture , have well prepared her for the pro- duction of `` The Festival Book ,
May	DATE	- Day Pastimes , and the May Pole '' -LRB-
A. S. Barnes Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which will be found exceedingly helpful by all who are trying to make the out-door life of the young healthful and beau - tiful .

		The brief introductory chapter gives enough of a historical setting to stimulate interest in this form of pastime ; and to the materials derived from
England	LOCATION	in its pleasure-loving days have been added accounts of some folk dances from
Sweden	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, and elsewhere .

		By means of illustrations , diagrams , music , and minute instructions as to costumes , etc. , the beauties and plea - sures of the open-air pageant and festival are brought within the possibilities of all .

		BOOKS OF THE COMING YEAR .

		Following a custom of many years , we pub - lish in this issue of THE DIAL a classified list of the fall announcements of the chief American publishing houses , to serve as a guide for libra - rians and booksellers , and to whet the appetites of individual book lovers in anticipation of the literary feast which the coming months have in store for them .

		Likewise in accordance with our custom , we take this occasion to select from the thousands of titles offered a few of those that seem worthy of special mention for their promise of entertainment or instruction , restrict - ing our selection , however , to the categories of biography , history , general belletristic litera - ture , and fiction .

		It is a venturesome thing to guess at what is likely to prove `` the book of the year , '' but we shall probably not go far wrong in naming the `` Letters of
George Meredith	PERSON	'' for that distinc - tion .

		The collection has been edited by the son of the poet-novelist , and extends over a full half - century .

		Among those to whom the letters are addressed are Lord
Morley	PERSON	,
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	,
Frederick Green	PERSON	wood , and
Robert Louis Steven	PERSON	- son , and we may well believe that such corres - pondents brought out the best that
Meredith	PERSON	had to give .

		A few examples already published make it clear that he by no means kept all his good things for his books .

		An important work of American biography will be '' The Personal and Literary Life of
Samuel Langhorne Clem	PERSON	- ens , '' by Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	, the literary executor of the great humorist .

		`` The New Life of Byron , '' by Miss
Ethel Colburn Mayne	PERSON	, promises to discuss the ugly scandal first raised by Mrs.
Harriet Beecher Stowe	PERSON	, and revived by Lord
Lovelace	PERSON	's '' Astarte '' in
1905	DATE	.

		We hope that the author does not treat this unsavory matter seriously .


John Bigelow	PERSON	's ''
Retrospec	PERSON	- tions of an Active Life '' will be completed with the publication of two new volumes , making five in all .

		Miss
May Sinclair	DATE	's study of '' The Three Brontes '' will , we fancy , be chiefly inter - esting as a revelation of the writer 's own tempera - ment .

		A singularly interesting and readable volume of reminiscences will v be Mr.
James Kendall Hosmer	PERSON	's '' The Last Leaf , '' being '' ob - servations during seventy-five years of men and events in
America	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	. ''

		Mr.
Hos	PERSON	- mer 's association with the political and in tell ec - 180 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, tual movements of the past half - century has been intimate , and his memoirs can not fail to be illumi - nating .

		The '' Memoir of
George Palmer	PERSON	Put - nam , '' by his son Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	, will doubtless form a contribution to American pub - lishing annals of permanent value and interest .

		The department of history does not offer any work of forthstanding importance , but there are many special studies in restricted fields that promise to be of value .

		We note in particular the ``
New France	LOCATION	and
New England	LOCATION	'' of Mr.
James Douglas	PERSON	, the ``
Italy	LOCATION	in the Thirteenth Century '' of Mr.
Henry D. Sedgwick	PERSON	, and `` The Grandeur That Was
Rome	LOCATION	'' by Mr.
J. C. Stobart	PERSON	.

		We note also that the eighth vol - ume of Mr.
J. B. McMaster	PERSON	's '' History of the People of the
United States	LOCATION	, '' completing the work as planned over thirty years ago , and bringing it down to the outbreak of the Civil War , is now ready for publication .

		The category of general literature is mainly remarkable for its profusion of volumes of col - lected essays .

		Dr.
S. M. Crothers	PERSON	, Mr.
Mere	PERSON	-
dith Nicholson	PERSON	, Mr.
Brander Matthews	PERSON	, Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	,
Miss Agnes Repplier	PERSON	, Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	, Mr.
John Galsworthy	PERSON	, Mr.
Hilaire Belloc	PERSON	, Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, Mr.
Austin Dobson	PERSON	, ''
Vernon Lee	PERSON	, '' the late
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	, and
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	are all to be represented this year .

		This is a list to justify one in saying with Mr.
Squeers	PERSON	: `` Here 's richness ! ''

		We shall await with much interest such books as Mr.
Irving Babbitt	PERSON	's '' Masters of Modern French Criticism , '' and '' Some En - glish Story Tellers '' by Mr.
Frederic Tabor Cooper	PERSON	.

		A very attractive announcement is that of a series of critical studies in separate volumes of substantial size , of modern English writers .

		The forthcoming volumes have for their subjects Hardy ,
Pater	LOCATION	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
William Morris	PERSON	, and
George Gissing	PERSON	.

		Books about the theatre and books of plays fill a large place among our announcements .

		The most important is '' The Wallet of Time , '' by Mr.
William Winter	PERSON	, in which our veteran dra - matic critic reviews the history of the American stage from the time of
Junius Brutus Booth	PERSON	to the present day .

		This is likely to prove the crowning work of Mr.
Winter	PERSON	's life-long devo - tion to whatsoever things are lovely and of good report in our theatrical life . ''

		The Present State of the English Theatre , '' by Mr.
George Calderon	PERSON	, is another interesting announcement .

		The new translations promised from
Strindberg	LOCATION	and
Tchekoff	ORGANIZATION	will be welcome additions to the shelf of foreign dramatic literature .

		The plays of
Hauptmann	PERSON	are also being prepared for pub - lication in English .

		In poetry , by far the most important an - nouncement is that of the collected works of
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	, with a biographical introduction by Mr.
John M. Manly	PERSON	.


Moody	ORGANIZATION	's great dramatic trilogy , of which '' The Fire - Bringer '' and '' The Masque of Judgment '' were published during his lifetime , was left un - finished at his untimely death , but a considerable fragment of the closing section had been written , and this , together with a number of unpublished poems , will be included in the new edition , which will also include
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's two plays , '' The Great Divide '' and `` The Faith Healer . ''

		The two volumes of this edition will thus contain the practically complete work of the most remark - able poet given to English literature during the last score or more of years .

		Next in importance to this announcement is probably that of a new volume of poetic dramas by Mrs.
Olive Tilford Dargan	PERSON	, who is well known to the elect -LRB- although not to the general public -RRB- as one of the most remarkable poetical personalities of our day .

		The forthcoming volume will contain three plays in three distinct fields of imaginative interest .

		Two anthologies are promised which are likely to attract much attention .

		One is '' The
Golden Treasury	ORGANIZATION	of American Songs and Lyrics '' upon which Mr.
Curtis Hidden	PERSON	Page has been engaged for several years , and which is announced under exactly the same title as was given to a similar collection by Mr.
Frederic Lawrence Knowles	PERSON	some fifteen years ago .

		The other anthology is '' The Lyric Year , '' which is to represent one hundred living American poets by pieces entered in a sort of prize competition .

		The outcome of this experiment will be well worth observing .

		The fiction list is , as usual , of appalling length .

		Miss
Mary Johnston	PERSON	is to give us , in '' Cease Firing , '' the concluding section of her masterly study of the military operations of
Stonewall Jackson	PERSON	.

		A new novel by Mrs.
Mary S. Watts	PERSON	is promised , to be entitled `` Van Cleve . ''

		The late
David Graham Phillips	PERSON	, whose works go on forever , is represented by ``
George Helm	PERSON	, '' one of a numerous posthumous progeny . ''

		The Joyous Adventures of Aristide Pujol '' is to be Mr.
William J. Locke	PERSON	's vehicle of whimsical entertainment .

		Mr.
Maarten Maar	PERSON	- tens 's `` Eve '' will be a welcome offering from an author whom we would gladly read more fre - quently .

		In '' Marriage , '' we presume that Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	is to make another of his audacious contributions to sociological literature .

		A few more titles that seem promising are the follow -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE NOMAD IN LITERATURE .

		The recent publication of a biography of
George Borrow	PERSON	and of his Letters to the
Bible Society	ORGANIZATION	reveals the permanence of his fame and the interest the world takes in the Nomad in Literature .

		Hardly anybody needs a biography less .

		He lives in his own works as the victor over the Flaming Tinman , the unsatisfactory lover of
Isopel Berners	PERSON	, and the perfectly satisfactory Bible missionary to the gypsies and bandits and Jews of
Spain	LOCATION	.

		His first literary work was a compilation , in six volumes , of `` Cele - brated Criminal Trials , '' for which he received fifty pounds .

		His richer reward , probably , was the turn this work gave him for low life , picturesque adven - tures , and racy language .

		It is almost a disappoint - ment to learn that he settled down at forty and lived for forty more years as a country gentleman and au - thor , with no more vivid happenings in his life than quarrels with his neighbors and the critics .

		But he had his fling , and he endures , one of the classic wanderers of the world .

		The primal instinct of every healthy boy is to be a highwayman , a pirate , a hunter , anything which will take him away along the road that stretches before his door , over the waves that beat before his home .

		As he grows up , this instinct is crushed or stifled in him , and he becomes a tethered thing , a city dweller or a serf of the soil .

		In a few , the longing for the distant , the unknown , persists , and these develop into sailors , adventurers , explorers , tramps .

		Perhaps it is the nobler part to stay in one spot , to build up a home , to sink roots into the land , to become a citizen in all senses of that word .

		But to seek change and adventure and danger is certainly not ignoble : they who do it are the imaginative and poetical souls .

		For the things we see all the time we do not see at all .

		Revelation comes with the first look .

		It is true that familiarity breeds contempt .

		Things show most greatly by glimpses .

		Out of the haze of the unfamiliar leap appearances of beauty and power and strangeness that thrill the soul .

		The wanderer alone can be experienced and educated .

		His mind becomes a storehouse of inestimable treas - ures , a picture-gallery of impressions , a library of epics and dramas and lyrics which are all his own .

		What a splendid historic and literary ancestry has the common tramp , who skulks along the highway and bivouacs in the coppice beside his fire of dry twigs and his tin-can cooking utensil !

		There is
Ulysses	LOCATION	, whose vicissitudes and adventures go to form the typal song of the great open way .

		He , it is true , was not born to the trade of wandering .

		He was prudent , cautious , a getter of wealth , an accum - ulator of honors the
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	of anti- quity .

		But the anger of the heavens drives him forth , and he drifts over the face of the known world .

		What change , what variety , what experience !

		To be the companion of
Circe	ORGANIZATION	's herds , to recline beside Calypso in her island grot , to be cast up naked on the shores of
King Alcinoils	PERSON	' kingdom , and to sit at banquet and tell of his wars and wanderings while the most glorious girl in Greek literature watches him from a shadowed doorway and wishes like Desdemona that heaven had made her such a man !

		And then the long delayed home-coming , the slaughter of the Suitors , and
Penelope	PERSON	's welcome .

		Here Homer leaves him ; but the wiser
Dante	PERSON	-LRB- and Tennyson in splendid paraphrase -RRB- looks deeper into the heart of the much enduring , much experienced man , and doubting whether he who had known danger in a thousand forms , to whom nearly every new sun had brought a new difficulty or a new joy , who had felt the embraces of
Calypso	ORGANIZATION	and the maidenly regard of
Nausicaa	ORGANIZATION	's eyes , doubting whether such a one could rest in tranquil content with a wife grown old and an insipidly pious son , sets him to call his companions about him , hoist the sail on his galley , and steer out into the sunset sea .

		Then there is the Wandering Jew , who certainly ought to be elected patron saint of the tramping profession .

		He too , like
Ulysses	PERSON	, was pitchforked into the business driven forth under curse or doom .

		It would seem that the divine powers held homekeeping to be the normal state of man , and travelling a punishment .

		It is the tragic note , too , of
Ahasuerus	ORGANIZATION	's career which has been exploited by every writer who has handled the theme .

		But surely he must have got a great deal of enjoyment out of his never-ending experiences .

		For one thing , he has had time to exhaust the possibilities of life .

		For it is the deepest thing in the true nomad 's nature that he is avid of novel adventure .

		He is no sooner plunged into one experience than a better one seems to rise before him .

		There is a fairer valley on the other side of the hill , a fresh enchant - ment a little farther down the road .

		In his nine - teen hundred years of touring -LRB- if he is still afoot and faring on -RRB- , the Wandering Jew can easily have seen all that may be seen and done all that may be done on this earth .

		There is another feature of his career in which he is peculiarly typical , and that is his loneliness .

		Your true nomad always , at least where the thing is possible , goes alone .

		He needs detachment ; he needs to be eternally the stranger , really to know the novelty of life that rises around him .

		If he travels with companions , in companies , he carries his home-life with him ; he is protected against the new and the unknown .

		But it was in the
Middle Ages	LOCATION	, the time of Chivalry , that the nomadic cult was the most wide - spread .

		The books that composed
Don Quixote	PERSON	's 182 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, library Amadis of
Gaul	PERSON	, Palmerin of
England	LOCATION	,
Tirante	ORGANIZATION	, the White Knight , and all their companions , books which were the popular reading of
Europe	LOCATION	testify to this , as do the great romantic poems of Tasso and
Ariosto	PERSON	and the epics of
Charlemagne	LOCATION	and
Arthur	PERSON	.

		It was part of the education of a young knight to mount his steed and with his trusty sword and lance leave his home and wander far and wide , seeking adventures .

		And it was not only an unmapped but largely a roadless world he had to traverse .

		Through forest , over plain and mountain , he had to find his way a moving court of justice fighting wrongs , redressing grievances , encountering inimical giants or rival knights ; glad indeed if the legitimate spells he bore with him were sufficient to overcome the might of evil enchanters and magi - cians .

		And all the while his only correspondence with home and the lady of his fealty was the trains of prisoners he sent to bow before her feet .

		If his quest were the Holy Grail , he became a still nobler and higher figure .

		The Holy Grail !

		That it is , in fact , which all the nomads of the world are in search of .

		It may mask under a score of names the Passage to
India	LOCATION	, the
North Pole	LOCATION	,
Eldorado	LOCATION	, but ever there is the idea of something worthy the devotion of a man 's life , something whose winning shall be a crown to him forever .

		We may pass by those professional nomads , the gypsies , whose migrations thread through the ages , because they travel in companies and groups , and are therefore outside the pale of the true nomadic tribe .

		They have doubtless done the world good by letting a little mystery and a sense for the strange and remote into dull and settled communi - ties .

		And they have also done good by proving to the peoples of the roof-tree that fresh air is not exactly deadly .

		This last is the great merit of
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		That he upset the thrones of
Europe	LOCATION	is a little matter in comparison with his revival of the lost art of pedes - trianism , his teaching mankind that nature furnishes better employment for nose and eyes than the per - fumed and decorated apartments of the grand siecle .

		He also taught his fellows the cheapness of the most delicious pleasures the march along the tree-shadowed highway or through the flower - adorned wood , the halt by the
spring	DATE	or rivulet to bathe his feet and eat his morsel of bread , the talk with peasants or the picnic with damsels simi - larly astray , the bivouac under the stars .

		It is asserted , falsely enough , that nature came into liter - ature through
Rousseau	PERSON	.

		No age has been without its devotees of the open , and all that
Rousseau	PERSON	gives , and more , is in Homer and
Dante	PERSON	and Shake - speare .

		But he did for a time turn men 's thoughts almost exclusively natureward .

		Chateaubriand and
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	and
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Byron	PERSON	are his pupils .

		Childe Harold would hardly have left his ances - tral home if it had not been for the Swiss peasant .

		The greatest of modern knights-errant are the explorers and discoverers .

		The
North Pole	LOCATION	,
Africa	LOCATION	,
Asia	LOCATION	,
South America	LOCATION	, the
Pacific Islands	LOCATION	, all have furnished their quota of redoubtable spirits lured forth to seek danger and difficulty , the novel and the unknown .

		It is true that these have usually had companions ; but there is a loneliness of leadership , and
Stanley	ORGANIZATION	and
Burton	PERSON	in
Africa	LOCATION	,
Nansen	PERSON	and
Melville	LOCATION	and
Peary	PERSON	in the Arctic , are true to the most heroic nomad type .

		The mass of this litera - ture of exploration is great , and it would almost seem that to wander and adventure is the natural and primal instinct in man , that all settling down , building of homes and cities , the raising of families , the gathering together of material things , are repug - nant to the best of the spirit that is in him .

		This feeling is still more forced upon us when we consider the vast imaginative literature which may be classed as the wandering genre .

		Nearly all the great epics of the world are stories of travel and ad - venture .

		The ``
Ramayana	ORGANIZATION	, '' the `` Mahabharata , '' the ``
Shah Nameh	PERSON	, '' the `` Iliad , '' the `` Odyssey , '' the '' ^ Eneid , '' `` Jerusalem Delivered , '' ``
Orlando	LOCATION	, '' `` Paradise Lost , '' and others too numerous to be named , are dominated by the nomad star .

		The dramas of the world are more static ; they demand a fixed framework and a unity of scene which are in - imical to the peregrinating spirit .

		Yet even in the drama there are plenty of outlets for the nomad type .

		It is rather curious that ^ Eschylus brings into contrast and contact the most permanently fixed of all tragic sufferers , Prometheus , and the madly-driven world - circling lo .

		CEdipus is a wanderer , both when he commits his crime and when he expiates it .

		Shake - speare is never happier than when he can free his people from the bonds of home and society , and set them to wandering in the fields and woods , as witness the `` Midsummer Night 's Dream , '' `` The Tempest , '' `` Cymbeline , '' `` The
Winter	DATE	's Tale , '' and '' As You Like It . ''

		As for novels and romances , they are of adventure and wandering all compact .

		From the earliest one the `` Golden Ass '' to the latest best-seller , it is scarcely too much to say that nine - tenths of them turn that way .

		Run over the names of the great novels of the world ``
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' ``
Wilhelm Meister	PERSON	, '' `` The Three Guardsmen , '' ``
Tom Jones	PERSON	, '' one-half of
Scott	PERSON	, the best of
Dickens	LOCATION	, all are treatments of the wandering theme .

		If novels represent life , it would seem that we are a race of nomads .

		The wanderer at least is the hero of liter - ature , even if he is ineffectual and more or less of an outcast in real existence .

		Of course the centralizing and concentrating influ - ences of life are really the most powerful .

		They are necessities of our state ; the expansive and diverging forces are in comparison luxuries .

		In particular , woman is the type of home and society .

		Wherever she appears she is a centre around which a frame - work and a barrier are speedily erected .

		In conclusion it may be said that wide wander - ings are not absolutely necessary for the display of nomadic instinct .

		We may make discoveries at home .

		Each of us may be a

		THE DIAL 183 CASUAL COMMENT .

		INCENTIVES TO LITERARY EFFORT , as to exertion of whatever kind , must be candidly confessed to be largely of an unheroic and unromantic nature .

		It is the res angusta domi that is ultimately answer - able for the great bulk of the world 's noteworthy achievement .

		Whether churches would thrive on an income derived wholly from endowment , whether poets would sing if subsidized by the
State	ORGANIZATION	, whether publishing houses would raise the standard of litera - ture to dizzy heights if relieved from all concern as to book-sales , whether magazines and newspapers would attain to an unimagined excellence if perma - nently endowed , these are questions that will prob - ably for all time be open to debate , with strong presumptions in favor of the negative .

		Nevertheless , Mr.
Hamilton Holt	PERSON	, in an address before the recent national convention of newspaper men , allowed himself to take a roseate view of the possibilities of endowed journalism .

		He maintains : `` If a journal is to perform the two essential duties of careful news-gathering and competent comment , it must have an assured income of sufficient amount at the start to enable it to stand the stress of sensational and commercialized competitors and to demonstrate its usefulness to a large circle of readers all over the country .

		Once established and recognized as a truthful and important medium , it would have an enormous educational value .

		Though it might not be read by the millions , it would be indispensable to all libraries , journalists , preachers , teachers , the most intelligent professional and business men , and the leaders at least of the wage-earning class .

		It would also exert a great influence for good on other papers by forcing them to raise their standards of accuracy and fairness . ''

		After all , that is not a hope - lessly idealistic view of the possibilities of endowed journalism .

		** THE DESIRE FOR INFORMATION ON A GREAT VARIETY OF SUBJECTS , on the part of those whose indolence or inexperience makes them quite willing that others should do their research work for them , is probably manifest nowhere more than in the '' Questions and Answers '' department of a literary newspaper or the Reference department of a public library .

		In some of these journals , columns in each issue are given to such inquiries , suggesting the probable desire for material for essays , club papers , school themes , etc. , whjch can be obtained in this free and easy way .

		The questions that come , modestly but profusely , to the Reference department of pub - lic libraries are of wider range and usually of more curious interest than those that aspire to the promi - nence of print .

		The Annual Report of the librarian of the public library at
Santa Barbara	LOCATION	,
Cal.	LOCATION	, gives the following list of topics among those on which information was sought at that library in a single day : Date-palm culture ; open-air schools ; natural gas ; folding napkins at table ; spirit mediums ; the
Yosemite	LOCATION	; heroism of
Jack Binns	PERSON	; legends and super - stitions of precious stones ; steam boilers ; Roman home-life ; parcels post ; High Jinks of the Bohemian Club ; carriage painting ; the
Pentateuch	LOCATION	; canoes ; camels ;
George	PERSON
Washington	LOCATION	; author of the poem `` There is no death , '' etc. '' Many of these questions , '' says the librarian , `` are answered with the aid of the standard reference books and the indexes to peri - odical literature ; others involve search in out-of-the - way places . ''

		We should think they would !

		But in any case , the Reference department of a properly equipped public library cheerfully and eagerly opens its doors to just such inquirers as these , and the librarian stands ready to greet them with smiling mien and to lend a helping hand in their researches .

		To LOVERS OF THE ENGLISH LAKE DISTRICT , with all its precious associations , an appeal is made for help in preserving the region from disfigurement at the hands of builders .


Canon H. D. Rawnsley	PERSON	writes from
Crosthwaite Vicarage	LOCATION	,
Keswick	PERSON	, in part as follows : '' The head of
Windermere	LOCATION	, comprising the meadow land between the mouth of the river
Rotha	PERSON	and Waterhead , and including within its area the important Roman camp in the
Borrans Field	LOCATION	, was just about to be built upon ; indeed , the turf was off and foundations of two lodging-houses were laid , when the neighborhood woke up to the fact that un - less these twenty acres could be secured and handed to the custody of the
National Trust	ORGANIZATION	, there was an end for all time of the peculiar charm and beauty of the head of
Windermere	LOCATION	.

		Your readers will remember how attractive that beauty is as they ap - proach Waterhead near Ambleside by steamer from the south .

		They will call to mind the exquisite set - ting of the verdurous level with its background of Loughrigg Fell , and the blue hollow of the circling wall of
Fairfield	LOCATION	with its gray scars and dark woods above
Rydal Hall	LOCATION	.

		They will understand how , quite apart from the historic interest of securing the as yet unexcavated Roman camp , it is essential that the pastoral loveliness of that approach to the Ambleside valley should be preserved , and will not , I trust , be surprised that I urge
America	LOCATION	to help the old country for
Wordsworth	PERSON	's sake to preserve its ancient heri - tage of calm and beauty to succeeding generations . ''

		The writer of this letter , who signs himself as `` Hon. Secretary to the
National Trust	ORGANIZATION	, '' adds that twenty - four hundred pounds , of the four thousand needed to purchase the threatened piece of ground , has already been raised , the immediate vicinity contributing from its slender means three-quarters of the amount .

		Any Americans who '' have known the restf ulness of the as yet unspoiled parts of the English lake district , '' and feel prompted to aid in preserving that restful - ness , will earn the gratitude of all future tourists and sojourners in that peculiarly beautiful region of rural
England	LOCATION	... MACHINE-MADE FICTION has its ready market and its eager readers , as all the world knows , and as is made evident by the confessions of a plot-builder 184 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, who tells some of the tricks of his trade to readers of the
London	LOCATION	'' Answers . ''

		His brain produces plots with ease and abundance , but he himself can not so clothe them as to render them acceptable to editors and publishers .

		Therefore he sells these skeletons of stories and novels to writers of more skill with their pens , and his earnings amount to four or five pounds a week , the day 's work being often com - pleted before breakfast by this dextrous framer of plots at prices ranging from ten to twenty shillings , according to complexity .

		`` My principal client , '' says this ingenious craftsman , '' gets rid of about one hundred and fifty stories a year .

		He has a splendid style , and , singularly enough , although he possesses a vivid imagination , he is a bad hand at evolving plots .

		Give him the plot , and he will go along like a steam engine ... My clients number fewer than half a dozen , and if a plot does not suit one of them it will probaby appeal strongly to another , who makes a good story of it .

		So that a plot is seldom , if ever , wasted .

		What is more , it is possible to get at least four different plots out of one central idea .

		It can be twisted and turned about , given a different ending or development , and new names bestowed on the characters , and the trick is done . ''

		How beautiful !

		Perhaps some day there will be invented a mechanical contrivance for pro- ducing all the possible combinations of all the known elements of plot-construction ; then , with an adequate supply of phonographs , type-writers , and similar appliances , a fiction-factory ought to turn out hun - dreds of stories , all of standard grade and finish , every working day of the year .

		THE DORMANT LIBRARY TRUSTEE may be less worrisome to the librarian than the rampant or officiously meddlesome , fussy , and bustling trustee .

		For we have all kinds , including an increasing num - ber of intelligently active and helpful trustees ; but that they have more of this latter sort across the Canadian border than south of it seems to some observers to have been indicated by the quality of the attendance at the late
Ottawa	LOCATION	conference of library workers .

		`` The Library Journal '' says , in its ``
Ottawa	LOCATION	Conference Number '' -LRB-
August	DATE	-RRB- : `` One of the most interesting features of the
Ottawa	LOCATION	meeting was the large attendance of trustees , particularly from
Canad #	ORGANIZATION	.

		Over the border , the trustee has been quite as important as the librarian in developing the pub - lic library , and there has indeed been some question whether the librarian , as such , had not been too much subordinated by this fact .

		The contrary is true in the
States	LOCATION	, for here trustees are apt to confine them - selves to the finances of the library and not even support the librarian as they should by informing themselves of the practical work and giving it the strength of their well-informed support . ''

		The sad truth is that , on this side the boundary at least , politics plays havoc with too many a board of library trustees , as also with too many a school committee , and with other public offices of trust and importance .

		These positions are often sought as stepping-stones to something higher that is , more lucrative , and usually they are in part filled by ex-officio members with no especial qualifications for the work to be done .

		In general , smaller library boards of picked men -LRB- and women -RRB- are desirable .

		A MONUMENTAL INDEX to a monumental edition is that comprised in the final volume -LRB- the thirty - ninth -RRB- of the complete `` Library Edition '' of Rus - kin , edited by Sir
E. T. Cook	PERSON	and Mr.
Alexander Wedderburn	PERSON	.

		The index comprises seven hundred double-columned octavo pages of fine type , the num - ber of references exceeding 150,000 .

		Every topic treated or mentioned by
Ruskin	PERSON	, and every proper name mentioned in his works , are included .

		And this is by no means all .

		The topical references are so grouped as to form a practical analysis of Rus - kin 's teaching on whatever subject . ''

		I have left the system of my teaching widely scattered and broken , hoping always to bind it together , ''
Ruskin	PERSON	once said ; but there was no time in his heroically busy life that could be spared for such a project .

		Now at last it has been carried through by his devoted editors , and in a way that could not be bettered .

		The tangled tropical forest of
Ruskin	ORGANIZATION	's writings has here been tracked and charted for all time .

		As an instance of the appalling amount of labor expended in the making of this volume , it may be noted that of the thousands of quotations and allusions scattered through
Ruskin	PERSON	's books , all but sixteen are here traced and recorded !

		A supplementary volume -LRB- the thirty-eighth -RRB- contains , besides a complete anno - tated catalogue of
Ruskin	PERSON	's drawings , a Bibliography which for inclusiveness and exactness is not likely ever to be superseded .

		Thus is brought to a fitting conclusion one of the noblest memorials ever dedi - cated to a great writer , a labor of love on the part of editors and publishers not easily to be paralleled in modern literary annals .

		THE FINAL FALL OF THE AUCTIONEER 'S HAMMER ON THE HOE LIBRARY is announced by the Ander - son Company for the fortnight beginning
November 11	DATE	.

		Thus will end , after four memorable sales , the dispersal of the richest private collection of books and manuscripts ever sold in this country .

		From the day of the opening sale , when a copy of the
Gutenberg Bible	ORGANIZATION	brought fifty thousand dollars , the highest recorded price for a single item at a book - auction , the amounts bid for these literary rarities have been unprecedentedly large , so that the total sum realized by the completed sale is likely to exceed
two million dollars	MONEY	.

		Probably to most readers it would be but a tantalizing kindness to name here any of the choice items enumerated in the catalogue of this fourth and final section of
Robert Hoe	ORGANIZATION	's re - markable library .

		Forty-six manuscripts , many of them illuminated , are on the list ; also books from the libraries of
Jean Grolier	PERSON	,

Henry the Third	ORGANIZATION	, Louis the Fourteenth , Louis the Fifteenth , and
Louis	PERSON	the Eighteenth ,

		With both the Hoe and the
Huth	PERSON	sales in progress , millionaire collectors have ample opportunity to ease the congestion of their bank accounts ... A WARNING FROM THE `` ARABIAN NlGHTS , '' to be found in `` The Story of the Grecian King and the Physician Douban , '' needs to be occasionally repeated for the benefit of those unthinking readers who indulge in the practice of turning the leaves of books with fingers moistened by the tongue .

		The first part of this story , down to the
King	ORGANIZATION	's death -LRB- caused by his thus turning the leaves of the poi - soned folio -RRB- , might profitably be posted in libraries , especially in reading-rooms , perhaps side by side with the now familiar verses about the untidy Goops whose bad habits with books are held up to the rep - robation of all well-bred children and as a horrible example to the ill-bred .

		A lecture dealing in part with the perils lurking in the slovenly practice here referred to was recently delivered at
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
William R. Reinick	PERSON	, and has been published in `` The American Journal of Pharmacy . ''

		Although we moderns may be yielding to a tendency to make too much of a bogy of bacteria and microbes and germs -LRB- all undreamt-of by our hale and hearty ancestors -RRB- , still there is good sense in Mr.
Reinick	PERSON	's counsel to librarians to give due attention to the physical condition of each volume passing to and from the public .

		Frequent hand - washing on the part of library employees is advised ; and even a compulsory ceremony of this sort on the visitor 's part , before using the reference books , is suggested .

		The spread of tuberculosis is what is especially to be feared as a result of untidy habits with books .

		...
MR. SANBORN	PERSON	AT EIGHTY-ONE , or close to it , and with his vigor renewed , as is to be hoped , by the re - cent celebration of his golden wedding , presents a pleasing appearance to the mind 's eye in his
Concord	LOCATION	home , where he enjoys the distinction -LRB- not quite free from melancholy , it is true -RRB- of being the last sur - vivor of that illustrious company whose names are now mostly to be read on the grave-stones of Sleepy Hollow .

		He still continues his connection with the
Springfield	LOCATION	'' Republican , '' which he first served as associate editor forty-four years ago , afterward be - coming its regular contributor from
Boston	LOCATION	and Con - cord .

		The ''
Boston	LOCATION	Literary Letter , '' furnished by him once a week , has long been a prominent feature of the journal .

		In it he allows himself the privilege of his years and writes in a genially discursive vein , with splendid disregard of the ephemeral favorites of the book-world , and with a fine harking-back to whatsoever things are imperishable in literature .

		Those who visit him find him still reading the Greek classics as the rest of us read novels and contempo - rary memoirs .

		Turning the leaves of his two sub - stantial volumes of reminiscences , a rich store of unusually interesting memories , there come to one the words put by
Cicero	PERSON	into the mouth of the elder Cato : '' Fructus autem senectutis est , ut saepe dixi , ante partorum bonorum memoria et copia . ''

		A PUBLIC LIBRARY WITH NO DEAD BOOKS , that IS , with no books that have ceased to circulate , might seem , from all the recent criticism of the staleness and uselessness of much of the material that cum - bers the shelves of so many libraries , to be as rare as , for example , a city with no idle inhabitants , or a swarm of bees with no drones .

		But
Redlands	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, appears to be blessed with such a library .

		The collection numbers more than twenty thousand volumes , and its accumulation covers nearly a score of years ; yet we read in the '' Eighteenth Annual Report '' of the library : '' In making out the annual budget at the beginning of the calendar year , it was thought that the expense of a new book case might be avoided this year by the removal of some of the books which had not been used , to the basement .

		It was esti - mated that about 1000 books might thus be transferred , and by marking the catalogue cards , they could easily be found in case they were called for .

		But on looking over the shelves in order to weed out the dead material it was found that so few books could be spared from the shelves that almost none were suitable for the basement .

		This does not mean that all the books had been circulated , for it would have been com - paratively easy to find a thousand books on the shelves which had not been loaned for two years or more , but the condition of the books and the requests made at the delivery desk showed that they were very generally in use at the library .

		This seems to be an unusual condition of affairs , if we may judge from some of the criticisms reported through the press of the country that a fair proportion of the shelves of public libraries are loaded down with dead material .

		It also speaks most highly of the careful selection which has been made by the
Book Committee	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		THE
GOLDWIN SMITH	PERSON	LECTURES AT
CORNELL	ORGANIZATION	will be inaugurated under favorable auspices in the course of the coming college year .

		Professor
Albert Frederick Pollard	PERSON	, who occupies the chair of English history at
London University	ORGANIZATION	, has been invited to deliver the first series .

		An Oxford '' first-class '' scholar and a winner of various academic prizes , he has devoted his talents to the service of one of the people 's universities and has also made a name for himself as a well-equipped historical writer .

		In addition to his lives of
Thomas Cranmer	PERSON	and
Henry the Eighth	PERSON	, and his '' Factors in Modern History , '' and other kindred works , he has contributed some fifty articles to the new '' Encyclopaedia Britannica '' and what would amount to an entire volume to the '' Dictionary of
National Biography	ORGANIZATION	, '' of which he was assistant editor from
1893	DATE	to
1901	DATE	.

		Six chap - ters of the ''
Cambridge	LOCATION	Modern History '' are also from his pen , and volume six of the '' Political His - tory of
England	LOCATION	. ''

		One marvels at the extent and the substantial quality of his literary work work that , in a sense , must be regarded as executed with the left hand while the energy of his right is given to his professorship and to his duties as member of the
University Senate	ORGANIZATION	.

		Truly , it would seem that Professor

		THE APPRAISAL OF CONTEMPORARY GREATNESS .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		As your readers probably include many persons who might be interested in a project like the Modern His - toric
Records Association	ORGANIZATION	, will you permit me to make in your columns a mild protest against the note of flip - pancy that crops out in your otherwise pleasant comment -LRB- in your issue of
August 16	DATE	-RRB- on my letter to the
New York	LOCATION	`` Sun , '' and to correct some small errors that appear in your criticism .

		The collection of autographic utterances on parch - ment by men and women of genius is only a minor undertaking of our
Association	ORGANIZATION	.

		Its objects embrace the use of the photographic plate as the most durable means of preserving records and documents ; of the phonograph , for the preservation of the utterances of celebrities ; of moving-picture machines in obtaining records of important events ; and the application of all other suitable means for transmitting to posterity a vivid and comprehensive record of the life and civiliza - tion of the day .

		The names of our incorporators should be a sufficient assurance of the worth and dignity of our aims .

		These endeavors including even the '' diversion '' of obtain - ing autographic names have -LRB- and has -RRB- elicited the warm approval of Mr.
Frederic Harrison	PERSON	, who many years ago conceived an enterprise startlingly like our own , and wrote of it with eloquence heightened by humor in an essay entitled , `` A
Pompeii	LOCATION	for the
Thirtieth Century	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Respecting my list of so-called `` immortals , '' the attempt to compile it bears a certain relation to the estimates , however fallible , we must inevitably make of the various products of contemporary civilization of which we shall seek to preserve some record .

		The list of names published in the '' Sun '' was explicitly denned as imperfect and incomplete .

		I submitted only 121 names , and not '' about two hundred '' as you say .

		I should like to make it 200 , and that is why I invited suggestions , and why I am grateful for your own .

		This accounts for my '' many surprising omissions , '' though you overlooked my inclusion of Sun Yat Sen. The Mikado , moreover , came within the '' arbitrary group '' of rulers .

		I have been awaiting competent ad - vice and suggestion for augmenting the list of Orientals .

		As for my '' astonishing inclusions , '' I could wish that you had been more specific .

		A few of the names will , on further consideration , doubtless be deleted .

		A '' ten - tative list `` is a tentative list .

		Also , I would cite , in extenuation of my avowed temerity , the '' astonishing inclusions '' and '' surprising omissions '' in every list of '' best dead authors '' from Sir
John Lubbock	PERSON	's down to Dr.
Eliot	PERSON	's ; while the
Hall	PERSON	of Fame committee 's ex - clusion of
Poe	PERSON	and inclusion of well , no matter are probably fresh in your mind .

		Finally , I should like THE DIAL 'S frank opinion of all the names in the Nobel prize list , and to hear its editor recite , without a prompter , the names of all the members of the French Academy .

		Most of all I should cherish its views on our own
American Academy of Immortals	ORGANIZATION	crowned by far more competent hands than mine .

		It has fallen to my lot to question , in public print , this appraisement of native reputations .

		That I have not found it convinc - ing as a guide to my own compilation is possibly a mani - festation of ignorance and narrow-mindedness .

		But at least I do not regard our own '' diversion '' with the over - seriousness which you somehow read into my letter to the `` Sun . ''

		so often does the verdict of posterity reverse the most carefully considered judgment of this sort .

		The phrase '' about two hundred '' was written with the writer 's eye on that passage in Mr.
Larned	PERSON	's letter which speaks of the purpose '' to assemble a list of , say , two hundred names , '' and without an actual count of his list .

		Surprise at certain inclusions and omissions would be excited , in some quarters , by any conceivable list of this kind , and we should be the last to claim ability to frame one that would not aston - ish all its readers by some of its items and some of its readers by all its items .

		We think , however , that Mr.
Larned	PERSON	's tentative roll of honor shows most cred - itable care and judgment .

		SOME DISPUTED POINTS IN THE STORY OF OLD FORT
DEARBORN	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Permit me to comment upon the review of my book , '' The Story of Old
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	, '' which appeared in your issue of the 1st instant , signed by
Milo Milton Quaife	PERSON	.

		In order to understand the state of mind of this re - viewer , when confronted with my book , it will be neces - sary to refer to his previous utterances on this subject .

		About a year ago Mr.
Quaife	PERSON	was invited to read a paper on the
Chicago Massacre	ORGANIZATION	before the
Mississippi Valley Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	, which he did .

		It turned out to be a violent tirade against the authenticity of the '' Wau-Bun '' account of that event , an account which had been accepted as a most reliable and indeed the principal source of our knowledge on the subject .

		Naturally considerable surprise and disapproval were manifested among those who listened to the paper , and on being reported in the newspapers it occasioned some rather bitter controversy .

		Regarding the incidents re - lated by Mrs.
Kinzie	PERSON	in '' Wau-Bun , '' the lecturer held them up to scorn , using such expressions as '' inherent improbability , '' '' incredible tale , '' '' probably largely fictitious , '' `` grotesque , '' and declaring the defects of the work were '' numerous and glaring '' and the facts distorted .

		Indeed , throughout the address there was a constant flow of epithets and strained inferences .

		Since that time Mr.
Quaife	PERSON	has been endeavoring , through the
Chicago Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, to secure a fur - ther hearing for his radical views , but so far he has not seemed to be very successful .

		In reviewing my book , which is frankly based on the `` Wau-Bun '' account , with such additional details as have become available since that book was written , Mr.
Quaife	PERSON	has transferred his denunciations to my work and its author .

		He finds that the book '' is for the most part a paraphrase '' of ''
Wau	LOCATION	- Bun '' though he fails to mention the fact that it is ampli -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 187 fied and adapted and its order changed .

		Any complete account of the event described , it may be said , could not , be written without going back to that indispensable source .

		Some of the matters in my book criticised by Mr.
Quaife	PERSON	may be noticed .

		One of my statements was to the effect that Mrs.
Heald	PERSON	was '' nearly as old as her uncle '' Captain
Wells	PERSON	, who was about forty-two years of age .

		The reviewer oracularly observes that she was but twenty-two years old .

		In answer I would refer to
Fergus	ORGANIZATION	's Historical Pamphlet , No. 16 , in which
John Wentworth	PERSON	quotes from information obtained by him that Mrs.
Heald	PERSON	died in
1857	DATE	, aged 81 years .

		That would make her thirty-six years old in
1812	DATE	.

		Perhaps Mr.
Quaife	PERSON	has better information than this , but I doubt it .

		He declares that the name of the Frenchman Debou was
Cardin	PERSON	.

		Kirkland , in his book on '' The
Chicago Massacre	ORGANIZATION	, '' says it was as I gave it .

		The order for the evacuation , according to Mrs.
Kinzie	PERSON	, was received
August 7	DATE	, as I gave it .

		Captain
Heald	PERSON	, however , in his report gives it as the 9th , which is doubtless the better authority , and I will adopt it .

		The date of beginning the construction of Fort Dear - born is given in my book as
July 4 , 1803	DATE	.

		This the reviewer roughly contradicts , and declares that the troops did not arrive until some six weeks later .

		Hon.
Isaac N. Arnold	PERSON	, in an address before the
Chicago	LOCATION	His - torical Society in
July , 1877	DATE	, in speaking of the building of the fort , said : `` Some companies of infantry , under command of Maj. -LSB- Captain -RSB-
John Whistler	PERSON	, arrived at the same time
4th July	DATE	and commenced the con - struction of
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	. ''

		This was good authority up to a period as recent as
August 11 last	DATE	, when there was printed in the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Record-Herald '' of that date an account , heretofore existing only in manuscript form , of Lieut.
Swearingen	PERSON	's march overland with the troops who were to build the new fort , and who arrived on
August 17	DATE	.

		The account thus printed was accom - panied by some explanatory remarks by Mr.
Quaife	PERSON	, who said that the manuscript was in the possession of the
Chicago Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, and had been `` brought to light recently . ''

		As soon as I saw this account I deter - mined to make a corresponding change in a later edition of my book , which was then already in print , accepting this as better authority for the date of beginning the work of building .

		It is quite characteristic of this re - viewer , however , to give the impression that I ought to have known what had not yet come to public knowledge , and thus disingenuously make it appear as an error which could have been avoided .

		What reason Captain
Heald	PERSON	may have had for pro- posing to distribute the arms and ammunition to the Indians , in spite of his orders from Gen.
Hull	PERSON	to de - stroy them , does not appear .

		We only know that he promised them he would do so .

		The reviewer says that '' it is obvious '' that this story , '' together with state - ments concerning the resentment of the Indians ... are inventions . ''

		Such a remark is harsh and offensive .

		Mrs.
Kinzie	PERSON	in her book says that at the second council with the Indians `` murmurs and threats were every - where heard among the savages . ''

		Whatever estimate the reviewer may place on my authority , it is clear at any rate that I was not guilty of inventing anything .

		The transfer of Capt.
Whistler	LOCATION	to
Fort Wayne	LOCATION	, as I stated it , has the respectable authority of
H. H. Hurlbut	PERSON	-LRB- p. 27 -RRB- , in fact it is much better authority in my belief than the off-hand declarations of Mr.
Quaife	PERSON	, who ap - parently considers that his dictum '' settles it '' without troubling to mention an authority .

		He sneeringly states that Gen.
Dearborn	LOCATION	's services on the Niagara frontier were '' doubtless ' distinguished ' '' -LRB- using my expres - sion -RRB- , but that they were '' hardly so in the sense intended by the author . ''

		It is enough to say that just as the war of
1812	DATE	was closing President
Madison	PERSON	had deter - mined to appoint
Dearborn	LOCATION	general-in-chief of the whole army , but was prevented by the return of peace ; and it is hardly to be supposed that this appointment could have been contemplated unless
Dearborn	LOCATION	had already acquitted himself to the satisfaction of the president .

		The reviewer remarks with a superior air that '' Sur - geon
John Cooper	PERSON	'' was an unmarried man , and was not killed at the massacre , as I had stated , that '' he had resigned the service and left
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	over a year before . ''

		I did not say '' Surgeon
John Cooper	PERSON	, '' but I did place the words '' surgeon 's mate '' after the name of
John Cooper	PERSON	, quite a different matter .

		For some reason
John Cooper	PERSON	, the surgeon 's mate , did leave the service the year before , as the reviewer says .

		Now , whether the astute reviewer knew it or not , he ought to have known that there was a man by the name of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- first name not known -RRB- who was at
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	at the time of the massacre , that he was killed , and that he had a wife and daughter who survived him .

		Previous writers have confused these two men , as I did .

		The story of the Cooper who was killed is given in
Fergus	LOCATION	's Historical Series , No. 16 , pp. 54 , 56 .

		The reviewer had become aware of this fact while rummaging through the details of a wretched feud that existed among the officers and the people of the neighborhood a year or two before the massacre -LRB- as appears in the address re - ferred to -RRB- , which gives him occasion to make a partial statement intended to be injurious to me .

		The reviewer finds that my book '' reveals no evidence of the exercise of a critical faculty . ''

		His review is possibly a specimen of the exercise of such a faculty ; but joined with a narrow and contentious disposition , such as he exhibits , I believe it will strike the fair - minded reader as a most undesirable accomplishment .

		To examine the minute merits of every historical ques - tion touched upon would have defeated the purpose for which my book was written , : a point that the reviewer misses entirely .

		If , for example , I had entered upon a discussion of the merits of Gen.
Dearborn	LOCATION	's services on the
Niagara	LOCATION	frontier it would , in my judgment , have been regarded by most readers as a needless digression remote from the subject-matter of the book .

		In fact , to have done so would have been to awaken the con - troversial activities of just such men as this reviewer shows himself to be .

		He would have such a story as I have written prepared in the manner of a thesis , a manner that would only have served to repel the class of readers such as I intended to attract .

		I will close this letter with a quotation , which is per - haps appropriate .

		A certain wise old philosopher , Sir
Thomas Browne	PERSON	, in the course of some general advice to critics , wrote as follows : `` Bring candid eyes unto the perusal of men 's works , and let not Detraction blast well-intended labors .

		He that endureth no fault in man 's writings must only read his own .

		... Capital truths are to be narrowly eyed , collateral lapses and circumstantial deliveries not to be too strictly sifted .

		And if the substantial subject be well forged out , we need not examine the sparks which irregularly fly from it . ''

		188 -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, RETROSPECTS or A RETIRED WAR VETERAN .

		* Those who fought in , or lived through , or even heard some faint dying echoes of our Civil War , will not soon tire of reading its history as told from many points of view by those whose valor and ability helped to bring it to a fortunate termination .

		To the list of noteworthy military memoirs penned by Amer - ican soldier-authors there is now added General
James Harrison Wilson	PERSON	's detailed and interest - ing recollections of his eventful campaigns in the great struggle of half a century ago and of his less sanguinary experiences in the short conflict with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		`` Under the Old Flag '' traces , in two stout volumes , the course of its writer 's life from boyhood in a small
Illinois	LOCATION	town through the formative years of a West Point training , the hardening and ripening years of military service immediately afterward , at the outbreak of the Civil War , the subse - quent campaigns in which promotion and in - creased responsibilities were not slow to follow , the peaceful interval of a third of a century , and the parts played in the war with
Spain	LOCATION	, the reconstruction of
Cuba	LOCATION	, and the suppression of the Boxers in
China	LOCATION	.

		Only a few of the most prominent features of so extensive a work can be touched upon in any general survey of its merits .

		New lights on some of our national heroes , fresh views of certain historic events , a fuller realization of perils encountered and difficulties overcome by the shapers of our country 's destinies these are afforded by the graphic narrative before us .

		To begin with the school days of the future brigadier and division-commander , here is a paragraph from the account of his studies at West Point : '' At the end of the -LSB- first -RSB- year , although I had started next to foot , I was in the first or second section in all the studies .

		My two terms at college had been of great advantage in teaching me how to study .

		I had no diffi - culty in any branch , and did my daily task easily enough , and , after a few months , had plenty of time left for general reading .

		This was the case to the end of my cadet life .

		The library contained some twenty thousand volumes , largely military , but all fairly well selected , and , although nothing was done to encourage its use , or to guide the cadets in the selection of books , it was free to all who had time or inclination to visit it after study hours or on holidays .

		I soon made the acquaintance of * UNDER THE OLD FLAG .

		By
James Harrison Wilson	PERSON	, LL.D. , late Major-General ,
U. S.	PERSON	V .

		In two volumes .


New York	LOCATION	:
D. Appleton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Fries , the curator .

		During my first encampment I read Story 's ' Constitutional Law ' and a general assortment of romance and history , and after that not only became a steady patron of it , but close friends with the kindly Fries , who had a wonderful memory , and was most help - ful in introducing me to his treasures .

		As I grew older he became more considerate , and I hold him in grateful memory for his unfailing kindness .

		The instructors came and went , but he remained at his post , not only for my term , but for long years afterward , and if 1 should be called upon to say who did me the most good and helped me most to equip myself for the duties of life , I should unhesitatingly say Andrd Fries , the old librarian . ''

		In the war that followed soon after the cadet 's graduation from
West Point	LOCATION	, he served first in the Port Royal expedition , afterward in the
Antietam	LOCATION	campaign , and was then assigned to various duties in rather rapid succession , and with equally rapid promotion from a lieutenancy to higher and higher offices until we find him commanding a division of
Sheridan	PERSON	's cavalry , afterward organizing and commanding a cavalry corps of the
Military Division	ORGANIZATION	of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	, then directing the assault upon and capture of
Selma	LOCATION	and
Montgomery	PERSON	and other positions in the South , and , finally , effecting the pursuit and capture of
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	.

		Many famous gen - erals , as
Grant	LOCATION	,
Sherman	PERSON	,
McClellan	PERSON	,
Hooker	PERSON	, under or with whom he fought , pass across the writer 's pages in an almost living and breathing reality .

		Two peculiar regrets in connection with this excellent record are felt by the author , who says in an early chapter : '' Looking back on my military life , I have only two regrets in connection with it : first , that I was never an enlisted man in the infantry or cavalry , because , with my health , activity , powers of endurance , and skill in handling a rifle and a horse , I always felt that I would have been as good a soldier as could be found anywhere in the ranks , while I was far from having the same con - fidence in my capacity as a commissioned officer ; and , second , that I was never a prisoner of war , because I felt that the privation and ill treatment of that fate would have stimulated me to even greater determination and services in behalf of the
Union	LOCATION	cause . ''

		Like any other full account of our military operations in 1861-65 , General
Wilson	PERSON	's narra - tive makes the reader vividly aware of the blun - ders committed , the disasters narrowly escaped , the un skill and unreadiness displayed , at the opening of the war , and the seeming ease with which , under wiser direction , the conflict could have been brought to a close long before its actual end .

		For example , had a younger and more alert man than the veteran
Scott	PERSON	been at the head of the army when hostilities began , how different might have been the course of subse - quent events !

		But the writer pays appropriate tribute to
General Scott	ORGANIZATION	's merits .

		In contrast - ing him with another Virginian ,
Lee	PERSON	, he says :
1912	DATE	.

		J THE DIAI , 189 '' In these later days when it is the fashion to mag - nify the virtues of Lee , not only as a military man , but as a patriot , it seems to me that the country is in danger of forgetting its immense debt of gratitude to General
Scott	PERSON	, who was fully
Lee	PERSON	's equal as a soldier and far greater than
Lee	PERSON	as a patriot .

		His conquest of
Mexico	LOCATION	was a performance of the first rank and that is more than can be said of
Lee	ORGANIZATION	's best campaign .

		Scott 's patri - otism , unlike Lee 's , was neither provincial nor bounded by state lines , but was national and all-embracing .

		He gave his services at all times and all places to the whole country , without hesitation and without question .

		Like
Douglas	PERSON	, his example was worth an army to the
Union	ORGANIZATION	cause .

		All eyes were , indeed , turned to the veteran Brevet Lieutenant General
Scott	PERSON	, second of that rank in
America	LOCATION	, for inspiration and guidance , and no one looked to him with more anxiety than
Lincoln	LOCATION	, the newly - elected President .

		Happily both for him and the cause he upheld ,
Lincoln	PERSON	did not look in vain .

		The old soldier , staggering under the weight of years , put behind him all appeals to state pride and , like an old and seasoned oak , stood erect and unbending amid the raging storm of secession and civil war . ''

		The following passage presents Grant in a guise not too familiar to be interesting .

		It was
Grant	ORGANIZATION	's influence and favor that acted most powerfully in securing the author 's recognition as an able organizer and commander , and his promotion to rank befitting his quality .

		Of the impression made by the older man on the younger at their first meeting we read : '' Putting on no airs whatever and using nothing but the mildest and cleanest language , he treated me from the start with cordiality and without the slightest as - sumption of personal or official superiority .

		As I after - ward learned , this was always his way , and while he invited no confidences , he repelled none , and thus got all that were worth having .

		Snowing no sign whatever of hard living or bad habits , he produced a pleasant but by no means striking impression at first .

		With what I heard from others , I naturally suspended judgment , and as my first orders were to join
McPherson	PERSON	with the right wing of the army for the movement about to begin , instead of to settle down at headquarters and organize my branch of the staff service , I naturally got the im - pression that Grant was neither a great organizer nor much of a theorist in military matters .

		This opinion grew gradually into a settled conviction , and in spite of his great achievements , which were won mainly by atten - tion to broad general principles rather than to technical details , I have never had occasion to materially change these earlier impressions . ''

		It appears from
General Wilson	ORGANIZATION	's account , that he and Major Eawlins first conceived , or first put into words , the plan , later adopted by
Grant	ORGANIZATION	, of running the
Vicksburg	LOCATION	batteries by night .

		In a council of war held some time before the bold project was put into execution , all sorts of plans were discussed .

		We quote a portion of the narrative at this point : `` Whereupon
Rawlins	PERSON	explained my proposition to run the batteries under cover of darkness with the gun - boats and transports and march the troops below by land , to the first feasible crossing . ''

		As
Rawlins	PERSON	had predicted ,
Sherman	PERSON	at once and with emphasis declared : ` It ca n't be done .

		It is im - practicable .

		The transports will be destroyed .

		The enemy 's guns will sink them or set them afire . '

		And that settled it for the time being , for although
Rawlins	PERSON	gave the reasons clearly and emphatically for the faith that was in us , no one came to his support .

		Even Grant kept silent , though he tells us clearly enough in his memoirs , written many years afterward , that it was his purpose from the first to carry that plan into effect if the others failed . ''

		To refer at any length to the rather absurdly inconspicuous part assigned to General
Wilson	PERSON	when he offered his services in the Spanish - American War , would exceed the limits allowed to this review .

		But he seems to have accepted his lot with the cheerful acquiescence of a true soldier .

		To gain a more intelligent appreciation of his character and worth one may turn to
Nicolay	PERSON	and Hay 's '' Life of Lincoln , '' to which the present book makes pardonable reference .

		Among other notices of General
Wilson	PERSON	, we read : `` The ride of
Wilson	PERSON	's troopers into
Alabama	LOCATION	was one of the most important and fruitful expeditions of the war .

		... If the Confederacy had not already been wounded to death , the loss of
Selma	LOCATION	would have been irreparable .

		... It justified by its celerity , boldness , and good judgment the high encomium with which
Grant	ORGANIZATION	sent
Wilson	PERSON	to Thomas . ''

		If still further aids are desired to an esti - mation of General
Wilson	PERSON	's worth as a soldier , they are not far to seek .

		He is one of three brothers who served with distinction in the Civil War , and a tribute he pays to his brother
Henry	PERSON	's bravery enables one to surmise what are likely to have been his own exhibitions of cool daring when put to the test .

		He writes of Henry : '' He had early become known to the leading generals as an active and fearless officer and an excellent drill - master with remarkable presence of mind .

		He had led his company in the successful charge against the enemy 's works at
Donelson	LOCATION	, had been shot through the body , as he thought , and paralyzed , had been pulled to cover under the hillside he had just surmounted , by a comrade who covered him with a blanket and left him for dead , had revived , cut a crutch , rejoined his company , and fought with it till night when the bullet was cut out of his back .

		Fortunately it had ' gone around , not through ' him .

		At .

		Shiloh he distinguished himself by leading his men to the capture of a battery and by turning it against the enemy .

		Having been drilled for a year at West Point , he was as much at home in the artillery as he was with the infantry .

		While working the captured guns , one of his gunners thoughtlessly dropped an armful of shrapnel near the muzzle of a piece , the flash from which set the wrappings on fire .

		Fearing an explosion , my brother , without tremor or a moment 's hesitation , seized the shell and hurled it to the front where its explosion did no harm .

		It was in allusion to this and other gallant feats that
General Oglesby	ORGANIZATION	, afterward senator and governor of
Illinois	LOCATION	, said with an emphatic 190 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, oath : < Captain
Wilson	PERSON	was the bravest man I ever knew ! ' ''

		In fulness and readability , '' Under the Old Flag '' is the best work of its kind that has appeared since General
Howard	PERSON	gave us his two volumes of autobiography five years ago .

		In `` human interest , '' which it is the present fash - ion to clamor for , it would be difficult to indicate how the book could be improved .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		IDEAL.S AND TENDENCIES IN PRESENT - DAY SOCIALISM .

		* There are two very decided tendencies to be noted in the pages of the lately published books dealing with socialism .

		First of all one feels that there is a very great desire on the part of the authors to `` pull the sting '' of the socialist teachings .

		One seeks in vain for the vigorous insistence upon the class-conscious , revolution - ary , Marxian programme which until the last few years has been so characteristic of socialist writers .

		In its stead there appears a jumble of Utopian , ethical , Christian socialist , and Fabian ideas , with a smattering of Marxian principles .

		To add to the confusion the result is frequently and falsely labelled `` scientific '' or '' Marxian '' socialism .

		While it is admittedly true that socialism is not a group of fixed and unchange - able dogmas , but primarily a growing , changing movement for social betterment , it seems ques - tionable under the circumstances for these later authors to classify their special brand of ideas as '' Marxian . ''

		Every chance remark or state - ment of the founder of scientific socialism is searched out and used by them for the purpose of bolstering up their individual contentions .

		So widespread has this practice become that to - day
Marx	PERSON	's writings and those of his co-worker ,
Engels	LOCATION	, are about as frequently misquoted and misinterpreted to fit the particular situation as are those of the Biblical authors .

		In the second place one notes that more attention is being given to constructive ideas .

		A Study of the Application of Socialistic Principles to the
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		By
John Spargo	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	.

		In former years socialists were forced to con - cern themselves with critical and destructive arguments for the purpose of forcing the people to acknowledge that a change was imperative .

		Now that they have obtained a hearing and have gathered a rapidly-growing following , they deem it advisable to build for the future .

		In many instances the propositions advanced closely ap - proximate the Utopian schemes of the past ; in others they smack greatly of the progressive legislation proposed by social reformers .

		Both of these tendencies seem to have devel - oped out of the over-weening desire of a very large faction among the socialists to `` get votes . ''

		The acquisition of political power appears to be the goal most desired at the present time by the members of the socialist movement .

		Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	's `` Socialism and Character '' is a unique contribution to socialist literature .

		The author discusses with some detail the prob - able moral and spiritual results of socialism , and concludes that under such a regime `` the Beatitudes will no longer have to maintain themselves against the trend of things , but will become as truly the law for social progress as they are now the law for individual holiness . ''

		The book is a beautifully written essay of carefully chosen words , with frequent allusion to classical and modern literature .

		Its pages clearly disclose the extremely idealistic and intel - lectual , almost Christian socialist , point of view of its author .

		Although Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	claims to write as `` a socialist a class-conscious , revolu - tionary socialist , if you will , '' she confesses that her attitude toward this question is that of one '' to whom none the less the spiritual harvest , the fruits of character , are the only result worth noting in any economic order . ''

		Meekness , re - ligion , sympathy , affection , morality , love , gen - erosity , are words which give the keynote of the discussion .

		The thorough-going socialist will find much in the work to criticize .

		The author confesses that although she accepts the material - istic conception of history and the doctrine of the class struggle , `` the construction here put on them will be foolishness and irritation to many a good Marxian . ''

		Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	's book is , how - ever , replete with stimulating and suggestive ideas ; and while it can not appeal to the class - conscious , revolutionary political socialist , it will undoubtedly supply the need for just such a dis - cussion as Christian socialists and others have long felt .

		In '' Socialism and the Ethics of Jesus , '' Pro- fessor
Vedder	PERSON	first clears the field by defining socialism and differentiating it from other be -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 191 lief s with which it is frequently confused ; after which he gives us a brief statement of the his - tory of socialist principles and parties in Ger - many ,
France	LOCATION	,
England	LOCATION	, and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Concluding chapters are devoted to an inquiry regarding the respects in which the principles of socialism correspond to or differ from the ethics of Jesus .

		Professor
Vedder	PERSON	writes , not as a scientific socialist , but as a Christian socialist .

		This is evidenced , for example , by his declaration that '' the real basis of Socialism is not scientific , but ethical '' -LRB- p. 135 -RRB- .

		In fact , the author is bitter in his denunciation of scientific socialism .

		He characterizes the first volume of '' Capital '' as `` thoroughly unscientific and misleading '' -LRB- p. 136 -RRB- , and declares the whole Marxian system to be '' as unsubstantial as moonshine '' -LRB- p. 135 -RRB- .

		He also concludes that it is `` time somebody punctured this swollen German windbag -LSB-
Marx	PERSON	-RSB- and reduced it to its natural proportions '' -LRB- p. 113 -RRB- .

		In discussing the labor theory of value , he shows a surprising lack of ac - quaintance with the theories of
Marx	PERSON	as well as with those of modern economists .

		Probably it is this that accounts for the statement that the Marxian law holds that '' the more unskilful a shoemaker , the more valuable will be the shoes that he makes '' -LRB- pp. 118-119 -RRB- , and that
Marx	PERSON	maintained that '' wealth is produced by manual labor alone , and therefore of right belongs entirely to the manual laborer '' -LRB- p. 125 -RRB- .

		The chapter on '' The Ideals of Socialism '' is espe - cially good , and shows that the author has an excellent grasp of the more popular arguments concerning conditions that may exist when the prophesied stage of socialism becomes a reality .

		In treating the relation of the ethics of Jesus to socialism , Professor
Vedder	PERSON	severely criticizes the Church for what he terms its '' social failure , '' and demands that it become '' more socialized in all its thinking and activities . ''

		He says that '' The teachings of Jesus are utterly incompatible with the present social order , '' and can only be truly realized under a socialistic regime .

		Social - ism and Christianity , he says , are not antago - nists but allies .

		They can do each other much good , because Christianity needs to be socialized , and socialism needs to be Christianized .

		The volume is excellently written , logically arranged , and makes a well-rounded discussion from the standpoint of a Christian socialist .

		Its general thoroughness and accuracy are somewhat marred by occasional rash and unfounded statements , and by a lack of appreciation of the principles of scientific socialism .

		A short but well-chosen bibliography accompanies each chapter . ''

		Elements of Socialism , '' by Messrs.
Spargo	PERSON	and
Arner	PERSON	, is without doubt the best popular exposition of socialism by two of its advocates that has thus far been published .

		Although any opponent of socialist doctrines will find much in it with which to disagree , he will nevertheless be forced to admit that as a state - ment of the theories , ideals , history , and present strength of the socialist movement , it leaves but little if anything to be desired .

		The volume is thoroughly revisionist in its attitude toward socialist theories and tactics , and in point of view closely follows the previous writings of Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	.

		Its weakest parts are those chapters that deal with the theories of value and surplus value .

		Although the authors have presented a clear statement of the Marxian theory of value , they experience the usual difficulty in making it a workable proposition .

		It is impossible for one to explain
Marx	PERSON	's unit of value , `` an hour of socially necessary unskilled labor , '' as it is also impossible for one to reduce skilled labor to terms of that unit .

		The authors are not very well grounded in the general field of theory , as is shown by their statements that `` wealth is the product of a union of labor and the forces of nature '' -LRB- p. 144 -RRB- , and that capital is `` wealth that is used for the production of new wealth with a view to the realization of profit through its exchange '' -LRB- p. 145 -RRB- .

		The ideals of Utopian as well as of scientific socialists are explained in detail .

		There is also a discussion of the relations which it is thought may exist in the political , social , and industrial spheres under socialism .

		A necessarily brief but generally satisfactory de - scription is given of the socialist movement in various countries .

		Many of the customary ob - jections urged against socialism are answered .

		A short summary , a list of questions , and a bibliography follow each chapter .

		The authors are to be congratulated upon this book .

		It is written in an optimistic and kindly vein , free from the bitterness and sarcasm that usually characterize socialist works .

		Although intended for use as a text-book , the fact that it presents but one side of the question will undoubtedly prevent its wide acceptance for the class-room .

		Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	,
Lady Warwick	PERSON	, Mr.
L. G. Chiozza Money	PERSON	, and several other persons of note have collaborated in publishing a volume bearing the title , `` Socialism and the
Great State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The
Great State	ORGANIZATION	, broadly speaking , is the
State	ORGANIZATION	of the future towards which it is claimed society is evolving .

		An effort is made to outline , but only in very general terms , the conditions which may exist at that time .

		None 192 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, of the collaborators are Marxian socialists ; sev - eral acknowledge that they are out-and-out non - socialists .

		The joint product is a volume of stimulating , enthusiastic , and optimistic predic - tions concerning the future .

		To the reader who possesses a progressive turn of mind there is nothing that will offend , while practically every - thing can be accepted in its entirety .

		Although the authors condemn the Fabian socialists in no uncertain terms , one finds much in the book that `` out-Fabians the Fabians . ''

		The volume will appeal to members of the middle class , but it will receive scant appreciation at the hands of the Marxian socialists .

		Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	in his new book on `` Applied Socialism '' keeps much closer to the working - class point of view than do the authors of `` Socialism and the
Great State	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		He begins by wisely warning the reader that his statements must not be accepted as `` authoritative '' ; they are merely the ideas of a socialist who has at - tempted to sketch the conditions that may come to pass with the inauguration of the prophesied socialistic
Cooperative Commonwealth	ORGANIZATION	.

		Will socialism result in the confiscation of property ?

		Will it destroy the home ?

		Will it be opposed to religion ?

		How will labor be compensated ?

		What will be the incentive to effort ?

		These , and many other equally important questions , the author attempts to answer frankly and conclu - sively .

		That he has succeeded in presenting the best and the most thorough-going study of the application of socialistic principles to the
State	ORGANIZATION	, no one can deny .

		But in doing so , Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	has exercised great generalship in threading his way amongst the mooted questions of construc - tive socialism .

		He has been exceptionally cau - tious and conservative in his presentation of the subject .

		There are parts of the volume that will be very severely criticized by the socialists , especially by the more radical advocates of social democracy .

		To the reviewer it seems that Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	at one point has argued himself into a contradictory position by declaring that under socialism both the
State	ORGANIZATION	and groups of workers engaged in voluntary cooperative industry may manufacture the same things .

		This will natur - ally lead to industrial competition of the very same sort that the socialists are so bitterly op - posed to in our present system of industry .

		Mr.
Spargo	PERSON	argues for socialism because it would make industrial competition impossible , yet his scheme of things would make its retention pos - sible in a socialistic form of society .

		An index would have added to the value of the book .

		THE RECORDS or THE FEDERAL , CONVENTION .

		* Upon the adjournment , on
September 17 , 1787	DATE	, of the Convention which framed the Con - stitution of the
United States	LOCATION	, no record of the proceedings of that body was made public .

		The sessions of the Convention had been secret , and the journal and papers kept by the secretary ,
William Jackson	PERSON	, were now by order turned over for safe-keeping to the presiding officer ,
George Washington	LOCATION	.

		In
1796	DATE	,
Washington	LOCATION	, then President of the
United States	LOCATION	, deposited these papers in the
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		There they remained until
1818	DATE	, when
Congress	ORGANIZATION	by joint resolution ordered them to be printed , and President
Monroe	PERSON	found a willing editor in his Secretary of
State	ORGANIZATION	,
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	.

		Under
Adams	PERSON	's care , the `` journal '' was pub - lished at
Boston	LOCATION	in
1819	DATE	.

		This `` journal '' was but a cold statement of motions and votes , and gave but a very unsatis - factory insight into the springs of the Conven - tion 's actions .

		But records of another form the unofficial soon made their appearance .

		These may be divided into two classes : first , notes made by members of the Convention dur - ing the sittings in
Philadelphia	LOCATION	, which have the authority of contemporary evidence ; and second , productions formal or informal written by mem - bers or by other persons after the adjournment of the Convention , which thus are dependent either upon notes of the former class or upon mere recollection , and indeed can be called '' rec - ords '' only in a qualified sense .

		In order of time , the second class just described was the first to appear in print .

		Even before the ratification of the Constitution by the Conventions of the several States , there had appeared such accounts as
Charles Pinckney	PERSON	's '' Observations '' which , in addition to some remarks which
Pinckney	PERSON	may have delivered before the Convention , con - tains , it is thought , some that he certainly did not and the partisan report of
Luther Martin of Maryland	ORGANIZATION	, which he ingenuously entitled `` Genuine Information , '' while later , after the inauguration of the new government , this or that matter of constitutional dispute brought from the surviving `` fathers '' statement after statement of their individual recollections of the
Convention	ORGANIZATION	's work .

		THE DIAL 193
New York	LOCATION	.

		These notes , which had already been gleaned for partisan purposes , were pub - lished in
1821	DATE	.

		Seven years later , some con - temporary notes taken by
William Pierce	PERSON	of
Georgia	LOCATION	made their appearance in a
Savannah	LOCATION	newspaper .

		This publication was known to
James Madison	PERSON	, but in general
Pierce	ORGANIZATION	's notes had probably a very limited circulation .

		Both of these were eclipsed , however , when , in
1840	DATE	, after the death of
Madison	PERSON	, his papers , and more especially the famous notes which with skill and assiduity he took down during every day of the Convention 's sitting , and which in his lifetime he jealously reserved from public view , were at last put into print and rendered accessible .

		Infelicitously spoken of as
Madison	PERSON	's `` Jour - nal '' -LRB- for that word should be reserved for the official record -RRB- ,
Madison	PERSON	's notes , reprinted in many forms , have ever since been familiar to all serious students of American history .

		This much of retrospect is necessary to under - stand fully the place occupied by a work which embodies a most important accomplishment of external criticism in the field of American his - tory , Professor
Max Farrand	PERSON	's `` Records of the Federal Convention of
1787	DATE	, '' recently published in three large and handsome volumes by the
Yale University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The title sufficiently indicates the general scope of the work ; but a more detailed analysis of the contents is de - manded for the purposes of this review .

		In vol - umes one and two , Professor
Farrand	PERSON	publishes for each day of the session of the Convention of
1787	DATE	the official `` journal '' and the unofficial records that are contemporary .

		In appendixes in volume three are printed some documents that properly go with the matter just described the credentials of the delegates to the Conven - tion , and the textual reconstruction , with criti - cal notes , of the various `` plans '' submitted by individuals or by groups of individuals for the consideration of the constituent body .

		We shall discuss these factors in the order in which they have been mentioned .

		The official `` journal '' of
William Jackson	PERSON	, edited in
1819	DATE	carefully , but not without some errors , by
John Quincy Adams	PERSON	, is reprinted by Professor
Farrand	PERSON	from
Jackson	PERSON	's manuscript , with indication of
Adams	ORGANIZATION	's editorial emendations where such are found .

		Especially in determin - ing the distribution of the votes the ayes and noes upon particular questions has Professor
Farrand	PERSON	found it necessary sometimes to correct
Adams	PERSON	's editorial work .

		Passing from this to the unofficial records , and considering first those of the contemporary type , we find that Professor
Farrand	PERSON	prints after the `` journal '' for each day the notes of Madison for that day , and similarly those of
Yates	PERSON	and those of
Pierce	ORGANIZATION	for each day concerning which either of these has anything to say .

		But this is not all .

		In recent years there have come to the knowledge of investigators other groups of contemporary notes , including those of Rufus King of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	,
James McHenry	PERSON	of
Maryland	LOCATION	,
William Paterson	PERSON	of
New Jersey	LOCATION	,
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	of
New York	LOCATION	,
Charles Pinckney	PERSON	of
South Carolina	LOCATION	, and
George Mason	PERSON	of
Virginia	LOCATION	; while the papers of
James Wilson	PERSON	and those of
Benjamin Franklin	PERSON	of
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	also yield some fragments in the nature of records .

		These additions to our knowledge of the
Convention	ORGANIZATION	's work , most of which have been printed originally or have been immediately reprinted in the `` American His - torical Review , '' are now likewise transferred by Professor
Farrand	PERSON	to take their place with the older `` notes '' in the diurnal account of the Con - vention 's doings .

		This grouping in one place , for each day of the
Convention	ORGANIZATION	's session , of the known contemporary accounts , official and unof - ficial , constitutes a boon to students and greatly facilitates an intensive study of the period .

		Pro- fessor
Farrand	PERSON	's work , however , has not been merely the arranging of texts , for by a thor - .

		oughgoing critical examination of
Madison	PERSON	's notes he shows that in some cases
Madison	PERSON	made later emendations in his work , using as bases therefor the `` journal '' and
Yates	PERSON	's notes , so to this extent weakening the value of his own ac - count as an independent authority .

		Similarly in his editing of the `` plans '' submitted to the Convention by the
Virginia	LOCATION	delegates , by the
New Jersey	LOCATION	men , by
Charles Pinckney	PERSON	, and by
Alexander Hamilton	PERSON	, Professor
Farrand	PERSON	some - times reaches conclusions which differ from those of Professor
A. C. McLaughlin	PERSON	and Dr.
J. F. Jameson	PERSON	, his predecessors in this special field of criticism .

		From this analysis of the contemporary rec - ords we pass to the '' supplementary materials , '' or later accounts of the work of the
Convention	ORGANIZATION	, which constitute by far the greater part of Pro- fessor
Farrand	PERSON	's third volume .

		The editor has gleaned diligently ; and while the matter in - cluded under this head is of very heterogeneous character , and , as a whole , is secondary in im - portance to the main body of the work , it is of the greatest interest and most helpful toward the elucidation of the records .

		In this group are included the report of
Luther Martin	PERSON	, and that of
Pinckney	ORGANIZATION	to which we have already refer - red ; letters of
Washington	LOCATION	,
Hamilton	LOCATION	,
Madison	PERSON	, 194 -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, and other `` fathers '' ; reports of the French charge d'affaires to his home government ; state - ments made in
State	LOCATION	conventions or in the Con - gress of the
United States	LOCATION	; and other similar materials .

		Rigorously excluded are all theo - retical interpretations of the Constitution ; one finds , therefore , no decisions of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, and from '' The Federalist , '' or other con - troversial pamphlets , only a few citations which relate to matters of fact .

		The range of the testi - mony is wide , extending from
Madison	PERSON	's most serious statements on constitutional points to Dr.
Franklin	PERSON	's unfinished tale of the two-headed snake , and to the anecdote of Gouverneur Mor - ris 's familiar slap upon General
Washington	LOCATION	's shoulder .

		Merely to suggest the capacity for usefulness that arises from such a compilation is to pay a sufficient tribute to the painstaking work which the editor has so well performed .

		To the re - viewer there appears to be ground for but one serious criticism .

		In
1894	DATE	the
Department of State	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, through the
Bureau of Rolls and Library	ORGANIZATION	, began the publication of a work entitled '' The Documentary History of the Constitution , '' which in
1901	DATE	was reprinted by Congressional authority .

		To this work the thought of the special student is at once carried back by the contemplation of Professor Far - ' rand 's volumes .

		In the '' Documentary History '' were reprinted with scrupulous care the official `` journal '' and
Madison	PERSON	's notes , along with the records of the earlier convention at
Annapolis	LOCATION	, some important selections from the journal of the
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	under the Articles of Confederation , a large number of documents relating to the history of the amend - ments to the Constitution , and lastly , in the fourth and fifth volumes -LRB- published in
1905	DATE	-RRB- , a mass of supplementary materials derived from the manuscript collections then in the Depart - ment of
State	ORGANIZATION	.

		On this last group of materials , Professor
Farrand	PERSON	has drawn heavily ; though the fact that his citations from the same docu - ments are frequently of less length than those of the `` Documentary History '' will make careful students prefer , after all , to consult the origin - als .

		For his narrower topic the work of the Constitutional Convention itself Professor
Farrand	PERSON	has accomplished far more than the `` Documentary History '' accomplished , and his work is in many respects better done .

		But in the opinion of the reviewer the two productions have so much in common that a clear statement by Professor
Farrand	PERSON	as to the relation of his own work to the older one would have been most helpful to the student .

		As it is , each person must make the comparison for himself .

		The general index , full in most respects , omits a few important topics .

		On the other hand , an analytical index by clauses of the Constitution promises a means of assistance the exact value of which must be tested by use .

		The typography of the volumes is of the highest excellence except for a few misprints which may easily be corrected in another edition .

		The only illustrations are two photographs , one showing a page of
Jackson	PERSON	's `` journal '' and the other a page of
Madison	PERSON	's notes .

		Finally may be mentioned , as a very helpful addition made by the editor , a table showing as accurately as the records permit the time during which each of the delegates to the Convention was actually in attendance .

		RESEARCHES IN THE REALM OF FAERIE .

		* In his book on `` The Fairy-Faith in Celtic Countries '' Mr.
Evans Wentz	PERSON	has set himself the somewhat startling task of endeavoring to prove in broad daylight the solid basis of fancies which have haunted most men in some moment of darkness or fear .

		All external nature , he argues , is animated throughout , and controlled in its phenomena , by daemons acting by the will of gods .

		The fairies of Celtic belief , along with the goblins , spectres , kobolds , etc. , of all prim - itive folk , have a real basis in these mighty beings of the unseen , who may at certain times and places appear to favored observers .

		The author heaps up evidence of fairy belief from all Celtic lands ,
Ireland	LOCATION	,
Scotland	LOCATION	, the Isle of Man ,
Wales	LOCATION	,
Cornwall	LOCATION	, and
Brittany	PERSON	; and con - cludes that where there is so much smoke there must be some fire .

		No sensible person will reprove Mr.
Wentz	PERSON	for collecting and marshalling every possible evidence to prove his hypothesis .

		He is undeni - ably justified in keeping an open mind for all the truth that man can gather .

		But one has a right to expect that Mr.
Wentz	PERSON	will somewhere in his big book call attention to the trivial and uncertain character of nearly all the facts that he has mustered .

		He ought in fairness to state his case somewhere with calmness and caution .

		His main argument that where there is so much smoke there must be some fire , is not very co - gent .

		Have we satisfied ourselves that this kind * THE FAIRY-FAITH IN CELTIC COUNTRIES .

		THE DIAL 195 of smoke can be occasioned only by real fire ?

		What if , after all , it should prove to be a cloud of dust ?

		Mr.
Wentz	PERSON	's reasoning is not based on clear and rigid analysis .

		He gives a place of honor , for example , to the argument that all primitive peoples , who have lived close to nature , have be - lieved in beings comparable to fairies . ''

		Only men in cities , '' he says , '' who are removed from the natural life of the out-of-door world , '' dis - believe .

		Mr.
Wentz	PERSON	plays upon the word '' nat - ural , '' and urges that life in cities is abnormal , and that the city man has an unwholesome and probably an untrue conception of nature .

		This argument rests upon a vague and shifting sig - nification of the word `` natural . ''

		He surely does not mean that questions of fact are settled by popular vote .

		These are determined by the opinion of experts , and in the last analysis by recourse to experiment .

		It is not likely that the existence of .

		ST-rays would be affirmed by popular vote .

		The assertion that our disbelief in fairies is determined by the opinion of the swarms of human beings who live in crowded and unnatural conditions in cities , is nonsense .

		It is not the opinion of the multitudes who live in slums , and in closely pent-up streets , that constitutes knowledge .

		Rather it is the opinion of experts who live in highly natural , indeed in ideal , conditions , in or near cities .

		Few will follow Mr.
Wentz	PERSON	if he means that all life in cities is unnatural , and all city folk abnormal .

		Man seems to be by nature a city-making animal , like the ant or the bee .

		The knowledge and control of the powers of nature upon which our civilization reposes have been initiated and car - ried forward by city men .

		Rather , one might say that to the city man belongs the knowledge of the world .

		Mr.
Wentz	PERSON	's argument is based on a confusion of thought .

		If it proves anything it proves that all human knowledge is abnormal .

		Man is by nature naked and superstitious .

		The utility of Mr.
Wentz	PERSON	's book for students of Celtic custom , ritual , and myth is consider - able .

		He has collected much information con - cerning the modern fairy beliefs of Celtic lands , and has conveniently catalogued it according to the locality where it was obtained .

		He fails , however , to call attention to many of the valu - able conclusions which his researches tend to establish .

		The persistence of Celtic popular tra - dition is one of these astonishing facts .

		Irishmen in
Connemara	LOCATION	to-day hold exactly the same be - liefs about the fairies as were recorded in Irish sagas of one thousand years ago .

		For example , the
Togail Bruidne Da Derga	ORGANIZATION	, which was very likely written down in the eighth century , and is preserved in an MS. of about
1100	DATE	, describes hostile fairies as appearing all red , even to their clothing , their hair , and their teeth , and riding upon red horses .

		These hostile fairies in red , slightly disguised as mysterious red knights , appear again and again in the Arthurian legends , which undoubtedly rest upon a basis of Celtic story .

		Mr.
Wentz	PERSON	's informants in many differ - ent places in
Ireland	LOCATION	of to-day peasants , un - lettered men , wholly unfamiliar with ancient books described to him fairies who appeared all in red , even to their hair , and sometimes declared that they had seen the fairies as com - panies of little red men in red cloaks .

		The numerous facts of modern folk-lore which Mr.
Wentz	PERSON	has collected , rather than his conclu - sions about them , constitute the real value of his book .

		Indeed , to any exacting reader , these folk-lore facts are by far the most interesting things which the book contains .

		THE CONFLICT WITH CRIMINALITY .

		* It is curious to note in certain young admini - strators of the criminal law in
America	LOCATION	an irri - tability which makes them impatient of the careful and slow processes of education .

		The ancient retributive idea of justice was adapted to simple and savage minds , and required nothing but a club , a noose , and a dungeon .

		This primi - tive conception still casts its dark shadow over our courts and codes .

		The prosecuting attorney , the sheriff , and the policeman are eager to make quick work with the disagreeable offender , and '' send him over the road '' as soon as possible .

		They are not so much to blame , for they have legal traditions on their side , and are bred to prompt action .

		One trouble is , however , that this swift emotional reaction creates recidivists ; and the repeater returns after a brief cooling process to plague the courts and the public .

		In medical treatment of deep-seated disease a little time spent on diagnosis is not wasted .

		196 THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, a careful husbandman , waits long years for his harvest .

		Criminal procedure usually aims to be just , and it often loses itself in technicalities which favor the criminal ; but at bottom our pro- cedure has no reformatory purpose or method : it remains under the spell of the retributive aim .

		As a corrective of this hasty and emotional attitude toward criminality , the studies of Dr.
James Devon	PERSON	, physician in a Scotch prison , are welcome .

		His criticism of the legal legends and fictions is caustic , but justified by the facts cited from his long experience .

		It is amazing how this shrewd observer of men can see the weak - ness and wickedness of humanity so vividly and paint it so realistically , and yet retain his calm , patient , and loving attitude toward everyone except the privileged classes .

		While he does not mention the American methods of parole , probation , and indeterminate sentence , it is encouraging to us to find this Scottish doctor supporting our own contentions at every point .

		One moves into an entirely different atmo - sphere when passing from Dr.
Devon	PERSON	's prison clinic and hospital ward to the scholarly pre - cincts of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	and the philo - sophic speculations of Dr.
Ray M. McConnell	PERSON	.

		The very title of the latter 's book , '' Criminal Responsibility and Social Constraint , '' smells of the lamp .

		Yet speculation has practical value , and compels us to go to the foundations of our legislation and our prison theories .

		We have need of profound reflection on the aims of pun - ishment , and ought to consider carefully what we are trying to accomplish .

		Is it expiation , or retribution , or deterrence , or reformation , or social utility , or an amalgam of all these ?

		It is profitable also to review our philosophical notions about fate , foreordination , and free will , and the exact nature of responsibility for crime .

		Toward all of these ends Dr.
McConnell	PERSON	's book is an excellent means .

		From the purely scholastic debate about deter - minism and responsibility , we descend with some - thing of shock to the practical problem of prison labor . ''

		Penal Servitude '' is a pamphlet directed against the prison contractor , who here figures as a slave driver under state authority .

		The
National Committee on Prison Labor	ORGANIZATION	is doing for this subject what the
National Committee on Child Labor	ORGANIZATION	is doing for childhood exploited by factory , mill , and mine .

		A strain of human idealism runs through the sordid details of prison shops and disciplinary punishments , of venal foremen and spoils politics , of coarse brutality and purchase of raw materials .

		One could wish that the discussion might be more impersonal , for some prison contractors are honest men and the contract system is by no means condemned by all prison authorities .

		In his main conten - tion , however , the author of this attack is on the right side .

		The
State	ORGANIZATION	should not delegate to private persons the process o ^ f correction and punishment , in which labor is a vital factor .

		The descriptions of conditions observed by the author are instructive , and should awaken the public conscience to correct these gross abuses .

		In order to make our system of dealing with criminals worthy of our modern civilization , thoughtful and educated men and women must give more attention to this forbidding theme .

		The Attorney General has asked
Congress	ORGANIZATION	to prosecute an investigation of the whole subject , so far as the federal authority extends .

		We must strive to bring into the service a higher order of officials , and a more scientific and conscientious study of the human beings with whom they have to deal .

		The criminal world is not a world apart , but near our homes , and can not be ignored as a theme unfit for the polite .

		The cost of crime is estimated by care - ful men to be over 1700,000,000 each year , and the fruits of this appalling expenditure are sorrow , debasement , cruelty , shame , and every form of evil .

		In urging the social duty of attention to criminality , the author of '' The Present Day Problem of Crime '' touches the more spiritual elements of the subject .

		In a citation from Mr.
F. H. Wines	PERSON	, we have the central idea of prison reform the personality of the officials .

		`` The head of a reformatory prison must be an idealist , a consecrated man , a man with a vocation .

		A truly reformatory prison is the last and highest expression of charity .

		It demands the expression of charity by the warden .

		It will not work in the hands of a harsh , brutal , incompetent warden .

		It needed the Christian heart and administrative genius of a
Maconochie	ORGANIZATION	to devise and work out the reformatory method of treatment . ''

		What is true of wardens is true also of police , prosecutors , and judges : the modern educa - tional theory of the treatment of crime breaks down unless it is administered throughout by competent and high-minded men .

		That is not a reason for abandoning the modern view , but only for demanding the selection and training of a body of officials who understand it and are competent to carry it into effect .

		To students of prison science , the principles and methods worked out at
Elmira Reformatory	ORGANIZATION	have long been familiar through the year-books ,
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 197 essays , and addresses of its famous superintend - ent , as well as by discussions in various lan - guages by critical visitors .

		The autobiography of Mr.
Brockway	PERSON	now published reproduces cer - tain classical documents which summarize his doctrines in various stages of development ; but the new factor here is the frank , clear story of the evolution of the great administrator 's own mind .

		This new light is extremely welcome even to those who have already known him and studied his impersonal statements of views in numerous previous publications .

		The world is not even yet far enough advanced fully to sympathize with the fundamental eth - ical , legal , and administrative ideas which have made
Elmira	LOCATION	Reformatory the synonym of a revolution .

		Before he had reached his majority this innovator , sturdy son of a man of independ - ent spirit and
New England	LOCATION	conscience , entered upon his apprenticeship .

		He was fortunate in coming under the influence of the most famous prison wardens of the previous generation , from whom he learned much , but advanced steadily beyond them .

		Mr.
Brockway	PERSON	was stimulated in his earlier work by a very intense , if some - what narrow , religious enthusiasm , from which he gradually turned away for what he regards as a more rational faith .

		In this respect , as in many others , he has been affected by the modes of thinking current in the
last century	DATE	, although he does not often indicate the literary sources of the new direction of thought .

		We have to do , not with a man of books so much as a man who felt himself in contact with reality and used the ideas of others in a very independent fash - ion , hardly noting whence they came to him .

		With the bare mention of
Lombroso	PERSON	and the Irish prison reformers and a few others , he moves along quite unconscious of his literary obliga - tions .

		We know that he has read a good deal , but he seems to have most valued conversation and correspondence with the best men of prac - tical experience in his own profession .

		The one principle which guided him from beginning to end was that of social protection against criminals by their reformation or by their segregation .

		To secure these ends he tried all sorts of experiments with a sagacity , per - sistence , and patience which were crowned with growing success .

		He never gave up an ele - ment which he found in any degree useful .

		While he laid less emphasis on moral and reli - gious persuasion in later years , he never wholly abandoned them and always made use of them ; always trying to keep out sectarianism and fanaticism , from which he suffered more than once .

		He is liberal and honest to the extent that he reprints his earlier views , with an ex - planation of the changes in his own philosophy .

		His autobiography is the account of a growing mind .

		Down to the very last he is trying experi - ments and making observations ; for he still lives a noble intellectual life , with open mind and keen criticism of methods and systems .

		His enemies will be forgotten ; but his work will remain , an honor to him and to his country .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		studies of `` There is not , and there can never frankness in be , any legitimate purpose in print literature .

		save pleasure and delight ; so that he who would hide his art behind the broken wall of moral excellence is instantly suspected of foul play .

		When once another intention is admitted than the awakening of sense or intelligence , ` moral ' or 1 immoral ' matters not a jot . ''

		These two sentences maybe regarded as the text of Mr.
Charles Whibley	PERSON	's '' Studies in Frankness '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , a volume which embraces appreciations of eight authors popularly banned as immoral either in their lives or in their works .

		Modern English literature is represented by Sir
Thomas Urquhart	PERSON	,
Laurence Sterne	PERSON	, and
Edgar Allan Poe	PERSON	; the ancient classics by
Petronius	LOCATION	,
Heli	PERSON	- odorus ,
Apuleius	PERSON	,
Herondas	LOCATION	, and
Lucian	PERSON	.

		One won - ders what
Poe	PERSON	is doing in this unholy gallery ; his works are - not likely to corrupt the youngest thing , and his life no longer biases people against his works .

		One might suppose from the sentences quoted above that the ordinary moral distinctions of life were to be completely disregarded in art , that the obscene could be transmuted into the artistic , were it not that elsewhere in the volume
Sterne	PERSON	is condemned because he is '' manifestly obscene in places , '' and obscenity , which in life is immoral , is in art '' a matter of taste . ''

		Well , if the obscene is condemned in art , it makes very little difference whether it is called immoral or in bad taste ; we do not want it under any name .

		If Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	regrets that the Milesian story is denied literary expression by our '' ineradicable modesty '' and is forced to '' eke out a beggarly and formless existence by the aid of oral tradition , '' we can not enter into any very vital sympathy with him .

		The '' pleasure and delight '' lost to the race may well be spared .

		Nor can one go off into gales of laughter , or be tickled , as one is by Chaucer at his naughtiest , when one reads the tid-bits selected from the '' frank '' dialogues of Herondas , unless one supposes that the asterisks are voluble of convulsive mirth .

		And why asterisks in a Study in Frankness ?

		On the other hand , no one to-day will object to the picaresque novel , to the rascalities of the rogues and beggars , . ''

		daggle-tailed and out-at - elbows , '' as they are , for instance , depicted in
Petronius	LOCATION	.

		As a matter of fact , , the purpose of art is not subjective , as Mr.
Whibley	PERSON	198 -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, -LRB- following Aristotle -RRB- declares ; but it is , as Professor
Butcher	PERSON	has already pointed out , objective .

		It is the '' revelation of the beautiful in external form . ''

		If what our conventions stamp as immoral can reveal the beautiful , it has a place in art , and only so .

		Criti - cism will not condemn ''
Holy Willie	PERSON	's Prayer , '' what - ever the puritan may say ; but it will condemn the pruriences of
Sterne	PERSON	and the unblushing license of
Wycherley	PERSON	.

		Morality is more than convention ; and art , which is founded on life , can not ignore that which penetrates all life .

		The story of More than three-quarters of a cen - a prophet and tury after his sombre and pathetic Jiis reward .

		passing from the scenes of his spec - tacular labors as a preacher of astonishing eloquence and power ,
Edward Irving	PERSON	is made the subject of as zealous a defense , of as glowing a eulogy , as any martyr to his faith could desire .

		`` Edward Irving : Man , Preacher , Prophet , '' by
Jean Christie Root	PERSON	, is written in an earnest endeavor to rescue from threatening oblivion the name of one who , the author finds reason to believe , `` perhaps more clearly fore - shadowed the problems and truths of to-day than any other one man in his period . ''

		By `` problems and truths '' must be understood those of a spiritual and religious nature ; and the trial and condemna - tion of Irving for heresy do indeed stamp him , to our view , as a thinker in advance of his age in that liberality which comes with freedom from the fet - ters of tradition and convention .

		The writer has evidently long cherished the purpose of presenting the world with a true picture of
Irving	LOCATION	, and she has amassed much valuable material for such an under - taking .

		All the contemporary and other published writings that throw light on his character and work she has faithfully studied , and she has also had the use of the large store of unpublished material gath - ered together by the late Rev.
W. W. Andrews	PERSON	, who had made the acquaintance of some of Irving 's asso - ciates and seems to have enjoyed exceptional oppor - tunities for learning the details of his later life .

		Yet the book now offered is not the exhaustive biography that might have been expected ; but as we already have Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	's substantial performance , this briefer essay in character-study and interpretation may better meet the present need .

		What is espe - cially excellent , in it is its plea for charity and sym - pathy in judging those enthusiasms and ardors of Irving 's that his own contemporaries were prone to condemn .

		His views on the human qualities of Jesus , his faith in the testimony of the `` inner voice , '' his belief in something akin to our modern psychotherapy , were all in advance of his day and generation .

		At the same time he conspicuously lacked balance , he had no saving sense of humor , and he laid himself open to imposture from any charlatan that pretended to divine inspiration .

		This weaker side of the man his apologist does not turn to the light .

		The book does an incidental service in rightly presenting Irving 's relations to the
Carlyles	LOCATION	, and in asserting , with documentary evidence , the happiness of his marriage .

		A portrait of Irving and brief `` appreciations '' of him from
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Maurice	PERSON	, and other contemporaries , are supplied .

		Not to dwell on this harsher side of prison life , but `` to recall certain of the inci - dents which helped to enliven the tedious days and nights of confinement , '' is the purpose of Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	's personal record entitled '' A Pris - oner of War in
Virginia	LOCATION	, 1864-5 '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		It is probably not generally known that this publisher and author , besides having won with his pen the title of Doctor of Letters , much earlier earned with his sword that of Adjutant and Brevet-Major , and that it was his lot to suffer four months ' confinement in
Libby Prison	LOCATION	and at
Danville	LOCATION	.

		The narrative of the less harrowing part of this trying experience was presented in a paper read before the
New York	LOCATION	Commandery of the
United States Loyal Legion	ORGANIZATION	, in
December , 1910	DATE	.

		It attracted attention , and is now expanded sufficiently to make a book of a little more than a hundred pages , adorned with an interesting portrait of the soldier-author in his uniform , with a sketch of the interior of the
Union	ORGANIZATION	officers ' prison at
Danville	LOCATION	drawn by the author 's chum , Captain
Harry Vander Weyde	PERSON	, and with other appropriate illustra - tions .

		With something of the realism of a Dostoieff - sky , but with a lighter touch and with an emphasis on the more entertaining or amusing features of his prison life , the author has produced a book that few will open without feeling moved to read from begin - ning to end .

		gist , however , has not always borne the best of reputations .

		In his pronouncements he has not invariably been guided by commonsense and a sound linguistic feeling .

		Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, for instance , was naive enough to derive the adverb along , in the collocation `` Come along , '' from French Allans ; and Bishop Trench blandly connected the word saunterer with the Crusading expeditions to the Holy Land , deriving the word from the French la
Sainte Terre	ORGANIZATION	.

		But within the
last half-century	DATE	English etymology has finally been put on a scien - tific basis ; and in recent years some most excellent books on the subject have appeared .

		The latest addition to this list is Professor
Ernest Weekley	PERSON	's `` The Romance of Words '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Professor
Weekley	PERSON	writes mainly of English words , but he shows his bias to his own field as teacher by the
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 199 large number of Romance etymologies that he introduces .

		He is concerned only incidentally with the exposition of general principles , but avows as his chief purpose the presentation of the `` unexpected in etymology , ` things not generally known , ' such as the fact that Tammany was an Indian chief , ... that jilt is identical with
Juliet	PERSON	, that parrot is historically a diminutive of
Peter	PERSON	, and that glamor is a doublet of grammar . ''

		He makes little at - tempt to exploit new theories , contenting himself , for the most part , with `` compiling '' his materials -LRB- as he modestly states it in his preface -RRB- from other sources , mainly the `` New English Dictionary '' with which he has been associated for a number of years in the verification of etymologies .

		Among the dozen or more words for which he proposes new etymologies are cockney -LRB- generally supposed to be compounded of cock and egg -RCB- , which he would now trace to French acoguine -LRB- `` made into a coquin '' -RRB- ; mulligrubs , which he derives from mouldy grubs ; foil -LRB- for fencing -RRB- , which he connects with feuille ; and sullen , which he holds to be a doublet of solemn .

		An extremely interesting chapter is the final one , entitled `` Etymological Fact and Fiction , '' in which the author brings together a collection of anecdotes from the .

		earlier lexicographers , and lays sundry ety - mological ghosts .

		Throughout , Professor
Weekley	PERSON	writes with admirable downrightness and simplicity , and he nowhere displays anything of cocksureness or of pedantry the besetting sins of the etymol - ogist .

		His book is , first of all , scholarly ; but it is also thoroughly entertaining .

		The undying The '' S P eli Series ' J -LRB- Page -RRB- reaches charm of its fourth number in '' The Spell of old
England	LOCATION	.

		England , '' by Mrs.
Daniel Dulany Addison	PERSON	-LRB- or
Julia de Wolf Addison	PERSON	, as the name appears on the title-page -RRB- .

		Mrs.
Addison	PERSON	lived in
England	LOCATION	as a child , and studied art there later , so that she writes with much more than the
summer	DATE	tourist 's acquaintance with the country .

		In seven - teen chapters , agreeably conversational and anec - dotal in style , she takes her readers through
England	LOCATION	from end to end and from side to side .

		That the '' spell '' is not so unremitting and so powerful as to hush the traveller 's criticism and deaden all sense of humor is evident from many an entertaining passage like the following : '' One might almost write a whole chapter on the signs and advertisements which one meets in English travel .

		A terrible possibility is suggested by the announcement : ` Old false teeth bought and sold , ' while ` The Superfine Cotton Spin - ner 's Combine Limited ' is almost as difficult to say five times as '
Peter Piper	PERSON	. '

		On a shop in
London	LOCATION	one reads '
Greaves	PERSON	late
Huggins	PERSON	. '

		This is a sermon in itself . ''

		A good index and two pages of bibli - ography add to the usefulness of the book , while a map marked with the places visited enables one to follow the itinerary understandingly .

		`` Tavistock , '' misprinted `` Travistock '' on the map , is placed , not in
Devonshire	LOCATION	, but too far to the west , in
Cornwall	LOCATION	a part of
England	LOCATION	, by the way , to which many readers would doubtless feel inclined to give consid - erably more time than Mrs.
Addison	PERSON	has given , less than two pages being devoted to it in her book .

		Also the
Lake District	ORGANIZATION	might fairly claim more than the dozen pages allotted to it .

		But
England	LOCATION	is crowded with places of interest , and to do them all justice would take a lifetime .

		The book 's numerous illus - trations from photographs of buildings , interiors , landscapes , and paintings , are excellent .

		Records of two Mr -
Richard Davey	PERSON	, whose death Elizabethan has recently been chronicled , was a princesses .

		writer of more than usual breadth : his field embraced journalism , history , travel , and other sections not so easily classified .

		As historian he is best known as the biographer of Lady
Jane Grey	PERSON	, `` the nine days ' queen . ''

		The last years of his life were devoted to a continuation of his studies in the history of the
Brandon	PERSON	line , the results of which have lately been published under the title `` The Sisters of Lady
Jane Grey	PERSON	and their Wicked Grand - father '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The Greys were the legal heirs to the English throne after
Elizabeth	LOCATION	; but as they never came into the inheritance , their history has been neglected by earlier historians .

		Mr.
Davey	PERSON	's work traces the career of the two Grey sisters ,
Catherine	PERSON	and
Mary	PERSON	, with the chief attention given to
Catherine	PERSON	as the older and more important ;
Mary	PERSON	was a dwarf and scarcely had what may be called a '' career , '' except during her brief marriage to a giant who held a subordinate office at the royal palace .

		As heir presumptive in a period of much ferment , Lady
Catherine	PERSON	naturally found herself in the centre of a network of intrigue , as both Catholics and Pro- testants looked with favor on her as a candidate for the throne if
Elizabeth	ORGANIZATION	should be displaced .

		The author gives some attention to this phase of his biog - raphy , and throws considerable light on the anti- Elizabethan movements in the early years of the reign ; but by far the greater portion of the work is devoted to the love affairs of these indiscreet prin - cesses , and Mr.
Davey	PERSON	narrates much gossip that is of slight importance , though usually entertaining .

		The portraits which illustrate the volume are very interesting ; they are chiefly of members of the
Tudor	PERSON	family , but several are from paintings that are not generally known .

		social conditions The analysis of community life has in a
New England	LOCATION	been developed far enough to make factory town .

		i oca -RSB- studies more complete and instructive than ever before .

		The latest of such stu - dies is Mr
George F. Kenngott	PERSON	's `` The Record of a City : A Social Survey of
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Lowell is a fine example of the tend - encies of industrial populations in this country , and it is old enough to reveal contrasts between the present and the past .

		One must be a stout-hearted optimist to contemplate serenely a comparison between the
Lowell	PERSON	of
Lucy Larcom	PERSON	and the `` Lowell Offering '' with the noisy and polyglot town of to-day .

		It is a different stock , with distinctly lower standards and THE DIAL -LSB-
Sept. 16	DATE	, ideals .

		If this is what industry and immigrant labor are going to make of American people , then success - ful manufactures are a national calamity .

		But we have not seen the end , and even in this chaos one may discern the dawn of a more hopeful day .

		It is well to read Miss
Mary Antin	PERSON	's `` The Promised Land '' as a relief from the depressing effects of such a picture .

		If we can react upon this mountain - mass of alien material , we may help to save the world ; if we are apathetic and passive we shall cer - tainly lose our civilization .

		The following quotation from the poet
Lowell	LOCATION	fittingly closes this rather dole - ful description of a factory town : '' ` Ti8 ours to save our brethren , With love and peace to win Their darkened hearts from error Ere they harden into sin .

		But if , before his duty , Man with listless spirit stands , Ere long the Great Avenger Takes the work from out his hands . ''

		It is significant that this study was inspired and directed by such men as Professor Peabody of Har - vard .

		The history of the town from Colonial days introduces a mass of well-arranged facts , collected with vast toil , about the present population , the hous - ing of the operatives , health conditions , the standard of living , industrial conditions , social institutions , and recreations of the people .

		The reader should be reminded that the budget included is based on only one week 's experience , while it is now generally agreed that the accounts should cover at least a whole year .

		The better method , however , is so ex - pensive that private investigators can not use it for an entire city , and we should be grateful for the study as it stands .

		Those to whom statistics are an un - known language may look at the pictures in this vol - ume , some of which are pathetic even to tragedy .

		T
London	LOCATION	in beautitul drawings of historic Lon - pen and pencil , don houses were made for his brother 's chapters describing them , or , as the brother modestly intimates , the descriptive matter was furnished as complementary to the illustrations , the book , '' Famous Houses and Literary Shrines of
London	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Button -RRB- , which Mr.
A. St. John Adcock	PERSON	and Mr.
Frederick Adcock	PERSON	have together brought to completion , is well planned and does credit to all concerned in its making .

		Seventy-four houses and other literary landmarks of
London	LOCATION	, covering the three centuries from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time to
Whistler	LOCATION	's , are gracefully drawn by the artist , while his collaborator turns to good account the abundant memoirs and other literature throwing light on the inmates of these houses and the haunters of these scenes .

		Not as a mere compiler , however , has Mr. St.
John Adcock	PERSON	been content to perform his part .

		A wide knowledge of
London	LOCATION	and an intimate acquaintance with the literature relating to its memorable buildings are apparent in his pages .

		Even our own
Hawthorne	PERSON	and his visit to
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	in
Rowan Road	LOCATION	find a place in the book ; and the noteworthy researches of our Pro- fessor
Wallace	PERSON	in fixing
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's temporary abode with one
Christopher Mountjoy	PERSON	, wig-maker , at the corner of Silver and
Monkwell	PERSON	streets , do not escape his generously appreciative notice .

		Some - what surprising to most readers will be the number and importance of the extant monuments of bygone ages scattered about
London	LOCATION	.

		Much that is his - toric has vanished , but much still survives ; and a more attractive or useful guide to these cherished mementos of a day that is dead could hardly be desired .

		Sixteen portraits , beginning with Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	's and ending with
Robert Browning	PERSON	's , add to the pictorial richness of the volume .

		A noblewoman Mrs -
Maxwell Scott	PERSON	's Life of the of the French Marquise de la Rochejaquelin -LRB- Long - Revoiution .

		mans -RRB- is based mainly upon Mme. de la
Rochejaquelin	ORGANIZATION	's Memoirs , an English translation of which appeared as long ago as
1827	DATE	, with a pre - face by Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Scott	PERSON	has drawn also upon the Souvenirs of Mme. de la Bouere , another Vendean heroine .

		In point of view the treatment is unreservedly sympathetic toward these defenders of the throne and altar ; not merely toward the women , who were undoubtedly heroic , and the peasants and their leaders , who were equally so , but towards the cause .

		The Vendean revolt and its ruth - less suppression make up one of the most tragic in - cidents of the Revolution , but wrong was not wholly on the side of the '' Blues , '' as the Republicans were called , although the list of their atrocities is longer .

		The absence of shading mars Mrs.
Scott	PERSON	's narrative ; and the characters , which are all courage and virtue and self-sacrifice , give it too much the tone of a work of edification .

		The element of contrast might have been furnished by one personage , to whom she alludes as a mystery , but whose secret has been revealed in one of M. Len6tre 's incomparable essays .

		This is the masquerading Bishop of
Agra	LOCATION	, who gave himself out as direct representative of the Pope and was ac - cepted as such by the Vendean chiefs .

		The comedy ended in tragedy , and the motive -LRB- at least in the beginning -RRB- seems to have been the simple one of trying to extricate himself from the danger of being shot .

		Has any city '' she exclaims , '' half the sublime loveliness of this
Napoli	ORGANIZATION	?

		But no it were impossible , that !

		Sleep too is impos - sible for wondering over her beauty her majestic glory this Old World Naples of mystery and en - chantment ... Ah , this enrapturing , entrancing , enchanting city !

1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 201 vivacious and informally descriptive and narrative , as well as rapturous , are addressed chiefly to either '' M '' or '' G , '' but occasionally to other members of the alphabet ; and their writer , we are told , is '' an American girl . ''

		She shows a quick responsiveness to all that is striking or characteristic or otherwise interesting in the strange sights that greet her Amer - ican eyes .

		Incidentally , too , her book derives abun - dant `` local color '' from the innumerable native words and phrases that it contains for the instruc - tion or the bewilderment of its readers .

		In fact , we have failed to find a single page unsprinkled with foreign terms .

		But a little more care to have these exotic gems free from flaw would have been advis - able .

		A couplet quoted in the third letter as '' Tutto al mondo e vano Ne Vamore agni dolcezza , '' has enough errors to startle even a careless reader .

		Nevertheless , one is moved to envy this American girl for her ecstatic winter on the
Bay of Naples	LOCATION	.

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		Two of the late
William James	PERSON	's student talks , '' On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings '' and '' What Makes a Life Significant , '' have been reprinted by Messrs.
Holt	PERSON	in a little volume entitled '' On Some of Life 's Ideals . ''

		These essays are among the most stim - ulating and helpful of the author 's ethical writings , and in the present inexpensive form it is to be hoped that they will find the widest possible audience .

		Volume Six of the '' Bibliographical Society of Amer -
ica Papers	ORGANIZATION	, '' published by the
University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	, is made up of three noteworthy articles : '' Father
Kino	ORGANIZATION	's Lost History , its Discovery , and its Value , '' by Mr.
Herbert E. Bolton	PERSON	; `` A Bibliography of English Fiction in the
Eighteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
John M. Clapp	PERSON	; and `` The New Classification of Languages and Literatures by the Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
A. C. von Noe	PERSON	* .

		There is in all these papers a freshness of interest not always to be found in the publications of bibliographical societies .

		The latest addition to Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	's admirable series of inexpensive reprints known as the '' World 's Classics '' is `` A Book of English Essays -LRB- 1600-1900 -RRB- , '' selected by Messrs.
Stanley V. Makower	PERSON	and
Basil W. Blackwell	PERSON	.

		Here are brought together more than fifty brief essays , from some forty different essayists , rang - ing from Sir
Thomas Overbury	PERSON	to
Francis Thompson	PERSON	.

		The choice of items is abundantly varied , each of the several types of essay -LRB- the informal , the didactic , the critical , and the like -RRB- being fully represented , and is in other respects judicious . ''

		The Village Homes of
England	LOCATION	'' is the subject of the latest special number of '' The International Studio '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		These '' haunts of ancient peace , '' in which En - gland is so rich , are here dealt with as examples of archi - tecture rather than as records or symbols of the past .

		Mr.
Sydney H. Jones	PERSON	, who is responsible for the text , supplies also a multitude of pen-and-ink and color illus - trations ; a few additional drawings in color are con - tributed by Messrs.
Wilfrid Ball	PERSON	and
John Fullwood	PERSON	.

		The work as a whole forms a competent and interesting treatment of a fascinating subject ; while in all external details the volume measures up to the notably high standard set by previous '' Studio '' special numbers .

Baron D'Ambes	PERSON	, which Messrs. Little ,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	will immediately publish in this country .

		A belated recognition of

Oxford University Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Ernest Hartley Coleridge	PERSON	, grandson of the poet - philosopher , is the compiler and editor of this first com - plete edition of the writings that have been waiting a century -LRB- more or less -RRB- for collection and publication in fitting form .

		257 CLASSICAL R UBBISH .

		The official bulletin of the
Newark Public Library	ORGANIZATION	devotes a page of its current issue to the '' great books '' superstition .

		The homily opens as follows : '' Much literary talk is mere pretense .

		We learn in school days who the great writers are , according to the critics and the text-books , and we learn a few phrases about them , and perhaps , because the course prescribes it , we read a few pages of them .

		When we get out of school or college , do we read them any more ?

		Very few of us do .

		If it strikes our fancy to have a library we buy these great books and put them on its shelves , and look at them with pride , and often with a little guilty feeling .

		We think we ought to read them . ''

		Now with all this we have no quarrel .

		It is plain truth , given a somewhat philistine accent in the expression .

		When boys and girls leave school , most of them turn their backs upon lit - erature , and will have none of it .

		This deplor - able fact is , we are persuaded , a consequence of the way in which pedantic pedagogues use works of literature as educational appliances .

		But the fact is none the less deplorable , and it behooves those who have to do with educational work to remedy the conditions which bring about such a result .

		Our librarian mentor goes on to say -LRB- and here we most emphatically part company with him -RRB- `` We are quite mistaken we ought not to read them if we do not really like them . ''

		Which is to say : We ought not to be virtuous if our natural inclinations are sinful , or we ought not to be sober if we get more satisfaction from being drunk .

		For there undoubtedly is such a thing as good taste in reading , and if we have not acquired it we should confess the defect in a humble spirit , and not resort to blustering denial after the fashion of the philistines in all ages .

		Humility , not hypocrisy , is what we need to practice in such a case .

		For a man to pretend to like books that in reality bore him unspeak - ably is a grievous fault , but to assert that be - cause they bore him they can not be worth his attention is mere childish petulance .

		We remem - ber the time when we were profoundly convinced that all this talk about the beauty of Shake - speare and
Tennyson	PERSON	was sheer humbug , and scornfully rejected it as something not to be taken seriously .

		But that was at the age of twelve or thereabouts , and when the awakening 230 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, came , it bad all the fervor of a religious conver - sion .

		Speaking of the world 's great books , our bulletin further remarks : '' One may dare to say that save for the very , very few who care for that kind of book , they are not worth the read - ing . ''

		From a child , this utterance would be merely amusing , but from an educational organ which speaks for that great agency of culture , the public library , it is simply shocking .

		If there is any purpose for which public libraries exist , and which in any way justifies them as a charge upon the public funds , it is that of in - creasing the number of '' the very , very few who care for that kind of book , '' and of opening the minds of the many who view good literature from the seat of the scornful .

		To encourage them in their benighted self-sufficiency is nothing less than a crime against culture , and it is atrocious for such encouragement to come from an educa - tional agency which is under bonds to be uplift - ing in its influence .

		According to the counsel of iniquity which has occasioned these reflections , `` the great , vital , fundamental , universal books of light and power ... have , most of them , a message only for a very small circle , '' which would seem to be a paradox quite incapable of solution .

		The adjectives used in this characterization must be taken ironically to give the statement even a semblance of truth .

		For if books are in very truth vital , fundamental , and universal , they must have a message for every intelligent human being , and it is at his own serious cost that any individual will close his ears to the message , or refrain from the effort to decipher it .

		`` He that is filthy , let him be filthy still '' is a scrip - ture that would seem to apply in his case , and the worst service that could be done him would be to persuade him that the message was not meant for his hearing .

		To argue thus is to say , in effect , that no aspirations and idealisms are worth while , that souls sunk in the slough should make no uncomfortable effort to rise out of it , that the circumscribed vision is well enough , and the gleam of glories beyond is a delusion .

		One can not too often recall
Ruskin	PERSON	's indignant repudiation of the debased gospel of culture which preaches that the best literature is too bright and good for human nature 's daily food . ''

		Will you go and gossip with your housemaid , or your stable-boy , when you may talk with kings and queens ; or flatter yourself that it is with any worthy con - sciousness of your own claims to respect , that you jostle with the hungry and common crowd for entree here , and audience there , when all the while this eternal court is open to you , with its society , wide as the world , multitudinous as its days , the chosen , and the mighty , of every place and time ? ''

		That there may be no misunderstanding as to the nature of the advice offered by the
Newark Library	LOCATION	to its patrons , we are given a list of the books against which readers are warned as un - profitable .

		This list includes most of the works in which genius has attained its highest reach , and which have most profoundly moved the souls of men .

		The `` Iliad , '' the `` Odyssey '' and the '' ^ Eneid '' are here , as are also `` The Divine Comedy , '' `` Paradise Lost , '' ``
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' and `` Faust . ''

		^ schylus and Euripides are placed on the Index , although for some un - accountable reason Sophocles and Aristophanes escape condemnation .

		Aristotle and Plato are , of course , marked for slaughter , as are also
Cicero	PERSON	,
Epictetus	ORGANIZATION	, and
Marcus Aurelius	PERSON	.

		The secondary classics of English literature are mostly under the ban , including `` The
Canter	PERSON	- bury Tales , '' `` The Faerie Queene , '' `` The Pil - grim 's Progress , '' the '' Morte d'
Arthur	PERSON	, '' ''
Tris	PERSON	- tram Shandy , ''
Burke	PERSON	's speeches , and
Gibbon	PERSON	's `` Decline and Fall . ''

		Addison ,
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, and Montaigne are essayists who have no message for the many , and even the `` Imitation '' is not spared .

		Mill 's `` Political Economy '' appears here in bad eminence , evidently as a type of all the great works that have clarified human thought and advanced the intellectual life .

		We only wonder that the list -LRB- of some thirty great names -RRB- was not made much longer , for it does not come anywhere near to exhausting the chief literary sources of spiritual refreshment .

		It does , how - ever , guard the unwary reader against the errors into which he is most likely to fall , and assures him that most of what he has been taught about literature , either in school or by the masters of criticism , is unworthy of credence .

		Of course this sort of counsel is a most damnable perversion of the function of a public library , which , while it must recognize the deplorable fact that the best books are not called for nearly as often as the worst ones , should nevertheless bend its main energies to the redress of this bad balance , and should take more satisfaction in the one borrower who asks for Homer or
Dante	ORGANIZATION	, for `` Don Quixote '' or `` Faust , '' than in the ninety and nine who swell the statistics of circulation by bearing homeward the latest puerility of the latest popular novelist .

		It is difficult to have patience with the argument that neglect of a classic offers prim a facie evi - dence that tradition has overrated it .

		When the best minds of many generations are unanimous
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE D1A1 231 in delaring the supreme excellence of a book , it is no counsel of perfection to recommend it to the attention of the most casual reader as a source , for him personally , of rich spiritual sustenance .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A NOTABLE BIBLIOGRAPHY , now in preparation by Professor
John M. Clapp	PERSON	, is to be devoted to English prose fiction of the eighteenth century , and is expected to contain when completed between five thousand and fifty-five hundred titles .

		The laborious but not uninteresting task was begun by Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	eight years ago , and has been prosecuted chiefly at the British Museum , whose catalogue must be the chief dependence of anyone engaged in such an undertaking as this .

		An account of his labors was read by Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	at the late annual meeting of the
Chicago	LOCATION	Chapter of the
Bibliograph	PERSON	- ical Society of
America	LOCATION	, and is printed in volume six of that
Society	ORGANIZATION	's `` Papers . ''

		To give an idea of the scope and method of his work , we quote a passage from his instructive and readable article .

		`` To be really useful such a work must list not only the books which we should to-day classify as Novels or Short Stories -LRB- of these , according to my own list , there were between
2000	DATE	and
3000	DATE	-RRB- , but also as many as possible of the great number of other works whose appeal was chiefly , or largely , that of fiction .

		These may be grouped , roughly , in four classes : First , the narrative Chap-books .

		Second , the works of Pseudo-History , Pseudo-Biography , and Pseudo-Travel , of which there were many , especially in
the first half of the century	DATE	.

		In this class would be included the longer Criminal Bio - graphies .

		Third , the stream of Tracts and
Pam	PERSON	- phlets , cast into narrative form , discussing current questions political , social , religious , educational , or personal in a persuasive , polemic , or satirical way .

		These also were very numerous , particularly at the beginning and the end of the century .

		Fourth , various miscellaneous works : Jest-books ; ' Miscellanies ' so called , made up of both expository and narrative matter ; certain collections of Essays , like those of
Tom Brown	PERSON	, or Letters , like Mrs.
Elizabeth Rowe	PERSON	's Friendship in
Death	LOCATION	, in which there is a considerable narrative element ; and a few odds and ends . ''

		It is clear , as Mr.
Clapp	PERSON	points out , that no one bibliographer can cover the whole field of English fiction in this systematic and painstaking manner .

		There is room enough for many workers , and even in the task that he has set himself , one would think him in need of helpers .

		THE LAST LABORS OF A VETERAN LITERARY WORKER , who has stuck to his task for more than forty years and then died pen in hand , figuratively speaking , are likely soon to see the light in posthu - mous publication .

		It appears from a communica - tion of Mr.
Samuel C. Chew	PERSON	, Jr. , lately printed in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Evening Post , '' that the late Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's closing years of Shakespeare editorship had brought almost to completion a fifteenth play in the series whose beginning dates back to
1871	DATE	.

		In a letter written to Mr.
Chew	PERSON	only a few days before his death , Dr.
Furness	PERSON	said , after referring to the loss of several dear friends : `` My nepenthe , how - ever , is work , into which it is impossible at eighty to throw as much energy as at thirty .

		If all goes well I hope to deliver ' Cymbeline ' to the mercies of the printers in a month or two .

		And then I shall rest and patch up my old body for heaven . ''

		As six years have elapsed since the `` Antony and Cleopatra '' was delivered to the mercies above named an interval only equalled , in the history of this Variorum edition , by that between `` King Lear '' and `` Othello '' there is reason to hope the `` Cymbeline '' may indeed be practically ready for publication , and that its early appearance may be counted on .

		Further quotation from the editor 's correspondence claims a place here .

		Mr.
Chew	PERSON	communicates this passage from an earlier letter : `` To know that fresh , young , enthusiastic spirits are entering the world of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, wherein there lies for them illimitable growth , can not but fill with measureless content one who is finishing the journey , and to whom that world is fast vanishing in the lengthening shadows . ''

		In referring to the Baconian theory , which he said was almost as prevalent as the measles , and from which most people recovered as soon , Dr.
Furness	PERSON	is quoted as demanding with mock indignation that the Baconians should read the essay `` Of Gardens `` and then follow it with the fourth act of `` The
Winter	DATE	's Tale , '' or read the essay `` Of Love '' and then the third act of `` Romeo and Juliet . ''

		`` If they still believe , '' said he , `` that the man who wrote the essays wrote those scenes , I give them up ! ''

		DETAILS OF HARVARD 'S PROMISED LIBRARY , the magnificent gift of Mrs.
George D. Widener	PERSON	, mother of the late
Harry Elkins Widener	PERSON	, to whose memory the building is to be dedicated , have now been made public , and indicate that the new structure will take rank with the world 's largest and finest library buildings .

		Exceeding in dimensions the great
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, it will almost equal the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and will have a capacity of nearly two and one - half million volumes , with fifty-nine miles of shelving to hold them .

		Its main reading-room , seating 375 persons , will be larger than the famous
Bates Hall	PERSON	of the
Boston	LOCATION	library , while there will be no fewer than eighty special or private reading-rooms for
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	professors and other scholars desiring seclusion of this sort .

		Also 350 still smaller studies will be provided , so that no reasonable request for privacy in one 's literary labors need be refused .

		The
Widener Memorial Hall	ORGANIZATION	, on the first floor , will be a chief feature of the interior , and will be a room forty by thirty-two feet in measurement , with stack-room in the rear for the
Widener	ORGANIZATION	collection .

		The dimensions of the building 232 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, as a whole are given as 206 by 275 feet ; the mate - rial will be brick and limestone , and the construction will be fire-proof throughout .


Gore Hall	PERSON	, the home , since
1841	DATE	, of
America	LOCATION	's fourth-largest library , will be torn down to make room , in part , for the incom - parably more commodious new quarters ; and until the expected completion of the memorial building , in about two years , the books will be stored chiefly in
Randall Hall	PERSON	, where also the card-catalogue will be placed , while reading-room accommodations will be provided in
Massachusetts Hall	LOCATION	.

		It is hoped that the dedication of the world 's finest university library building may take place in the commence -
ment week of 1914	DATE	.

		THE APPEAL OF THE LITERARY WEEKLY to popular favor has been as successful with our English cousins as it has been the contrary with us .


London	LOCATION	hebdomadal publications devoted more or less conspicuously to the interests of literature are numerous and of no mean order of merit .

		That so many periodicals like the `` Nation , '' `` Athenaeum , '' `` Academy , '' `` Spectator , '' `` Satur - day Review , '' and `` Speaker '' should flourish side by side , while in this country hardly more than one or two weekly publications of like character can be found even by the most kindly-disposed scrutiny , is rather remarkable .

		And what is more , the English list is now to be lengthened by a notable addition at the hands of the enterprising house of
Messrs. J. M. Dent & Sons	ORGANIZATION	.

		On the eighteenth of
October	DATE	there will appear , according to announcement , a new literary weekly whose contributors will be of various countries and of divers parties and creeds .

		For example , articles are promised from such writers as Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, who will treat the subject of industrial unrest ; Mr.
G. K. Chesterton	PERSON	, who will handle peasant proprietorship ; Professor
Hans Delbriick	PERSON	, who will consider how to make more cordial the relations between
England	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	; Professor
Cestre	PERSON	-LRB- of the
University of Bordeaux	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , who will give a Frenchman 's view of Mr.
George Bernard Shaw	PERSON	; Professor
Saintsbury	LOCATION	, who will write on Balzac and on Sir
Walter Scott	PERSON	; and the Abbe * Houtin , whose pen will depict the character of Pope Pius the Tenth .

		A periodical so hospitable to writers of whatever nation or creed might well choose for a motto , if it had not already been preempted ,
Tros	ORGANIZATION	Tyriusque mihi nullo dis - crimine agetur .

		... SUPPOSED QUALIFICATIONS FOR LIBRARIANSHIP , as that office is viewed by the uninitiated , who often regard it as a dignified sinecure to be obtained by favor or influence of a political or other nature , in - clude , first and foremost , a limitless capacity for sitting in an easy chair and reading books all day .

		Miss
Hoover	PERSON	, the experienced head of the
Galesburg Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, takes occasion , in her current Report , to touch on this matter as follows : '' With the ma - jority of people the idea prevails that the duties of a library attendant consist in handing out the re - quired book or furnishing the desired information , leaving the attendant ample time to spend in the enjoyment of reading .

		The frequency with which an applicant for a library position states as a quali - fication the fact that he is ' very fond of reading ' proves the popularity of the idea . ''

		But , as a matter of prosaic fact , '' each day in a busy library sees a large amount of routine work done aside from the delivery of books , the compiling and recording of statistics , re-writing of book-cards , issuing of bor - rowers ' cards , writing of notices of overdue and of reserve books , the recovery of overdue books , the business correspondence , the financial book-keeping , the type-writing of book-lists and bulletins , the me - chanical preparation of books for circulation , the mending and repair of books , the care of pamphlets , keeping books in order on the shelves , '' and various other duties which are not mentioned , but which any library worker can easily add .

		In short , to adapt an old and familiar rhyme , Though other folk 's work be from sun to sun , The librarian 's task is never done .

		`` THE TOLSTOY OF
GERMANY	LOCATION	'' is what some of Professor
Rudolf Eucken	PERSON	's admirers call the famous professor of philosophy at the
University of Jena	ORGANIZATION	.

		His acceptance of the exchange professorship at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	for the coming year -LRB- at the same time that ProfessorBergson accepts a similar call to
Columbia	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- directs attention anew to his personality and his work .

		The feeling of attachment and enthusiastic devotion with which his many disciples regard him , the deserved distinction of being awarded a Nobel prize , the increasing rapidity with which his books sell both in his own and in foreign lands , give assur - ance that his lectures at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	this
winter	DATE	will be well worth hearing and will not be delivered before empty benches .

		Dr.
Eucken	PERSON	is sixty-seven years old , and has held his present chair at
Jena	PERSON	since his call in
1874	DATE	from
Basel	LOCATION	, where he had occupied a similar position for three years .

		His university training was received at
Gottingen	LOCATION	.

		His best-known book , to English readers at least , is `` The Problem of Human Life , as Viewed by the
Great Thinkers	ORGANIZATION	from
Plato	LOCATION	to the Present Time . ''

		The teachings of this philosopher , like those of his eminent contem - poraries , Professors
James	PERSON	and
Bergson	PERSON	, emphasize the non-fixedness of reality .

		Truth with them is not something forever finished and unalterable , but rather an evolution , a process that continues , a drama that unrolls .

		The problem of the universe can hope for no final solution , but must be attacked afresh , from new points of assault , in each succeeding age .

		Professor
Eucken	PERSON	's way of handling the riddle has afforded stimulus and cheer for many a bewildered and often pessimistic student of the baffling problem .

		IMPROVING THE CONDITIONS OF COUNTRY LIFE forms one of the themes most frequently turned to oratorical uses by the most volubly eloquent of our present candidates for the highest public office in the land .

		And meanwhile , it is worth noting , this same improvement of rural conditions is being made
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 233 the subject of some quiet and , it is already evident , fruitful study by the combined intelligence of the
Massachusetts Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	and the
Massa	PERSON	- chusetts
Library Club	ORGANIZATION	.

		An example of what rural library work can accomplish has been recently fur - nished by the little hill town of
Pomfret	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	, whose activities in this field are so well described by Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	in a most interesting illus - trated pamphlet .

		It was only the other day that our attention was called to the improved condition of a western
Massachusetts	LOCATION	farming town of not more than five hundred inhabitants ; and amid the other signs of local progress was the revived aspect of the public library , which had recently been placed in charge of a trained librarian and provided with suitable quarters .

		Books are not the sole road to salvation , and unassisted by other agencies they can do little ; but in the interplay of all the countless elements of a progressive civilization the dissemi - nation of good reading-matter probably counts for much more than is generally suspected .

		BOOK-BUYERS , BOOK-BORROWERS , AND THE PAR - CELS POST ought to have been brought into a more satisfactory relationship , the two former to the last - named , than was effected by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	in the provis - ions of the new postal regulation to take effect next
January	DATE	.

		Books and similar printed matter ought to enjoy the benefit of the reduced rates accorded to merchandise under the new system .

		Librarians , publishers , booksellers , library-users , and all who handle books are interested in securing facilities less expensive than those now furnished by the mail and the express companies , for the carriage of books to and from libraries and bookshops and from friend to friend .

		The approaching holiday season will once more make our people conscious that the pur - chase of gift book 's for Christmas offerings by no means ends the outlay necessary for their presenta - tion to distant friends .

		Though the green-grocer and the drygoods-dealer may profit by the new regu - lation , the book-hungry backwoods folk , dependent on some form of library extension for their reading matter , must possess their souls in patience until a dilatory
Congress	ORGANIZATION	shall see fit to frame and pass a parcels-post law that is something more than a rider to an appropriation bill hurried through in the last days of an unduly protracted session .

		REORGANIZING A PUBLIC LIBRARY , especially one that has reached a considerable size and is nearly a quarter of a century old , is no holiday diversion .

		The new librarian of the
Los Angeles Public Library	ORGANIZATION	is now engaged in this work of reorganization , as appears from the current Report of that energetic and progressive institution .

		In the Directors ' Report we read : '' On
September 8th	DATE	-LSB- of last year -RSB- Mr.
Everett R. Perry	PERSON	, of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, was appointed librarian .

		Through Mr.
Perry	PERSON	's tire - less efforts since that time , several departments of the Library have been reorganized , and the standards of efficiency of the library service very highly im - proved .

		This has been attested by a wider interest in the
Library	ORGANIZATION	, manifested by a very heavy increase in circulation . ''

		The first of six
Carnegie	ORGANIZATION	branch libraries is about to be built , and sites for five of the six have been given and have met with the
Board	ORGANIZATION	's approval .

		From the reports of the various heads of departments , as well as from that of the librarian-in - chief , it is clear that the literary needs of the com - munity are to suffer no neglect , as far as Mr.
Perry	PERSON	and his associates can prevent it .

		CHINESE SENSATIONAL FICTION apparently re - sembles the same class of literature elsewhere in its shameless appeal to the love of all that is hair - raising and horrible in description , plot , and character-painting .

		That our '' shilling shockers '' and '' penny dreadfuls '' should have their counter - parts wherever books are printed , is as inevitable as that rivers should run down to the sea .

		The ''
North China Herald	ORGANIZATION	'' deplores the crude sensa - tionalism of certain recent native works of fiction that seem to be showing a tendency to supplant the older classic romances .

		One of these lurid tales bears the bloodcurdling title , `` The Magistrate 's Decision on the Dismembered Corpse of a Rake . ''

		A synopsis of the plot is given , but even that is too disagreeable to reproduce here .

		One is amused , however , by the unconscious humor displayed in the last chapter of the book , where the author turns preacher and gravely points the moral of his story by cautioning his readers against indulging their passions and harboring in their bosoms the vices depicted in the preceding pages .

		Nine-tenths of the readers will skip the moral , and the remaining tenth will give it slight heed ; but the manufacturer of the wretched stuff has salved his conscience , or thinks he has .

		BOOKS AND THE WEATHER seem to stand in a certain important relationship , the one to the other , that is recognized by booksellers and publishers .

		Without going so far as to say that book-sales are '' servile to all the skyey influences , '' one might safely maintain that , other things being equal , a rainy season will quicken the circulation of books , and a season of sunshine will retard it .

		Just now the abundant and protracted rainstorms in
England	LOCATION	are rejoicing the English publishers ' and booksellers ' hearts ; for the people , out of sheer desperation , if from no higher motive , are turning to literature and swelling the receipts of those who deal in printed matter , who in their turn are joyfully making hay while the sun is obscured .

		And this may suggest to the curious observer that one great reason why northern
Europe	LOCATION	reads more than southern , why
Scandinavia	LOCATION	buys more books than
Spain	LOCATION	, lies in the greater prevalence of gloomy weather among the hyperboreans .

		It was confidently predicted in
Copenhagen	LOCATION	not long ago that as soon as Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	's book on the
South Pole	LOCATION	should appear , 234 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, three out of every four street-car conductors and motormen would be reading it .

		Could any such gratifying spectacle be looked for in the lands of sunshine and of almost uninterrupted outdoor life and of perpetual dolce far niente ?

		FRIENDLINESS TO THE FOREIGNER is the note struck by the so-called Foreign Reading Room of the
Broadway Branch of the Cleveland Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		This room , says an illustrated leaflet issued by the library , '' is very interesting to those who do not for - get the Fatherland .

		It contains the books in lan - guages other than English , and also magazines from
Europe	LOCATION	.

		The librarian will always be glad to receive suggestions for new titles . ''

		Attention is given to the literary needs of Bohemians , Germans , Poles , Slovenians , Hungarians , Finns , Italians ,
Lithua	LOCATION	- nians and others .

		The English-reading public is , of course , also abundantly provided for .

		Small de - scriptive folders and book-lists in a number of foreign languages are circulated by the
Broadway Branch	LOCATION	, which seems to be in the heart of the foreign quarter of
Cleveland	LOCATION	, and to be doing its best to relieve the immigrant 's homesickness and to open for him the way to intelligent citizenship in the land of his adoption .

		... `` A FUNDAMENTAL PARADOX OF EDUCATION , '' which the advocates of vocational and industrial training would do well to consider , finds itself well stated by President
Hibben	PERSON	of
Princeton	LOCATION	in a discussion of `` True Conservatism in Education , '' in the
New York	LOCATION	`` Times . ''

		He calls attention to the frequency with which `` the most immediate and direct means of bringing about a desired end for that very reason tends to neutralize itself , and thus to defeat its own purpose .

		In other words , there is no short cut to knowledge .

		The particular task in life must be allowed for some time at least to remain in the background of thought and of endeavor .

		A thorough training of all the powers of the man is the best preparation for the particular work , whatever it may be , which awaits him . ''

		One is reminded by this of the especial and diligent attention bestowed by Dr.
Martineau	PERSON	, in his school days , on the studies least congenial to him and least likely to bear directly on his woi ' k in after life .

		The story of the youth who , on being asked why he spent so much time over the dialogues of Plato , answered , '' Because I am going to be a civil engineer , '' is not without its point and significance .

		PUBLISHERS IN PETTICOATS will not long astonish by their rarity .

		In this country we already have the
Alice Harriman Company	ORGANIZATION	, with a number of noteworthy books to its credit ; and in
London	LOCATION	there has just been organized a promising business house under the name of the
Happy Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	conducted entirely by women , handling only books written by women , and , to a considerable extent , employing women in their manufacture .

		The first venture of the
Happy Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	is the maiden effort of a new writer , Mrs.
M. M. Lee	PERSON	, and is entitled '' Love 's Victories , '' which should appeal especially to women .

		Women writers may like to have the address of this new publishing house ; it is 133
Salisbury Square	LOCATION	, Fleet Street , E. C. ENGLISH POLITICS AND ENGLISH LITERATURE .

		-LRB- Special Correspondence of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The combination of politics and the practice of letters is becoming rare in
England	LOCATION	, and perhaps in other countries as well .

		Or it might be more just to say that it is less successful : that we fail to produce now -LRB- for
Lord Morley	ORGANIZATION	's work , excellent as it is , belongs rather to a past age -RRB- men who are at once considerable politicians and in the front rank as authors men of the stamp of Lord
Macaulay	PERSON	and
Benjamin Disraeli	PERSON	,
Earl of Beaconsfield	ORGANIZATION	.

		I say this with the full knowledge that we possess cer - tain members of the Cabinet at the present moment who have written agreeably in the past , and may do so again .

		Our Irish secretary is still Mr.
Augustine Birrell	PERSON	, who won his literary spurs many years ago with several pleasant volumes of light essays ; our secretary for
Foreign Affairs	ORGANIZATION	, Sir
Edward Grey	PERSON	, wrote a book on fly-fishing , which has become a classic in its own field ; an ex-prime minister ,
Lord Rosebery	PERSON	, has produced more than one biographical work of interest and literary ability .

		But none of these men , not even Mr.
Birrell	PERSON	, can be said to take literature seriously .

		Politics is their chief occupa - tion : they turn to the other -LRB- some of them -RRB- in the all too scanty moments of leisure snatched from parliamentary duties ; and it is pretty safe to say that such immortality as they may earn will be due to their deeds in the political rather than in the literary field .

		Nor can I detect signs of any new men arising to take the places of those I have mentioned .

		Parliament still possesses Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	; for a short while he had as companions in the
House	ORGANIZATION	two tolerably distinguished novelists in Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	and Mr.
A. E. W. Mason	PERSON	.

		They came , and saw , and were conquered : the Mother of Par - liaments proved too much for them .

		Mr.
Belloc	PERSON	has never ceased since to declare his conviction that the whole system of party government is rotten to the core .

		There has , in fact , been of late years a general increase in the pace of political life , a '' speeding - up '' process , as the modern phrase has it , which must necessarily be alien to the literary mind .

		Our legislators are now paid for their services , and ac - cordingly they are full of new-born zeal : they feel that they must give the country something for its money ; and the consequence is that they have fallen into the habit of passing new bills at break - neck speed and after very inadequate consideration .

		Indeed , the ordinary
Member of Parliament	ORGANIZATION	has no occasion to think matters over for himself : he is
1912	DATE	.

		J THE DIAJL 235 practically the creature of his party , and must obey the dictates of the machine .

		Now , your man of letters , at the worst , has a sort of pride : he believes in his own judgment ; he was chosen to this respon - sible post , he imagines , because of his superiority of intellect , and it would clearly be absurd not to utilize this valuable quality in the public interest .

		Consequently , he is apt to prove a difficult subject for the management of the party authorities , who require above all things men who will do what they are told and argue to order .

		It is for this reason that we find so large a preponderance of legal gen - tlemen in the
House	ORGANIZATION	.

		And the place that used to be filled by the man of letters is now commonly oc - cupied by the journalist .

		I perceive that
Lord Morley	PERSON	, in a recent speech delivered at a complimentary dinner to a well-known journalist , remarked upon the number of recent prime ministers who had made their mark in the realm of books .

		If they had been drawn by the necessities of life into journalism , he , in his editorial days , would have guaranteed any one of the five a very excellent salary .

		Perhaps we should not take the words of an after-dinner speaker too seriously ; but it is a little remarkable that
Lord Morley	PERSON	, possibly our last sur - viving example of the combined politician and man of letters , should instinctively have appraised the worth of these gentlemen in the light of his experi - ence as editor rather than as literary critic .

		Disraeli ,
Gladstone	LOCATION	,
Rosebery	ORGANIZATION	,
Balfour	PERSON	, the late Lord
Salis	PERSON	- bury -LRB- these , I imagine , were the sacred five referred to -RRB- all possessed undoubted ability as writers .

		But the majority of them -LRB- I am inclined to except Mr.
Balfour	PERSON	, who has written a
Defence of Philosophic Doubt	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- saw things from the point of view of the poli - tical journalist , a point of view which is proverbi - ally one-eyed .

		Their literary quality was apt to be swamped in their desire to prove a thesis : the habit of debate had gained possession of them .

		Thus it was even as long ago as the days of Macaulay , who wrote his History of
England	LOCATION	and found it turn under his hands to a
Defence of Whiggery	ORGANIZATION	.

		But the name of Macaulay remains , and will re - main , a bright spot in the literary history of his time .

		We may perhaps attribute this to his consistently independent attitude .

		He entered Parliament as the member for
Calne	PERSON	, then a '' pocket borough '' of the Lord Lansdowne of that day , but with the express understanding that he was to have complete freedom of action .

		Subsequently , when he took office , in
1832	DATE	, he was always prepared to sacrifice his place rather than his convictions .

		And , in his days , it was pos - sible for a Member of Parliament to speak his mind in debate and to record his vote according to his real opinions .

		The party machine had not yet arrived , to crush all the individuality out of the private mem - ber , making of him nothing but a single cog-wheel in the complicated apparatus of power .

		It was still possible for a man to enter the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	and preserve his self-respect .

		It was not necessary for him then to keep his name before his constituents , under pain of being forced to resign if he failed to take a share in debate , or to make himself conspicu - ous at question-time .

		He had not the fear of the local paper before his eyes .


Gibbon	PERSON	, the historian of the '' Decline and Fall , '' could sit seven years for Liskeard , recording none but silent votes .

		Pride hastened to excuse a natural timidity , and he con - fessed that even '' the success of my pen discouraged the trial of my voice . ''

		Yet , as his training in the
Southampton	LOCATION	militia enabled him to examine the battles of antiquity with an intelligent eye , so his Parliamentary experience was not without value .

		`` The eight sessions that I sat in
Parliament	LOCATION	, '' he wrote , '' were a school of civil prudence , the first and most essential virtue of an historian . ''

		The great speakers filled
Gibbon	PERSON	with despair : the bad ones with apprehension , to use once again his inimitable stateliness of phrase .

		More than half a century earlier , the same diffidence made an equally silent member of
Addison	PERSON	, who presented the curious spectacle , impossible in these strenuous days , of a silent
Secretary of State	ORGANIZATION	.

		The great essayist is re - corded , perhaps apocryphally , to have made one attempt in the direction of parliamentary oratory , but his shyness overcame him , and he sat down in confusion .

		Indeed , it must be admitted that our literary politicians have not invariably attained a success as public speakers commensurate with the command of language they displayed in other fields .

		Against Macaulay ,
Sheridan	PERSON	, and
Disraeli	PERSON	must be set
Addison	PERSON	,
Gibbon	PERSON	,
John Stuart Mill	PERSON	, and perhaps the late Mr.
Lecky	PERSON	.

		But Mill , though not an elo - quent debater , was heard with attention , and his career in
Parliament	LOCATION	may be said to have extended his influence .

		The historian and the philosopher , as is only nat - ural , bulk more largely in active political life than the poet .

		Yet
Andrew Marvell	PERSON	and
Matthew Prior	PERSON	sat in
Parliament	LOCATION	, and the latter was secretary to the embassy at
The Hague	ORGANIZATION	and afterwards to the pleni - potentiaries who concluded the
Peace of Ryswick	ORGANIZATION	.

		A lighter strain in verse has proved not incompatible with a certain success in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	.


W. M. Praed	PERSON	and
Richard Monckton Milnes	PERSON	may be cited as examples .

		Of novelists few can be said to have made much mark in parliamentary history , with the considerable exceptions of Disraeli and
Bulwer Lytton	ORGANIZATION	.

		Yet the life has evidently possessed a fascination for them .

		Thackeray stood for
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	in
1857	DATE	, but was defeated , perhaps fortunately , by Mr.
Card	PERSON	well , afterwards Secretary for War ; some ten years later his biographer ,
Anthony Trol	PERSON	- lope , followed his footsteps in becoming candidate for
Beverley	LOCATION	.

		In more recent times Mr.
Anthony Hope Hawkins	PERSON	, among a host of others , has tried his fortune at the polls .

		But it is doubtful whether modern parliamentary life can find much use for the peculiar qualities of the successful novelist .

		Perhaps Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, with his remarkably constructive imagination , might prove an exception .

		Whatever appeal politics may make to literature , it is clear that literature , in itself , makes but the smallest appeal to the politician .

		The man of let - 236 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, ters at the present day receives but little in the shape of honors or rewards from those in power ; and what little he obtains is almost invariably bestowed upon him -LRB- as though of set purpose -RRB- for some other rea - son than his achievements as an author .

		Carlyle was offered a baronetcy by Sir
Robert Peel	PERSON	;
Tenny	PERSON	- son was raised to the peerage .

		But since the date of his accession to that high order it is difficult to think of any author -LRB- with the possible exception of the late Sir
Walter Besant	PERSON	-RRB- who has been included in the list of honors for purely literary reasons .

		We have a sufficiency of military and naval knights , as is only just and proper : to the lay mind it seems that the order of knighthood might reasonably be confined to the two services .

		But since the politician and the medical man have now come to claim at least an equal share in these honors we can not but feel that literature is somewhat neglected .

		We have , it is true , a few knights in our ranks .

		An editor or two has received the honor ; a newspaper proprietor has been raised to the peerage ; the other day a pub - lisher was knighted ; but these honors hardly belong t6 pure literature .

		Among authors we possess Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle	PERSON	, who owes his honor chiefly to his services during the South African War ; Sir
A. T. Quiller Couch	PERSON	and Sir
Gilbert Parker	PERSON	, who owe theirs to political work ; and Sir
H. Rider Hag	PERSON	- gard , whose suggestions for a scheme of national land settlement in
Great Britain	LOCATION	were held to out - weigh his claims as a writer of romance .

		A knight - hood is , I admit , but a barren honor ; but if we may no longer look for embassies to The Hague , like Mat Prior , or even consulships such as fell to the lot of
Charles Lever	PERSON	, it remains , I imagine , the best that we can expect .

		It might occasionally be bestowed upon men of real mark in their profession , as a re - ward for excellence in their own work rather than for a combination of literary talent with political or other services .

London	LOCATION	,
September 17 , 1912	DATE	.

		COMMUNICATION .

		SOME POINTS IN THE HISTORY OF FORT
DEARBORN	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The nature of Mr.
Currey	PERSON	's letter in THE DIAL for
Sept. 16	DATE	, concerning my review of his book on
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	, impels me to submit the following observa - tions .

		In the review in question I developed reasons for the judgment expressed that from the serious historical viewpoint the work is of but slight , if any , value .

		The author replies to this with a bitter arraignment which seeks to discredit the review by representing the re - viewer as prejudiced and dishonest , and by explaining away a few of the many errors to which attention was called in the review .

		Did time and inclination permit , it would be much easier to riddle the statements contained in the writer 's letter than it was to establish the unsound character of his book .

		However , I have as little inclination for , as the public would have interest in , a personal dispute with Mr.
Currey	PERSON	.

		To enter upon such a course would only detract attention from the sole issue of any public or , to me at least , private interest .

		So far as the pub - lic interest is concerned , it is immaterial whether the reviewer is in private life habitually dishonest , as Mr.
Currey	PERSON	seems to think , or whether Mr.
Currey	PERSON	's passion overcame for the time being his sense of fairness and his regard for the truth , as the reviewer believes .

		It is a matter of some concern to the reading public , I take it , whether the truth of history lies with Mr.
Currey	PERSON	's book which was reviewed , or with the criticisms which the reviewer passed upon it .

		Nor do I perceive the utility of imposing upon the readers of THE DIAL a detailed discussion of the his - torical issues raised in Mr.
Currey	PERSON	's letter .

		It would be an easy thing to show that all of them are unsound .

		Mrs.
Heald	PERSON	was but a young woman in
1812	DATE	, instead of thirty - six years of age ; it is not true that the public had no access to knowledge concerning the date of begin - ning the construction of the first
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	, prior to the reviewer 's `` Record-Herald '' article of
last month	DATE	; it is a fact that '' Surgeon '' Cooper was the same indi - vidual as '' surgeon 's mate '' Cooper , and that neither he nor another man of this name was killed in the massacre ; it is not true , as any schoolboy knows , that
General Dearborn	ORGANIZATION	performed '' distinguished '' services on the Niagara frontier .

		And so with the other errors which the author committed , and now vainly seeks to deny .

		I neither expect nor care to convince Mr.
Cur	PERSON	- rey of these things ; the casual reader can have little interest in a detailed discussion of them ; and other stu - dents who turn their attention to the field of local his - tory will find little difficulty in deciding which of us is in the right .

		In a word , my only interest in the whole matter is to see what I believe to be the truth of history prevail .

		The only issue between us which interests me pertains solely to this .

		I believe the author 's preparation for his work to have been only superficial ; that his methods of work are fundamentally unsound ; and consequently that the issue of his labors , judged as history , is value - less .

		In his resentment over the expression of this judgment he has resorted to a bitter ad hominem argu - ment with the design of discrediting it .

		In this connection one or two further points demand attention .

		It was furthest from my thought to impute the invention of the stories growing out of
Captain Heald	ORGANIZATION	's action with reference to the arms and ammuni - tion to Mr.
Currey	PERSON	, and this a correct reading of the review will show .

		The extent of his responsibility is that he ignorantly copied the stories as though they were true .

		So far as his statements concerning the paper I read at the meeting of the
Mississippi Valley Historical Association	ORGANIZATION	are concerned , he has simply ascribed to the audience generally -LRB- and this without any possible war - rant -RRB- what I am quite willing to believe were his own private impressions .

		A letter of inquiry as to the source on which he based his statement concerning the re - viewer 's futile efforts '' to secure a further hearing '' at the hands of the
Chicago Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, elicits the explanation that he '' got the impression '' from a re - porter 's article in the '' Tribune '' recently .

		The truth is that the reviewer is in no way responsible for the article in question , which abounded in errors , and that the statement which Mr.
Currey	PERSON	based upon it is quite without foundation in fact .

		THE FOUNDER OF A GREAT AMERICAN PUBLISHING HOUSE .

		* Some of the most interesting books about books and bookmen have in recent years come from the hands of those engaged in the business of producing books and in enlisting in their ser - vice the most distinguished and talented writers of books .

		The reminiscences of men like Mr.
Edward Marston	PERSON	, the veteran
London	LOCATION	publisher , and Mr.
J. Henry Harper	PERSON	, the well-known
New York	LOCATION	publisher , have a quality of interest not to be found in memoirs of any other kind .

		It is with keenest pleasure that lovers of such intimate histories of literature in the making hail the appearance of Mr.
George Haven	PERSON	Put - nam 's filial tribute to the memory of the founder of the
House of Putnam	ORGANIZATION	.

		``
George Palmer Putnam	PERSON	: A Memoir '' is packed with both lit - erary and human interest , the winning personal - ity of the man holding the attention no less than the remarkable achievements of the publisher .


George Palmer Putnam	PERSON	, of good New En - gland stock that traces its descent back to the Puttenhams ,
Puttnams	LOCATION	, and Putnams of Buck - inghamshire , was born in
1814	DATE	at
Brunswick	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, where his mother ,
Catherine Hunt Pal	PERSON	- mer , of
Dorchester	LOCATION	, had opened a private school in
1808	DATE	upon the disablement , from illness , of her husband ,
Henry Palmer	PERSON	of
Boston	LOCATION	, a lawyer by profession .

		In his mother 's school
George	PERSON	received his education , side by side with his sisters , and the discipline maintained , both on weekdays and
Sundays	DATE	, seems to have been of the good old Puritan sort .

		That the mother was a woman of strong character and vigorous intellect appears from many facts and incidents transmitted through the son to the grandson , and notably from her having written a series of Bible commentaries which the founder of the Putnam publishing house brought out in two octavo volumes soon after he had firmly estab - lished himself in
New York	LOCATION	.

		But the breaking - away from home , under the compulsion of narrowness of means , had come much earlier than that , in
1825	DATE	, when the lad 's uncle ,
John Gulliver	PERSON	, had proposed to take him into appren - ticeship in his carpet business in
Boston	LOCATION	.

		There he remained until
1829	DATE	, when , with courage and enterprise not found in every boy of fifteen , he made his way to the scene of his subsequent *

G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons .

		labors and obtained employment with a book - seller and stationer , carrying on his education meanwhile in
late evening	TIME	hours at the Mer - cantile Library .

		In certain '' Eough Notes of Thirty Years in the Trade , '' reprinted from the `` American Publishers ' Circular '' of
1863	DATE	, we get a glimpse of the boy voraciously reading everything in the way of history that came to his hand .

		He writes : `` It had so happened that though my father had graduated at
Harvard	LOCATION	, and my home influences were of the educated and cultivated sort , I had not received even the ordinary elementary ` schooling , ' to say nothing of a college course , and further , 1 had been permitted even less than ordinary access to general reading .

		It is , therefore , a pleasure to testify , as I can very heartily , to the usefulness of the
New York Mercantile Library	ORGANIZATION	, then a few years old , and just located in the new
Clinton Hall	PERSON	, in Beekman Street , the corner-stone of which I had seen laid by that liberal-minded citizen ,
Philip Hone	PERSON	.

		In these degenerate days , boys in my position of sixteen or seventeen are usually dismissed from the ' store ' at six or seven o'clock .

		In 1831-32 , we were kept till nine or ten ; so that it was usually after nine when I could get to the Mercantile and take out my book .

		It chanced that my tastes rather turned from the novels to the more solid interest of a course of history .

		Begin - ning with Father Herodotus -LRB- in
Beloe	LOCATION	's English -RRB- I plodded on through Thucydides ,
Xenophon	LOCATION	,
Livy	PERSON	,
Tacitus	ORGANIZATION	, Sal lust ; then
Gibbon	PERSON	,
Russell	PERSON	's
Modern Europe	LOCATION	, several histories of
England	LOCATION	, including
Hume	PERSON	,
Lingard	PERSON	,
Smollett	PERSON	, and De Moleville .

		Crammed with some hun - dred and fifty octavos , rapidly mastered in succession , and with no clear guide at hand , personal or in book - shape , to systematise and classify the stock of lore thus acquired , I began to take notes and make parallel tables .

		I copied and recopied , and collated and revised until I had written over a couple of reams . ''

		These reams of notes took book-form in
1832	DATE	, when their writer was but eighteen years old , in a work that ultimately became very well known as '' The World 's Progress . ''


Jonathan Leavitt	PERSON	was the courageous publisher , and he evidently did not repent of his confidence re - posed in the boy-author , since the edition soon sold out .

		Thus in a small way had begun the book - producing activities of one whose calling and election to the publishing business were not slow to make themselves manifest .

		In
1833	DATE	he entered the employment of
Wiley	PERSON	and Long , publishers and booksellers ;
seven years later	DATE	the firm of
Wiley	PERSON	and
Putnam	PERSON	was formed ; from
1841	DATE	to
1847	DATE	the junior member of this firm acted in
London	LOCATION	as English representative of the house ; in
1848	DATE	the partnership was dis - solved and Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	began business on his own account at 155 Broadway , in the very centre of the commercial life of that day ; and thenceforward to the present time , with some financial reverses and one intermission in the 238 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, sixties , when the founder of the house held the government position of
Collector of Revenue	ORGANIZATION	, the
Putnam	LOCATION	publishing business has continued to grow in magnitude and in honorable repute .

		The inestimable service rendered to the cause of international copyright by both the elder and the younger Putnam , in the office of secretary and inspiring genius of successive copyright leagues and associations , and by eloquent and reiterated word of mouth and pen , would fur - nish matter for far more lengthy narration and approving comment than can here find space .

		Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	tells most interest - ingly the story of his father 's self-sacrificing exertions to bring about the desired legislation , and Mr.
R. R. Bowker	PERSON	has very recently , in his painstaking history of copyright , chronicled the services of both father and son in this field of reform .

		It was in
1872	DATE	, in a fifth vain attempt to effect a correction of ancient abuses , that Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	, senior , spent his strength so lavishly and against such discouraging odds as to under - mine his health and hasten his death .

		After going to
Washington	LOCATION	, at the request of the
Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, to push the pending copyright bill through the
Judiciary Committee	ORGANIZATION	, he found the measure opposed in the committee - meeting by the attorney of a prominent
New York	LOCATION	publishing house which had been under - stood to be not antagonistic to the proposed legislation .

		The narrative continues : '' My father 's personal disappointment and annoy - ance were naturally keen .

		The bill itself never got out of committee .

		Senator
Lot M. Morrill	PERSON	, of
Vermont	LOCATION	, the Chairman of the
Library Committee	ORGANIZATION	, in making an ad - verse report to the consideration by
Congress	ORGANIZATION	of any international copyright bill , took the ground , naturally enough , that ' there was no unanimity of opinion among those interested in the measure . '

		Fifteen years later , the Harpers who were then directing the affairs of the
House	ORGANIZATION	had convinced themselves that their interests were not adverse to international copyright , and I was able , having succeeded my father as Secretary of the Publishers ' Copyright League , to maintain before the
Judiciary Committee	ORGANIZATION	the contention that the publishers were united in support of the measure and had author - ized me to speak for them ; and the international copy - right for which my father had laboured for nearly one third of a century was at last brought about .

		The fatigue of the journey and the disappointment , not only at the failure of the undertaking , but at the annoyance that question should have been raised in the
Committee	ORGANIZATION	con - cerning his right to speak as a representative of the publishers , had something to do with bringing on the fit of exhaustion that caused his death a few weeks later . ''

		In honorable endeavor to inflict no injury on any foreign author introduced to his patrons , but rather to promote to the utmost the material welfare of such authors , the founder of the Putnam house distinguished himself above any of his competitors .

		Other firms have shown splendid liberality to eminent authors who could claim no legal protection from piracy ; but in uniformity of honest and considerate dealings with all foreign writers whose works were solic - ited for republication in this country , it is safe to assert that no other publishing house can show quite so clean a record as the one whose history is now offered to public perusal .

		The list of early Victorian authors whose American inter - ests were as far as possible guarded and pro- moted by Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	is significant in this connection .

		It includes the names of
Carlyle	LOCATION	,
Thomas Hood	PERSON	,
William Howitt	PERSON	,
Leigh Hunt	PERSON	,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Layard	PERSON	,
Kinglake	PERSON	, and
George Bor	PERSON	- row .


Fredrika Bremer	PERSON	was another whose books he tried to shield from piracy ; but a powerful rival , even after courteously receiving Miss
Bremer	PERSON	and being made aware of the close con - nection between that lady 's length of sojourn in this country and her receipts from the American sale of her books , refused to recede from the posi - tion that courtesy was courtesy and business was business ; and so '' the receipts from the author - ised editions were necessarily curtailed , and the poor little lady returned to
Stockholm	LOCATION	with plea - sant memories of some American friends , but not a little disappointed at the final results of her invasion of the States . ''

		The names of native authors to be found in the early cata - logues of the Putnam house form a brilliant list and include those of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	,
Washington Irving	LOCATION	,
Bayard Taylor	PERSON	,
Poe	PERSON	,
Lowell	LOCATION	,
Catherine Sedg	PERSON	- wick , and
Professor Dana of Yale	ORGANIZATION	.

		If to these are added the names of writers secured for the pages of the magazine started in
1853	DATE	by Mr.
Putnam	PERSON	, the showing becomes still more impres - sive .

		He had a decided genius for winning to himself , in both a business and a friendly way , the leading authors of his time .

		A description from his pen -LRB- originally published in his maga - zine -RRB- of one of these noted writers may be in place at this point . ''

		The name of
FENIMORE COOPER	ORGANIZATION	in American author - ship was a prominent one during his life ... He was as conspicuous in person as in intellect , standing over six feet in height strong , erect , well proportioned with the air and manner of one who claimed the right to be listened to , and to have his dictum respected ... One of his axioms appeared to be , that the very posses - sion of office or of popular favour in this country was prima-facie evidence of incompetency , superficial attain - ment , or positive dishonesty .

		-LRB- It is rather sad to think , that if he had lived longer , this estimate of popular and official success might have been strengthened rather than diminished . -RRB-

		He loved to demonstrate this by ex - amples and would even include such names as
Edward Everett	PERSON	and others whose fame and position were beyond ordinary question .

		His views on personal rights were
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 239 very decided , and often decidedly expressed .

		Coming from
myhouseatStaten Island	LOCATION	, he took occasion having been brusquely jostled by a carman driving onto the ferry - boat to give him a five-minute lecture on the inherent rights of foot passengers as against all vehicles whatso - ever .

		The dignity and force of the argument evidently impressed both the carman and the bystanders . ''

		The subjects of interest either touched upon or elaborated in this biography are so many as to preclude the possibility of doing the book justice in a review of this length .

		The author 's account of his father 's
London	LOCATION	sojourn and European travels , his picture of him at the battle of Bull Run , whither he had been driven by a consum - ing desire to witness what it was surmised might be the last as well as the first sanguinary engage - ment of the war , his narration of the varying fortunes of the struggling young publishing house , his introduction of literary celebrities from chapter to chapter these are some of the features of a work crowded with entertaining and -LRB- as a part of our literary history -RRB- important and instructive matter .

		From the many paragraphs affording an insight into the character of a man who deservedly commanded wide respect and admiration , we select for final quotation the fol - lowing , which refers to the second period of the commercially unfortunate `` Putnam ` sMagazine . ''

		The pathos of the picture makes a moving appeal . ''

		The closing of this second series of the magazine was a very keen personal disappointment to the pub - lisher whose name it bore .

		It was , in fact , a shock that really added at once to my father 's age .

		The feeling that he was no longer in touch with the reading public , that his literary judgment could not be depended upon as trustworthy , that his personal influence could not bring into his office , in the face of the competition of other publishers , the best literary material of the day , the hampering restriction of want of adequate resources with which to carry out larger and more per - manent literary plans all these things weighed upon him in a manner that would not have been possible in the earlier years when he still possessed full physical vigor and with this maintained his natural elasticity of temperament .

		In years he was still fairly young , but it was evident that in vitality or in working strength the corner had been turned . ''

		The biography makes us acquainted with a man of invincible courage and optimism , of fine confidence -LRB- sometimes misplaced -RRB- in human na - ture , of rare determination to succeed by none but honorable means , in the face of competition not always equally honorable , of the gentleness and strength that are never , either of them , com - plete without the other , and of a personal charm that speaks to us even now in some of his recorded words and published utterances .

		The portrait prefixed to the work helps one to com - plete the mental image of this strong and win - some personality .

		OUR RELATIONS WITH
JAPAN	LOCATION	.

		* One of the features of recent international relations most to be regretted has been the sub - stitution of suspicion and ill-will for the confi - dence and cordiality which for so long existed between
Japan	LOCATION	and the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Offi - cially , intercourse is as amicable as ever .

		On the part of Americans and Japanese who really understand the relations between the two coun - tries there is little tolerance for the fomenters of the present unrest .

		But in the case of the great uninformed public , in both countries , it must be recognized that , in recent years , a change in sentiment has taken place .

		The traditional friendship of the
United States	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	is unique in the story of the contact of East and
West	LOCATION	.

		During the fifty years between the opening of
Japan	LOCATION	by
Perry	PERSON	's firm but kindly diplomacy , and the close of the great Eusso-Japanese struggle , the diplomatic relations of the
United States	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	were notable for the sympathetic attitude of the vigor - ous power of the West and for the apparent appreciation of the rising nation of the
East	LOCATION	.

		In comparison with the conduct of the powers of
Europe	LOCATION	the attitude of
America	LOCATION	stands out in sharp relief .

		And so in this period when
Japan	LOCATION	modelled her army on the French and German lines , and her navy on those of
Britain	LOCATION	, she turned to
America	LOCATION	for suggestions in education , in banking , and in other great productive fields of development .

		American missionaries and teachers performed services that were most ap - preciated by the eager Japanese .

		And in Amer - ica the little that was written about
Japan	LOCATION	and her people was almost without exception penned in glowing terms .

		Then came the war with
Russia	LOCATION	.

		American public opinion , so far as any might be said to exist , at once made the cause of the Japanese its own , and followed with satisfaction the un - broken record of success .

		But with the peace a change was manifest .

		The press which had scored the Muscovite so bitterly now found words of sympathy for the humbled Christian , and soon `` public opinion '' became less fulsome in its praise of the new world-power .

		Within a year the immigration problem had arisen and war talk became a matter of course , and the past five years have at frequent intervals seen the name of our old friend and protege written in scare - heads as our adversary in an unavoidable war .

		Two years span the change from admiration * AMERICAN-JAPANESE RELATIONS .

		An Inside View of
Japan	LOCATION	's Policies and Purposes .

		By
Kiyoshi K. Kawakami	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Fleming H. Revell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		240 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, to suspicion .

		What explanation can be given for such a phenomenon ?

		Mr.
Kawakami	PERSON	, whose new volume entitled '' American - Japanese Rela - tions '' is a vigorous endeavor to right some of the wrong already done , dismisses the idea of jealousy , or of fear , or even of war-talk spread to sell warships and guns .

		The explanation which he offers is that
Japan	LOCATION	's commercial ad - vance in the Asian continent has alienated the western world .

		This may account for the mer - cantile interests and for their representatives in
Asia	LOCATION	, but it surely does not account for the rapid change of heart of `` the man in the street , '' or for his willingness to read , even if not with entire conviction , the reckless statements of the mischief-makers .

		No explanation so simple as that can really explain .

		Many factors were present during those critical years .

		The first wave of anti-Japanese feeling was probably due to the sympathy which Americans always have for `` the under-dog . ''


Russia	LOCATION	aggressive and intolerant was very different from
Russia	LOCATION	hum - bled and contrite .

		People had time to remem - ber the friendship of the Czar in
1863	DATE	, and to realize that for the first time since the fall of
Constantinople Asia	LOCATION	had beaten back
Europe	LOCATION	.

		After this period of indecision came the
San Francisco	LOCATION	school-children incident , which was magnified into an international question ; and then the time was ripe for articles inspired by commercial rivalry , by military expediency , and even by missionary policy .

		Many of these highly-colored preachments would have aroused little discussion if the reading public had been prepared properly to evaluate the arguments presented .

		But , as Mr.
Kawakami	PERSON	remarks : `` Meanwhile , belligerent words continue to be spoken , and alarmist notes continue to be sounded .

		The average American , by reason of want of unbiased information , is apparently inclined to listen to the counsels of jingoes and alarmists .

		Thus the cloud of misunderstanding is growing thicker every day , casting its gloom over American - Japanese relations . ''

		It was in an endeavor to clear up some of these misunderstandings that the present volume was written .

		Three great questions are dis - cussed , as the source of the more serious diffi - culties .

		The Manchurian Question is treated in seven chapters , which deal with the relative interests of
Japan	LOCATION	,
China	LOCATION	,
Russia	LOCATION	, and
America	LOCATION	in
Manchuria	LOCATION	.

		Ten chapters are devoted to the Korean Question , explaining why
Japan	LOCATION	annexed
Korea	LOCATION	and narrating the work of the Japanese before and after annexation .

		And , finally , six chapters deal with the
Immigration Question	ORGANIZATION	on our
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	.

		As eleven of the chapters originally appeared in American and Japanese periodicals , the treatment is sug - gestive rather than profound , while in its moder - ation and in its endeavor to be fair it compares very favorably with certain recent discussions of some of these topics .

		In discussing the
Manchurian Question	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Kawakami	PERSON	emphasizes the price in blood and money which
Japan	LOCATION	paid for her present posi - tion in
Manchuria	LOCATION	, characterizes
China	LOCATION	's atti - tude toward
Japan	LOCATION	as '' one of ingratitude and insincerity , '' criticizes Mr.Knox 's neutralization proposal and recent American railway schemes in
Manchuria	LOCATION	, explains the present
Russo	PERSON	- Japanese rapprochcment ^ smd asserts that
Japan	LOCATION	has scrupulously observed the `` open door '' policy .

		So , too , in the case of
Korea	LOCATION	, charge after charge that has been brought against
Japan	LOCATION	is considered and explained .

		It would be too much to expect that Mr.
Kawakami	PERSON	possesses complete information as to the future plans of his government , but he is in a position satisfactorily to refute many of the criticisms which have of late been current .

		The chapters on the Immigration Question do not make pleasant reading for unprejudiced Americans .

		Japanese immigration , before the passport agreement , is discussed , as to its extent , its nature , and its comparison with European immigration .

		Two chapters bear the title ''
Denis Kearneyism	PERSON	Once More . ''

		There is much truth in this summary , though other factors were present : `` Thus it was that the anti-Japanese agitation on the
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	of a few years ago began and subsided .

		It was the old story some one wanted to go to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	or the
House	ORGANIZATION	, or some one had the guber - natorial bee buzzing in his bonnet , or some one wanted to sell his paper , or some one wanted to make a living by levying upon the innocent laborers , or some ' interests ' wanted to control Japanese labor for their exclusive benefit . ''

		The agitation began in
1905	DATE	, and yet the next year
Japan	LOCATION	subscribed more than half the total for - eign subscription for the relief of the fire-swept city .

		In
October	DATE	the school-children case arose , and later the assaults upon Japanese business men and travellers .

		If the means employed were wretched in the extreme , the end gained was a most desirable one .

		By the agreement of
1907	DATE	Japan voluntarily restricts her emigra - tion to our shores by means of a rigid passport system .

		Mr.
Kawakami	PERSON	asserts that `` the
Japan	LOCATION	- ese feel that , viewed in the light of the real status of Japanese immigration , such a drastic
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 241 measure of exclusion as was adopted by the two governments is not justified . ''

		This is no doubt the case , but , granting the existence of a strong prejudice against the Japanese on our
Pacific Coast	LOCATION	, this endeavor to remove irritation until the better understanding , such as Mr.
Kawakami	PERSON	seeks to bring about , has been reached , seems eminently proper .

		Finally a plea is advanced for the naturalization of resident Japanese .

		Mr.
Kawakami	PERSON	's book deserves a wide circu - lation .

		No doubt he over-estimates the real influence of the `` jingoes and alarmists , '' for their outcries at times excite more consternation in
Japan	LOCATION	than among our own people .

		But his efforts , and those of other Americans and
Japan	LOCATION	- ese , will do much to restore the old relations which were so long a credit to
America	LOCATION	and
Japan	LOCATION	'
PAYSON	PERSON	J. TREAT .

		WHISTLER THE ARTIST .

		* Mr.
Way	PERSON	justifies the addition of another volume to the already formidable quantity of printed words about Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	by the state - ment that few of the books , magazines , and newspaper articles devoted to him and his art '' suggest the real charm of
Whistler	LOCATION	the crafts - man . ''

		In any just estimate of his character this phase of it needs to be emphasized much more strongly than commonly it has been hitherto .

		His fame rests in quite disproportionate measure upon his idiosyncrasies , his wit , and his pugna - city .

		To those who were privileged to know Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	intimately , these traits , though they enlivened intercourse with him , stood out far less prominently than those that constituted him one of the world 's greatest artists : they were only another manifestation of the super - sensitiveness that quickened his perception of all artistic things , that made him so keenly ap - preciative of the beauty of tone relations , and enabled him to bring forth the works in which this beauty is so exquisitely presented .

		It is of
Whistler	LOCATION	the artist , and more partic - ularly of
Whistler	LOCATION	the lithographer , rather than the painter or the etcher , that Mr. Way gives his memories .

		His acquaintance with Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	dates back to the
year 1878	DATE	, when the master 's interest in lithography was first awakened by Mr.
Way	PERSON	's father , a well-known lithographer and a life-long enthusiast and experimenter in all that concerns the process .

New York	LOCATION	:
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Then began frequent visits to Mr.
Way	PERSON	's estab - lishment , where the father and son inducted the distinguished artist into the practical details of their craft .

		The intimacy formed while thus working side by side lasted until a short time before Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's death , when it was ter - minated by an unfortunate misunderstanding .

		The opportunity to follow the artist 's mental processes which these years of close association afforded appears to have been accorded to no one else in such generous measure , and this gives Mr.
Way	PERSON	's reminiscences a special value apart from their intrinsic interest .

		Among the things that stand forth most dis - tinctly in the book are Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's industry and his painstaking attention to every detail of craftsmanship .

		Like all great artists he was a master workman .

		He recognized clearly that only through the acquisition of consummate skill of hand could he impress his drawings with the subtle refinements , the almost imperceptible nuances that enter into the highest art and stamp it as a thing apart .

		When at work he was so absorbed in the effort to realize the precise effect he had in mind that he was oblivious to every other consideration .

		He disregarded his own comfort quite as much as that of his models . ''

		I have never come across any one , '' says Mr.
Way	PERSON	, '' who could exist upon so little food as
Whistler	LOCATION	whilst he was at work . ''

		Another thing which Mr. Way brings out is that instead of ignoring all criticism and sug - gestion , as is generally supposed , Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	'' constantly appealed to those about him as to how they liked the work he was engaged upon and what they thought of it . ''

		Though he was irritated by inept comment from people whose education should have taught them how to look at works of art , he was ever ready to welcome intelligent discussion .

		In all that he did he never failed to keep basic principles clearly in mind .

		And when he had occasion to criticize other work , as that of his pupils , he dealt with these principles rather than with the execution , which he left almost alone , '' thus doing nothing to interfere with the individuality of the student , but in the kindest way helping him with advice . ''

		A characteristic incident is related by Mr. Way : `` I was painting a portrait of Dr.
Whistler	PERSON	, at his Wimpole Street house , in
1883	DATE	, and
Whistler	LOCATION	came and advised me about it , taking my brushes and working on the canvas to ex - plain his meaning .

		I found that whenever I showed him anything I had done , his criticisms were based upon my point of view , as it were . ''

		It was the same attitude of mind that caused 242 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, him to be horrified at the idea of printing etchings in color .

		Rightly he felt this to be '' utterly contrary to the principles of the art . ''

		Mr.
Way	PERSON	's reminiscences are in large part devoted to Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's lithographic work , many of his experiments and his achievements being chronicled with considerable detail .

		For the reader not having technical knowledge there is a short account of the lithographic process .

		This , and also the descriptions of methods of working that occur here and there throughout the book , are exceptionally clear in statement .

		Naturally Mr.
Way	PERSON	is partial toward lithog - raphy , and he expresses the opinion that '' for the reproductive side of his art '' Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	'' found in it the most sympathetic and perfect medium of all . ''

		To this he adds : '' Great indeed as he was as an etcher , I believe he found he could get a far more direct and personal expression from lithography than on the copperplate .

		Tones and shadows which he could obtain directly with a stump or wash , or a few strokes of the soft chalk , he could only obtain in his etchings with an infinite number of lines with the needle point , or by a painting of ink upon the plate , which latter he of course needed to repeat for each impression , and this form of printing he discarded before he had finished printing the hundred sets of the
Venice	LOCATION	plates .

		I know from what he told me that he looked upon his lithographs , and especially his later ones , as having qualities equal to any of his etchings . ''

		It is easy to understand why Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	should have had this feeling .

		His art is in a very special and direct way an art of tone values and tone relations .

		To emphasize these he sacri - ficed other qualities , notably at times that of exact drawing , though he was a splendid draughtsman when he chose to be .

		Even in his etchings it is the tone relations that charm the beholder and evoke wonder as well as admiration .

		Although Mr. Way makes no attempt to deal with Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's personality , he has not been able to omit all reference to his peculiarities .

		Indeed to make no mention of any of these would be to rob the portrait of verisimilitude .

		In all mention of them , however , and in the anecdotes in which they crop out , they are treated most tenderly as things of little weight in our final estimate of the man .

		This attitude is main - tained even when relating the incident of Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's severance of friendly relations with the author and his father , which is told without any trace of bitterness or of feeling other than deep regret .

		Such magnanimity is as rare as it is commendable .

		A large number of lithographic illustrations add to the interest of the book .

		One of these , `` Grand Rue ,
Dieppe	LOCATION	, '' is printed direct from Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	's original work .

		The others are for the most part reproductions by Mr. Way of sketches made by Mr.
Whistler	PERSON	in preparation for his etchings and paintings , or of memory notes of the completed works .

		There is a very much reduced reproduction in color of the '' Cremorne Gardens '' painting ; and another of Mr.
Way	PERSON	's pastel copy of the project for the `` Symphony in White , No. 4 . ''

		Charming as the latter is , it fails to give an adequate impression of either the quality or the beauty of the original painting , now in the collection of Mr. Freer ; but that is quite beyond the power of any reproduction .

		THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY OF IXSECTS .

		* We are glad to welcome another volume of translations from
M. Fabre	PERSON	.

		This time we are introduced to the cicada , the mantis , crickets and grasshoppers , moths , the bee-hunting wasp , and several different beetles .

		The insects are in general similar to those found in this coun - try ; they are the common species of southern
France	LOCATION	, but common as they are ,
M. Fabre	PERSON	has found out new and wonderful things about each one of them .

		In science , as in literature , it is the province of genius to illuminate the ordinary .

		Four chapters are devoted to the cigale .

		It is well that the translator did not follow the pop - ular error of this country , and call it a '' locust '' ; but he might have used the word cicada , which is surely by this time part of the English lan - guage .

		The name , however , matters little , since very good pictures show the reader what is in - tended .

		M.
Fabre	PERSON	begins his account with a discussion of the fable about the grasshopper and the ant , showing that La
Fontaine	PERSON	, know - ing nothing of the cicada , changed the old Greek version .

		The Greek story , it appears , probably came from
India	LOCATION	, and it may be that it was not even the cicada that begged the ant for food , but some other insect .

		However this may have been ,
M. Fabre	PERSON	objects strongly to the idea of the cicada asking favors of the ant , showing that as a matter of fact it is the ant which feasts at the cicada 's table .

		The cheerful songster is thus vindicated , but it is no doubt
M. Fabre	PERSON	's little joke to take La
Fontaine	PERSON	and his predecessors so seriously .

		The life history of the cicada is graphically * SOCIAL LIFE IN THE INSECT WORLD .

		THE DIAL 243 described , and some of the facts are surprising .

		As everyone knows , the males chant vociferously during the short
summer	DATE	of their maturity .

		We have always supposed it a love song , but
M. Fabre	PERSON	gives reasons for seriously doubting this : reasons , indeed , for suspecting that the cicada is almost or quite deaf !

		This seems ridiculous , but who can prove otherwise ?

		Even a gunpowder explosion , close by , did not affect their compla - cency .

		Another astonishing thing is that the great green grasshopper of
Europe	LOCATION	, which we had imagined to be a strict vegetarian , is in fact carnivorous , a ferocious enemy of the cicada .

		The next three chapters are devoted to the mantis , the greatest of all hypocrites .

		It is this creature , credited from ancient times with special sanctity , that shows the most depraved appetites it is possible to imagine .

		The female , after marriage , makes a regular practice of devouring her unfortunate mate .

		Two chapters now follow which are headed by some strange confusion on the part of the translator , `` The Golden Scarabseus . ''

		The insect discussed , and well figured , is no scaraba3us at all , but a ground beetle , the Carabus auratus .

		It is sin - gular that the translator , who makes some show of learning in a variety of footnotes , should have overlooked this error .

		Chapter XX. , again , is headed '' The Gray Cricket , '' when the insect concerned is not a cricket at all , but a grass - hopper .

		Genuine crickets are described in another part of the book .

		There is also strange confusion in the charming chapter on the
Great Peacock Moth	LOCATION	, which is indifferently called a moth or a butterfly .

		Thus : `` Who does not know this superb moth , the largest of all our European butterflies , with its livery of chestnut velvet and its collar of white fur ? ''

		Papillon , in French , may mean simply a lepidopterous insect , as did undoubtedly the Latin Papilio ; but in English a moth is not a butterfly .

		It is curious that we have no common term for the whole tribe , just as we had no common term expressing fraternal relationship independ - ent of sex , and
Galton	PERSON	was obliged to invent `` sib . ''

		Apart from such matters as we have com - plained of , which can easily be corrected in a second edition , the translation appears to have been very well done .

		The book is certainly delightful to read , and does justice to the spirit of the author .

		It will take its place among the classics of literature and of science .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* It seems that ``
Richard Dehan	PERSON	, '' the author of that striking novel `` The Dop Doctor , '' is the pen name of Miss Clothilde Graves , an Irish dramatist , which fact transpires coincidently with the appear - ance of her new novel , `` Between Two Thieves . ''

		This is a book not easy to characterize .

		It is a `` big '' book in both the literal and the figurative sense ; it is an intensely emotional book and one ex - traordinarily rich in substance ; it is .

		a book in which we seem to see a brilliant light struggling to emerge through a fog of verbiage ; it is a book loose in structure and of feebly coherent interests ; it is a book that begins with the end , and then , taking a fresh start , toilsomely leads up to its beginning -LRB- which is , to our mind , a most detestable method -RRB- ; it is a book which resorts , in one instance , to the cheap device of telepathy for an effect , and which culminates in a chapter of supernatural bathos ; and withal it is a romance of fascinating interest and impressive power , based essentially upon historical material ranging from the period of the great
Napoleon	PERSON	to that of the `` saviour of society '' who later made a mockery of the Napoleonic name and empire .

		It makes us a participant in the French Revolution of
1848	DATE	, in the crime of
December	DATE	, and in all the heroisms and horrors of the Crimean War .

		The main currents of nineteenth century life flow through its pages , and an elaborate historical pa - geant discloses itself to the view .

		The figure that gives to all these matters whatever unity they possess is that of a man , the son of one of
Napoleon	PERSON	's mar - shals , trained for the army , who sees service at home and in
Africa	LOCATION	, who witnesses the precipitation of the Revolution and the accomplishment of the coup d'Stat , who as the agent of the imperial adventurer makes the plans upon which the Crimean enterprise is founded , who learns the true character of his mas - ter and renounces him to his face , who is imprisoned for his audacity , who when released makes his way to the field of war and toils devotedly in the inter - ests of humanity , who sins grievously and expiates nobly , inspired by the influence of an angel of light called
Ada Merling	ORGANIZATION	in the book -LRB- who is in reality
Florence Nightingale	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , who carries on the blessed work of the

		244 -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, career as this , there is opportunity in abundance for creative romantic invention , and for the most part the author has used her material worthily .

		She has to deal with black sin and desperate wickedness in many phases , but she contrives to make us feel that the mantle of divine forgiveness is ample to cover the deepest transgression , save in the one case of
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	, for whom no damnation can be sufficiently deep .

		The book has no finer feature than its blistering portraiture of this blackest of his - torical criminals , and the view which it gives us of that cesspool of social and political corruption known ironically to history as the
Second Empire	ORGANIZATION	.

		It offers a prose parallel to the `` Chatiments '' of Hugo and the '' Dirae '' of
Swinburne	LOCATION	.

		Whole sections of the work have been left unhinted at in our description the English scenes , including the picture of gar - rison life and the scathing study of the army con - tractor , and the chapters which describe the hero 's unsuccessful attempt to claim the succession to a German principality .

		These and other matters must be left for the reader to discover , for the book is so rich that no review of ordinary length can hope to do more than indicate its more important features .

		Of the variety of styles at his command , Mr.
J. C. Snaith	PERSON	has chosen the frothiest for his service in `` The Principal Girl . ''

		This story of an alliance between the peerage and the theatrical profession is an engaging example of light comedy in the vein of `` Araminta . ''

		The hero is a young man for whom his parents have matured matrimonial plans , which he sets at naught by becoming infatuated with a most charming Cinderella of the
Drury Lane	ORGANIZATION	pantomime .

		Expostulations from the pompous father and the supercilious mother are of no avail to stay him in his mad career , and even the objections of the young woman 's grandmother a fine representative of ' theatrical conservatism who holds the aristocracy of the stage a far finer thing than the mushroom crea - tions of politics do not prevent the young people from following the dictates of their affection .

		The hero is stupid , but good , and he knows exactly what he wants .

		Having an independent fortune , he is enabled to contract the mesalliance in defiance of all opposition , and it proves to be the best thing in the world for him .

		Recognizing his wife 's superior intelligence , he is sensible enough to let her manage him , and when she decides that he shall go into parliament , is content that she should pull the strings which bring about his triumphant return .

		The fact that he is a famous hero of the football field aids him not a little in his campaign , and he wins the heart of his constituency by pledging himself to play with the local team upon critical occasions .

		The wit of the story is sparkling , and the world of society and politics is touched up with many delicious satirical dabs .

		When twins are produced , even the flinty - hearted parents melt , and become reconciled to their wayward offspring . ''

		The Citadel , '' by Mr.
Samuel Merwin	PERSON	, is called '' a romance of unrest . ''

		The unrest is of the social sort which manifests itself in '' progressive '' politics and the tendency to substitute impulse for principle in the direction of public affairs . ''

		The Citadel '' is the structure of constitutional government within whose walls so many forms of privileged corruption find shelter .

		Mr.
Merwin	PERSON	evidently thinks that the only way to destroy these abuses is to tear down the walls , which is a procedure too suggestive of the famous method of getting roast pig to be taken very seriously .


John Garwood	PERSON	, the hero of this story , is a member of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	from one of the
Illinois	LOCATION	dis - tricts .

		He has been sent to
Washington	LOCATION	by the local ring of allied political and business interests , and is supposed to be a reliable man .

		He has become en - gaged to the daughter of the chief local magnate , thereby offering an important hostage to fortune .

		But acquaintance with the practical side of political life fills him with such deep disgust that he resolves to become a champion of the people , turning his back upon all of his former supporters .

		Particularly , he gets into a state of mind about the federal Constitu - tion , which seems to him to block every effort for social amelioration , and he emphasizes his new stand by making a frenzied attack upon that instrument , putting in the forefront of his reform programme an amendment designed to make the Constitution more easily amendable .

		His ideal of popular government seems to be a system which shall make it possible for the majority , at any time , without any pretense of deliberation , and without any regard for the ele - mentary rights of the minority , to upset any part of the law which it does not like .

		In thus defining
Garwood	PERSON	's position , we are given his measure so clearly that he can not command the sympathy of the sober-minded , although his political conduct is praiseworthy enough in its secondary aspects .

		He returns home , severs all his relations with the influ - ential men of his district , and engages in a campaign for reelection upon a socialist platform .

		It is a lively struggle and arouses a nation-wide interest , but the forces arrayed against him are too powerful to be overcome , and he is defeated .

		But he has found an Egeria in one of the departments at
Washington	LOCATION	, who has stood at his side during the whole arduous campaign , and she saves him from being absolutely disconsolate in his overthrow .

		This book is one of many written in similar strain of recent years , which overshoot their mark because they unduly magnify the evils at which they are directed , and which , in the remedies they offer , are simply fatuous , so utterly do they disregard the lessons of history and the precepts of political wisdom .

		Mr.
Holman	PERSON	Day continues to draw material for fiction from the woods of northern
Maine	LOCATION	, and his latest novel , `` The Red Lane , '' is the best that he has written , having a larger admixture of the roman - tic than is to be found in the studies of business and politics that he has heretofore given us .

		His title is explained in the opening paragraph of the book .

		`` The Red Lane is neither road nor route .

		It is an institution it is smuggling .

		Its thousand avenues are now here , now there . ''

		The smuggling that goes on over the border that separates
Maine	LOCATION	from New
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 245 Brunswick is of food mutton , potatoes , and oats a fact which sheds a particularly clear light upon the iniquity of a system which subjects these pro- ducts to a customs tax , and rather inclines us to sympathy with Mr.
Day	PERSON	's chief law-breaker , the villain of the story .

		However , he is bad enough in other respects to qualify for his position in the tale , and we cheerfully witness the thwarting of his schemes and his eventual overthrow .

		When
Evan	PERSON	-
geline Beaulieu	PERSON	, who has been brought up in a con - vent , comes to seek her father in his home , she finds him the proprietor of a road-house on the border , and hand in glove with the smuggling fraternity .

		She also learns that she herself has been promised in marriage to the chief of the smugglers .

		Being an independent and high-spirited young woman , and finding her protest against these conditions of no avail , she abandons the paternal roof , and starts out to make her own way in the world .

		A suitable hero is provided in the person of a
United States	LOCATION	customs officer , who falls in love with the girl , and rescues her when she has fallen into the hands of her ene - mies , and is about to be made the victim of a forced marriage with the hated smuggler .

		The story has , however , a larger interest than is provided by this private romance .

		It is essentially concerned with the struggle of the simple Acadian border-folk to retain possession of their homes , from which the owners of the timber lands seek to evict them .

		They are squatters , it is true , and the law is against them , but the author enlists our sympathies in their behalf , and we rejoice when the legislature is moved to act in their favor .

		The author understands these peas - ant people , their ways of speech and their modes of tl linking , and he is at his best in giving expression to their character .

		A particularly delightful episode is that which describes the mission of the vagrant fiddler to the bishop , sent with a petition for the res - toration of their parish priest , who has been arbit - rarily taken from them .

		There are many varieties of interest in this narrative , and all are skilfully blended into an organic structure . ''

		The Midlanders , '' by Mr.
Charles Tenney Jack	PERSON	- son , is a narrative of an
Iowa	LOCATION	river town , with a prologue in the bayous of the lower
Mississippi	LOCATION	.

		A battered human derelict named '' Uncle
Michigan	LOCATION	'' and an equally battered veteran of the Confederate army named '' Captain Tinkletoes '' -LRB- because he wears a bell on his wooden leg -RRB- live together on a '' johnboat '' in the swamp , and one day add to their company a little girl , kidnapped by the former of these precious vagabonds from a parade of asylum orphans in the streets of
New Orleans	LOCATION	.

		Here the child lives for several years , when the death of '' Captain Tinkletoes '' breaks up the happy family , and '' Uncle
Michigan	LOCATION	, '' unmooring the old boat , takes it on an adventurous voyage up the river .

		It finally becomes stranded by the
Iowa	LOCATION	town which is the principal scene of the story .

		From this time on , the book becomes a study of the social and political life of the town in question .

		Aurelie grows up to be a beautiful young woman , and the chief object of the affections of two men one the son of a patri - cian family , and the other , who is much older , the editor of the local country newspaper .

		As in larger communities , there is a good deal of corruption in the management of public affairs , and the '' leading citizens '' have matters pretty much in their own hands .

		The editor , who has been doddering along in the town for many years , and is not thought to be of much account , is pushed into the congressional campaign in opposition to the '' ring , '' and the town is stirred from its sluggishness in the struggle that ensues .

		Meanwhile Aurelie , whose photograph has been sent by the editor to a
Chicago	LOCATION	newspaper for entry in a '' beauty contest , '' becomes the surprised recipient of the prize and the victim of all the sensa - sional advertising that goes with it .

		She is promptly snapped up by the theatre , and wins a great popular success in that hybrid species of entertainment for imbeciles known as `` musical comedy . ''

		This so shocks the youth of patrician extraction that he tries to put her out of his thoughts , and enters heartily into the political campaign , being a candidate for the district attorneyship .

		At the critical moment it transpires that
Aurelie	PERSON	is the daughter of the editor , the fruit of a marriage contracted in the days of his reckless youth .

		The mother has been long dead , and of the existence of the child -LRB- placed in the
New Orleans	LOCATION	asylum after the mother 's death -RRB- he had never known .

		His political enemies
spring	DATE	the re - velation upon him on the eve of the election , and threaten him with exposure if he refuses to with - draw .

		How they are circumvented , how Aurelie learns of her father , how he is elected when he be - lieves himself out of the running , and how the pat - rician youth finds that love is the most important thing in the world these things provide the ma - terial for a whirlwind finish which leaves nothing to be desired in the way of excitement .

		The conquests of science speedily become annexed to the domain of the novel-writer .

		Wireless teleg - raphy is an invention which obviously lends itself to the planning of startling new situations , and its place in the literary workshop is secured .

		The best of the stories which have thus far been based upon this device is Mr.
Arthur Train	PERSON	's '' ' C Q ' ; or , In the
Wireless House	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		In this sprightly tale the unities of time and space are necessarily observed , for the entire story is told within the compass of a two weeks ' voyage of the
Pavonia	LOCATION	, and the unity of action can not under these conditions be very much obscured .


Micky Fitzpatrick	PERSON	, the
Marconi	ORGANIZATION	operator , is the chief figure of the story , and the messages that come to him in the wireless house make him acquainted with several interesting matters .

		One of them relates to a pearl necklace which a fascinating young woman is hoping to smuggle into
New York	LOCATION	, another relates to an embezzler who is sought by the police , and still another raises the hue and cry on account of the fugitive murderer of the
Earl of Roakby	ORGANIZATION	.

		This latter message
Micky	PERSON	suppresses , and , making the acquaintance of its object , concludes that the mur - der was quite justifiable .

		In consequence of this , he 246 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, arranges for the fugitive to slip overboard , and seek refuge on a French ship bound for
Algiers	LOCATION	.

		The other fugitive turns out not to be an embezzler after all , but a noble youth who has shouldered his father - in-law 's guilt , and we are given the intimation that he will be cleared in due time .

		We are left in doubt about the necklace , but it supplies the occasion for several bits of comedy .

		We get a good deal of the technique of the operator 's craft , and the way in which he slangs his fellows on the other ships is extremely amusing .

		The narrative is sparkling throughout , and abounds in deft characterizations and dramatic situations .

		Our breath is fairly taken away by one bit of information which is not dis - closed until the final paragraph .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .


Charles Lamb	PERSON	's J nn Rickman , statistician and cen - friend the sus-taker , secretary to the speaker of census-taker .

		the
Houge of Commons	ORGANIZATION	for twelve syears , clerk at the table of the
House	ORGANIZATION	for twenty - i x , and -LRB- chief claim upon our interest and friendly regard -RRB- valued friend of
Charles Lamb	PERSON	during much of the latter part of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's life , is made the subject of a book that will appeal strongly to all lovers of
Elia	LOCATION	, `` Life and Letters of
John Rick	PERSON	- man '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mr.
Orlo Williams	PERSON	, with a portrait of the census-taker and views of the
Parlia	LOCATION	- ment houses and their neighborhood as they were in
Rickman	LOCATION	's time .

		It was
George Dyer	PERSON	that brought Lamb and Rickman together , a service to which we owe , among other things , the enthusiastic letter from
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	to
Manning	PERSON	describing the new friend as `` the finest fellow to drop in a ' nights , about nine or ten o'clock cold bread and cheese time just in the wishing time of the night , when you wish for some - body to come in , without a distinct idea of a probable anybody ... He is a most pleasant hand ; a fine rattling fellow , has gone through life laughing at solemn apes ; himself hugely literate , oppressively full of information in all stuff of conversation , from matter of fact to
Xenophon	PERSON	and Plato can talk Greek with
Porson	PERSON	, politics with Thelwall , conjecture with
George Dyer	PERSON	, nonsense with me , and anything with anybody ; ... '' If that is not enough to make anyone eager for a closer acquaintance with this genial and accomplished man , it would be useless to offer the temptation of further bait .

		Nevertheless , his letters can not be said to fall into the same class with those of Lamb and the other accepted masters of the epistolary art .

		There was in Rickman too much of the man of hard facts , of statistics and cur - rent politics , to admit of any considerable grace and playfulness and airy fancy in his letter - writing .

		A mass of his correspondence has been preserved by a grandson of his , and other portions , published and unpublished , are elsewhere available ; so that with the abundant and welcome insertions of comment and explanation which Mr.
Williams	PERSON	has supplied , a substantial volume of interesting matter has been produced that not only gives fresh views of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	and
Southey	PERSON	and
Coleridge	PERSON	and others of that period , but also supplies here and there a more or less im - portant fact in
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's life or corrects a previous error of his biographers .

		In the ten-page index , which seems quite complete in its references , though not so `` analytical '' as might be desired , the half - column of
Coleridge	ORGANIZATION	items is headed ``
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Samuel Hartley	PERSON	, '' by some slip of pen or type .

		Otherwise the marks of care and thoroughness on the editor 's part are what might have been expected from a successor to
John Rickman	PERSON	in the exacting duties of a
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	official , which Mr.
Williams	PERSON	, on his first page , proclaims himself to be .

		Mr.
Delos F. Wilcox	PERSON	, in his volume entitled `` Govern - ment by All the People '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , deals at length in separate chapters with the initiative , referendum , and recall , explains what each is , and gives the arguments for and against it .

		A simple list of the author 's arguments shows that his treatment is not exhaustive .

		For example , to the initiative he finds six objections , that it would destroy constitutional stability , foster the tyranny of the majority , tend to subvert judicial authority , result in unscientific legis - lation , lead to radical legislation , and be used by the special interests to get the better of the people .

		In its favor he finds four arguments , that it would utilize the individual in politics , result in the draft - ing of laws by those who wish them to succeed , enable the sovereign to enforce its will without the consent of the legislature , and provide an orderly means of extending or restricting suffrage .

		These arguments , and those on the referendum and recall , are very much `` in the air , '' for rarely does Mr.
Wilcox	PERSON	base them on citations of actual facts .

		The volume on the same subject edited by Mr.
William Bennett Munro	PERSON	-LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- is a collection of essays by some of the most distinguished men in
America	LOCATION	, prefaced by a long and carefully pre - pared introduction by the editor .

		This introduction and the essays themselves are definite and pointed , many references to specific facts being cited in sup - port of the positions taken .

		Altogether , the book possesses surprisingly few of the faults common to collections of essays written by various writers without any thought of their being put together Messrs.
Edwin M. Bacon	PERSON	and
Morrill Wyman	PERSON	, in their volume entitled '' Direct Elections and Law - Making by Popular Vote '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , seek to cover in one hundred and fifty pages the whole field of direct elections , popular law-making , the recall , commission government , and preferential voting .

		Even in this brief compass the authors have given some valuable summaries of what has been done in different places .

		The appendix contains some specimen ballots and a comprehensive bibliography .

		Mr.
Samuel Robert	PERSON	- son Honey 's `` Referendum among the English ''
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 247 -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is somewhat misleading in its title .

		The author , a native of
America	LOCATION	residing in
England	LOCATION	, has made a rather unskilful effort to bring before the British public the application and results of demo - cracy in
America	LOCATION	.

		The result is a conglomeration consisting of an attempt to prove that Americans -LRB- or rather the people of
New England	LOCATION	-RRB- are of English descent , an explanation of democracy by quotations from English statesmen and American constitutions , and a history of the referendum in
America	LOCATION	.

		That a work on popular government should be devoted almost wholly to
New England	LOCATION	is sufficient proof of its absurdity .

		However , this book contains some in - teresting facts in regard to the history of the refer - endum not elsewhere easily accessible , though in a few cases not altogether accurate .

		A unique ^ r ' ^ ' ^ '
Goddard	PERSON	's volume entitled study in '' The Kallikak Family '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- social heredity .

		j s a remarkable human document .

		It is a scientific study in human heredity , a convinc - ing sociological essay , a contribution to the psycho - logical bases of the social structure , a tragedy of incompetence , and a sermon with a shocking exam - ple as a text .

		With an endless patience sustained by a scientific insight into the value of principle and detail , the history of two branches of a family has been traced .

		A common father in Colonial days through an illegitimate connection with a nameless feeble-minded girl becomes the progenitor of innu - merable feeble-minded progeny ; later marrying a woman of his own class , he becomes the ancestor of men and women of the highest respectability , of social and professional standing , numbering among them high officials , names so worthy that care must be taken to prevent their recognition from the descriptions given .

		The good and the bad branches of the family have been subjected to about the same environment , living in the same part of the country , and -LRB- though bearing the same name -RRB- quite igno - rant of their kinship until this study was made .

		No more striking example of the supreme force of heredity could be desired .

		Though its interpretation in the details of descent is beset with uncertainty , it goes far to assimilate the hereditary trend to that termed `` Mendelian . ''

		Upon this issue Dr.
Goddard	PERSON	promises another volume based on the slighter study of a larger number of defective families .

		The story found its clue in
Deborah Kallikak	PERSON	-LRB- all the names of course are fictitious -RRB- , an illegitimate and aban - doned child who came to the
Training School	ORGANIZATION	for the Feeble-Minded at
Vineland	LOCATION	.

		Despite fourteen years of teaching and care , she has , at the age of twenty-two , the mentality of a ten-year-old child , though she has the capacity to acquire a considerable range of manual skill .

		Indeed , placed in favorable surroundings , she and her kind would not be recog - nized by the public as feeble-minded ; for she be - longs to the high-grade type of difficult , backward , but not unattractive folk .

		It is precisely in this type , especially among girls , that criminality finds its ready recruits or victims .

		Hence the imposing scope of the single story , from which so many other stories of degeneracy receive a lurid illumination .

		The prac - tical regulation and prevention of this array of inca - pacity and worse is the serious social problem .

		Dr.
Goddard	PERSON	and his associates have added notably to our insight into its fundamental significance , and particularly by demonstrating that deficient mental - ity the stigma of an unworthy stock is the clue to the condition , and vice and crime and inefficiency and brutality its issues under present-day social stress .

		French medievalist who died about four years ago , was engaged in a study of French society during the reign of
Philip Augustus	PERSON	-LRB- 1180 1223 -RRB- , in which he doubtless intended to include all the important phases of civilization at the time when mediaevalism stood at the zenith of its course .

		Death prevented the complete realization of this plan , but a large part of the work was found in a practically finished form among his literary remains , and was given prompt publication .

		Recently an English translation of Professor
Luchaire	PERSON	's work has been prepared by Professor
E. B. Krehbiel	PERSON	of
Leland Stanford University	ORGANIZATION	, and has been published under the title '' Social
France	LOCATION	at the
Time of Philip Augustus	ORGANIZATION	'' -LRB- Holt -RRB- .

		The work of a master is always gladly received ; and in this instance the master has drawn an unusual picture .

		There has recently been a tendency among historians to deal more sympa - thetically with the middle ages , to dwell less on the unlovely characteristics of the time , and to empha - size the constructive forces of mediaeval life .

		But the great Frenchman saw the period in a different light ; to him the civilization of the middle ages was crude and inferior , and he proceeded to tell the truth about it .

		Sombre colors are used throughout the work , but particularly dark is the view that he gives of the religious and spiritual life of the age ; the religion of the masses he finds to have been relic worship of the coarsest kind .

		Naturally the age also had its attractive phases , and these , too , are faithfully presented .

		It may be that the writer , who studied and wrote during the years of conflict between the French government and the Roman church , has over - drawn the picture at times , but on the whole the work seems honest and convincing .

		He quotes freely from the sources used , and his conclusions seem so well - founded that they will not be easily shaken .

		The work also discusses the various secular elements of mediaeval society , especially the noble classes ; less attention is devoted to the peasants and the burghers , but this is doubtless due to the fact that the writers of the age showed but slight interest in the lower classes and have consequently left us less information concerning them than we might desire .

		In his chap - ter on '' the noble dame , '' the author takes occasion to discuss marriage and divorce in feudal times , and concludes that the mediaeval church was utterly un - able to enforce its decrees as to the indissolubility of 248 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, marriage .

		That a work of this sort should have lit - erary blemishes is inevitable , as the corrections and changes of an editor can never take the place of the author 's own final revision ; but even in its some - what imperfect form , the volume does great credit to its author , whose works are all of more than usual excellence .

		In its outward aspect , `` The Heritage of Hiroshige '' -LRB-
Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is an unusually successful attempt to give a Japanese appearance to a book enclosed in substan - tial boards and put together strongly enough to stand the wear and tear of Western use .

		It is printed on Japanese paper , on one side of the folded sheets , and Japanese papers of harmonious tones are used for the binding , the result being a very attractive vol - ume .

		The book is the joint production of Mrs.
Dora Amsden	PERSON	and Mr.
John Stewart Happer	PERSON	.

		The sale at
Sotheby	ORGANIZATION	's in
1909	DATE	of Mr.
Happer	PERSON	's fine collection of Japanese color-prints made his name widely known to collectors of these beautiful works of art .

		One section of Mr.
Happer	PERSON	's collection consisted entirely of prints , by
Hiroshige	ORGANIZATION	, and in the catalogue he announced his discovery of the deciphering of the `` seal-dates '' that appear upon many of the prints .

		This was an important discovery , as it made possible the definite determination of the authorship of works that had theretofore been attributed arbitrarily to the first Hiroshige and to his pupil who afterward adopted the same `` brush name . ''

		Other confirma - tory evidence and biographical data made the cata - logue an exceptionally useful one for students .

		This material , together with some further items gleaned from the prefaces to books of drawings by
Hiroshige	LOCATION	, forms the pith of the present volume .

		There is a chapter of `` Biographical Notes , '' one upon a `` Me - morial Portrait of Hiroshige '' and the `` seal-dates , '' one about the `` Forewords to Some of
Hiroshige	ORGANIZATION	's Books , '' and one of `` Notes upon
Hiroshige	ORGANIZATION	's Master - pieces . ''

		These chapters , all of which contain useful information , are , it may be presumed , Mr.
Happer	PERSON	's contribution to the book .

		Besides editing it and preparing it for the press , Mrs.
Amsden	PERSON	has written a short introduction , and four chapters of rhapsody over the classic art of
Japan	LOCATION	, which , though well meant , seem a bit irrelevant .

		It is , for example , inter - esting to learn that `` National art with the
Japan	LOCATION	- ese is the materialization of faith , '' but it is not easy to see what this has to do with
Hiroshige	LOCATION	.

		The book is illustrated with excellent half-tone reproductions of some of
Hiroshige	ORGANIZATION	's best-known prints and of the memorial portrait of him by
Kunisada	PERSON	.

		In an ap - pendix some facsimiles of signatures and publishers ' marks are given , also examples of date-seals and several forms of the zodiacal characters that enter into the composition of the cycle cyphers .

		There is , besides , a short bibliography of books on Japanese art , which would be more useful did it not include the titles of utterly worthless books as well as some of the best ones that have as yet been written .

		The Mrring ``
John Hancock	PERSON	, the Picturesque American Patriot '' is the inviting title of Pro- patriot .

		fessor
Lorenzo Sears	ORGANIZATION	's attractively - presented account of the life and public services of him whose bold signature is the first and the best - known of the fifty-six appended to the Declaration of Independence , and whose other chief claims to re - membrance are thus summarized by the author : '' He was the earliest considerable sufferer from commer - cial oppression ; the first aristocrat of
Boston	LOCATION	to join a party which had little property to lose ; one of the two whom royal displeasure excluded from pardon ; often chairman of liberty meetings ; a member of the Great and
General Court	ORGANIZATION	; deputy to the Provincial Congresses and presiding officer ; also deputy to the
Continental Congress	ORGANIZATION	and for two and a half years its President ; the first Governor of the Common - wealth of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	and ten times re-elected . ''

		Fourteen years ago some selections from
Hancock	PERSON	's letter-book were edited with explanatory matter by Mr.
Abram English Brown	PERSON	; and much earlier than that materials for a biography are said to have been collected , but to have been sold for a thousand dol - lars to some unnamed person interested in suppress - ing them .

		Thus , for whatever mysterious reason , no formal biography of
Hancock	PERSON	has hitherto ap - peared , and Professor
Sears	ORGANIZATION	enters an untrodden domain in his present historical study .

		His volume , of about the size of those in the '' American States - men '' series , is written in a style to win popular approval , and gives with sufficient fulness -LRB- so far , at least , as inadequate records permit -RRB- the main facts of
Hancock	PERSON	's life .

		The romance of his suit for
Dorothy Quincy	PERSON	's hand , in the troubled times of outbreaking hostilities between
England	LOCATION	and her American colo - nies , is agreeably told ; and the puzzling episode of his seeming delinquency as treasurer of
Harvard Col	ORGANIZATION	- lege is unsparingly related .

		But the brevity of ref - erence to the Declaration of Independence is a little surprising , in view of the importance of its framing and signing in both the history of the nation and the public life of
Hancock	PERSON	.

		The closing words of the book couple the name of
John Hancock	PERSON	with the names of
Robert Morris	PERSON	and
George Washington	PERSON	as deserving of highest honors in our tribute to the heroes of the Revolution .

		The familiar Copley por - trait is reproduced as appropriate frontispiece to the volume , which bears the imprint of Little ,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		THE DIAL , 249 is courted in his own territory of commonsense .

		We are apparently at the beginning of such a change .

		The latest expression of the recurring romantic movement has apparently culminated in pragma - tism , and pragmatism has wandered far from real - ity .

		Hence a brilliant group of men on both sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	are preaching a return to reality , to the world of every day .

		`` The World We Live In ; or , Philosophy and Life in the Light of Modern Thought '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Professor
G. Stuart Ful	PERSON	- lerton of
Columbia	LOCATION	, is a general defence of the new phase of thought and a criticism of both the intel - lectual idealisms of
Berkeley	LOCATION	,
Bradley	PERSON	, and
Royce	PERSON	and the newer pragmatism from the realistic stand - point .

		The world , says Professor Fullerton , is not existent only in our or God 's perception of it , as
Berkeley	LOCATION	taught , nor is it a mere function of an `` abso - lute '' ; but it is an objective reality truly presented to us though with limitations by our senses .

		Hence the philosophy of the New Realism keeps close to facts and sane inductions from them .

		But this system of thought should not be confused with the older naturalism .

		It realizes that there are minds as well as bodies in the universe , and it does not try to express the reality and operation of these minds in terms of chemistry or molecular physics as is done by such a thinker as the biologist
Jacques Loeb	PERSON	in his `` mechanistic conception '' of life .

		Pro- fessor
Fullerton	ORGANIZATION	's outline of this philosophy is writ - ten in a non-technical manner and with a great effort to attain concreteness of exposition by the constant use of examples from everyday thought and life .

		In fact he carries this mode of exposition to such length that the philosophical reader who happens to hold the conceptions Mr.
Fullerton	PERSON	criticises will be irrita - ted exceedingly by what he will consider a rather unfair method of exposition .

		But the book is writ - ten primarily for the plain man ; and the world it presents , while considerably less fascinating than either the pragmatic or idealistic worlds seem to be at first blush , yet has an aspect of solid and comfort - able reality about it .

		The New Realism seems re - solved to give us a world which is chary of promis - ing too much to the enthusiastic soul but which keeps the few promises man may exact from it .

		The function and value , in the econ - omy of the world , of small nations depend upon the maintenance of high standards of independent national culture .


Denmark	LOCATION	has long been noted for its unique demo - cratic institutions , and no less for the characteristic - ally vigorous intellectual and artistic life in its capital .

		The portrayal of society in the literary circles of
Copenhagen	LOCATION	in the early seventies is of especial in - terest .

		It was a brilliant period , though as a nation
Denmark	LOCATION	had for the second time been brutally crushed by
Germany	LOCATION	and was smarting under the defeat .

		The romantic period in literature and art was just drawing to a close ,
Hans Christian Andersen	PERSON	was writing his last work , the tragedies of Oehlenschlager were still in vogue , the verses
Literary Denmark	LOCATION	in the seventies .

		of Paludan-Mtiller were popular , and
Galeotti	PERSON	's tableaux-ballets continued to dominate the stage at the Royal Theatre .

		The great national movement for a native poetry , a native drama , and a native art had reached fruition .

		Bissen 's '' Landessoldat '' had succeeded the Psyches and Hebes of the Icelander Thorwaldsen in popular esteem , and canvases portraying Danish home life were in high favor .

		But a change was impending .

		BjOrnson 's `` Newly Married Couple '' had been enthusiastically received at the Royal Theatre , though with misgivings in conservative circles .

		Ibsen had returned to the North from
Rome	LOCATION	somewhat mellowed by the suc - cess of '' Brand , '' and the
Gyldendalske Boghandel	PERSON	was entering upon its wider exploitation of
Scandi	LOCATION	- navian literature .

		But
Copenhagen	LOCATION	's coming writer ,
Georg Brandes	PERSON	, was still ostracized by the orthodox for his radical views and destructive criticism .

		Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	, in his volume entitled '' Two Visits to
Denmark	LOCATION	: 1872 , 1874 '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , draws from his note-books the youthful impressions which this cultivated society of
Copenhagen	LOCATION	made upon him .

		He wrote with enthusiasm and fulness at the time , and the literary portraits sketched in his pages have not lost in interest with the passing years .

		Mirthful A & ood book with which the youth - tcenesfrom ful reader of
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's `` Tales from
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Shakespeare '' might follow up his study of the great dramatist is offered by Mr.
William A. Lawson	PERSON	in his '' Shakespeare 's Wit and Humour '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , a small volume collecting the more enjoyable mirthful scenes that are scattered through the plays .

		Enough of plot and situation is in each case indicated by the compiler to give intelli - gibility to the extracts .

		Also an introductory essay which young readers will skip , as a rule is sup - plied on the general subject of wit and humor as illustrated in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's pages .

		No table of con - tents or index is provided , to show what plays have been drawn upon ; but it appears that not many more than half of the whole number have furnished quotable matter .

		Curiously enough , the `` Comedy of Errors '' has contributed but a single page , while some of the tragedies , notably `` Hamlet , '' have been found far richer in wit and humor .

		If readers , young or old , shrink from the unabridged form of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's plays , such selections as this may do them a service by opening their eyes to unsuspected treasure .

		The book is handy in form and the text has not been `` doctored '' except in the way of neces - sary omissions , which are indicated by dots .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The current annual report of the
City Library of Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
Nebraska	LOCATION	-RRB- gives indication of the further ex - tension of the county library system .

		`` At the last ses - sion of the legislature a measure was passed providing for the establishment of county libraries , also fixing the maximum levy for library purposes at three mills on the dollar .

		A number of citizens of this county have 250 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 1	DATE	, taken the matter up and are now asking that the mat - ter be submitted to the voters of the county at the next general election .

		In the event of its being carried and the county library established , some proposition will probably be made to this board , looking toward co - operation in the management of the two organizations . ''

		One would hardly say that '' A Zola Dictionary '' satisfies a long-felt want , but for those who need it Mr.
J. G. Patterson	PERSON	has supplied it .

		The volume is published by the Messrs.
Dutton	PERSON	, and is uniform with the dictionaries of
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Meredith	PERSON	,
Hardy	ORGANIZATION	, and Kipling .

		Mr.
Henry Frowde	PERSON	publishes an edition of '' The
Rowley	PERSON	Poems of
Thomas Chatterton	PERSON	, '' reprinted from
Tyrwhitt	LOCATION	, and edited by Mr.
Maurice Evan Hare	PERSON	.

		A good modern
Chatterton	PERSON	has long been needed , and this one -LRB- in type facsimile -RRB- supplies the want .

		We find in the bibliography no mention of Mr.
C. E. Russell	PERSON	's work one of the most important of recent years .

		The Chautauqua books for home reading during the coming year include a reprint of Mrs.
Alfred Sidgwick	PERSON	's delightful `` Home Life in
Germany	LOCATION	, '' and three new books prepared for this course , as follows : '' Social Progress in
Contemporary Europe	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
Frederic Austin Ogg	PERSON	; '' Mornings with Masters of Art , '' by Mr.
H. H. Powers	PERSON	; and The Spirit of French Letters , '' by Miss
Mabell S. C. Smith	PERSON	.

		`` The Story of the Ancient Nations , '' by Professor
William L. Westermann	PERSON	, is published by the Messrs.
Appleton	PERSON	in their series of '' Twentieth Century Text - Books . ''

		A great amount of new material for the his - tory of the ancient world has come to light of recent years probably more than for any other section of history and this the author has sought to make avail - able for high school uses .

		He has made an admirable text-book , equipped with all the needful apparatus .

		To Professor
Walter C. Bronson	PERSON	's four volumes of '' English Poems , '' a volume of '' American Poems , 1625-1892 '' is now added , published by
the University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The volume presents a great quan - tity of material in chronological arrangement , and is supplied with copious notes and bibliographies .

		The resources of the special collections of
Brown University	ORGANIZATION	have supplied the editor with the best authorities for accurate texts , and have made possible the widest range of selections .

		`` British Poems ' , '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , edited by Dr.
Percy Adams Hutchison	PERSON	, is an anthology of non-dramatic verse from Chaucer to Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	.

		It is unburdened by notes , and , with few exceptions , the pieces included are given in their entirety .

		The selection seems judicious , and the amount of matter presented is considerable equalling perhaps the two series of '' The Golden Treas - ury . ''

		Much pains have been taken with the texts , and the rich resources of the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	library have been at the service of the editor .

		A reaction from the present sordid commercialism in industrial fields is foretold by Professor
Alvin S. John	PERSON	- son , of the
Economics department of Cornell University	ORGANIZATION	, in a Phi Beta Kappa address delivered by him at
Stan	PERSON	- ford
University	ORGANIZATION
last May	DATE	, and now issued by the Chapter in pamphlet form .

		It is a hopeful and well-reasoned paper . ''

		Much of the power of commercialism , '' he says , '' is the product of transitory historical conditions , and must pass away . ''

		Moral and aesthetic values , no less than material ones , are essential to the evolution of the industry of the future ; and poetry and philosophy and painting will '' take their place alongside of indus - try in the every-day service of man . ''

		Workers in the higher fields will have a large part in the new industrial development , by furnishing it with standards and ideals . ''

		Architects and sculptors , painters and poets , can trans - form social man and society into values capable of dom - inating industry . ''

		Professor
Johnson	PERSON	's paper is so inspiring and suggestive that it might well be elaborated into a volume .

		In connection with the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of the
Mount Holyoke College	ORGANIZATION	there has been published at the Riverside Press '' A Mount Hol - yoke Book of Prose and Verse , '' edited by
Miss E. C. Porter	PERSON	and
Miss F. L. Warner	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a selection from undergraduate manuscript of the past twenty odd years and '' was undertaken to show the best of what
Mount Holyoke	LOCATION	girls have written . ''

		The editors add : `` Once the manuscript was got together it proved to be a far more interesting thing , a sort of footnote to college his - tory , alive with the successive interests of the different years and shaped as the college has been shaped . ''

		The volume is pleasant reading and creditable to the methods and ideals of the school from which it comes .

		A copy of ''
Newark	LOCATION	in the Public Schools of
Newark	LOCATION	, '' by Mr.
J. Wilmer Kennedy	PERSON	, Assistant Super - intendent of Schools , has come to us , and deserves hearty commendation for its combined instructiveness and read - ability .

		It is described on the title-page as '' a course of study on
Newark	LOCATION	, its geography , civics and history , with biographical sketches and a reference index . ''

		Nu - merous illustrations are inserted , and the whole makes an attractive volume of more than two hundred pages .

		Especially interesting to general readers is the section devoted to '' Literary Landmarks of
Newark	LOCATION	, '' a chap - ter richer in distinguished names and precious associa - tions than many would have suspected .

		Newark appears to be the leader , and a most energetic one , in introduc - ing into its public schools this thorough and systematic study of its own history , topography , and institutions .

		A pamphlet by the
Newark	LOCATION	librarian , Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	, on '' The Study of a City in the Schools of that City , '' reprinted from '' The Pedagogical Seminary , '' gives significant facts and details regarding this praise - worthy movement on the part of the
Newark	LOCATION	educators , a movement in which we surmise Mr.
Dana	PERSON	himself has played no unimportant part .

		The second volume of Lescarbot 's '' History of
New France	LOCATION	, '' as reprinted by the
Champlain Society	ORGANIZATION	of
Toronto	LOCATION	, with the original text , an English translation , and notes and appendices by Professor
W. L. Grant	PERSON	of
Queen 's University	ORGANIZATION	,
Kingston	LOCATION	,
Canada	LOCATION	, contains Books III .

		and IV .

		of the History , describing the voyages of Jacques Cartier ,
Roberval	ORGANIZATION	, La Roche , and Champlain to the Gulf and
River St. Lawrence	LOCATION	; and those of De Nonts and Poutrincourt to the
Bay of Fundy	ORGANIZATION	.

		As Lescarbot himself was a member of the expedition of
1606	DATE	, and took an active part in all the affairs of the little settlement at
Port Royal	ORGANIZATION	, the Fourth Book of his History is of particular interest .

		He not only gives us , from personal knowledge , the romantic story of this pioneer settlement in what now constitutes the Maritime Provinces of
Canada	LOCATION	, but he adds many characteristically shrewd and acute comments on the character of his companions , and of Membertou , sagamore of the Mic - macs , and his savage allies .

		Professor Grant 's discrimi - nating editorial work , which formed so admirable a feature of the first volume , is equally praiseworthy here .

		Volume III. , completing the History , is expected to be published before the closing of the year .

		While dealing specifically with the Turko-Italian war in

		Founded on the carefully revised text of the Memorial Edi - tion -LRB- in which the poetry fills three large volumes -RRB- this is an impressive volume containing more than six hundred pages .

		Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	, who wrote during the au - thor 's lifetime `` THE PHILOSOPHY AND POETRY OF
GEORGE MEREDITH	PERSON	, '' which is referred to in
Meredith	LOCATION	's recently pub - lished Letters , has added some illuminating notes to the poems .

WILLIAM R. SCOTT	PERSON
$ 1.35	MONEY	net ;
$ 1	MONEY	.45 postpaid THE
PANAMA	LOCATION	CANAL , the world 's greatest enterprise , is more than 90 per cent completed .

		It is now possible to take a perspective view of the project , and `` The Americans In
Panama	LOCATION	'' is such a treatment .

		The author is a newspaper man who spent five months studying the canal , working three months as a canal employee to insure accuracy of visualization .

		Between 15,000 and 20,000 Americans will visit the canal this year , the last time it may be seen in course of construction , as the first ship is scheduled to pass through in
September , 1913	DATE	.

		If you expect to go , two things should be done at once .

		Secure your steamer reservation and buy a copy of `` The Americans In
Panama	LOCATION	. ''

		It will qualify you to get the maximum instruction and pleasure out of your trip .

		From the beginning of
Panama	LOCATION	's history in
1501	DATE	to the latest developments on the canal there is not an essential fact omitted or a superfluous one retained .

		Discusses competently the
Monroe	PERSON	doctrine , the controversy with
England	LOCATION	, and
Colombia	LOCATION	's claim for the loss of
Panama	LOCATION	.

		If you are one of the 89,900,000 Americans who will not see the canal in the building , '' The Americans In
Panama	LOCATION	'' is ideally the book to purchase and read and to add to your library .

		It is a sign of culture to be accurately informed on current subjects of vital inter - est. `` The Americans In
Panama	LOCATION	'' is authoritative , succinct , and non-technical .

		It is illustrated adequately .

		The selection in each case has been governed by scholarly discrimination , and is designed to show the individual , representative work of each poet .

		The poetry of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries and the minor poetry of the nineteenth century are included , although more than half the space is given to the greater poets .

		The broad view thus afforded of the entire field of American poetry will help the student to an understanding of American life from the earliest colonial times and to a juster appreciation of the greater nineteenth-century poets .

		A BOOK THAT HAS BEEN LONG WAITED FOR THE MODERN READER 'S CHAUCER The Complete Poetical Works of GEOFFREY CHAUCER Now first put into Modern English by
JOHN S. P. TATLOCK PERCY MAC KAYE	PERSON	Author of AND Author of `` The Development and Chronology `` The Canterbury Pilgrims , '' of Chaucer 's Works '' ``
Jeanne d'Arc	PERSON	, '' etc. .

		Illustrated by 32 full-page quadri color plates from paintings by the celebrated English artist ,
WARWICK GOBLE	PERSON	.

		Chaucer 's entire works have never before been put into Modern English .

		Fugitive fragments retold in prose and verse by Pope ,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	, and others of lesser fame exist , but the wit , beauty , and wealth of this great English poet is practically unknown to the modern reader .

		This condition is now removed by this work in which the editors specialists in their knowl - edge of CHAUCER adhering closely to the original have rendered into modern English all the wonderful tales of this early poet .

		The editors have kept as much of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's raciness and archaic savor as is consistent with the reader 's ease , and have been strictly faithful to the original , paraphrasing as little as possible , and never misrepresenting .

		It is believed , therefore , that the present volume will be welcomed by a great number of cultured people everywhere , who , desirous of becoming fully acquainted with this classic English poet , but unversed in Old English , have experienced difficulty in reading Chaucer in the original .

		300 THE CAUSE .

		11 It is the cause , it is the cause , my soul . ''

		The Cause is looking up .

		It is being advo - cated in the
Fiji Islands	LOCATION	, and has won the adherence of Mr.
R. H. Williams	PERSON	of Beacon -LRB- significant name ! -RRB-

		,
Iowa	LOCATION	, of Mr.
D. W. La Rue	PERSON	of
East Stroudsberg	LOCATION	,
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, and of several other doubtless equally estimable per - sons .

		We gather these interesting and hopeful facts from the last number of the '' Simplified Spelling Bulletin , '' which is the official organ of the Cause , and which will be sent regularly to any address for an annual subscription of
ten cents	MONEY	.

		Another cheering announcement is that the
Chicago Numismatic Society	ORGANIZATION	has seen the light a flash-light , in this case , which took a `` fotograf '' of the numismatists assembled at a banquet , where the menu provided them with roast
spring	DATE	`` lam '' and `` mince sauce . ''

		Of even more thrilling interest is the announcement that a student at
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	in the department of chemistry has published his doc - toral dissertation in simplified spelling .

		His subject is `` Derivativs of 4-Hydroxy-5-Nitro - Quinazoline , '' which seems to us a fairly harm - less application of the reform .

		The author of the above diverting essay may be as yet unknown to fame , but that can not be said of Sir
William Ramsay	PERSON	, who is , we believe , now in
Texas	LOCATION	as a foreign representative of `` siens '' at the inaugural ceremonies of the
Rice Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has recently , it seems , addressed himself to the readers of an English educational journal in the following cabalistic terms : `` Let every teecher hu reedz theez lienz ov mien tri and convins herself hou eezy iz this nyu speling .

		... It is the jeneraishonz ov children tu cum hu apeel tu us tu saiv them from the aflicshon which we hav endyuerd and forgoten . ''

		We like particularly that weird word `` jeneraishonz , '' which must be a joy forever to anyone who can remember how to spell it .

		But as we scan this brief quotation of forty-three words , of which nearly two - thirds are unknown to the dictionary , and try to read it aloud , giving the letters the values that we instinctively attach to them , we discover that just one-half of the deformed spellings indicate a pronunciation which is dis - tinctly not that of the cultivated user of the English language .

		For example , how does 276 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, the writer reconcile his `` siens , '' `` lienz , '' and `` mien '' ?

		And how are his readers to know that the initial vowels in `` apeel '' and `` aflic - shon '' are short ?

		The Cause is welcome to these phonetic vagaries , but they do not exactly commend it to the judicious .

		Elsewhere , Sir
William Ramsay	PERSON	is quoted as saying : '' It is objected that with the new sys - tem people would not all spell the same way .

		But does it really matter so long as what is written is understandable ? ''

		We should think `` decipherable '' a better adjective , but let that pass .

		The result at which Sir
William	PERSON	hints is amplified in the leading article of the '' Bul - letin , '' which opens as follows : '' One of the delites of a modernized English spelling will be the new era of discovery that it will open to the readers of letters and books .

		They will often find out , for the first time in their lives , how the writers whose books they read , and how their correspondents whose voices they have not heard , pronounce their words .

		At present readers have to -LRB- jess how the authors pronounce .

		No doubt they gess correctly , in - most cases ; but they do not know '' The writer of this aston - ishing plea says truly , later on , that '' a vista is opend . '' ''

		O , vistas infinite unfold ! ''

		says Brand to the Dean , who is expounding to him the true philosophy of religion .

		Hitherto , we have left this sort of license to the amateurs of dialect , who have alternately bored and puzzled us to the limit of endurance , but we have not had to read them .

		In the good time coming , it seems , everybody who writes will devise for his words spellings ad hoc , in accordance with some occult phonetic system of his own .

		By way of illustrating the nice derangement of epitaphs which will follow from this practice , we are given the following examples : '' isyu -LRB- ishu , ishyu -RRB- , '' and '' tordz -LRB- toewerdz , toerdz -RRB- . ''

		We should doubtless also get '' ishoe , '' '' toardz , '' and many others , wondering all the time what the writer was trying to say .

		The example of the ingen - ious person who showed that '' scimitar '' might be spelled in we forget how many ways stands as a solemn warning against indulgence in this happy-go-lucky practice , which is gravely recom - mended to us as a saver of time for school chil - dren and an economizer of energy for the adult brain .

		In an unguarded moment , the Bulletin ad - mits that the Cause '' invites humor , and indeed makes it inevitable . ''

		Its sponsors , we are told , '' have more fun with spelling , simplified and unsimplified , than any other class of human beings . ''

		An exhibit of this playful spirit is made in several instances .

		Does the man who issued the Edict of
Oyster Bay six years ago	DATE	need to be defended from criticism as a back - slider because his `` African Game Trails '' is written in dictionary words , the defence is found in obedience to the scriptural injunction , `` Authors , obey your publishers in the Lord , lest they turn again and rend you . ''

		This is fairly side-splitting .

		The word `` manoeuvres '' provides an opportunity for much merry jest - ing .

		`` If ten thousand American soldiers were opposed by twenty French soldiers , and if the victory of the American soldiers depended on their pronouncing manoeuvres just as the twenty Frenchmen would , the whole ten thou - sand would be left gloriously ded on the field of battle , while the twenty heroic Frenchmen would roll their tungs in triumf . ''

		It seems that even
Webster	PERSON	does not take enough liberties with this word , because he feebly compromises on `` man - euver , '' whereas the free-born American calls it '' manoover . ''

		If this be so , it is a grievous fault , paralleled only by the awful example of the
New York	LOCATION	'' Evening Post '' when it lapsed from grace in the spelling of '' pronunciamiento '' shortly after Mr.
Godkin	PERSON	's death .

		To the charge that the spelling reformers are only '' an unauthorized group of persons , '' we have a crushing rejoinder in the shape of a quotation from an English scholar anent
Julius Caesar	PERSON	: `` The oldest part of the Tower is said to have been built by
Julius Caesar	PERSON	without any authority . ''

		Also the
Pilgrim Fathers	ORGANIZATION	and the Signers and the Abolitionists were `` unauthorized '' groups of reformers .

		More than usually ponderous is the sarcasm expended upon a university teacher of English who , when asked if he had read the literature of the
Simplified Spelling Board	ORGANIZATION	, replied irrele - vantly : '' No , I would rather read ' Cymbeline . ' ''

		This leads to an array of quotations from the play , all in the lawless orthography of
1600	DATE	, such as the following : '' When shall I hear all through ?

		This fierce abridgment '' -LSB- thru -RSB- , or as this : '' Our very eyes , Are sometimes like our Judgements , blinde . ''

		Another quotation from '' Cymbeline '' seems to us more apt , as a suggestive commentary upon the Cause as a whole , than any of those given .

		It is brief and to the point : '' The game is up . ''

		But it is perhaps too much to suppose that the game will be really `` up '' as long as the subsidy holds out .

		THE DIAL 277 ANOTHER LITERARY MARE 'S - NEST .

		Alas for the ingenuity of man !

		Simple truth , plain fact , recorded history do not please him .

		He must go behind the returns .

		He must suspect , sur - mise , invent , and out of the accepted data of the past weave himself a crazy-quilt pattern of his own .

		He is not going to be deceived by the disinterested liars of old times .

		He knows their business a great deal better than they did themselves .

		He can see through the millstones or milestones of the past , and they are not what they are supposed to be .

		The standard , the paragon , of critical delusions woven by over-smartness , the most prodigious fabric ever built without foundation , is the theory of the Baconian authorship of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	.

		Against probability , against evidence , against certainty , it persists .


James Spedding	PERSON	, who gave thirty years to the study of
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	's life and works , for the sole purpose of rehabilitating and aggrandizing his hero , said of this theory : '' I see no reason to suppose that
Shakespeare	PERSON	did not write the plays .

		But if some - body else did , then I think I am in a position to say that it was not Lord Bacon . ''

		I have often thought that the French have wasted a good chance for a similar controversy in regard to
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	.

		Why do they not pool their issues , as it were , form an intellectual Trust and put forth the claim to an all - accomplished genius in the person of Pascal ?

		Pascal was the most learned and the most variously gifted man of his time in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		He was a metaphysician , mathematician , inventor , master of polite letters , and pupil of polite society .

		His father was a Judge , and he was brought up in ease and in the company of the best minds of his period .

		What is more likely than that he wrote the Molieresque comedies ?

		That he had the power to do so is evident ; for , while there is nothing to show that Lord Bacon could have writ - ten a single page of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the author of the `` Provincial Letters '' and the `` Pense'es '' had the wit , the perception of character , the creative gift , the profound philosophy necessary to have written the plays ascribed to
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	.

		And the latter , how does it stand with him ?

		How is it possible that the son of a vulgar upholsterer , a strolling actor battered and beaten about the provinces for fifteen years , how is it possible that he could have ac - quired the learning , the knowledge of society , the nobility of thought , and the depth of philosophy which the comedies display ?

		It is true that
Pascal	PERSON	died at a time when only two of
Moliere	ORGANIZATION	's Parisian successes had been produced ; but it is easy to get around that difficulty .

		We have only to suppose that
Pascal	PERSON	wrote the rest of the plays before and after his retirement to Port-Royal , and handed them over in bulk to Moliere to be brought out as occasion required , and our theory is right and tight enough .

		That the French have not allowed such a theory to form and get headway , while the English have looked on stupified at the Baconian folly , would seem to prove that the former , beneath their surface extravagances , are entirely sane , while the latter under their veneer of common sense are es - sentially eccentric .

		And one form of English , and still more American , eccentricity is the excessive reverence paid to learning , and the disposition to rely upon the acquirer of information for all other good things .

		If we could only realize that , as far as lit - erature at least is concerned , mere learning is the iron pyrites , the fool 's gold , and natural parts are the true metal , then there would be an end of such delu - sions as the Baconian theory .

		But let us leave the tormentors of Shakespeare to their fate , and turn to another `` question '' which seems to be looming up .


Emily Bronte	PERSON	is the Sphinx of literature .

		A spirit so removedly re - served , so profoundly proud , yet so touched with tenderness , her like can scarcely be found among the daughters of men .

		She was brave to temerity ; she stood up to meet her death .

		And her work is not merely
Amazon	LOCATION	work it is man 's work .

		Every epithet which
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	instinctively applied to her when he said that her soul '' Knew no fellow for might , Passion , vehemence , grief , Daring , since
Byron	PERSON	died , '' testifies to this male quality in her .

		Accordingly , some years ago a Mr.
Leyland	PERSON	put forth a book advocating the claim of
Branwell Bronte	PERSON	to the authorship of `` Wuthering Heights . ''

		Undoubtedly there is a good deal of
Branwell	ORGANIZATION	in the book .

		His experiences , his letters , and recorded ravings all show that he was , or thought he was , a close kinsman to Heathcliff e , for whom he must have served as a partial model .

		But there is absolutely nothing to prove that he had any real literary power .

		And his boastfulness was such that if he had had any direct hand in the book , he would have made the welkin ring with his claims .

		So Mr.
Leyland	PERSON	's revelations obtained no credence .

		A book rather portentously entitled `` The Key to the Bronte Works , '' by Mr.
John Malham-Dembleby	PERSON	, has recently appeared .

		In it , with a great show of parallel citations and of labelled `` Critical Methods , '' Mr.
Malham-Dembleby	PERSON	seeks to show that
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	was the real author of '' Wuthering Heights . ''

		We hardly think that Mr.
Malham-Dembleby	PERSON	's `` critical methods '' would require notice , were it not that his book displays some real discoveries as the results of his investigation .

		One of the most interesting of these discoveries is the unearthing of a romance by
Eugene Sue	PERSON	, published in 1850-51 , apparently founded on the occurrences in the He `` ger household in
Brussels	LOCATION	, and showing that the relations of M. He * ger , Madame He * ger , and
Charlotte Bronte	ORGANIZATION	must have been public property on the continent at that date .

		This work of gossip , however , has no bearing on the authorship of `` Wuthering Heights . ''

		The other discovery may have some such bearing .

		This is in the shape of a tourist 's guide-book to
York	LOCATION	- shire written by
Frederick Montagu	PERSON	, in which Mr.
Malham-Dembleby	PERSON	professes to find the germs of some of the scenes and characters of both ''
Wuther	PERSON	- ing Heights '' and ``
Jane Eyre	PERSON	. ''

		Granting the 278 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, similarities , it is possible to reason quite differently than he does about them .

		Books were scarce in that
Haworth	PERSON	parsonage , and it would seem prob - able that the home-loving
Emily	PERSON	, who pined in spirit when away from the moors , should have been the one to pore over this
Yorkshire	LOCATION	guide , rather than the errant and city-loving
Charlotte	LOCATION	.

		And as `` Wuthering Heights '' was unquestionably written before ``
Jane Eyre	PERSON	, ''
Charlotte	LOCATION	may have merely followed her sister 's lead and taken
Montagu	PERSON	's data at second hand .

		Apart from external evidence , of which there is plenty , there are four great reasons which must neg - ative
Charlotte Bronte	PERSON	's authorship of ''
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	. ''

		The first of these is the character of
Emily Bronte	PERSON	, which we have glanced at above .

		Was she the being to descend to the level of a com - mon cheat , to deck herself in borrowed plumes , to go forth to the world as an impostor ?

		The thing is incredible .

		And if she had done so , would
Charlotte	LOCATION	, herself a scorner of meanness and deception , have kept on loving and revering her during her life ?

		Would she , after
Emily	PERSON	's death , have reared for her a monument in the noble and spirited figure of
Shirley Keeldar	PERSON	?

		Human nature is not built in that way .

		Charlotte
Bronte	PERSON	was not wanting in self - assurance .

		She could hold her opinion of herself against others .

		She retorted sharply on
Lewes	LOCATION	when he implied that she had a great deal to learn from
Jane Austen	PERSON	.

		But every line that she wrote about
Emily	PERSON	testifies not merely to a sisterly affection but to an admiration of almost startled wonder .

		She never wrote about
Anne Bronte	PERSON	in any such terms .

		The poems constitute a second obstacle to Char - lotte 's assumption of the novel .

		Mr.
Malham	PERSON	- Dembleby does not pretend to claim
Emily	PERSON	's for her sister , which , in view of the tame , ladylike , colorless character of
Charlotte	LOCATION	's verse , is prudent .

		Nearly all of Emily 's pieces are at least touched with the divine fire , and four or five of them stand by themselves in literature .

		They are and will be a part of all anthologies , and are so great that were Emily really robbed of '' Wuthering Heights '' it would not seriously lower her intellectual place .

		Of course it is a matter for critical opinion , how far the authorship of the poems makes valid the authorship of the novel .

		To me they seem to bear the same stamp .

		They are bone and flesh and blood of one being .

		At the very least , they indicate that Emily could have written the novel .

		Now there is a cloud of witnesses to prove that all three of the girls were busy writing stories from their childhood up .

		And
M. Heger	PERSON	thought that
Emily	PERSON	's prose themes were superior to
Charlotte	LOCATION	's .


Anne Bronte	PERSON	, though she had considerably less leisure than
Emily	PERSON	, left two fair-sized novels .

		If '' Wuthering Heights '' is taken from
Emily	LOCATION	, what did she write ?

		The characters of
Heathcliffe	ORGANIZATION	and
Rochester	LOCATION	are enough in themselves to proclaim the separate authorship of the two novels .

		If
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	, with her prentice hand , carved the black statue of
Heathcliffe	ORGANIZATION	, faultless in design , unflawed in execu - tion , and then in full practice put together the sham - bling , uncertain workmanship of
Rochester	LOCATION	, she made a more sudden fall than any other known artist .

		Heathcliffe is all of a piece , tragic , intense , true to the conception from first word to the last .

		He might have stepped out of a great Elizabethan play .

		Rochester is mostly melodramatic , and at times he is almost comic .

		He is a woman 's conception of a strong man .

		In fact , the petticoat is not far away from any of
Charlotte	LOCATION	's male characters .

		It peeps out in Mr.
Helstone	PERSON	and the
Moores	PERSON	, and
Paul Emanuel	PERSON	is entirely wrapped up in it .

		Charlotte was as intensely womanly as her sister was male .

		All her novels are saved by the depth and splendor of her female characters .

		On the contrary , the women in ''
Wuthering Heights	LOCATION	'' are hardly more than despicable .

		Lastly ,
Emily	PERSON	and
Charlotte	LOCATION	set the seal of their respective natures on the prose style of their books .

		Emily 's prose is bare , naked of ornament , interpos - ing no veil of words between her meaning and the reader 's mind .

		Even her descriptive passages are of the shortest , a sentence or two , a hint or sug - gestion rather than a deliberate piece of painting .


Charlotte	LOCATION	, on the contrary , is rich and full and vari - ous .

		Her books are strewn over with purple patches .

		In their rich efflorescence they are like the Brazilian woods where , it is said , if you twitch a liana on the borders of
Bolivia	LOCATION	, the President at
Rio	ORGANIZATION	will feel the movement .

		She loves words and images for their own sake , and she deals with them superbly .

		Now it is not impossible that one and the same author should command these two styles ; but where this has been so , it has been at the extremes of a long life .

		And the instinct for wreaking the thought on expression has always corne first .

		If
Charlotte	LOCATION	wrote '' Wuthering Heights '' she must have been dowered with austerity and restraint in the begin - ning , and then very quickly forgot these qualities .

		In spite of '' The Key to the Bronte Works '' we fancy that the picture , which has so impressed the imagination of the world , of the three girls of genius , '' mewing their mighty youth '' in the lonely York - shire parsonage , from whence two of them , at least , were to rise in eagle wheelings visible to all the world , will long remain unaltered and unobscured .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A YEAR 'S LITERARY COMPANIONSHIP , the devo - tion of at least a part of one 's daily reading time for twelve months to one great book , or to one great author , will not be without permanent results to the reader .

		A man is known by the company he keeps .

		The president of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	the other day gave this advice to an audience of under - graduates : `` Resolve to pass the year in company with some high and noble character . ''

		Then fol - lowed suggestions as to the different works of lit - erature likely to suit different temperaments and
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 279 moods , ranging over some of the classics of a more or less distant past .

		But not every one can prevail on himself to cut loose from the fascinations of cur - rent thought and its manifold expression in literary form .

		The volumes of
Gibbon	PERSON	's ' k
Rome	LOCATION	'' are pushed impatiently aside in favor of Professor
McMaster	PERSON	's or Dr.
Rhodes	PERSON	's latest continuation of our own history ;
Masson	PERSON	's `` Milton , ''
Carlyle	PERSON	's `` Frederick , '' and even
Boswell	PERSON	's `` Johnson '' prove less imme - diately inviting than the lives and letters and rem - iniscences of those modern celebrities whom one has either actually seen and known or at least felt keenly interested in .

		The reader , unwilling to follow President
Butler	PERSON	's advice exactly as given , may yet find in current literature , in the books of this present season , not a few `` high and noble characters '' in whose company to pass the year .

		The two substantial posthumous volumes of
John Bigelow	PERSON	's `` Retrospections '' will furnish inspiring reading matter for one 's spare moments through the coming winter and beyond .

		Mark Twain , too , is one with whom a year 's leisure hours can profitably be passed in the three rich volumes of Mr.
Paine	PERSON	's admirable biography .


George Meredith	PERSON	's letters , also , offer opportunity for many half-hours of com - munion with a master-mind .

		And , without going outside this deservedly popular class of books , one can en joy ably and profitably linger for months over such works as Mr.
George Haven Putnam	PERSON	's biog - raphy of his father , and Mr.
James K. Hosmer	PERSON	's `` Last Leaf '' a few pages at a time .

		The em - barrassment is one of riches , in respect to books for companionship , and of poverty , with most of us , in respect to available half-hours or quarter-hours to give to that companionship .

		THE LIBRARIAN 'S HUMAN SIDE is the side that probably stands most in need of development .

		The professional , bibliographic , bibliothecal side will commonly take care of itself , and do it so well that the librarian , unless he be on his guard , will soon become conspicuously '' lop-sided . ''

		Some sensible remarks on this head are reported in the current `` Library Notes and News '' of the
Minnesota Public Library Commission	ORGANIZATION	, from Miss
Flora B. Roberts	PERSON	, presiding genius of the Superior -LRB-
Wis.	LOCATION	-RRB- Public Library .

		Always timely , and seldom sufficiently heeded , are such reminders and counsels as these to library workers : '' Our work is not automatic ; a book read enters into the life of the reader , whether it be the heart life , the intellectual life , or the play life .

		The book itself has come from the author , pul - sating with his life .

		We are the go-betweens , and in order to give the right book to the right person , we must be human , with keenness of mind , and much sympathy and charity of spirit .

		Were we to reduce our circulation of books to the automatic stamping of certain dates in certain places , and certain schemes of filing the cards , we might better invent a slot ma - chine for the work ; it would be cheaper .

		But we are dealing in human stuff , and we can not truly know our public without becoming a part of that public .

		Therefore I say , join clubs , accept social invitations , pay calls , join a church if your religious convictions are in sympathy with church organiza - tions , serve on committees , make addresses when asked get asked sometimes .

		If you see a need of some certain work in the town , take the initiative yourself , even if it has nothing to do with the library . ''

		Clearly , this librarian is convinced that though nickel-in-the-slot restaurants and weighing - machines and music-boxes may serve a useful office , the nickel-in-the-slot library has no place in this world of living and breathing and loving and hating human beings .

		VAGABONDAGE AND THE LITERARY TEMPERA - MENT find themselves not seldom united in the same person , perhaps on somewhat the same principle that causes extremes to meet .

		Casanova and
George Borrow	ORGANIZATION	and Sir
Richard Burton	PERSON	and
Josiah Flynt	PERSON	, born tramps , all of them , each in his own kind , were as skilled in the narration of their wandering adven - tures as they were happy in the knack of encounter - ing them .

		But when a man of books and studies , like the late Professor
Walter Wyckoff	PERSON	, takes to tramping -LRB- in an episodical way -RRB- for the sake of the material it may offer for literary or social-study pur - poses , rather than from an inborn love of the open road , the telling of the story afterward is likely to lack some of the zest that animates the pages of the tramp-author , as distinguished from the author - tramp .

		This difference in style between the two is well pointed out by an anonymous tramp printer who narrates his adventures in `` The
Saturday	DATE	Evening Post . ''

		He says : `` That winter I read some articles in a magazine written by a college professor who had gone tramping to find out how it really felt to be a laboring man .

		His narra - tive struck me as odd , for he never knew where to turn his hand for a bite to eat when he was hungry ; and he made a sort of world-problem of the simple question of where to lie down and sleep , with empty freight cars and warm roundhouses and convenient toolboxes all round him !

		In the light of my own practical experience it seemed to me as though he was an academic child who should not have been permitted to go out into the world alone .

		One other writer I read with a different interest .

		He was a man who called himself
Josiah Flynt	PERSON	; and in his description of hobo life I found no room for criti - cism , for he knew far more about it than I did .

		He was the real article a tramp who turned writer rather than a writer who experimented in being a tramp . ''

		THE MUSE IN BONDS , whether in the person of a Cervantes in durance vile , or a
John Bunyan	PERSON	impris - oned for unlicenced preaching , or an Oscar Wilde pining away in Reading Gaol , must always excite sympathy .

		The poem -LRB- a spontaneous outpouring innocent of rhyme and metre -RRB- that has lately found its way into print from the pen of Mr.
Arthur Giovannitti	PERSON	, thrown into jail as accessory to murder 280 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, in connection with the Lawrence -LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- mill strike , shows the accused to be a man of fine feeling and strengthens the presumption of his innocence of the crime charged against him , and inclines the reader to range himself on the side of Professors
Taussig	PERSON	and
Loeb	PERSON	and the other persons of prominence and influence who have protested against the treatment to which he and his companion have been subjected , Of course the poetic gift is no sufficient warrant of blameless moral character , and the following few lines from `` The Walker '' are here quoted merely for their poignant , pathetic quality , their haunting appeal , their touching picture of one shut out from the `` sunlit highways of life . '' ''

		I hear footsteps over my head all night .

		They come and they go .

		Again they come and again they go all night .

		They come one eternity in four paces and they go one eternity in four paces , and between the coming and the going there are Silence and the
Night	TIME	and the Infinite .

		For infinite are the nine feet of a prison cell , and endless is the march of him who walks between the yellow brick wall and the red iron gate , thinking things that can not be chained and can not be locked , but wander far away in the sunlit world , each in its wild pilgrimage after its destined goal . ''

		I have heard the stifled sobs of the one who prays with his head under the coarse blanket and the whisperings of the one who prays with his forehead on the hard , cold stone of the floor . ''

		And I have heard , most terrible of all , the silence of two hundred brains all possessed by one single , relentless , unforgiving , desperate thought . ''

		I implore you , my brother , for I am weary of the long vigil , weary of counting your steps , and heavy with sleep , Stop , rest , sleep , my brother , for the dawn is well nigh and it is not the key alone that can throw open the door . ''

		THE TECHNIQUE OF FUTURIST LITERATURE , as
Signer Marinetti	ORGANIZATION	informs the waiting world through a recent manifesto , will be distinguished by its sim - plicity , its elemental strength , its primitive natural - ness .

		Verbal expression will be reduced to its lowest terms .

		`` It is undeniable , '' explains this ardent iconoclast , `` that in abolishing the adjective and the adverb the noun will regain its essential , complete , and characteristic value . ''

		The devices of rhetoric are an abomination to him .

		`` For that reason , '' as the
London	LOCATION	`` Chronicle '' quotes him , `` I have re - course to the abstract severity of mathematical signs , which are useful in expressing quantity and quality of emotion by condensing all unnecessary explana - tions and avoiding the dangerous folly of losing time in phraseological corners and in the finicking works of the tailor , the jeweler , and the bootblack .

		Words delivered from the fetters of punctuation will flash against one another , will interlace their various forms of magnetism , and follow the uninter - rupted dynamics of force .

		A white space of vary - ing length will indicate to the reader the moments , also of varying length , when intuition rests or sleeps . ''

		Here let us give , from the
Futurist	ORGANIZATION	's pen , an example of these interlacing forms of magnetism , all unfet - tered , of course , by punctuation .

		The passage de - scribes an assault on a Turkish fort . ''

''

		Who , after this , will ever care to read those effete and finicking compositions , `` The Charge of the Light Brigade , '' or `` The Siege of
Corinth	LOCATION	, '' or the account , in ``
Childe Harold	PERSON	, '' of the battle of
Waterloo	LOCATION	, or any similar effusions of the anaemic poets of the past ?

		HE WHO RIDES MAY READ that is , if he rides in a street-car .

		The importance of this obvious truth so impressed itself upon a speaker at the late meet - ing of the
Wisconsin Library Association	ORGANIZATION	that he urged the placing of library advertising cards in some of those oblong spaces now so eagerly bought up by business men who are convinced of the expe - diency of keeping their names and descriptions or pictures of their wares before the eyes of the trolley - travelling public .

		At Menominee ,
Michigan	LOCATION	, the sug - gestion took speedy root and blossomed in the shape of sundry inviting placards inserted temporarily and by glad permission in the spaces paid for by certain commercial houses for their own behoof and profit .

		And the profit in this instance was expected to come from the mention of their courtesy on the library placards , in the assurance that their complaisance in furthering a worthy cause would work them no harm in the public estimation .

		The whole of this inter - esting experiment is well told by Miss
Lois Amelia Spencer	PERSON	of the
Menominee Public Library	ORGANIZATION	in the ''
Wisconsin	LOCATION	Library Bulletin '' of
July August	DATE	.

		It is too early to give results of the experiment ; but , as Miss
Spencer	PERSON	says in conclusion , `` People un - doubtedly read the advertisements in the street-cars .

		If they need to be reminded of the public library , is n't it the ideal time and place to do it when they are more or less unoccupied and possibly on their way to its part of the town ?

		Because it seems so logical we are expecting discernible results . ''

		PIERRE LOTI 'S ORIENTALISM , his passion for and sympathy with the Far East , colors and even , one might say , with a change of metaphor , saturates much that he has written .

		In the course of his recent
New York	LOCATION	visit
M. Viaud	PERSON	-LRB- Captain
Louis Marie Julian Viaud	PERSON	will be recalled as the name and title in real life of this popular author -RRB- took occasion to say : '' My enthusiasm for the
Orient	ORGANIZATION	is inherent within me .

		It is a part of my very nature .


1912	DATE	.

		J THE DIAJL 281 It is not enough that I can see what Oriental life is , each and every factor of it strikes an answering chord within my soul .

		I am all that the Oriental is , and I am it by nature , just as he is .

		I am a mystic , a dreamer .

		I love to sit and contemplate , as does the Oriental .

		I have the
Oriental	ORGANIZATION	sense of the beautiful in nature , for the
Oriental	ORGANIZATION	spends hours in peaceful communion with the landscape about him , that speaks to him in a language he under - stands . ''

		Of interest was the visiting Frenchman 's assertion that '' the literature of
Japan	LOCATION	has had practically no effect on the literature of the
Occi	PERSON	- dent , because we can not fully grasp its significance . ''

		In perfect accord with what might be called the upside-downness of things in the antipodes is the common people 's preference for poetry to prose .

		They '' love poetry , '' says this authority , '' and so the native literature expresses itself in verse '' as it always has where primitive simplicity has not yet yielded to sophistication .

		AN IMPORTANT GREEK MANUSCRIPT , an illumi - nated transcript , on vellum , of the four Gospels , has been presented to the library of the General Theo - logical Seminary , whose librarian thus describes the gift in his latest yearly Report : `` In the
summer of 1911	DATE	a Greek manuscript of the four Gospels was offered us for purchase .

		Its price was entirely prohibitive as far as our own funds were concerned .

		Through the generosity of Mr.
S. V. Hoffman	PERSON	, however , whose father ,
Dean Hoffman	PERSON	, gave us our
Gutenberg Bible	ORGANIZATION	, it was acquired and presented to us in perpetuity , to be a treasured possession of the Library and an adornment of our Seminary .

		The manuscript itself , hitherto unlisted and unrecorded , was examined during
April	DATE	of this year by Professor
Caspar Rene * Gregory	PERSON	, of the
University of Leipzig	ORGANIZATION	, while here at the Seminary , by him listed and as - signed a number in his list of all the
Greek New Testament	ORGANIZATION	manuscripts known to exist .

		It has been ascribed without doubt to the tenth century and is probably of Georgian origin .

		Written on vellum of small size and in a minute but careful hand , the manuscript is in excellent condition , contains six interesting and still brilliant illuminations , and is bound in velvet and metal ... By this addition we have one of the few New Testament manuscripts in
America	LOCATION	of value and importance a manuscript which must be a source of pride not only to ourselves , but to American Biblical scholars generally . ''

		THE LIBRARIAN 'S NATURAL ALLY in the cam - paign of culture against illiteracy in its more or less pronounced forms , is of course the schoolteacher .

		Perhaps the teacher would state the proposition the other way about , but the effect is much the same .

		The schoolhouse , too , js the natural and logical branch of the library .

		At
Pomfret	LOCATION	,
Vermont	LOCATION	-LRB- our oft-cited model in these matters of rural public - library management -RRB- each schoolhouse serves as a branch library , and as such is designated by the num - ber borne by the school district .

		At
Bristol	LOCATION	, Con - necticut , also , as may be noted in the current annual Report of its public library , even the one-room schools have been pressed into service by the ener - getic librarian , Mr.
Charles L. Wooding	PERSON	.

		He writes in his record of yearly progress : ''
Last winter	DATE	' traveling libraries ' of about 50 volumes each were placed in each of the one-room schools of the city , under the charge of the teachers , for the benefit of the adults living near the schools and remote from the central library .

		The books were exchanged at Easter for new collections .

		As a result 932 volumes were issued , and thirty-nine people who had not pre - viously used the Library were enrolled as borrowers .

		I wish to record my appreciation of the willing co - operation of the teachers , who gladly assumed the extra care of the books and their circulation . ''

		THE FLIPPANT NOTE IN AMERICAN LITERATURE has much to answer for if what Miss
Hanna Astrup Larsen	PERSON	writes in the
October	DATE	'' Forum '' is true .

		At the end of a rather rousing dissertation on '' The Cowardice of American Literature '' she writes : '' Puritanism is not so fatal to art as is the
Ameri	PERSON	- can flippancy , which we flatter ourselves by calling the national sense of humor .

		It is a corrosive , beneath which neither poetry nor oratory , neither enthusiasm nor earnestness can live .

		We deny the spiritual forces even while we are moved by them , and acknowledge only the seen and the tangible .

		But the time is coming when the greater writers of the country will give us literature , and not levity ; when life will no longer be caricatured , or truth distorted . ''

		A heavy charge , this ; but it may be that
Miss Larsen	PERSON	, with an excess of seriousness trace - able to her Norwegian extraction , over-emphasizes the banefulness of the American jocosity .

		Every literature , every literary masterpiece , has the defects of its qualities ; and if we sacrificed our love of fun because of the occasional pranks it plays on us , might we not fall victims to far worse proclivities ?

		No antidote to moroseness can be a very harmful dose .

		POETRY IN THE SOUL OF THE CHINESE TRADES - MAN finds expression in sign-boards of wonderful wording .

		A
Pekin	LOCATION	coal merchant , as a recent ob - server has noted , euphemistically styles his stock-in - trade `` heavenly embroidery , '' and a dealer in oil and wine calls his establishment the `` Neighborhood of Chief Beauty . ''

		Other signboards contain such inscriptions as `` Shop of Heaven-sent Luck , '' `` The Nine Felicities Prolonged , '' '' The Shop of Celestial Principles , '' `` Mutton Shop of Morning Twilight , '' '' The Ten Virtues all Complete , '' and '' Flowers Rise to the Milky Way . ''

		Now and then the shop - man makes his signboard proclaim in choice phrase his own virtues , as `` The Thrice Righteous '' and '' The Honest Pen Shop of Li , '' or some personal peculiarity , as '' The Steel Shop of the Pockmarked Wang . ''

		The height of the poetic is attained by a charcoal shop which calls itself the '' Fountain of 282 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, Beauty . ''

		The Dean of
Gloucester	LOCATION	remarked , a cen - tury and a half ago , that `` what is true of a shop - keeper is true of a shopkeeping nation . ''

		If that is correct , then
China	LOCATION	, as far as it is a country of retail buying and selling , should be a country fond of the felicities of figurative and picturesque language , which , in fact , it is to a noted degree .


AUSTRALIA	LOCATION	'S LITERARY LIKINGS manifest them - selves in favor of American books , especially novels and works having to do with actual experience and adventure , sport , travel , and the like .

		The editor of the
London	LOCATION	'' Book Monthly '' calls attention to this popularity of the American book in
Australia	LOCATION	, a popularity not yet enjoyed by its English rival ; for that far-distant continent -LRB- if the geographies now call it such -RRB- is a new land , newer even than
America	LOCATION	, and its affinities are for the literature of new rather than of old and conventionalized coun - tries .

		One recalls the enthusiastic welcome given to
Mark Twain	PERSON	in his world-encircling lecture tour .

		The stories of a Mark Twain or a
Bret Harte	PERSON	naturally suit the popular taste in
Australia	LOCATION	as those of no English novelist can .

		The increasing market for American books there is noted by the above - named writer , who advises English publishers to bestir themselves in that quarter .

		A TACTFUL HINT from a courteous foreign visitor takes the following form : `` Have you not perhaps paid and are you not perhaps paying too dearly for your material progress ?

		It is ill to lose the faculty of contemplation and the conditions of life that encourage it . ''

		The timely warning is from him whom all the world knows by his pseudonym , ''
Pierre Loti	PERSON	. ''

		It is not very many years ago that another distinguished Frenchman was with us , preaching the gospel of the simple life and calling us back to the things of the spirit .

		But what heed was paid to the friendly advice of
M. Charles Wagner	PERSON	, and what heed will be paid to that of this later admonitor ?

		Perhaps after the present strenuous few weeks are past we shall have time to sober down and reflect , and to read `` The Home of the Soul '' and `` The Simple Life . ''

		THE PERENNIAL APPEAL OF TRANSCENDENTAL - ISM an appeal which , it is true , evokes response quite as often in the unscholarly and the credulous as in the educated and the thoughtful seems just now to be making itself heard with remarkable suc - cess in
St. Louis	LOCATION	, if credit is to be given to the report from that city to the effect that the public library records there show
Emerson	PERSON	's essays to be among the most sought-f or literature of the non-fiction class .

		This rumor is highly creditable to
St. Louis	LOCATION	, and helps to disprove the late
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's too hasty assertion that
Emerson	PERSON	is now an inoperative factor in the literary world .

		Meanwhile , in visible refu - tation of this charge , the publication of the
Emerson	PERSON	`` Journals '' goes steadily forward , volumes seven and eight being announced for
November	DATE	.

		MORE ABOUT THE STORY OF OLD FORT
DEARBORN	LOCATION	.

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Referring to Mr.
Quaife	PERSON	's letter in the last issue of THE DIAL , I note that he '' does not desire to engage in a personal dispute '' with me ; to which I may reply that I do not particularly enjoy a controversy of this kind myself .

		But as Mr.
Quaife	PERSON	is concerned about the '' truth of history , '' it will be worth while to notice one or two things he has to say .

		For example , he says that no man by the name of
Cooper	ORGANIZATION	was killed at the
Fort Dearborn Massacre	ORGANIZATION	.

		How is it possible to account for the fact that a man of that name is mentioned in the letters of
A. H. Edwards	PERSON	, printed in
Fergus	ORGANIZATION	's Historical Pamphlet -LRB- No. 16 , pp .

		54 , 56 -RRB- ?

		Mr.
Quaife	PERSON	's waiving of Cooper out of exist - ence suggests the countryman who remarked to his wife , while they were gazing upon a strange specimen at the Zoo , '' Come along
Maria	LOCATION	, there ai n't no such animal . ''

		Mr.
Quaife	PERSON	returns to the subject of Gen.
Dearborn	LOCATION	's `` distinguished services on the Niagara frontier '' -LRB- this sentence being quoted from my book -RRB- , and remarks that any schoolboy knows that these services were not '' dis - tinguished '' in the sense in which I used the word .

		In Winsor 's '' Narrative and Critical History of
America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Vol 3 , p. 389 -RRB- , it is stated that the expedition directed by
Dearborn	LOCATION	on the Canadian town of York '' was suc - cessful , the enemy was driven off with the loss of over half their numbers , the town was taken , '' etc. .

		This movement , it is said , `` met with greater success than any which had hitherto been undertaken on the frontier . ''

		Regarding access to the
Swearingen	PERSON	narrative , the manuscript of which is preserved in the collections of the
Chicago Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Quaife	PERSON	says that '' it is not true that the public had no access to knowledge concerning the date of beginning the construction of the first
Fort Dearborn	LOCATION	prior to the reviewer 's ' Record -
Herald	ORGANIZATION	' article of
last month	DATE	. ''

		His own words in the article referred to were that the manuscript had been `` brought to light recently . ''

		Thus his contradiction applies to his own statement much more than to mine , which was merely based on what he himself had said .

		I would not be so foolish as to claim that there are no errors in my book ; and under ordinary circumstances I should feel grateful for such corrections and criticisms as might be suggested .

		A knowledge of the minute details connected with our early history is creditable to anyone who searches for it , but united with a bitter censoriousness of the work of others it is of but dimin - ished and minor value .

		It seems strange that out of the dozen or so reviews of my book which I have seen , some of them written by reviewers of great reputation , and all of which were favorable , it remained for a fellow worker in the field of local history to find my book utterly without merit , with not a single word of commendation for any feature of the work .

		There may be different views as to the reliability of my authorities , but such as they are they can be referred to precisely .

		My views as to their value may be fairly challenged , but I deny the charge that my methods are '' unsound '' or that my work is '' superficial . ''

		The many years I have devoted to a careful collection of the sources of out - local history , and the visible results thereof , are a sufficient testimony to the thoroughness

		THE DIAL 283 of my methods .

		This will be corroborated , I am sure , by a '' cloud of witnesses '' in every historical society and in every library and university of the state who know me and know of my work in this field .

		The important collections of the
Evanston Historical Society	ORGANIZATION	, which I have gathered , without thought of pecuniary reward , and primarily for the purpose of assisting students in historical research , may be pointed out in evidence .

		I have , indeed , received compensation for some of my writings , but that was long after I had devoted myself to a task pursued under immense difficulties and at great personal sacrifices .

		I have never presumed to class myself with professional historians , and have constantly suggested to publishers that they should employ such men as professors of history in our great institutions rather than myself .

		But having undertaken the task , I may be allowed to say that my writings on the subject of

		EARLY PREJUDICES AGAINST GREAT LITERATURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		The editorial in your
October 1	DATE	issue , on '' Classical Rubbish , '' has impressed upon me a little personal inci - dent that may interest your readers in the recounting .

		I have a very dear friend , an old lady of about seventy years of age , my mother .

		Her father was a great lover of books , and I have been told that the library on his old Southern plantation was stocked with some of the richest stores that could be found .

		It was burned during the war between the States , and , like the remain - der of the wealth of the plantation , has faded away in that great strife .

		It would be impossible to understand exactly how my mother gained her attitude toward literature , without knowing the conditions that surrounded her childhood .

		In the matter of reading she seems to have been per - mitted to do very much as she chose .

		Her education was left to the care of a Northern woman a spy who conducted a school in the heart of the
South	LOCATION	during the war .

		It was the general belief of the community that it was unwise to give females too much education , as husbands did not like intellectual equals .

		In this atmos - phere she developed a love for the sort of literature of which we hear so much from the average boarding - school girl .

		She read those books which girls sigh over in nooks and corners .

		Possibly it would be unfair to give any of the titles , but they were bound in paper covers and might be bought for ten or
twenty-five cents	MONEY	apiece . ''

		Why do n't you read this , and this ? ''

		I have often asked her , mentioning certain books by the best writers .

		`` I 'm too old to change my ways , '' she would always reply .

		`` You read them , and let me read what I like . ''

		I hope I was never snobbish about my views on the subject , yet it worried me a great deal .

		One day I dropped into her room with a well-known volume of Victor Hugo .

		I begged her to read it .

		She took the book from me with a smile and , in her patronizing way , said she would .

		The next day , upon inquiring how she was enjoying the book , I was greeted with the response that she had read nearly half of it and had found it stupid .

		Upon closer inquiry I found she had but an indistinct idea of the plot .

		Thereupon I sat down and read aloud to her the opening chapters .

		Thus encouraged she began again , with the volume , and read slowly and carefully .

		Day by day she would sit at her window in the warm sun of the autumn , at times with tears streaming down her face with sorrow for Jean , and then with eyes twinkling with smiles for the little waif .

		She would recount to me each evening what she had read .

		Naturally the roman - tic sections of the book at first appealed to her , then she became deeply interested in its sociological aspects .

		I believe that what she got out of that book amounted to more than she had ever gained from all her previous - reading .

		She told me later that she had always been preju - diced against books that bore the stamp of literature , and for this reason she had refused to read the recog - nized classics .

		Is not that the basic reason why we have such a large reading public for the enormous output of commonplace novels ?

		Is it not because so many of us are prejudiced , because so many of us have never taken the trouble to find out how to enjoy good reading ?

		THE USES OF `` CLASSICAL RUBBISH . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Allow one appreciative reader to thank you for your editorial of
October 1	DATE	, on '' Classical Rubbish . ''

		Religious scruples perhaps deterred the writer to whom you refer from putting the
Bible	LOCATION	in his list , where I suppose it would logically belong if it were judged simply by its literary merit .

		I remember coaching a young fellow years ago for the university examinations in English , and being surprised by his almost total lack of response to the Scriptural quotations or allusions in
Burke	LOCATION	's speech on Conciliation with
America	LOCATION	.

		The boy was Boston-born , clever , studious , knew his
Paris	LOCATION	and
Berlin	LOCATION	and passed all his examinations ; but I greatly fear that he will never be either a good American or a cosmopolitan of broad human sympathies .

		A man may be a dilettante , a diner-out , a class - conscious elegant idler , with very little knowledge of the great books ; but for a broad , sane spirit of democ - racy , a hearty acceptance of one 's place and function in the great world , a sense of hunior that cries out against snobbery , send a boy or a girl to the literature that is '' not of an age , but for all time . ''

		The world is no kindergarten for mere pleasure and play .

		If I like to read '' Lear '' and '' Cymbeline , '' so much the better and far better ; but I shall certainly read them .

		If I have a healthy appetite for the strong meat of the
Bible	LOCATION	, that is as it should be ; but I will read the
Bible	LOCATION	whether or no .

		If I were responsible for the breeding of a boy , he should take for granted the old discipline of obedience and make early acquaint - ance , willy-nilly , with the best books .

		You do well , Mr. Editor , in these days of journalism gone daft , to stand for something better than irrespon - sible , ephemeral , slipshod , best-selling `` literature '' made to sell .

Oct. 16	DATE	, 00ks .

		GEORGE MEREDITH HIMSELF .

		* Much more unanimity of opinion is likely to obtain in regard to
George Meredith	PERSON	's excel - lence as a letter - writer than has existed in regard to his significance as novelist and poet .

		For the qualities which tended to obscure his art are scarcely an obstacle in his correspondence ; and certain attractive personal qualities which tended to be obscured by his art lend the Let - ters a singular fascination .

		Of chief importance to the general reader , no doubt , will be the fact that
Meredith	PERSON	is a fellow of infinite faculty for being interesting in detail .

		It is not improbable , therefore , that the Letters will have a fate the reverse of that which fell upon the author 's early works , the fate of considerable popularity , attended , per - haps , by considerable over-estimation of the book 's ultimate value .

		Consideration of that value will be incidental , in the present review , to an examination of the autobiographic aspect of the Letters ; since , whatever else may be said of them , they are bound to have an exceptional present significance as a revelation of an unique personality .

		This revelation has been in no degree fore - stalled : a straight road lies before the Letters across the somewhat meandering ways of Mere - dithian biography -LRB- if the term be at all perti - nent -RRB- and interpretative criticism .

		These , to be sure , have widely traversed the country of our author 's personality ; but they have been sing - ularly unsuccessful in opening up the central region of it .

		Nor has the reason for that failure been properly stated in Mr.
Hammerton	PERSON	's ''
George Meredith	PERSON	in Anecdote and Criticism , '' which has hitherto been our chief authority on the subject : `` His personality is mountainous ; and who has ever read a description of
Mont Blanc	PERSON	or Vesuvius that would serve for all the seasons or all its phases of one day , one hour even ? ''

		Rather is it true that the several brilliant surfaces of that personality have been peculiarly reflective of certain present-day lights , and the resultant dazzle has obscured its clear outlines .

		Meredithian `` biography '' has therefore been unusually vivid and external ; typical of it is Mr.
Hammerton	PERSON	's bulky scrap-book , in which our author is sufficiently sung , drawn , and `` newspapered . ''

		Criticism , at the same time , * THE LETTERS OF
GEORGE MEREDITH	PERSON	.

		Collected and edited by his son .

		` In two volumes .

		With portraits .


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		has been too busy estimating the good , or evil , significance of Meredith 's various reflections of our age to lay bare his entity .

		So that while a fairly definite conception has arisen of the central purport of Meredith 's younger contem - poraries
Swinburne	PERSON	,
Stevenson	PERSON	, Hardy his own remains hazy .

		From the numerous articles about him , even from the different chapters of single books , one may derive quite divergent notions .

		These , very roughly speaking , may be reduced to two general impressions .

		According to the one ,
Meredith	PERSON	is something of a
Mont Blanc	PERSON	if one may thus twist Mr.
Hammerton	PERSON	's handy imagery ; and according to the second , something of a Vesuvius .

		In the one picture , our author wears an appearance of almost classic calm , at the least , he towers considerably above the swift complexity of nineteenth cen - tury life ; whatever of this quality appears in his mode of expression is but a cloud border , beyond which a smooth front is opposed to the heavens , glowing with ripe intellectual discern - ment .

		In the other picture , the subject is quite volcanically restless with his burden of leading thought-tendencies of the time ; above , the hea - vens are somewhat obscured , and yet what an admirable mouthpiece , what a `` spiritual '' mouthpiece , if one 's fancy can compass the image , our sturdy
Vesuvius	ORGANIZATION	is of Her on whom we should chiefly rest our hopes , Mother Earth '' that can not stop , Where ever upward is the visible aim . ''

		These two impressions , if traced to their original sources , are seen to derive again very roughly speaking from two corresponding divisions of Meredith 's works , dealing respect - ively with man in relation to society and with man in relation to nature .

		The first group includes of course the novels , but also a large number of the poems ; its ground-tone is sounded by the `` Ode to the Comic Spirit . ''

		The other comprises the nature poetry , typical of which is the greater part of `` A Reading of
Earth	LOCATION	. ''

		In the Letters , the two pictures merge .


Mont Blanc	PERSON	, ceasing to be '' mountainous , '' becomes the nucleus of a singularly gifted and effective personality ; the other appears simply as an active mode of this .

		Probably no previous author 's letters have been more constantly related to his works than are
Meredith	PERSON	's to his novels .

		To be sure , as his editor admits , '' many of his intimate friends , and a large number of his letters to them , do not for various reasons appear here at all '' ; and one must hope that certain important links will be supplied in time .

		Yet not only is the cor -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 285 respondence in its present form comprehensive , covering practically all of the author 's produc - tive years , but it involves an interesting series of persons , places , and events made use of in the novels .

		The fact that the novels were re - solutely allusive to contemporary social condi - tions has thus worked to the advantage of the Letters : the writer has constantly an artistic and philosophic interest , as well as a personal one , in his correspondents and his topics .

		In the letters to
Janet Duff Gordon	PERSON	-LRB- later Mrs.
Ross	PERSON	-RRB- , to
Frederick Maxse	PERSON	, and to
William Hardman	PERSON	we find much of that range of obser - vation which stimulated the creation not merely of
Rose Jocelyn	PERSON	,
Nevil Beauchamp	PERSON	, and Black - burn Tuckham but of three general character - types prominent in the novels as a whole and holding keystone positions in
Meredith	LOCATION	's social theory .

		At the same time we are shown , in the concrete , the temperamental affiliations and contrasts between those types of character and our author himself .

		To each of the three friends he turns a distinct and important side of his nature .

		To Janet he is always `` your poet , '' humorously admitting the larger admixture of air and fire in his own constitution .

		The con - trast , which reminds the reader vaguely of that between
Rose Jocelyn	PERSON	and
Evan Harrington	PERSON	, crops out in connection with many topics for instance , the
Royal Academy	ORGANIZATION	exhibit : ``
Leighton	PERSON	has a ` Paola and
Francesca	PERSON	' ; painted just as the book has dropped and they are in no state to read more .

		You would scorn it ; but our friendship never rested on common sentiments in art .

		I greatly admire it .

		I think it the sole English picture exhibiting passion that I have seen . ''

		The fact that comparatively few letters to Mrs.
Ross	PERSON	and other of his women friends appear in the collection will be regretted by those who think of Meredith chiefly as the creator of Rose ,
Diana	PERSON	, and all the others in whom blood and judgment are so well commingled or get them - selves commingled through hard experience .

		Apropos of
Diana	LOCATION	, one is interested to find an already known circumstance phrased as follows : '' I am just finishing at a great pace a two - volume novel , to be called '
Diana	PERSON	of the Crossways ' partly modelled upon Mrs.
Norton	PERSON	.

		But this is between our - selves .

		I have had to endow her with brains and make them eviderfce to the discerning .

		I think she lives . ''

		This was written on
March 24 , 1884	DATE	; and the reader who has ground his teeth over the close of that novel , will experience some malicious joy when he comes across the following sequel , written just five months later : '' My '
Diana	PERSON	' still holds me ; only by the last chap - ter ; but the coupling of such a woman and her man is a delicate business .

		She has no puppet-pliancy .

		The truth being , that she is a mother of Experience , and gives that dreadful baby suck to brains .

		I have there - fore a feeble hold of her ; none of the novelist 's winding - up arts avail ; it is she who leads me . ''

		The numerous letters to Maxse are in several ways at once the most appealing and the most illuminating in the collection .

		They are enliv - ened by
Meredith	PERSON	's brusque , incisive criticisms of his friend when the two differ in opinion on such various matters as art , the liquor question , or the government of
Ireland	LOCATION	, on one occasion , `` The hero of
Beauchamp	ORGANIZATION	's Career just bears with me , so stiffly have his bristles been rubbed up by the Irish . ''

		Always , however ,
Meredith	PERSON	's deep-seated affection for the other is apparent , especially when he is concerned about the pos - sible effects of
Maxse	ORGANIZATION	's impetuosity .

		Such a condition arose when , near the beginning of their intercourse ,
Maxse	ORGANIZATION	fell in love , informed
Meredith	PERSON	, and received in reply just such a letter of advice as one can imagine
Nevil Beau	PERSON	- champ , mad for
Renee	PERSON	, receiving from our au - thor .

		That
Meredith	PERSON	had Maxse in mind also when creating
Harry Richmond	PERSON	is intimated in the following : '' I have just finished the History of the inextinguish - able Sir
Harry Firebrand	PERSON	of the
Beacon	ORGANIZATION	, Knight Errant of the
19th century	DATE	, in which mirror you may look and see ; My dear
Fred	PERSON	and his loving friend ,
GEORGE MEREDITH	PERSON	. ''

		But the type of the extremist , who is likely to run unwittingly into egoism , embraces both of these characters and is of cardinal importance in the majority of the novels .

		With the attempt , into which his social insight led him , to isolate that egoism in a single character ,
Meredith	PERSON	was dissatisfied , he says of `` The Egoist '' : `` It is a Comedy with only half of me in it , unlikely therefore to take either the public or my friends .

		This is true truth , but I warned you that I am cursed with a croak . ''

		A perfect complement to the Maxse letters is provided by those to
Hardman	PERSON	, dubbed '' Tuck '' by
Meredith	PERSON	in allusion to the friar of earthly disposition , and characterized as follows : '' A dangerous man , Sir , for he tempteth us to love this life and esteems it a cherishable thing : yet , withal , one whom to know once is to desire ever .

		For indeed such a one is seldom seen . ''

		The writer 's comments on
Hardman	PERSON	send our thoughts not only to
Blackburn Tuckham	LOCATION	but to Red worth ,
Matey Weyburn	PERSON	, and other all - round , commonsense personages who frequent the novels .

		In outline these characters loom up , indeed , behind the glowing haze of the nature poems ; for surely they are the favorite '' sons '' framed by Earth to '' read '' her , and successful 286 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, in doing so if they acquire the requisite infusion of '' spirit '' a quality which , when one turns a prosaic eye on the poems , appears a somewhat vague by-product .

		This quality is of only occa - sional significance in the Letters ; certainly , it was not essential to Tuck 's attractiveness for Meredith . ''

		Tuck , Sweet Charmer , tell me why I 'm at ease when you are by ?

		Have you had ' a round ' with Care , Left him smoshen , stript him bare , That he never more can try Falls with me when you are by ?

		Ah , but when from me you 're screened , Attrobiliad glows the fiend : Fire is wet and water dry : Candles burn cocked hats awry : Hope her diamond portal shuts , Grim dyspepsia haunts my Ahem ! ''

		Beneath the surface of these verses , and of many scattered passages in the Letters , one catches glimpses of inward battles , not merely with dyspepsia but with the universe with the universe , our author himself would phrase it , as seen through the eyes of '' that old dragon , self . ''

		And one is enabled to realize the extent to which self-experience was the ground where grew that doctrine of self-repression and anti- sentimentalism so central in
Meredith	LOCATION	's works .

		The reader of those works would scarcely sus - pect the existence of the tendency referred to in the following passage , contained in a letter to
Maxse	PERSON	and sounding , for his benefit , the char - acteristic note of admonishment previously mentioned : '' As regards
Hawthorne	PERSON	, little
Meredith	PERSON	admits that your strokes have truth .

		I strive by study of human - ity to represent it : not its morbid action .

		I have a tendency to do that , which I repress : for , in delineat - ing it , there is no gain .

		In all my , truly , very faulty works , there is this aim .

		Much of my strength lies in painting morbid emotion and exceptional positions ; but my conscience will not let me so waste my time . ''

		This conscience of Meredith 's , potentially be - neficent in an age in which sentiment born of romance had become the foster-sister of science , was what primarily drew him to the like of
Hardman	PERSON	.

		Incidentally , the letters to '' Tuck '' overflow with the rich joviality and rollicking nonsense which made Box Hill the resort of the so-called ''
Sunday	DATE	Tramps , '' captained by
Leslie Stephen	PERSON	.

		Concerning his reproduction of
Stephen	PERSON	in
Vernon Whitford	PERSON	another of
Earth	LOCATION	's favorite sons
Meredith	PERSON	's own words are : '' It is a sketch of
L. Stephen	PERSON	, but merely a sketch , not doing him full justice , though the strokes without and within are correct . ''

		Such , briefly indicated , are the main high - ways on which our author gathered the stuff of his novels .

		Also numerous side-paths , many of them leading to illuminating discoveries , will tempt the reader of the Letters .

		Another chap - ter , the one most stimulative of thoughtful laughter , is the series of epigrammatic judg - ments passed by the writer on contemporary authors .

		It is safe to say that no other one of them had at once such a real sympathy for his fellow-craftsmen and such a shrewdly critical perception of the net significance of their works .

		Over-boisterous , indeed , becomes the critique of the `` Idylls of the King '' ; but then , two poets have seldom been temperamentally more antipa - thetic than were the Poet Laureate and
Meredith	PERSON	.

		It almost exhausts one of the letters to
Maxse	LOCATION	, and evinces , incidentally , the characteristic dif - ference of outlook between the two friends .

		Briefer , and often better , are the remarks on
Carlyle	LOCATION	, Mill ,
Ruskin	PERSON	,
Swinburne	LOCATION	,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Morris	PERSON	,
Stevenson	PERSON	,
Hugo	PERSON	, and several writers of lesser note .

		One may at first wonder at his keen championship of
Carlyle	LOCATION	, considering that , in regard to their fundamental attitudes toward life , they stand at opposite poles .

		Carlyle , as
Meredith	ORGANIZATION	puts it in a sonnet on the occasion of the seer 's eightieth birthday , `` bared the roots of life with sight piercing '' ; but , as
Meredith	PERSON	writes elsewhere , `` when he descends to our common pavement he is no more sagacious nor useful nor temperate than a flash of light - ning in a grocer 's shop . ''

		On the other hand , it is exactly on the surface of `` our common pavement , '' with its fringe of nature , that
Meredith	PERSON	himself is most sagacious and tem - perate ; for him , surely , the pavement was all too solid , and the `` roots of life '' which he cele - brates , often intemperately , in his nature poems have on the whole been dragged in from the fringe and not dug up from below .

		In short , if
Carlyle	ORGANIZATION	partly aspired to become a critic of society and remained a seer ,
Meredith	PERSON	more fully aspired to become a seer and remained a critic of society : the course of his development in this respect may be followed through numer - ous instances in the Letters , especially when these are placed side by side with his nature poetry .

		This very aspiration of Meredith 's , however , was undoubtedly what made him feel an affinity with
Carlyle	PERSON	.

		The same extraordi - nary range and keenness of intellectual vision which enabled him to steer free of most nine - teenth century excesses except the scientific one , and to survey this more fruitfully than could the romantic
Tennyson	PERSON	and
Browning	PERSON	on the one hand , or his humanitarian younger contem - poraries on the other the same vision caught
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 287 glimpses of spiritual heights which `` Earth '' had not framed him for climbing .

		His somewhat Vesuvian attempts , in his na - ture poems , to mix those heights with Earth both by pouring them molten upon her bosom and by heaving her skyward to meet them half - way are accountable for that secondary picture of him , mentioned near the beginning , which one finds in biography and criticism .

		It has been the aim of this review to indicate how that portrait blends with the other '' too too solid '' one , also previously described , in the pages of the Letters .

		And the student of these will be able to trace the true picture through many details more intimately autobiographic than those which have here been dealt with .

		For in spite of the editor 's modest assurance that `` the collection is not meant to form a narrative of Meredith 's life , '' it fulfills that function in a very large degree .

		And
Meredith	PERSON	's reticence , though it has robbed curiosity of many palatable partic - ulars , has been by no means sufficiently stoical to cloak those larger effects of the chief happen - ings in his life which are most vital for the study of his personality .

		One discerns , for instance , that his unfortunate first marriage was much more important than has been surmised , not only for the composition of `` Modern Love '' but for the whole course of his thought and art .

		One notes , in fairly numerous passages , the sig - nificant combination in his attitude towards nature of healthy animalism with intellectual interest ; and the lack of what have been gen - erally considered the deepest emotions in regard to her .

		On the other hand , one finds in his letters to his oldest son an unexpected revela - tion of tenderness , the Spartan cloak falls quite away , perhaps primarily because the boy was saved to him from the wreck of the first marriage .

		One watches the recuperation of his emotional , and the revivifying of his artistic , powers when , several years after his first wife 's death , he meets the woman who is to be his sec - ond wife .

		And one perceives that `` A Reading of
Earth	LOCATION	, '' composed after her death , records the effects not merely of this event but of their whole life together .

		With the mood of this poem - cycle strong upon him ,
Meredith	PERSON	writes on
March 16 , 1888	DATE	: '' If a man 's work is to be of value , the best of him must be in it .

		I have written always with the percep - tion that there is no life but of the spirit ; that the con - crete is really the shadowy ; yet that the way to spiritual life lies in the complete unfolding of the creature , not in the nipping of his passions .

		An outrage to
Nature	ORGANIZATION	helps to extinguish his light .

		To the flourishing of the spirit , then , through the healthy exercise of the senses . ''

		In this definitive statement of his position , one notes the strangely Carlylean opening and then the almost comic descent toward the Mere - dithian close .

		If some future student of our author 's works should run across this passage let us say , in the coming '' age of concentration '' when the outlines of the concept '' spirit '' shall have become fairly distinct again he would no doubt rub his eyes .

		He would then perhaps review his net impression of Meredith 's poems and novels with the aim of discovering in it '' the perception that there is no life but of the spirit ; that the concrete is really the shadowy . ''

		One 's net impression of Meredith 's works , and now of his letters also , has in the centre of it , not spirit , but `` Tuck '' a composite , social figure sym - bolic of things much larger than itself .

		At least , when the present reviewer had laid aside the two volumes of the Letters , he found that the follow - ing final sentences of an early note to
Hardman	PERSON	remained most vivid in his mind : '' I want restoration .

		Tuck being absent , I go to Nature , in her sublimest .

		Your loving ,
George Meredith	PERSON	. ''

		REGENERATING HUMANITY .

		* The hope of a regenerated humanity , and a world made fit to live in for all its inhabitants , is one that will not be subdued .

		It has haunted the imagination of the world 's finest intellects , from
Plato	LOCATION	to
Ruskin	LOCATION	; it has obsessed the thoughts of numberless thousands of plain men and women .

		Heroism and devotion have flowed without stint in its service ; renunciation and sacrifice have been heaped upon its altar .

		And yet it may scarcely be said that we have ap - proached in any conspicuous degree toward a fulfillment of the dream .

		Is the problem insol - uble ?

		Is the world 's long-battered fort indeed unbreachable ?

		Must the hopes of men for their highest good continue forever to move fatuously about in worlds unrealized ?

		Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	thinks not ; and in his new book , `` The Task of Social Hygiene , '' he unfolds what will seem to many the first con - structive scheme of social reform that carries with it the possibilities of even approximate realization .

		Here at last we are given a pro- gramme of social regeneration that is grounded not upon emotionalism or doctrinaire assump - tions , but upon the calm definite word of science , - a hope for the future that seems to bear the * THE TASK OF SOCIAL HYGIENE .

		By

Boston	LOCATION	:

		288 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, sanction of Mother Nature herself .

		It is a plan of all-embracing comprehensiveness , dealing with function no less than with structure , with character no less than with environment , with men 's souls no less than with their bodies . ''

		All social hygiene , in its fullest sense , is but an increasingly complex and extended method of purifica - tion the purification of the conditions of life by sound legislation , the purification of our own minds by better knowledge , the purification of our hearts by a growing sense of responsibility , the purification of the race itself by an enlightened eugenics , consciously aiding Nature in her manifest effort to embody new ideals of life ... The questions of social hygiene , as here understood , go to the heart of life .

		It is the task of this hygiene not only to make sewers , but to re-make love , and to do both in the same large spirit of human fellowship , to ensure finer individual development and a larger social organization .

		At the one end social hygiene may be regarded as simply the extension of an elementary san - itary code ; at the other end it seems to some to have in it the glorious freedom of a new religion . ''

		Here , then , is a gospel of the purification and ennoblement of life from within , an endeavor to attain a new joy and a new freedom for the individual based on social health and social order .

		Indeed so comprehensive is this plan of social hygiene that it practically supersedes what has hitherto been known as social reform , embracing not only the conditions of life but life itself , and dealing with its subject not in the old haphazard spirit of social reform but with the organized and systematic methods of modern biological science .

		Just as philanthropy has gradually evolved from the idea of alms-giving and amel - ioration to the modern spirit of prevention , so has social hygiene developed from the primitive notions of scavenging , drainage , etc. , to the present-day conception of eugenics .

		The social and physical and biological sciences are to-day working hand in hand for the redemption of hu - manity ; and it is in the reaction of these forces upon the will and intelligence and sense of re - sponsibility of the individual that the spirit of social hygiene becomes operative .

		Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	's book consists of eleven separate essays , nearly all of which have , we imagine , seen the light in one place or another during the past few years .

		But however seemingly detached in form and diverse in subject , they are yet bound together by a singular unity of spirit .

		An extended introduction traces the course of social reform during the past century , and summarizes the factors that enter into the new task of social hygiene .

		Believing , as every eugenist must , that the destiny of the race rests with woman , and that '' the most vital problem before our civilization to-day is the problem of motherhood , '' Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	naturally gives the foremost place in his volume to a detailed consideration of the part women will have to bear in social hygiene .

		In three chapters , constituting nearly a fourth of the en - tire book , he discusses '' The Changing Status of Women , '' `` The New Aspect of the Woman 's Movement , '' and `` The Emancipation of Women in Relation to Romantic - Love . ''

		While criti - cizing unsparingly the follies and mistakes that have characterized the suffrage movement in
England	LOCATION	, he yet affirms that the success of the cause is essential to a realization of our highest social aspirations .

		But the enforcing of woman 's claims as a human being rather than as a woman is to him only half the task of the woman 's move - ment , and perhaps not the most essential half . ''

		The full fruition of that movement means that women ... shall take their proper share in legislation for life , not as mere sexless human beings , but as women , and in accordance with the essential laws of their own nature as women . ''

		The following chapter , entitled '' The
Signi	PERSON	- ficance of a Falling Birth-Rate , '' deals with a subject familiar to us in
America	LOCATION	under the flashy designation of '' race-suicide . ''

		It is a subject which , as Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	says , has been usually left '' to the ignorant preachers of the gospel of brute force , would-be patriots who desire their own country to increase at the cost of all other countries , not merely in ignorance of the fact that the crude birth-rate is not the index of increase , but reckless of the effect their desire , if fulfilled , would have upon all the higher and finer ends of living . ''

		With con - vincing logic , reinforced at every turn by the statistics and conclusions of unimpeachable authorities , Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	proves that a falling birth - rate , instead of indicating degeneration and dis - aster , is in reality one of the most propitious signs of social progress , one of the most reassur - ing evidences of '' that calculated forethought , that deliberate self-restraint for the attainment of ever more manifold ends , which in its outcome we term ' civilization . ' '' ''

		< Increase and multiply , ' was the legendary injunc - tion uttered on the threshold of an empty world .

		It is singularly out of place in an age in which the earth and the sea , if not indeed the very air , swarin with countless myriads of undistinguished and indistinguishable human creatures , until the beauty of the world is befouled and the glory of the Heavens bedimmed .

		To stem back that tide is the task now imposed on our heroism , to elevate and purify and refine the race , to introduce the ideal of quality in place of the ideal of quantity which has run riot so long , with the results we see . ''

		THE DIAL 289 In '' Eugenics and Love '' and '' The Problem of Sexual Hygiene '' are considered some of the more specific features of the eugenic pro- gramme .

		The problem of sexual hygiene seems to Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	largely the problem of sexual en - lightenment for the young .

		It is pointed out that the greatest difficulty and danger in such enlightenment lie in the fact that those whom we most depend upon as teachers are themselves untaught .

		But notwithstanding this and other serious obstacles , sexual hygiene must be under - taken , and it will , `` if wisely carried out , effect far more for public morals than all the legisla - tion in the world . ''

		There is no more valuable chapter in the vol - ume than that on `` Immorality and the Law . ''

		Americans , particularly , are prone to believe in legislative short-cuts to the kingdom of heaven .

		But it is a matter of almost universal experience that attempts at moralization by law not only fail dismally to cure the evils aimed at , but actually tend to dignify and fortify those evils , and often result in furthering other evils far worse than those attacked .

		The spiritual evil of immorality , Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	tells us , can never be suppressed by physical means , only by oppos - ing spiritual force to spiritual force may vic - tory be hoped for .

		In the moral sphere , `` the generalizing hand of law can only injure and stain . ''

		A masterly statement of the forces now work - ing for international peace is contained in the chapter entitled , '' The War against War . ''

		It is doubtful if a more sane and searching analysis of the subject was ever before given in the same limited space .

		Throwing sentimentalism over - board at the outset by stating that `` the influ - ence of the
Religion of Peace	ORGANIZATION	has in this matter been less than nil , '' Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	goes on to sum - marize the various social and economic factors that are now warring so powerfully against war , and which are bound to triumph in the end .

		`` The only question that remains and it is a question the future alone will solve is the particular point at which this ancient and overgrown stronghold of war , now being invested so vigorously from so many sides , will finally be overthrown , whether from within or from without , whether by its own inherent weakness , by the persuasive reasonableness of developing civilization , by the self-interest of the commercial and financial classes , or by the ruthless indignation of the proletariat .

		That is a problem still insoluble , but it is not impossible that some already living may witness its solution . ''

		Such subjects as `` Religion and the Child '' and `` The Problem of an International Lan - guage '' will seem at first blush rather unrelated to the general theme of the book .

		Yet in reality they bear a close connection . ''

		Social Hygiene renders education a far larger and more delicate task than it has ever been before '' ; and `` the organization of international methods of social intercourse between peoples of different tongues and unlike traditions '' is one of `` the tasks , difficult but imperative , which
Social Hygiene	ORGANIZATION	presents and the course of modern civilization renders insistent . ''

		The old controversy between Individualism and Socialism is dealt with in the final chapter .

		After clearly and fairly stating the case for each camp , Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	concludes that not only are both absolutely right , but that in reality they are scarcely opposed . ''

		We have only to remember that the field of each is distinct .

		No one needs Individualism in his water supply , and no one needs Socialism in his religion . ''

		Each is complementary and indispensable to the other . ''

		We socialize what we call our physical life in order that we may attain greater freedom for what we call our spiritual life . ''

		Thus the divergencies of the two schools are essential to the purposes of social hygiene . ''

		The separate initiative and promulgation of the two tendencies encourages a much more effective action , and best promotes that final harmony of the two extremes which the finest human development needs . ''

		The foregoing is but a feeble summary of Mr.
Ellis	PERSON	's volume , but it may serve to indicate something of the scope and significance and value of the book 's substance .

		Of its splendid spirit , its sanity and insight , its liberality and flexibility of thought , its large sympathy , its comprehensive scientific and philosophical groundwork , its masterly interpretation of the past as a basis for speculations about the future , its convincing reasonableness , of all this we can give no adequate notion here , but must leave for the reader himself to discover and enjoy .

		It is an inspiring and reassuring volume , which deserves not one but several readings from everyone who takes anything more than a pre - datory interest in the social organism .

		More than any other book that we know of , it arouses in the reader an enthusiastic faith that the world may yet see a realization of the prayer of
Paracelsus	ORGANIZATION	: `` Make no more giants , God , But elevate the race at once !

		We ask To put forth just our strength , our human strength , All starting fairly , all equipped alike , Gifted alike , all eagle-eyed , true-hearted See if we can not beat thine angels yet ! ''

		290 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, MARK TWAIN .

		* `` When I was younger , '' said
Mark Twain	PERSON	in later life , '' I could remember anything , whether it happened or not ; but I am getting old , and soon I shall remember only the latter . ''

		Hence the need of a more accurate and de - tailed account of his life than is furnished in the autobiographical chapters he himself wrote in his last years for the benefit of posterity .

		This need has been met by the elaborate three - volume biography prepared with infinite care by his au - thorized biographer , Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	, who has devoted six years to the work , journey - ing half-way around the world to trace the great humorist 's footsteps and visit the haunts fre - quented by him in different lands , and for four years of the six living in close daily intercourse with him .

		The result is a book so filled with the spirit of
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	as to vie in interest with his own works and to furnish an extent and variety of entertainment hardly to be found in any other recent biography .

		It is certainly one of the notable books of its class .

		It was over the billiard-table that our
Boswell	PERSON	became best acquainted with his
Johnson	PERSON	; here , as he says , `` the disparity of ages no longer existed , other discrepancies no longer mattered .

		The pleasant land of play is a democracy where such things do not count . ''

		And further : `` To recall all the humors and interesting happenings of those early billiard-days would be to fill a large vol - ume .

		I can preserve no more than a few characteristic phases . ''

		He was not an even-tempered player .

		When the balls were perverse in their movements and his aim un - steady , he was likely to become short with his opponents critical and even fault-finding .

		Then presently a reaction would set in , and he would be seized with remorse .

		He would become unnecessarily gentle and kindly even attentive placing the balls as I knocked them into the pockets , hurrying from one end of the table to render this service , endeavoring to show in every way except by actual confession in words that he was sorry for what seemed to him , no doubt , an unworthy display of temper , unjustified irritation . ''

		Naturally this was a mood that I enjoyed less than that which had induced it .

		I did not wish him to humble himself ; I was willing that he should be severe , even harsh , if he felt so inclined ; his age , his position , his genius entitled him to special privileges ; yet I am glad , as I remember it now , that the other side revealed itself , for it completes the sum of his great humanity . ''

		Indeed , he was always not only human , but super - human ; not only a man , but superman .

		Nor does this term apply only to his psychology .

		being have I ever seen such physical endurance .

		I was comparatively a young man , and by no means an invalid ; but many a time , far in the night , when i was ready to drop with exhaustion , he was still as fresh and buoyant and eager for the game as at the moment of beginning .

		He smoked and smoked continually , and followed the endless track around the billiard-table with the light step of youth .

		At three or four o'clock in the morning he would urge just one more game , and would taunt me for my weariness . ''

		This intimate personal relation between the two it was worth while to illustrate even by a somewhat extended quotation .

		To the biog - rapher '' the association was invaluable ; it drew from him a thousand long-forgotten incidents ; it invited a stream of picturesque comments and philosophies ; it furnished the most intimate insight into his character . ''

		It has been said by those who knew
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	well that the culmination of his genius was reached only in these unpremeditated bursts of oral discourse , as splendid in their combination of imagery and poetry and philosophy , of humor and pathos and deep human feeling , as they were impossible to reproduce afterward on paper .

		This rich hu - manity of the man his biographer has fully recognized and has , to a marked degree , put into the pages that picture his life .

		The main outlines of
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's life - history are by this time known to all the world , and need not here be sketched .

		Space can better be utilized in conveying , by allusion and quotation , some idea of the wealth of variously interesting matter that goes to fill Mr.
Paine	PERSON	's three ample volumes .

		Some specimen chapters have already seen the light , in serial publication , but they hardly skim even the cream of the work as a whole .

		In the flashes of light thrown by the biographer 's pen on certain less familiar sides of the many-sided humorist and philoso - pher , one can not fail to note his emphatic likes and dislikes in literature .

		That this master of luminous prose should have kindled with enthu - siasm over the tortuous poetry of
Browning	PERSON	is rather surprising ; but having accepted the f act , , one is prepared to hear that he was equally fond of
Meredith	LOCATION	, when , disappointing expectation again , he shows himself quite the reverse .

		The Meredithian characters were to him ingeniously contrived puppets , not human beings ; and when `` Diana of the Crossways '' was read aloud to him he was likely to say : `` It does n't seem to me that
Diana	PERSON	lives up to her reputation .

		The author keeps telling us how smart she is , how brilliant , but I never seem to hear her say anything smart or brilliant .

		Read me some of
Diana	ORGANIZATION	's smart utterances . ''

		Most noteworthy

		THE DIAL 291 and most surprising of all was his passionate embrace of the Baconian craze .

		One would sup - pose that the barefoot scapegrace of those early
Missouri	LOCATION	days which he has so well depicted in `` Tom Sawyer '' would have been the last to deny , on coming into his own , the possibility of the
Stratford	LOCATION	poacher 's developing into a great poet and dramatist .

		And yet , in conversation with Mr.
Paine	PERSON	he declared that
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	could not have written the plays bearing his name . ''

		There 's evidence that he could n't , '' he said .

		`` It required a man with the fullest legal equipment to have written them .

		When you have read
Greenwood	ORGANIZATION	's book you will see how untenable is any argument for
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's authorship . ''

		But we have
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's little volume , `` Is Shakespeare Dead ? ''

		and it is enough to enjoy the literary charm of it without puzzling further over the reason of its author 's heresy .

		Let us pass to things more truly char - acteristic of the man .

		Here is a letter writ - ten by him to his lecture-manager ,
Redpath	PERSON	, in the days when the author of '' The Innocents Abroad '' was achieving his first great popularity as a public entertainer on the platform : '' DEAR RED , I am different from other women ; my mind changes oftener .

		People who have no mind can easily be steadfast and firm , but when a man is loaded down to the guards with it , as I am , every heavy sea of foreboding or inclination , maybe of indolence , shifts the cargo .

		See ?

		Therefore , if you will notice , one week I am likely to give rigid instructions to confine me to
New England	LOCATION	; the next week send me to
Arizona	LOCATION	; the next week withdraw my name ; the next week give you full , untrammeled swing ; and the week following modify it .

		You must try to keep the run of my mind ,
Redpath	PERSON	; it is your business , being the agent , and it was always too many for me ... Yours , MARK . ''

		The interesting though somewhat distressing story of
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's stupefying oratorical effort at the
Whittier	LOCATION	dinner in
Boston	LOCATION	,
Decem	PERSON	- ber 17 ,
1877	DATE	, is told more fully than it has ever been told before , with letters to and from the chief actors in that little tragedy or tragi - comedy , as at this distance of time we can regard it .

		The good humor shown and evidently felt by the Olympian trinity whom the tactless speech was supposed to have affronted helped to rescue the penitent speaker from despair .

		It appears , also , that the most revered of that trinity ,
Emerson	LOCATION	, failed to take in a single syl - lable of the speech , having lapsed temporarily into that happy oblivion which more and more held him in unconsciousness of outer happen - ings toward the end of his life .

		A kind letter from his daughter
Ellen	PERSON	to Mrs.
Clemens	PERSON	, in in - direct response to one from
Clemens	PERSON	to
Emerson	LOCATION	, is made public in the book .

		It must have greatly soothed the whole family .

		Concerning the un - fortunate speech itself and
Mark Twain	PERSON	's later alternating opinions of it , Mr.
Paine	PERSON	well says : '' Of course the first of these impressions , the verdict of the fresh mind uninfluenced by the old conception , was the more correct one .

		The speech was decidedly out of place in that company .

		The skit was harmless enough , but it was of the Comstock grain .

		It lacked refinement , and , what was still worse , it lacked humor , at least the humor of a kind suited to that long-ago company of listeners .

		It was another of those grievous mistakes which genius -LRB- and not talent -RRB- can make , for genius is assort of possession .

		.

		The individual is per - vaded , dominated for a time by an angel or an imp , and he seldom , of himself , is able to discriminate between his controls .

		A literary imp was always lying in wait for Mark Twain ; the imp of the burlesque , tempting him to do the outre , the outlandish , the shocking thing .

		It was this that
Olivia Clemens	PERSON	had to labor hardest against : the cheapening of his own high purpose with an extravagant false note , at which sincerity , conviction , and artistic harmony took wings and fled away .

		Notably he did a good burlesque now and then , but his fame would not have suffered if he had been delivered alto - gether from his besetting temptations . ''

		The debt that both his public and his fame owe to his faithful censor , Mrs.
Clemens	PERSON	, is lar - ger than many persons have ever suspected .

		The piles of manuscript that he uncomplainingly threw aside at her bidding , must have far ex - ceeded in bulk those other piles that went to the printer and contributed to the world 's lasting entertainment .

		One other brief selection from the biographer 's few critical comments on
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's books is worth giving to call renewed attention to that exquisite creation of the author 's finer genius , the nobly conceived ''
Joan	PERSON	of Arc . '' ''

		But this is just the wonder of
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's
Joan	PERSON	.

		She is a saint ; she is rare , she is exquisite , she is all that is lovely , and she is a human being besides .

		Considered from every point of view ,
Joan	PERSON	of Arc is
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's supreme literary expression , the loftiest , the most deli - cate , the most luminous example of his work .

		It is so from the first word of its beginning , that wonderful ' Translator 's Preface , ' to the last word of the last chap - ter , where he declares that the figure of
Joan	PERSON	with the martyr 's crown upon her head shall stand for patriotism through all time . ''

		The drama of the strange and yet always intensely real and human life unrolled in Mr.
Paine	PERSON	's three volumes must be read as a con - nected whole to be best enjoyed .

		Snatches and fragments seem to do it injustice .

		Yet it may be not out of place here to quote from the author 's own account of his memorable meeting with the subject of his book when the writing of that book was first proposed to him .

		The occasion was a dinner given to
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	.

		`` The night of
January 5 , 1906	DATE	, remains a memory apart from other dinners .


Brander Matthews	PERSON	presided , 292 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, and
Gilder	PERSON	was there , and
Frank Millet	PERSON	and
Willard Metcalf	PERSON	and
Robert Reid	PERSON	, and a score of others ; some of them are dead now ,
David Munro	PERSON	among them .

		It so happened that my seat was nearly facing the guest of the evening , who , by custom of The Players , is placed at the side and not at the end of the long table .

		He was no longer frail and thin , as when I had first met him .

		He had a robust , rested look ; his complexion had the tints of a miniature painting .

		Lit by the glow of the shaded candles , relieved against the dusky richness of the walls , he made a picture of striking beauty .

		One could not take his eyes from it , and to one guest at least it stirred the farthest memories .

		I suddenly saw the interior of a farm-house sitting-room in the
Middle West	LOCATION	, where I had first heard uttered the name of
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	, and where
night after night	TIME	a group gathered around the evening lamp to hear the tale of the first pilgrimage , which , to a boy of eight , had seemed only a wonderful poem and fairy tale .

		To
Charles Harvey Genung	PERSON	, who sat next to me , I whis - pered something of this , and how , during the thirty-six years since then , no other human being to me had meant what
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	had meant in literature , in life , in the ineffable thing which means more than either , and which we call ' inspiration , ' for lack of a truer word .

		Now here he was , just across the table .

		It was the fairy tale come true .


Genung	PERSON	said : ` You should write his life . ' ''

		And so in the end it came about that this writer from the
Middle West	LOCATION	wrote the life of that other writer from the
Middle West	LOCATION	, and he has written it so fully and satisfactorily that no one need in the future go over the same ground again .

		Mark Twain will of course con - tinue to be written about and talked about , and his books will form the subjects of critical comment and expert appreciation , to which the present biography happily does not pretend to devote itself ; but the authoritative life of the great humorist has been written , and in a way to insure a reading hardly less wide than that which
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's own books receive .

		In wealth of illustration and other details of its make-up , the book will not disappoint .


PERCY F. BICKNELL	PERSON	.

		ENGLAND AND THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION .

		* Among the many English men of affairs who have found time and leisure to satisfy a passion for historic research , Sir
George Otto Trevelyan	PERSON	holds an honored place .

		Sir
George	PERSON	was for many years an influential member of
Parliament	ORGANIZATION	.

		He has also held ministerial offices of high rank , and was at one time a leader in the councils of the Liberal party .

		When the * GEORGE THE THIRD AND CHARLES JAMES Fox .

George Otto Trevelyan	PERSON	,
Bart.	LOCATION	,

		In two volumes .

		Volume I.
New York	LOCATION	: Longmans ,
Green , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		party split in
1886	DATE	on the question of Irish home rule , Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	was one of the chiefs among the Liberal - Unionist seceders .

		Since then he has gradually withdrawn from public activities and has given his time to literary pursuits , especially to the study of history in the eighteenth century .

		In our own country he is , perhaps , best known as the author of a history of the Amer - ican Revolution , three volumes of which have appeared under that title .

		But still earlier , as long ago as
1880	DATE	, he had published `` The Early History of
Charles James Fox	PERSON	. ''

		He now gives us a continuation of both these ventures in a work entitled '' George the Third and
Charles James Fox	PERSON	. ''

		It is planned to publish this in two volumes , the first of which has appeared .

		It happens frequently that a title does not accurately describe the contents of a book , and such is the case in the present instance .

		Fox is not unusually prominent in the narrative ; his relationship with
George III	PERSON	.

		is discussed only incidentally ; and the American Revolution is - only one of the many subjects discussed .

		The volume is a military and political history of
England	LOCATION	during the years
1778	DATE	to
1780	DATE	, a period when
England	LOCATION	stood alone against nearly all
Europe	LOCATION	, facing hostility , active or passive , , commercial or military , almost everywhere .

		The author 's position with respect to the war in
America	LOCATION	is well known : the fight for self - government in
England	LOCATION	was won in
America	LOCATION	; the system of personal government that
George III	PERSON	.

		strove to fasten upon the English nation was discredited by his failure to conquer the Americans and his purposes were defeated - The effort to coerce the colonies was not only unwise but unjust , and the government should not have forced matters to the issue of war .

		But after hostilities had become a fact , the war should have been fought in a different spirit .

		It was carried on by a group of corrupt and incapable men whose inefficiency and stupid carelessness stir the author almost to the point of anger .

		Especially does he find incompetence in the admiralty ; and as a former secretary in that department , Sir
George	PERSON	must be presumed to know what an efficient management of the
navy	ORGANIZATION	should imply .

		Lord Sandwich is charac - terized as `` the most negligent administrator who ever sat at the head of the table in the admiralty Board-room . '' ''

		When
Keppel	ORGANIZATION	's mes - senger arrived in the
last days of June of 1778	DATE	, bringing the momentous intelligence that the British fleet had retired from before
Brest	LOCATION	and had got back to
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, neither the
First 1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 293 Lord nor the Secretary of the Admiralty could be found to unseal the dispatches . ''

		And this was in a department where watchfulness never ceases , and sleep is almost unknown .

		Against this negligence and corruption
Charles James Fox	PERSON	raised his voice again and again , and a marvellously effective voice it was .

		The picture that is given of the mighty debater is sympathetic in every line .

		Fox was no longer the young profligate ; the period of his reforma - tion had begun . ''

		He ceased to gamble .

		He lived contented within his slender means .

		His home-life with the woman whom he loved ... was admired by his uncensorious contemporaries as a model of domestic affection , and mutual sympathy in the insatiable enjoyment of good literature and quiet rural pleasures .

		Nothing at last remained of the old
Charles James Fox	PERSON	except the frankness and friendliness , the inexhaustible good na - ture , the indescribable charm of manner , and the utter absence of self-importance and self-consciousness , which combined to make him , at every period of his existence , the best fellow in the world . ''

		The author also describes the great triumphs of Fox in the
House of Commons	ORGANIZATION	; but they were personal triumphs and meant little for the cause that he represented , for the majority had sold its conscience to the king .

		Of the
Earl of Chatham	LOCATION	we have the conven - tional picture .

		In the intellectual make-up of
George III.	PERSON	, the author finds a few admirable qualities , but very few .

		Much attention is given to the king 's absolutist ideas and to the venal methods that he employed to secure his author - ity .

		For
Burke	PERSON	, Sir
George	PERSON	professes the great - est admiration . ''

		So full and cultured a mind as
Burke	PERSON	's , so vivid an imagination and so intense and catholic an interest in all human affairs , past and present , have never been placed at the service of the state by anyone ex - cept
Cicero	PERSON	. ''

		The author also bears testimony to the abilities of Admiral
Howe	PERSON	and by way of contrast to the incompetence of the French ad - mirals , particularly D'Estaing .

		But the only man whose greatness was unalloyed , whose deeds were above criticism , was
George Washington	LOCATION	.

		The closing chapter in the volume , in which is discussed the treason of
Arnold	LOCATION	and the death of
Andre	LOCATION	, is one of great interest .

		Without showing any sympathy for the traitor , Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	fully appreciates
Benedict Arnold	PERSON	's great abilities in the field , and has hard words for the
American Congress	ORGANIZATION	which unjustly wounded the general 's over-sensitive pride and thus strengthened him in his disloyal purposes .

		Full justice is done to the traitor 's estimable and innocent wife . ''

		Arnold was the waster ; and his wife , during a hard and life-long struggle with adversity , showed herself a notable saver and manager for the protection of her hus - band 's financial credit , and of her children 's future .

		And the beginning and end of
Margaret Arnold	PERSON	's reputed dis - affection to the American cause was that as a girl she had danced minuets with royal officers , and that as a married woman she had refused to exclude from her ball-room the wives and daughters of Loyalists and Tories . ''

		The importance of
Arnold	LOCATION	's defection , for the American cause , is clearly brought out . ''

		The revelation of
Arnold	LOCATION	's treachery created a power - ful and lasting reaction in American opinion . ''

		The results were not despair but horror , indig - nation , and patriotic fervor .

		The author is also careful to bring out the fact that while Arnold after the war apparently enjoyed the favor of the English court , ''
London	LOCATION	society set its face sternly and inexorably against him ... In poli - tical and fashionable circles he was shunned by most of the Whigs , and by many Tories . ''

		Much has been written in recent years about the American war and the conditions that gave birth to revolution ; but this literature is appar - ently unknown to the present author , at least he ignores its conclusions .

		We are , for instance , told once more that the king dismissed
Pitt	PERSON	to make room for Bute , an old view that
Von Ruville	PERSON	in his great biography of
Pitt	PERSON	has clearly shown to be erroneous .

		Mr.
Trevelyan	PERSON	can not be ignorant of the fact that recent En - glish students who look at history from the view - point of the modern imperialist have come to regard the struggle in
America	LOCATION	as the result of an effort to organize the British empire , which successful warfare had given almost magical growth ; but he seems not to have accepted these views .

		And perhaps it is too much to expect that the nephew of Lord Macaulay should accept and exploit the opinions of the imperialistic Tories .


LAURENCE M. LARSON	PERSON	.

		MAN AND CIVILIZATION .

		* It is , perhaps , by this time , a commonplace thought that we are passing through a period of social and cultural change in comparison with which the French Revolution was a simple and easily accomplished transition .

		Certainly we lack the faith and optimism with which the sanguine spirits of that day regarded their reconstructive programmes .

		In fact the more reflective spirits of to-day are apt , as they survey * MAIN CURRENTS OF MODERN THOUGHT .

		A Study of the Spiritual and Intellectual Movements of the Present Day .

		Translated from the German of
Rudolf Eucken	PERSON	, by
Meyrick Booth	PERSON	.


New York	LOCATION	:
Charles Scribner	PERSON	's Sons .

		294 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, the present course of civilization , to cry with the late
William Vaughn	PERSON	Moody : '' ... Does she know her port , Though she goes so far about ?

		Or blind astray , does she make her sport To brazen and chance it out .

		I watfhed her when her captains passed : She were better captainless .

		Men in the cabin , before the mast , But some were reckless and some aghast , And some sat gorged at mess . ''

		Such an extremity as this should be philoso - phy 's opportunity , and the extremity has come home in an unique measure to one present-day philosopher ,
Rudolf Eucken	PERSON	of
Jena	PERSON	.

		He is known to English readers already by some half dozen books , notably '' The Problem of Human Life , '' `` Life 's Basis and Life 's Ideal , '' and `` The Truth of Religion , '' all of which have very recently been translated into English , and for the writing of which the author has been awarded a Nobel Prize for Literature .

		Eucken is not a system builder , not a philosopher of the old argumentative and intellectualistic type , but a passionate and powerful preacher , a theologian in one sense , and a deeply religious spirit .

		Withal , he has the historic sense and the critical sense both highly developed .

		Consequently we may expect to find in his work valuable estima - tions of past and present tendencies , thorough destructive analyses of the attempted solutions of our world riddles and life riddles , a strenuous insistence on the rights of the spirit ; and we find all this in greater measure than any explicit and reasoned world view ready to be assimilated by the understanding of the seeker .

		The situation of human life at the present day as
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	sees it is almost as gloomy as that portrayed in
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's lines .

		He sees the ship of life advancing , indeed , but into danger - ous seas .

		The situation which he sketches is briefly as follows .

		The great scientific and technological advances of recent years have given man an unprecedented mastery over the world without .

		His experiences have been multiplied a hundred fold .

		His powers over nature have increased to the point of practical mastery .

		But that mastery has been gained at the expense of the old idea that man was central in the universe .

		The laws that he discovers are immediately seen to cover himself and his activities .

		Particularly the idea of evolution exhibits man as the product of a material environment , struggling with it and his fellows for material goods .

		Nature be - comes , in the words of Schwegler , an uuspirit - ualized mass , and an object for man only as it is subservient to his sensuous greeds and needs .

		This situation may be met in various ways .

		The most logical way , and the one which has been most energetically pushed , is the socialistic doctrine of work .

		If we accept this doctrine , '' Morality becomes altruism , a working for the good of society ; art finds no higher task than the sympathetic and accurate representation of social conditions ; education endeavors rather to elevate the general level of culture than to de - velop anything individual . ''

		But is there any reason in things for the individual willingly to allow himself thus to be used for the good of the whole , as means and not end ?

		Certainly not on the naturalistic hypothesis .

		Briefly ,
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	condemns all merely socialistic solutions of the life problem because they first in theory reduce man to an animal -LRB- not to put too fine a point upon it -RRB- and then call upon him in practice to act as a man and a `` soldier of the common good . ''

		No , the more logical way of meeting a life situation which is condemned to the realm of nature is to refuse to do other than make the best of things for one 's self .

		This position has also been pretty thoroughly exploited under various forms of aesthetic individualism .

		In this scheme of life , art is divorced from morality and made supreme .

		In this view the content of art is set aside as being irrelevant , and form is hailed as its all in all .

		But form in itself only appeals to the senses , and confers no inner free - dom . ''

		Genuine independence is to be found only when the creative work proceeds solely from an inner necessity of the artist 's own nature .

		But this can not take place unless there is some - thing to say , nay , to reveal .

		Mere virtuosity knows no such necessity . ''

		Let us glance at one more tendency of the day before passing to the constructive contribu - tion which
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	makes to the solution of the world problem .

		That tendency is the pragmatic movement which is at one with Eucken in its reaction against intellectualism , materialism , and mere aestheticism .

		Pragmatism , of course , would estimate truth by its service to humanity .

		Does the god idea seem to function well in society ?

		If it does , then a god let us have .

		In his criticism of this movement Eucken best exhibits his own position .

		With its insistence upon action as against thought as the primary concern of life ,
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	is in agreement .

		But obviously pragmatism is humanistic .

		It can not go beyond man even when it reaches out to god . ''

		When the good of the individual and humanity becomes the highest aim and the guiding principle , truth sinks to the level of a merely utilitarian opinion .

		This is destructive of inner life .

		All the power of conviction that truth can possess must disappear the moment it is
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 295 seen to be a mere means ... Finally , the chief aim and end of pragmatism the success and enrichment of human life is as an end by no means free from objection .

		By human life is here meant civilized life on the broad scale ; but in order to regard this life as so surely good , one must be inspired by the optimistic enthusiasm for human culture which was more character - istic of earlier ages than it is of our own .

		Is this life , when taken as in itself the final thing , really worth all the trouble and excitement , all the work and effort , all the sufferings and sacrifices that it costs ? ''

		Life can only be worth while , thinks
Eucken	PERSON	, if there is more in it than pragmatism can guarantee , only if the life of man be taken up into a realm of reality which transcends the human and is independent of it .

		This realm is no merely human affair , but represents a new stage in reality into which man who is , under one aspect , a being of nature , enters and thereby becomes more than a being of nature , becomes a being having his dependence on , and suste - nance from , the eternal itself .

		This is the conception which dictates
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	's stalwart individualism .

		As against those think ers who claim that man can only enter into spiri - tual life as a member of society , who claim that the emotional lift which the presence of a similarly minded and intentioned crowd gives to each member of it is at once the basis and the end of religion ,
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	holds that for the individual to lean on crowd or on
State	ORGANIZATION	is to impoverish himself .

		Eucken is not an advocate of what he calls '' mere individual freedom , '' as he has for man as a mere `` specimen of a spe - cies '' nothing but contempt .

		But the mutual relationships of individuals `` must proceed from their own personal decision and free agreement . ''

		And , `` failing this free unity the tendency is more and more for men to fall back on the State . ''

		The reason for this is `` because the individual , on account of the breaking down of traditional relationships and the thorough insecurity of his own position , yearns after some sort of firm hold , because he wishes to see his existence in some way valued and protected by the whole . ''

		And `` what shaping of human conditions will result therefrom lies for the time being in pro- found obscurity . ''

		With the cry of democracy for this security , and also for a share in culture , Eucken sympathizes , but in the ability of a democracy to operate in anything but a `` vul - garizing , shallowing , narrowing , and negating fashion '' unless it be led by strong individual - ities , themselves the fruits of spiritual culture , he has little faith .

		He sees such a democracy degenerate into a sleek , materialistic type of life which shall be destructive of all spiritual values and hence self-destructive .

		We may well admit with Eucken that human - istic culture as it exhibits itself before us to-day is nothing to boast about .

		We may agree with his denunciations of unmoral art , unspiri - tual work , and uninspired might of numbers , as means and methods of solving the problems of life .

		If we do this we must either admit hu - manity 's defeat in its struggle for spiritual ex - istence , or we must accept some such solution of the question as Eucken offers us in his idea of the independent spiritual life .

		But the reader who reaches this point in agreement with him will be disappointed with the working out of that conception itself .

		He will wander from volume to volume of
Eucken	LOCATION	's works looking for a really clear and understandable statement of this life .

		He will read that it is achievable by man but not created by him , that it is a personal inner world and yet that it is cosmic .

		The transition to it he will not be able to see .

		He will probably conclude that Eucken takes it for granted because he feels that we need it .

		But if the reader is content to give his own interpretation to
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	's phrase , and to enter rather into
Eucken	ORGANIZATION	's spirit in uttering it , he will find him not only an efficient guide to the maze of modern life but one who on the whole enables us to transcend the disillusion - ments to which he exposes us in his critique of our cultural limitations .

		BRIEFS ON NEW BOOKS .

		The lure of Written from a life-long knowledge literature from , .

		c , , - r , .

		, , .

		T < j a bookseller 's and love of the Bookselling Trade , standpoint .

		Mr.
Joseph Shaylor	PERSON	's collection of articles entitled `` The Fascination of Books , with Other Papers on Books and Bookselling '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- has a certain practical , observational , time-tested quality that commands the reader 's respectful atten - tion and gives him the comfortable feeling of having both feet always on the solid ground .

		The eighteen chapters deal with questions interesting to book - publishers , book-sellers , and book-readers alike , and are at least partly collected from leading English magazines and reviews and the `` Encyclopaedia Britannica . ''

		The glimpses that the author gives of book-publishing customs in the pre-copyright past -LRB- before
1710	DATE	-RRB- impress one with the number and magnitude of the abuses formerly flourishing for the enrichment of the unscrupulous .

		A popular writer 's name became common property , a label affixed by the bookseller at pleasure to any produc - tion in order to expedite its sale .

		The book-trade is not even yet blamelessly conducted , but its progress toward high ethical standards is seen to have been considerable .

		Mr.
Shaylor	PERSON	gives the bookseller no 296 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, mean rank .

		He says : `` Booksellers may console themselves by being classed with those who follow literature as a profession , and of whom
Froude	PERSON	has said , ' It happens to be the only occupation in which wages are not given in proportion to the goodness of the work done . ' ''

		His paper on '' Some Old Li - braries '' might at first glance mislead by its title ; it discusses , not libraries as the word is commonly understood , but certain early Victorian series of books , such as the Parlour Library , the Railway Library , the
Popular Library of Modern Authors	ORGANIZATION	, and others .

		In a timely chapter on `` The Use and Abuse of Book Titles '' the author fails to set the seal of his disapproval on that too common abuse whereby the same English or American book appears under different names on the two sides of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	a source of vexation to booksellers , as well as to librarians and others , which he doubtless deplores .

		Another cause of bewilderment to the trade is the heedless ordering of a book by the heading prefixed to a critic 's review of it an inadvertence for which Mr.
Shaylor	PERSON	does not blame the reviewer , though he regrets its frequency and the trouble and loss of time it occasions to the busy bookseller .

		A pleasing portrait of this cultured and courteous English book - connoisseur faces the title-page of his informing and entertaining volume .

		The latent Life The perennial interest which has of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's always surrounded everything per - taining to
Napoleon	PERSON	clings in no small degree to the name of his first wife , the
Empress Josephine	PERSON	, whose career was so closely bound up with his down to 1810 , the year of their divorce .

		The latest narrative of her life is from the pen of Baron de Me * neval , published in an English translation by Messrs.
Lippincott	PERSON	.

		It curiously pur - ports to be an `` autobiography , '' and the publishers ' announcement states that `` the author has set him - self the task of justifying , by means of authentic documents in his possession , the evidences of respect and esteem rendered to the memory of the
Empress Josephine	ORGANIZATION	by the Duke of Reichstadt '' -LRB-
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	's son by
Marie Louise	PERSON	of
Austria	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		Notwithstanding the fact that
Mdneval	ORGANIZATION	's sources include many letters and other documents hitherto unpublished , it can not be said that he has greatly increased the store of information already available and utilized in such popular sketches as those by Miss
Ida Tarbell	PERSON	and Miss
Harriet A. Guerber	PERSON	, and especially in the standard Life of Josephine by Aubenas -LRB- 1859 -RRB- .

		These facts , however , he has re-assembled and added to ; and from them he has painted a pleasing picture of the graceful and affectionate woman who held for so long the heart of the world 's conqueror .

		He admits her extravagance and her occasional indis - cretions ; but he gives her the benefit of every doubt , and reserves his invectives , naturally enough , for
Marie Louise	PERSON	, who supplanted her , and for
Fouch	PERSON	^ , the treacherous minister of police , who probably deserves all the odium that has been heaped upon him .

		Napoleon is treated with great consideration and respect , and is deprived of none of the halo with which most Frenchmen have invested him .

		The English version , by Mr.
D. D. Fraser	PERSON	, is gener - ally smooth and idiomatic ; but the proof-reading has been , in some places , very carelessly done .

		`` Anti- podes , '' on page 18 , should probably be '' Antilles '' ; and some especially unfortunate slips are found in the first two sentences of the book , in which the heroine is twice referred to by the masculine pro- noun , and
Louis XVI	PERSON	.

		is made to do duty for his predecessor .

		_ Some Salem days when the old wooden ship-owners of whalers and merchantmen are be - the olden time , coming more and more of a rarity in our
New England	LOCATION	ports , such a book as Mr.
Robert E. Peabody	PERSON	's `` Merchant Venturers of Old Salem '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- serves as a welcome reminder of that vanished era of American ship-building and ocean-voyaging before the whole habitable globe and navigable sea had been made an open and familiar book to every school-boy .

		In his volume , which is described in its sub-title as '' A History of the Com - mercial Voyages of a
New England	LOCATION	Family to the Indies and Elsewhere in the XVIII Century , '' the author traces the business fortunes of the historic Derby family of Salem , and incidentally brings in other shipmasters and navigators , notably Captain
Nathaniel Silsbee	PERSON	,
Nathaniel Bowditch	PERSON	, and
Richard Cleveland	PERSON	, grandfather of President
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		It was
Elias Hasket Derby	PERSON	who raised the family name to preeminence in Salem by his mastery of the busi - ness of ocean trading , and a picture of the mansion he built for the enjoyment of his later opulent years , after the vexations and losses of Revolutionary times were well in the past , shows him to have been a grandee of more than parochial prominence .

		Atten - tion is called , in the closing pages , to the debt which our country 's growth and prosperity owe to these early ship-owners who pushed their commerce into all parts of the world and made the new nation widely known and respected .

		A still greater debt , it might have been added , do we owe these enter - prising traders for the new thought and wider out - look which they brought into the narrow intellectual life of Puritan
New England	LOCATION	a stimulus that had a direct bearing on the educational and religious development of that corner of our country .

		Mr.
Peabody	PERSON	's preface is written at
Marblehead	LOCATION	, and from this and other indications the book appears to have come into being in the very atmosphere of those traditions it so agreeably hands down to future readers .

		Its portraits and other illustrations are of peculiar interest .

		_ A Nietzschean D r .

		Q. T. Wrench , a
London	LOCATION	physi - S5Kf cian , in a large book of over five hun - in government , dred pages entitled `` The Mastery of Life '' -LRB- Kennerley -RRB- has written a '' review of the history of civilization '' with the aim of showing that the conditions under which man has always shown the most positive attitude toward life have always been the conditions of paternalism -LRB- which word with
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 297 Dr. Wrench is synonymous with Nietzschean aristoc - racy -RRB- , and that democracy is a perversion of the civilized mind from which the consciousness of all our men who are fitted to rule must he purged before further progress or rather before any progress can be made .

		Dr. Wrench first gives reviews of the histories and social psychologies of
Egypt	LOCATION	,
Greece	LOCATION	,
Rome	LOCATION	, the Romanesque period , Gothic influences ,
Germany	LOCATION	and
England	LOCATION	, the
Renaissance	ORGANIZATION	, the Roman Renaissance , and Dutch and Saxon Art .

		Presum - ably , in these historic sketches , the author resists any temptation to be guided in his necessarily partial selection of facts and aspects by his preconceived thesis .

		Coming down to later times , he character - izes our progress since the industrial revolution of the early nineteenth century as a '' Gadarene prog - ress '' and devotes a chapter to showing it up as such .

		In many ways , it has been just that ; but unfor - tunately Dr. Wrench seems unable to separate the Gadarene from the divine elements in this imme - diately past and contemporary drama .

		Pragmatism , for instance , he attacks as a '' dollar philosophy , '' and he accuses Professor
James	PERSON	of `` naively '' saying that every idea has a dollar value .

		Of course ,
James	PERSON	never said this , and the expression he did use , '' cash value , '' was very carefully guarded and explicitly limited to values which were of the spirit .

		The fact that so much of Dr. Wrench 's indictment of democ - racy is true , is simply due to the fact that the in - dustrial revolution threw the government of things into the people 's hands before any system of philos - ophy had succeeded in giving us a new set of moral values .

		To turn away from democracy at this date , and especially to turn to a crude interpretation of what
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	may or may not have meant for
Nietzsche	PERSON	was a mystic who spoke in parables is impossible .

		The hope of the future lies in clearly thinking out the problems of democracy and embrac - ing them in a consistent world-view which will again exhibit moral values in a supreme light .

		This , of course , is just what Dr. Wrench tries to do , except that he begins by denying democracy .

		Pragmatism , on the other hand , is an attempt to do this , by medi - ating spiritual values to democracy .

		If this can be done democracy is safe .

		But if there is no basis in reality for spiritual values but only merely subjective and aesthetic base , then we are not sure but that Dr. Wrench has made good his case against democracy .

		But in this latter case , his criterion of aristocracy , abjuring as it does mere fitness to survive as being a criterion of good , may be found difficult to establish .

		An English outline of German literature .

		When Professor
J. G. Robertson	PERSON	con - densed his '' History of German Lit - erature '' -LRB-
Blackwood	ORGANIZATION	,
1902	DATE	-RRB- of fifty chapters and 635 pages into the present '' Outlines of the History of German Literature '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- of twenty-five chapters and 320 pages , he gave irre - futable testimony to the wisdom of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's verse : `` In der Beschrankung zeigt sich erst der Meister . ''

		The index of the original work tabulates eight hun - dred proper names and 260 topics and authorless works ; that of the abridgment tabulates five hun - dred of the former and 160 of the latter .

		But Professor
Robertson	PERSON	has not simply deleted ; he has rearranged , abridged his remarks on the great writers , omitted some of the lesser ones entirely , eliminated quotations and notes , added chronological tables of important events and works from the consecration of Wulfilas as Bishop of the Visigoths -LRB- 341 -RRB- to the death of Nietzsche -LRB-
1900	DATE	-RRB- , and , what is very pleasing to the reader , completely reworded the whole .

		The tables , to be sure , add but little to those of Professor
Nollen	PERSON	in the `` Lake German Series , '' but their connection with the preceding text greatly increases their value .

		Barring a few instances of incorrect syllabification at the end of lines -LRB- pages 244 , 251 , 256 -RRB- , there are no faith - shaking misprints .

		The book abounds in first in - stances and superlatives : '' Ludwigslied '' -LRB- 881 -RRB- is the first German ballad , `` Ruodlieb '' -LRB- 1030 -RRB- the first German romance ,
Dietmar von Aist	PERSON	has given us the first German '' Tagelied '' ; '' Der arme
Hein	PERSON	- rich `` is one of the most charming idylls in mediaeval literature ,
Gyburg	PERSON	is the finest of all
Wolfram	PERSON	's women ,
Murner	PERSON	is the most unscrupulous satirist in the whole range of German literature ,
Annette von Droste	PERSON	has written the finest German religious poetry of the nineteenth century ,
Nietzsche	PERSON	was the most gifted writer of the last generation , and so on through a very long list .

		The recapitulations and transitions are presented with really artistic skill .

		The language , generally clear , is at times queer , there are readers who do not like such expressions as `` led to them being considered . ''

		The critical opinions are , on the whole , the result of sympathetic scholarship .

		In a tone of simple sincerity that holds the attention from the start , the author of '' One of the Multitude '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- tells the story of his painful struggle upward from slum life in
East-End London	LOCATION	to respectability and comparative prosperity .

		Absolute truth in every detail except proper names is vouched for by the writer , who calls himself
George Acorn	PERSON	, and by his literary sponsor , Mr.
Arthur Christopher Benson	PERSON	, who contributes a thoughtful introduction touching on some of the social problems suggested by the nar - rative .

		It is just such a heart-stirring and thought - evoking chronicle as that with which Mr.
George Meek	PERSON	, under the sponsorship of Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	, arrested the attention of the English-reading world two years ago .

		The confessions of a cockney
Owen Kildare	PERSON	, the publishers not unfitly call the book , '' a human document that compels attention from its grim fidelity to the life it describes . ''

		The wonder of it all is that one born and reared amid such de - grading surroundings could have not only conceived the possibility of things so much higher and better , but remained true to that early vision until it began to assume some sort of blessed reality .

		The heart - breaking struggle to attain to this reality is told with Up front , the slums .

		298 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	, an unconscious art that makes the book a veritable work of literature .

		A high ideal , a firm will , and a sense of humor seem to have been important factors in the ultimate working-out of the writer 's salvation through his own independent efforts .

		Much also he must have owed to his love of reading :
Dickens	PERSON	and
George Eliot	PERSON	he especially mentions among those whose books furnished him a refuge from the hate - ful realities of his material environment .

		Cabinet - making , chosen by him as his trade in early youth and followed with industry and skill , was the ladder by which he climbed at last to the possession of a pleasant home and family , with cheering hopes for the future .

		Again we have illustrated in this unpre - tentious history the familiar truth that no human life , if faithfully related , can prove devoid of very real and living interest .

		A treatise on The presentation of comparative Comparative anatomy is a task demanding an Anatomy .

		extensive and lucid terminology of technical terms , great skill in graphic presentation of the complicated structural interrelations of parts , and a logical marshalling of the seemingly endless array of data so that the reader is conscious of his progress through the subject .

		These requirements of a clear-cut terminology , of illustrations which really portray relations , and of logical presentation characterize Professor
J. S. Kingsley	PERSON	's `` Compara - tive Anatomy of Vertebrates '' -LRB- Blakiston -RRB- .

		The illustrations are unusually numerous , clear , and well - labelled ; they are mainly original , and specially devised to illustrate the text .

		Many stereograms are employed , with excellent results , to express in contour the relations of organs .

		A little more ac - cent and contrast , bolder utilization of heavy lines , and more care in the use of the blender upon shaded surfaces would have greatly improved some of these otherwise excellent drawings .

		The author pays especial attention to the vertebrate skull , an excel - lent motif horn the standpoint either of comparative anatomy or of pedagogy .

		The use of bold-face type for technical terms will greatly enhance the value of the book as a work of reference , as will also the exceptionally complete index and extensive bibli - ography .

		The volume is a welcome and excellent addition to the list of American biological text-books and works of reference .

		American ^ ne reniar k of
M. Carnot	PERSON	, late Pres - assodations ident of the French Republic , that in
Paris	LOCATION	.

		Chaque homme a deux pays , le sein et la
France	LOCATION	, '' indicates a frame of mind which is very general and which has given rise to a multitude of books dealing with things French .

		Some of these volumes have been solid contributions to the subject , some have been entertaining , some have been both solid and entertaining ; but Mr.
John Joseph Con	PERSON	- way 's '' Footprints of Famous Americans in
Paris	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Lane -RRB- is , candidly , neither the one nor the other .

		One derives the impression that a host of Americans have left traces in
Paris	LOCATION	, but that they made no foot - prints distinct enough to be worth recording in a sumptuously bound , printed , and illustrated volume .

		A painstaking search among standard biographies and a few somewhat more esoteric sources reveals little that is significant or even diverting , Love affairs , when Americans were so obliging as to in - volve themselves in more or less harmless liaisons , are utilized to the full ; so are the bristling idiosyn - cracies of
Whistler	LOCATION	.

		But .

		in general , distinguished Americans seem to have gone soberly about their business in
Paris	LOCATION	, and there is consequently little material for the book .

		As a result , the author is driven to include not only divers Americans who are so far from famous that a normally intelligent reader has never heard of them , but such '' Americans '' as
Tom Paine	PERSON	and La Fayette , who are lugged in willy - nilly .

		Moreover , even when the man under consider - ation is undeniably famous and an American , the writing is often irrelevant , as when we are told that
Longfellow	PERSON	died of peritonitis in
Craigie House	ORGANIZATION	,
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		Irrelevancies and small talk abound , varied by pages of quotation , or by passages of dull record and unsavory anecdote .

		The book can not be called a contribution to anything ; nor is it interest - ing , save in the sense that a vaudeville performance is interesting .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

		The attempt to reinstate the lore , or resurrect the lure , of an earlier or a foreign mysticism in the language or the thought or the environment of a modern time and clime is a vain and not wholly innocent pursuit .

		This is particularly the case with such a work as Dr.
Rudolf Steiner	PERSON	's `` The Gates of Knowledge '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- .

		The '' gates '' seem futile either to exclude or to inclose , for the admittance is to a realm of subjective vacuity , with stage directions that but emphasize the unreality .

		To what manner of stranded soul or detached spirit such immersion in an artificial compound of the volatile deposits of occult procedures brings satisfaction or con - viction , it is difficult to conjecture .

		Nevertheless , that those who like it take to it is evident to the esoteric as well as to the practical mind .

		It is strange that we bave had to wait so long for an American edition of Mr.
Edward Carpenter	PERSON	's volume of poems , `` Towards Democracy . ''

		This work , first pub - lished -LRB- in
England	LOCATION	-RRB- in
1883	DATE	, has long exercised a power - ful influence with an ever-widening circle of American readers .

		In form it inevitably suggests
Whitman	PERSON	, and there is a marked resemblance in spirit also , the younger poet has more than a little of the elder 's cosmic comprehensiveness , his imperturbable faith in nature and humanity , his wide unhampered vision .

		But , as
Carpenter	PERSON	himself says , '' Towards Democracy '' shines with a milder radiance than '' Leaves of Grass , '' '' as of the moon compared with the sun . ''

		It is more subdued and reflective , and associates itself far more intimately with the actual social conditions of to-day .

		The worst thing about the book is its title , which has doubtless misled and deterred many readers .

		The American edi - tion now published by Mr.
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	is attract - ive in form , though we think many readers will prefer the compact little English volume on thin paper .

		Two photogravure portraits of the author are included .

Bradford Torrey	ORGANIZATION	, a popular writer about birds and flowers , and the author of many books of nature - studies , died
October 7	DATE	at
Santa Barbara	LOCATION	,
California	LOCATION	, within two days of his sixty-ninth birthday .

		He was born in
1843	DATE	in
Weymouth	LOCATION	,
Massachusetts	LOCATION	.

		Of late years , he has been one of the editors of '' The Youth 's Companion . ''

		Among his books are '' Birds in the 300 THE DIAL -LSB-
Oct. 16	DATE	,
Bush	PERSON	, '' '' A Rambler 's Lease , '' '' The Foot-path Way , '' `` A

		At the time of his death , Mr.
Andrew Lang	PERSON	was pre - paring for press a book entitled ''
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	,
Bacon	PERSON	, and the Great Unknown . ''

		Mr.
Lang	PERSON	having observed '' with pain , that the controversy has hitherto been pas - sionate and acrimonious , endeavours to treat the problem with sweet reasonableness , and if possible , with persua - sive urbanity . ''

		He believes he has been able to demon - strate '' that neither Bacon nor
Bungay	PERSON	, but
William Shakespeare	PERSON	, of
Stratford-on-Avon	LOCATION	, was the unassisted author of the plays ascribed to him . ''

		Messrs.
Long	PERSON	- mans hope to publish Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's book during the com - ing month .

		The Reverend
Walter William Skeat	PERSON	, the famous philologist of
Cambridge	LOCATION	, died in
London	LOCATION	on the seventh of
October	DATE	.

		Born in
1835	DATE	, and educated at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, he occupied a curacy for a time before he took up the work of teaching in his alma mater .

		His first work in editing was done for
Furnivall	ORGANIZATION	's Early English Text Society , and was concerned with ''
Lance	PERSON	- lot of the Laik , '' ``
Piers Plowman	PERSON	, '' `` The Bruce , ''
Chaucer	PERSON	, and the manuscripts of the Anglo-Saxon and
Northumbrian Gospels	ORGANIZATION	.

		In
1873	DATE	, he founded the En - glish
Dialect Society	ORGANIZATION	, and became its president .

		Numer - ous publications on the subject of English phonetics and philology made him one of the foremost authorities in those fields .

		In his late years , he associated himself with the company of those who chase the will-o ' - the - wisp of spelling reform .

		The other arts have their palaces and their periodicals ; poetry alone '' has been left to shift for herself in a world unaware of its immediate and desperate need of her . ''

		These words of Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	's indicate the motive which has impelled her to plead Cinderella 's cause , and act as fairy godmother to the neglected child .

		The coach-and-four provided for her triumphant progress takes the form of a little monthly magazine entitled '' Poetry , '' the contents being chiefly original verse , although space is found for a few pages of appo - site prose in the form of editorial comment and critical appraisement .

		The venture is supported by a hundred persons who have enough faith in it to pledge subscrip - tions of fifty dollars each annually for five years , in con - sequence whereof its existence for that period seems assured . ''

		We hope , '' says
Miss Monroe	PERSON	, `` to offer our subscribers a place of refuge , a green isle in the sea , where Beauty may plant her gardens , and Truth , austere reveal er of joy and sorrow , of hidden delights and des - pairs , may follow her brave quest unafraid . ''

		Prizes are offered for the best poem and the best epigram printed during the first year , and an offer has been made by an amateur organization to produce the best play in verse submitted during that period .

		The thirty - two pages of the first issue give us contributions from four living poets , not noticeably better than the verse printed in the general magazines of the better sort .

		The issue is given distinction , however , by a long poem , '' I Am the Woman , '' printed in advance from the forth - coming edition of the works of
William Vaughn Moody	PERSON	-LRB- whose name is here consistently misspelled every time it is used -RRB- .

		Such a poem as this would justify any magazine venture .

		Although good poetry rarely finds any difficulty in getting printed , we will confess to a certain satisfaction in the fact that it now has an organ of its own .

		345 THE PERIL OF EXTERNALISM .

		By externalism is meant the control from without of any body of people , banded together for spiritual or intellectual endeavor , or for the realization of any political or social ideal .

		The history of the American people , in its broader aspects , is a record of effective protest against externalism in religious and civil government .

		It was resentment against externalism that im - pelled the puritan colonists of
New England	LOCATION	to depart from the theory of a state-established church -LRB- in which belief they had been born and bred -RRB- and create instead the typical American system of churches considered as independent congregational units , each church a democracy governing itself by the common consent of its members , making its own rules and choosing its own leaders , and not for a moment admitting the claims of any external authority .

		It was resentment against externalism in political mat - ters that brought about the independence of the thirteen commonwealths that in
1776	DATE	made com - mon cause against the pretensions of a foreign legislature respecting taxation , and gained their cause by the arbitrament of the sword .

		It is resentment against externalism which is to-day actuating those commonwealths , now grown in number from thirteen to forty-eight , in resisting the efforts of ill-advised doctrinaires to impair their several authorities , and magnify at their expense the powers of a federal government that has already gone dangerously far along the perilous path of centralization .

		The specific illustration of the peril of exter - nalism to which we would now direct attention is that which is offered in the field of higher edu - cation in this country .

		`` The Administrative Peril in Education '' Professor
Joseph Jastrow	PERSON	calls it in an article which he has contributed to the
November	DATE	`` Popular Science Monthly . ''

		It is an old subject , both for him and for us , and one which we have both had occasion to discuss upon several former occasions .

		It presents one of the most puzzling antinomies in our national life , for while we should naturally expect the democracy which is the fundamental element in our national character to appear in its finest flower in our educational institutions , we find instead that they tend to embody the autocratic idea , and that their systems of administration , 322 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, instead of encouraging a cordial spirit of coopera - tion , tend to become hierarchical , bestowing as privileges upon their subordinate individual units such limited measure of what should inher - ently be their unassailable rights as seems good to the men vested with the ultimate authority .

		The reason for these tendencies is perfectly ob - vious .

		The exaggerated commercialism of our civilization has achieved such splendid results in the economic sphere that it is difficult to per - suade our statesmen and our captains of industry that their methods have no place in the quite dis - parate spheres of education and art and religion .

		It is to their manifest hurt that we liken churches and theatres to factories , or libraries , museums , and universities to department stores .

		The dif - ference between these activities and those of the industrial life is a consequence of the funda - mental difference between professions and trades .

		Motives from within are the actuating forces of the professional life ; control and direction from without are the secret of efficiency in organized business .

		We once put the matter in these words , which Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	quotes in sup - port of his thesis : '' The idea of professionalism lies at the very core of educational endeavor , and whoever engages in educational work fails of his purpose in just so far as he fails to assert the inherent prerogatives of his calling .

		He becomes a hireling in fact , if not in name , when he suffers , unprotesting , the deprivation of all initiative , and contentedly plays the part of a cog in a mechanism whose motions are all con - trolled from without . ''

		This citation is one of a great number ad - duced by our author in behalf of his plea for an educational democracy .

		We quote a few of the most striking . ''

		Elsewhere throughout the world the university is a republic of scholars , administered by them .

		Here it is a business corporation . '' ''

		The American university has become an autocracy , wholly foreign in spirit and plan to our political ideals , and little short of amazing to those marvels of thoroughgoing democracy , the German universities . '' ''

		The administration imposed on universities , colleges , and school systems is not needed by them , but simply represents an inconsiderate carrying over of methods current in commerce and politics . '' ''

		No single thing has done more harm in higher education in
America	LOCATION	during the
past quarter	DATE	- century than the steady aggrandizement of the presidential office and the modelling of univer - sity administration upon the methods and ideals of the factory and the department store . '' ''

		The very idea of a university as the home of inde - pendent scholars has been obscured by the pres - ent system . ''

		`` The prevailing system does not attract strong men to the profession of teaching , nor does it foster a vigorous intellectual life in the universities .

		And occasionally a gross and tyrannical abuse of authority reminds the world how far
America	LOCATION	is behind
Germany	LOCATION	in the free - dom of its university life . ''

		These are typical extracts from the testimony of the cloud of witnesses who have lately joined in the protest against the stifling of the academic spirit be - neath the wet blanket of externalism .

		Professor
Cattell	PERSON	's recent questionnaire upon the subject has shown astonishing results .

		It was addressed to practically all the faculty members of our important universities , of whom no less than
eighty-five per cent	MONEY	registered decided objections to the prevailing administrative system .

		Such a protest can not safely be ignored , and there are signs that the authorities are taking heed .

		The most striking illustration of the inability of the commercial mind to understand the claims and obligations of professionalism is the recent suggestion that educational efficiency is measur - able in the terms of the factory or the building trades .

		It may be granted that the administra - tive efficiency that swells endowments , and en - larges plant , and multiplies students is exactly measurable , but a true computation of the subtle efficiency of the master-mind in its dealings with aspiring souls will forever elude exact reckoning .

		On the other hand , as Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	remarks , `` there are efficient fools and knaves and meddlers and weather vanes and apologists and dissemblers , and most hopelessly the class whose costly effi - ciency is an eruption of their callous in sensibility .

		; ' Of the test of efficiency supplied by figures stand - ing for numbers and dollars , these caustic obser - vations seem to afford a fair characterization : `` Prosperity is statistically measured ; hence the desire for more buildings and costly ones ; for more instructors , many of them occupied in work that the college should require and not provide ; and more and more students who must be attracted toward the local Athenopolis and away from the rival one ; accordingly the hills are all reduced to easy grades and new democratic -LRB- not royal -RRB- roads to learning are laid out for those who do not like the old ones .

		Requirements are set not to what collegians should learn but to what they will ; as at the circus the strip of bunting is held ostentatiously high until the horse with its fair burden is about to jump , when it is incon - spicuously accommodated to the possible performance . ''

		The consequences of this pandering to our pleasure-loving and toil-abhorring youth are such as to make possible such a description of the student-body as this : '' Students have no intellectual interests , no applica - tions , no knowledge of essentials , no ability to apply
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 323 what they assimilate ; they are flabby , they dawdle , they fritter and frivol , they contemn the grind , they seek proficiency in stunts , they drift to the soft and cir - cumvent the hard ; undertrained and overtaught , they are coddled and spoon-fed and served where they should be serving ; and they get their degrees for a quality of work which in an office would cost them their jobs . ''

		The arraignment is severe , but not undeserved .

		It represents the college idea of preparation for life , when the college administration is obsessed with the notion that it must prove its efficiency by a brave statistical showing .

		A policy directed by educators for the legitimate purposes of edu - cation would not bear these pitiful fruits .

		In his summing-up Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	points his protest against the ideals of externalism , which are efficiency of the baser sort and the shaping of diverse natures in a common mould , by quoting from
William James	PERSON	, who once said at
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	that `` the university most worthy of rational admiration is that one in which your lonely thinker can feel himself least lonely , most positively furthered , and most richly fed , '' add - ing that '' our undisciplinables are our proudest product . ''

		Whereupon our author goes on to say : `` The administrative temper breeds an atmosphere peculiarly noxious to the finer , freer issues of learning .

		The inner quality so precious to the function of leader - ship in intellectual callings , dependent as they are on the delicate nurture of the creative gift , is precisely that which recedes at the first harsh touch of imposed restraint .

		There is a temperamental disposition in - volved , fraught with difficulty of adjustment under the most favorable circumstances , beset with hazard through - out its uncertain maturing at all levels .

		Unless the academic life is made helpful to its purpose , the course of which it must so largely be free to set for itself , the ships that bear our most valued cargoes will be storm-tossed and needlessly discouraged in their efforts to reach their sighted harbors , and some of them will mutely and ingloriously go down at sea .

		It is because the present administrative system is so deadly to ' our proudest product ' that it appears to me , through the vista of a quarter-century , as the supreme peril of the educational seas . ''

		WALT WHITMAN We are indebted to Mr.
Watts-Dunton	PERSON	for the distinction between poets of energy and poets of art .

		The one type attaches primary importance to its message , the other to its expression .

		Perhaps among the poets of energy another distinction might be made between those whose message is a '' criticism '' of life and those who merely vivify our experience .

		This distinction is apparent in contrasting , for in - stance , both verse and prose of Meredith and
Scott	PERSON	.

		Walt Whitman obviously belongs with the poets of energy .

		His message overbalances his art so much , indeed , that he is hardly thought of as a man of letters .

		He is a prophet ; tbe appreciation of his poetry is a '' cause '' to which converts are eagerly sought .

		He is no doubt receiving a fair hearing .

		His name is already one of distinction ; his audience has grown to proportions which make it more than a cult ; cosmopolitan critics have admitted his pre - cedence .

		But whether he is to become a recognized force in our intellectual and spiritual life we must leave to the future to decide .

		That , however , is the final and surest test .

		`` The proof of a poet , '' he says himself , `` should be sternly deferred till his country absorbs him as affectionately as he has absorbed it . ''

		But no prophet has appeared among us whose message is in such need of clarifying .

		He has been enveloped by his disciples in an atmosphere of appre - ciative comment which , while making our approach to him easy , has stupefied our critical faculties .

		Those who can not bear the thick incense of the inner shrine have come away disgusted , ready to deny the author - ity of ehe prophet as well as the vitality of his mes - sage .

		Perspective is sadly needed on both sides .

		But to place
Walt Whitman	PERSON	we must have a body of doctrine which will relate him to our previous spiritual forces ; we must have an analysis of his work which will reveal what
Whitman	PERSON	has added to the sum of human thought or how he has changed human aspiration .

		To sketch the poetical achieve - ment of
Walt Whitman	PERSON	from this point of view is the aim of this essay .

		I.
Walt Whitman	PERSON	was the avowed poet of a spiritual democracy .

		It was his aim to express in poetry a composite individual , a personality inclusive of all traits found among men .

		He would exclude neither high nor low , virtuous nor vicious . ''

		I am of old and young , of the foolish as much as the wise ; Regardless of others , ever regardful of others , Maternal as well as paternal , a child as well as a man , Stuff 'd with the stuff that is coarse , and stuff 'd with the stuff that is fine . ''

		It was a daring and original task ; and it is hardly to be expected that
Walt Whitman	PERSON	more than any other brave pioneer should be completely successful .

		To reconcile irreconcilables , to make inconsistencies consistent , is the unpromising task which Whitman nevertheless did accomplish to a degree ; the ap - parent miracle being wrought in the one manner possible : by fusing all the elements in the glow of emotion .

		The world is complex to the analysing intellect ; the uncritical emotions easily simplify and unify it .


Walt Whitman	PERSON	was therefore a poet pri - marily of emotion and energy , that he might unify the contradictory elements in the unique personality he sought to express .

		In the conception as well as in the execution of his task
Whitman	PERSON	gave evidence of a high and noble seriousness , an assuredness of temper , an intensity of creative passion , which prove him a man of very high order .

		He had the poise and balance , the sense of contact with primal power , which belong only to the masters .

		Although he professed to be the poet of democracy , of the lowly and vulgar as well as of the refined , yet one feels the force of a profound cul - 324 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, ture behind his written work .

		The naive poetry of democracy which
Burns	PERSON	left behind him is supported by neither such force of intellect nor such depth of vision as that of '' the good grey poet . ''

		II .

		But , although a great culture has entered into the poetry of Whitman , reason and taste , the faculties of culture , must be laid aside by the reader .

		For with this poet emotion is supreme , an emotion which is unguided and unrestrained except as it is '' a law unto itself . ''

		Reason and taste are critical and directive ; they estimate , balance , discard .

		Culture therefore means discrimination and selection ; it is exclusive .

		Its ideals tend to become narrow , its standards high .

		In its extreme form it becomes pure aestheticism , intellectual or emotional .

		Obvi - ously , only a leisure class can give to the ideal of cultivation its highest expression in life ; and Whitman , with many others , assumes that culture is theoretically impracticable in a democracy .

		In
America	LOCATION	, Whitman believed , we have no place for it . ''

		The greatest poems ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	included , are poison - ous to the idea of the pride and dignity of the common people , the life-blood of democracy .

		The models of our literature , as we get it from other lands , ultra-marine , have had their birth in courts , and bask 'd and grown in castle sunshine ; all smells of princes ' favors .

		Of workers of a certain sort , we have , indeed , plenty , contributing after their kind ; many elegant , many learn 'd , all complacent .

		But touch 'd by the national test , or tried by the standards of democratic personality , they wither to ashes . ''

		The American people must be energized by an ideal which is democratic both in its appeal and in its pos - sibility of expression .

		Such he believed his vision of a religious democracy to be ; for it appealed to the emotions , and in them is to be found most easily our common humanity .

		The exclusion of the directive powers of reason and taste , and the freedom given to unguided emo - tion , explain the demand made upon us by the dis - ciples of Whitman that we accept him whole or not at all . ''

		Unless we allow Whitman to be a law unto himself , '' says Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	, `` we can make little of him ; unless we place ourselves at his absolute point of view , his work is an offense and without meaning . ''

		We must not clip his wings .

		To criti - cize , to limit , to weigh , is to exercise reason or taste , and hence to assert their ultimate right to supremacy ; but this is a fundamental contradiction to the spirit of Whitman , and one which if accepted would seem almost fatal to his claim to a representative position .

		Whitman 's most obvious loss in his rejection of culture was a sense of distinction and evaluation .

		His purely emotional appreciation of the panorama of life was too immediate an experience to leave room for reflection .

		Detachment appeared cold to him .

		But it is an absolute requisite for preserving proportion in literature and life ; no true criticism is possible without it .

		And the very subordinate position accorded to the spirit of criticism , of evalu - ation , in
Whitman	LOCATION	's poetry accounts for that chaos of standards and monotony of tone which is appar - ent to even the casual reader .

		Our emotional reaction to the world must , indeed , be various both in degree and kind to be satisfying .

		The rose , the clod , the stars , the throbbing city street , speak to us in accents by no means similar or of equal force .

		Whitman boasted that he included all , as perhaps he did ; but he certainly had not the pliability of spirit , he was too great an egoist , to interpret all .

		His point of view was not one that tolerates a variety of experience .

		He did not draw near to life in all its phases and attempt to catch its spirit .

		His own personality , his u cosmic '' self , was too predominating .

		The procession of animate and inanimate creation through his pages have a value not in their own right , but derived from the poet 's transforming vision .

		And the emotion which unifies the strange variety of his poetical work , which breathes into it the cogent spirit of personality , has been accurately called `` cosmic emotion '' ; it is a translation into feeling of intellectual monism .

		Whitman was an emotional mystic , and regarded the multiform variety of the world only as an ex - pression of its essential unity .

		III .

		But it was with the vision of a spiritual democracy that the profound creative energy of Whitman ex - ercised itself ; and our judgment of him as a religious poet must form the basis of our final estimate .

		He has himself explained the purpose of his poetry in a passage of irresistible power in one of his prefaces : '' I will see -LRB- said I to myself -RRB- whether there is not , for my purposes as a poet , a religion , and a sound religious germen - ancy in the average human race , at least in their modern development in the
United States	LOCATION	, and in the hardy common fibre and native yearnings and elements , deeper and larger , and affording more profitable returns , than all mere sects or churches as boundless , joyous , and vital as
Nature	ORGANIZATION	itself a germenancy that has too long been unencouraged , unsung , almost unknown . ''

		Religion is too large and too important a factor to be left to an institution .

		`` It must be consigned henceforth to democracy en masse , and to literature .

		It must enter into the poems of the nation .

		It must make the nation . ''

		As thus stated the ideal has self-evident value .

		Has Whitman , however , been successful in the ex - ecution of his task ?

		Is the imagined personality of '' Leaves of Grass '' truly religious ?

		Does that book contain in it the enthralling vision which can energize the mass of average men ? ''

		Leaves of Grass '' is a monistic chant .

		It cele - brates the universe as a whole , and not any one part alone .

		It expresses not a personal but a '' cosmic '' emotion .

		Its view is not that of a struggling mem - ber , but of an idle spectator of the cosmic process . ''

		Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am ; Stands amused , complacent , compassionating , idle , unitary . ''

		And because he has made monism the basis of his poetry , Whitman is able to be inclusive , to be the poet of wickedness as well as of goodness ; for him there is no wickedness and no goodness , as such , but merely a cosmic process .

		This may indeed seem like ultimate spiritual democracy .

		But in reality it is the very opposite ; it
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 325 is the expression of a spiritual `` special privilege . ''

		The average man can not indulge much in k ' cosmic emotion '' ; he is forced to concern himself with his immediate interests as a part of the process .

		His life will consequently be justified to him on vastly other grounds than those Whitman has suggested .

		He would not be able to understand `` Leaves of Grass '' because it is remote from anything he has ever expe - rienced .

		And so Whitman , although democratic with a vengeance in his inclusiveness , can never be democratic in his appeal .

		The religion of the average man must obviously recognize the dualism which is his daily experience .

		The average man is ever looking forward into an uncertain future ; the situation calls for activity and self-direction .

		Life is strenuous if it is at all moral or religious , and its struggle develops better than anything else the '' religious germenancy '' which Whitman believed was in all men .

		But
Whitman	PERSON	was composed , satisfied with himself and the world ; the future did not invite him to effort , nor the present to discriminate . ''

		Showing the best , and dividing it from the worst , age vexes age ; Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things , while they discuss I am silent , and go bathe and admire myself . ''

		While Whitman thus seems to occupy a position beyond good and evil , he has as a matter of fact yet to arrive at that parting of the ways where the moral realm begins and ethical distinctions have sway .

		He was a spectator of the panorama of life , not an actor in its drama .

		Even in his profoundly religious spirit there is a pervading Bohemianism which viti - ates his work .

		In no place is this more evident than in his attitude towards woman .

		Whitman never understood the distinctively feminine , in which the ethical appears upon this planet in its fairest and finest form .

		His love poetry is primal and instinctive , with an occasional approach to Oriental voluptuous - ness and brutality . ''

		Cosmic '' emotion does not , indeed , blend well with love , the subtlest , most delicate , and most personal of human feelings .

		In his intense belief in the goodness of the uni - verse ,
Whitman	PERSON	was thus too ready to compromise with the spirits of darkness .

		We may have to admit that , in the final scheme of things , evil will appear to have been as necessary as the good ; but we can - not afford now to accept evil as readily as the good .

		The modern man believes , too , in the autonomy of the spiritual nature of humanity .

		But he need not and can not leave this nature unnurtured or the vic - tim of aimless drift .

		Monistic optimism is therefore to him an impossible faith ; in its stead experience sternly thrusts upon him a dualism , and dualism means guidance by norms .

		Reason and taste must in - evitably function to systematize experience , determine standards , and act as a corrective and directive force in the relations of man to the world about him .

		IV - Thus we are brought back again from the weird - ness of `` Leaves of Grass '' to life in its familiar aspect , with all the old pressing problems still un - solved .

		But every reader of Whitman must recognize that something has been gained , even though it be not the expected solution to the persistent riddle .

		What is the secret of Whitman 's power ?

		To what can we attribute the exhilarating and strengthening qualities of his poetry ?

		The famous confession of
John Addington Symonds	PERSON	is illustrative , although a little extreme to be typical , of the experience of men of culture in contact with Whitman : '' ' Leaves of Grass , ' which I first read at the age of twenty-five , influenced me more perhaps than any other book has done , except the
Bible	LOCATION	; more than
Plato	PERSON	, more than Goethe ... My academical prejudices , the literary instincts trained by two decades of Greek and Latin studies , the refinements ef culture , and the exclusiveness of aristo - cratic breeding , revolted against the uncouthness , roughness , irregularity , coarseness of the poet and his style .

		But , in course of a short time , Whitman delivered my soul of these debilities . ''


Symonds	PERSON	did not , however , as everyone knows , give up his academic interests when on the threshold of manhood , to become a `` natural and non-chalant '' loafer .

		His whole life was devoted to such matters as appeal only to the cultivated .

		Whitman did not replace his culture , but broadened it .

		This is the distinctive service which the poetry of Whitman is able to render us .

		It is a liberator from academic narrowness , enlarging as it does the basis of culture .

		The subtle and intricate thought and feeling of the highly developed man , he does not express ; his spirit reached back into a primeval , chaotic state , where the elemental was the most ob - vious .

		His universe is in need of evolution .

		This partly explains its fascination for us ; in the midst of the complexities of civilization we hear and respond to the call of the wild .

		Perhaps at times our habit - ual refinement would like to exclude some of the rawness we find there ; but , when the shock is once overcome , the experience becomes satisfying , our outlook and sympathies are broadened , our culture itself becomes intenser and deeper because it draws power from the uncultivated , the primitive , the elemental .

		In the poetry of Whitman , then , we do not find a trustworthy constructive criticism of life , but rather the chaotic , unevolved elements of life itself .

		His poetry serves not as a guide , but as a point of departure .

		His creative energy aimed , not at culti - vation , but at expansion .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		PROS AND CONS on any question of wide interest are usually so many , and each , taken alone , so con - vincing , that it is not surprising if there rises to the lips the old cry , What is truth ?

		A person of judicial habit of mind , and not a violent partisan by tempera - ment , is torn by this conflict of arguments .

		In child - hood all things are either black or white ; there are no grays .

		All men are good or bad , all actions either 326 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov.	DATE	l r right or wrong , and the line of division is as sharp as that separating the mathematician 's plus and minus quantities .

		But the years that bring the philosophic mind take away this comfortable cer - tainty and leave us floundering in a sea of doubts .

		In illustration of the inevitable two-sidedness -LRB- and sometimes many-sidedness -RRB- of every question , the double-column pages of an excellent and useful pub - lication -LRB- '' Pros and Cons , '' by Mr.
John Bertram Askew	PERSON	-RRB- set forth with clearness and sufficient brevity the arguments for and against a great number of proposed reforms and legislative acts .

		The book is by this time no novelty to the reading world , being now in its fifth edition -LRB- re - written and enlarged -RRB- and the sixteenth year of its life .

		But as it is an English work it may not be very familiar to American readers .

		As an example of the impartial author 's manner of setting up a thesis with one hand and knocking it down with the other , let us quote from the section headed '' A Censorship of Fiction . ''

		It begins , in the left-hand column : '' The evil of per - nicious literature is a grave and dangerous one , and deeply affects the principles and lives of the young people of the nation .

		The steady increase in crime may be to a considerable degree laid at the door of fiction . ''

		This is rebutted in the parallel column , thus : '' The responsibility of fiction for the increase in crime is greatly exaggerated .

		The ' young person ' who will be led astray by fiction is so weak that he will go wrong , fiction or no fiction .

		Fiction repro - duces the spirit of the age rather than creates it . ''

		And so the argumentative see-saw goes agreeably on through one subject after another .

		It is a contro - versial teeter - board of infinite diversion and also of much sound sense .

		A NOTABLE ADDITION TO AMERICAN PAGEANTRY was the festival procession which formed the great outdoor spectacle on the occasion of
last month	DATE	's celebration of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the founding of
Mount Holyoke College	ORGANIZATION	.

		In a setting of wonderful autumn splendor , by means of pantomime and symbolic tableaux , the academic departments of the college depicted the liberal arts and sciences , while alumnae , in the fashions of three-quarters of a century , presented the seventy-five years of the life of
Mount Holyoke	LOCATION	.

		From the first gay fiddling of mediaeval minstrels , as , crossing a rustic bridge and winding through brilliant trees , they led the head of the great procession out on the grassy stage under the eyes of more than three thousand specta - tors , to the last rushing together of all the companies of heralds and color-bearers on the wide green of the
South Campus	LOCATION	, scene after scene unfolded in significant and arresting beauty .

		Augustus and
Agrippa	PERSON	celebrated the
Ludi Saeculares	PERSON	in the year 17 B.C. .

		The chemical element paced through its chequered history , ending in an ingenious setting forth of Mendele'eff 's `` Periodic Law . ''

		Geology , botany , and zoology united to depict evolution in nature , even to
Mendel	PERSON	's law of heredity .

		Portrait figures presented masterpieces of the world 's art .

		In the presence of
Louis XIV.	LOCATION	,
Moliere	PERSON	conducted rehearsals of his plays .

		Economics unfolded in five groups the evolution of industrial society .

		Twenty departments , with an ingenuity and comprehensive - ness which can only be hinted at , thus developed each a single subject chosen from its own special field of knowledge .

		This is something new in page - antry .

		By its originality of conception , spontaneity of execution , variety and freedom of design , its beauty of color , and continuity of thought ,
Mount Holyoke	LOCATION	's `` Festival Procession '' made that provocative appeal to the imagination which is the final test of all art .

		That this expression of the life of an academic com - munity was entirely the product of that community itself is still more suggestive .

		The seven hundred undergraduates who participated received no `` pro- fessional '' training .

		The historic accuracy of their costuming derived from no imported brains .

		To - Professor
Jewett	PERSON	, creator of the pageant , and her able assistants is due this fresh insight into the art impulses of twentieth-century life .

		A DECADE OF LIBRARY GROWTH forms the subject of Mr.
John Cotton Dana	PERSON	's current report to the people of
Newark	LOCATION	-LRB- N. J. -RRB- concerning his adminis - tration of their great and rapidly growing public library .

		The decade began with the removal from old to new quarters , from the outgrown building in
West Park	LOCATION	Street to the splendid new structure which , including land , cost not far from half a mil - lion dollars and is one of our notable examples of library architecture .

		Also coincident , or nearly coincident with the beginning of the decade , if we mistake not , was Mr.
Dana	PERSON	's assumption of his pres - ent position ; and in that time he has had the grati - fication of seeing the institution under his direction grow marvellously in all its departments .

		From approximately seventy-eight thousand volumes ten years ago , the book-collection has increased to nearly two hundred thousand ; the annual circulation has grown from less than a third of a million to more than a million volumes ; six branch libraries have been established , and the eight delivery stations of ten years ago have become magnified and trans - formed into thirteen deposit stations ; and the library staff has undergone enlargement , from sixteen per - sons to forty-four , not including messengers , janitors , elevator men , engineers , and firemen .

		But all these figures are , of course , merely the crude symbols of that growth and ramification in the library 's educa - tional activities , that increased power of ministering to the deeper needs of its patrons , which have come as the result of ten years ' well-directed effort .

		A POSSIBLE UNEARTHING OF LITERARY TREASURE possessing value beyond the dreams of bibliophilism may be regarded as a not very remote contingency .

		If the present disturbances in the
Balkan	LOCATION	peninsula should prove to mean that
Turkey	LOCATION	's hour of doom has struck , there would be reasonable hope that the thousands of precious manuscripts known to be stored in the vaults of
St. Sophia	LOCATION	might at last see the light .

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 327 Tradition avers that at the time of the Turkish con - quest of
Constantinople	LOCATION	more than a million manu - scripts were hastily consigned for safe keeping to the crypts heneath the sacred edifice ; and though Ottoman arrogance , which forbids Christians to visit what was once the chief shrine of their faith , has stubbornly refused to let these literary relics be ex - amined , a very few favored persons have been allowed to get a tantalizing peep at the piles of dusty rolls mouldering in subterranean darkness .

		One of these grudgingly-privileged ones was the late
Moberly Bell	ORGANIZATION	, of the
London	LOCATION	`` Times , '' who left a description of what was revealed to his hurried glance .

		In its pre-Mohammedan prime the Byzantine capital num - bered a million and more inhabitants , and boasted many fine churches , famous monasteries , and flour - ishing schools , while its leading citizens had each his private library of considerable value .

		Conse - quently the possibilities awaiting realization when the accumulated treasures of
St. Sophia	LOCATION	's crypts shall be unlocked are such as no scholar can con - template in imagination with unquickened pulse .

		Who knows but , among other priceless legacies of classical antiquity , there may be discovered the lost books of
Livy	PERSON	, and the missing tragedies of ^ schy - lus and Sophocles , and the poems of Anacreon and Alcaeus and Sappho ?

		WHY NOVELS MULTIPLY , especially in the English book - world , is explained by
London	LOCATION	publishers or at least an explanation is attempted somewhat as follows .

		A great many women have in recent years entered the ranks of journalism , but have found themselves somewhat handicapped for that strenuous calling by '' sex disability . ''

		Therefore , unwilling to abandon the pen for the needle or the egg-beater , or other implement of female industry , they have turned to the writing of romances for the entertain - ment of other women , and some men , and have found on the whole a hospitable market for their wares .

		Indeed the publishers -LRB- Messrs.
William Heinemann	PERSON	and
Arthur Waugh	PERSON	are quoted on this head -RRB- are said to show a certain partiality for women 's work in this field of literature .

		The manuscripts submitted by women novelists far outnumber those offered by men , and commonly prove fully as acceptable , though in point of literary finish , attention to the rules of sentence-construction , and so on , the average edu - cated woman shows herself inferior to the average educated man .

		Apropos of this , one might observe , parenthetically , it is curious to note the carelessness in such subordinate details of even so gifted and scholarly a woman novelist as Mrs.
Humphry Ward	PERSON	.

		Her paragraphing and punctuation , for example , seem at times to be dictated by pure caprice .

		In further evidence of the inherent attractions of novel-writing for our '' sex-disabled '' women journalists , attention is called to the smallness of remuneration that awaits their labors .

		The pecuniary return for a work of fiction does not average more than two hundred dol - lars , while the labor of writing may have extended over six months or a year , with no certainty of accept - ance even at the end of that time .

		Froude 's remark is an often-quoted one , that the literary calling is '' the only occupation in which wages are not given in proportion to the goodness of the work done . ''

		`` LAMBING WITH
MR. LUCAS	PERSON	'' is an admirable and easily understood phrase attributed by Mr.
Henry C. Shelley	PERSON	to an American friend of his who , in the course of a visit to
England	LOCATION	, assured Mr.
Shelley	PERSON	that her dearest desire was to go Lambing through
London	LOCATION	with Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	.

		No better guide to
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's
London	LOCATION	could be found than
Elia	LOCATION	's genial biographer , who doubtless could dilate on the charms of the metropolis with something of the same eloquence as did Lamb himself in that letter to his friend
Manning	PERSON	wherein he glows with enthusiasm over the '' shops sparkling with pretty faces of indus - trious milliners , neat sempstresses , ladies cheapen - ing , gentlemen behind counters lying , authors in the street with spectacles ,
George Dyers	PERSON	-LRB- you may know them by their gait -RRB- , lamps lit at night , pastry-cooks ' and silver-smiths ' shops , beautiful Quakers of Pen - tonville , noise of coaches , drowsy cry of mechanic watchmen at night , with bucks reeling home drunk ; if you happen to wake at
midnight	TIME	, cries of Fire and Stop thief ; inns of court , with their learned airs , and halls , and butteries , just like
Cambridge	LOCATION	colleges ; old book-stalls ,
Jeremy Taylors	PERSON	, Burtons on Melan - choly , and Religio Medicis on every stall .

		These are thy pleasures ,
London	LOCATION	with-the-many-sins . ''

		In a sense , we can all , fortunately , go Lambing through
London	LOCATION	with Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	: we can do it in his books ; and we can also go Lucasing through
London	LOCATION	, not only in some of his earlier volumes , but also , and most enjoyably , in his new novel , ``
London Laven	PERSON	- der , '' which will be found none the worse for the occasional reappearance of some of the familiar characters from its predecessors .

		THE POST OF BIOGRAPHER TO ERRATIC GENIUS is not the easiest in the world to fill , as must be evident to every reader of Mr.
Albert Bigelow Paine	PERSON	's account -LRB- in the
November	DATE	`` Harper '' -RRB- of some of his experiences in trying to gather from
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's flow of varied and extremely enter - taining personal reminiscence such trustworthy data as were needed for his prospective work .

		Unfor - tunately for the biographer ,
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's imagina - tion eclipsed his memory in so many instances that his autobiographic outpourings had to be carefully checked and corrected with the help of such other sources of information as were available if there were any such , as doubtless was not always the case . ''

		If you wanted to know the worst of
Mark Twain	PERSON	, '' says his biographer , '' you had only to ask him for it .

		He would give it , to the last syllable worse than the worst , for his imagination would magnify it and adorn it with new iniquities , and if he gave it again , or a dozen times , he would improve upon it each time , until the thread of history was almost impos - sible to trace through the marvel of that fabric ; and he would do the same for another person just a & 328 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, willingly . ''

		Painfully conscientious and unsparing as
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	is well-known to have been in his self-revelations , he simply could not cure himself of his growing habit of remembering quantities of things that never happened . ''

		When I was younger , '' he once quaintly remarked , '' I could remember anything , whether it happened or not ; but I am getting old , and soon I shall remember only the latter . ''

		... ACKNOWLEDGING THE UNPROCLAIMED ACHIEVE - MENT , welcoming the literary angel that comes to us unawares , is a task of peculiar pleasure which presents itself all too infrequently .

		Such a pleasure , however , we now indulge ourselves in by advising the discriminating to possess themselves at once of a little volume called '' The Children of Light , '' which has just come unheralded from the press .

		It is the work of Miss
Florence Converse	PERSON	, whose '' Long Will '' was recently accorded the honor of inclusion in `` Everyman 's Library . ''

		But unlike that romance , `` The Children of Light '' is a tale of to-day of the mighty movement for social regeneration which is slowly spreading over the world .

		It is a narrative of much interest , told with rare distinction of style : but its chief charm resides in the fine breath of idealism which animates the whole .

		Something is here of the spiritual glow and fervor of
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Morris	PERSON	the
Ruskin	PERSON	of '' Fors , '' the
Morris	PERSON	of '' News from Nowhere . ''

		Especially to generous-hearted young people , eager to bear their part in the strug - gle for social righteousness yet bewildered by the complexities of the problem , will this book bring joy and enlightenment .

		If a few such readers find their way to the volume through this brief paragraph , its purpose will have been fulfilled .

		... POETRY BY LINEAR MEASUREMENT appears to form one of the subjects of study to be pursued at a certain leading school of journalism .

		A press notice announces that this school `` will offer this year a number of new courses in magazine writing and editing , magazine advertising and circulation , and magazine and newspaper verse . ''

		Wherein magazine and newspaper verse differs conspicuously from other verse seems to be the neat space-filling quality that commands the reader 's admiration as he reaches the end of a prose article not quite able to stretch itself to the bottom of the page or column .

		Here the couplet , the quatrain , or in rare instances the poem of six or eight lines , is in requisition ; and the practical journalist who can assist at the make-up of the pages and fill in the gaps with appropriate verse , should command a good weekly wage .

		THE FIRST PROFESSORSHIP OF PRINTS known to exist in the educational or art world will be estab - lished at
Harvard	LOCATION	as soon as an endowment of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars is assured , two - thirds of it being already pledged by seven
New York	LOCATION	and
Boston	LOCATION	art-lovers .

		The occupant of the new chair will also act as curator of prints at the
Boston	LOCATION	Museum of Fine Arts ; and the person already selected for this double office is said to be Mr.
Fitz	PERSON	-
Roy Carrington	PERSON	, who for the past fifteen years has been a partner in the well-known
New York	LOCATION	art firm of
Frederick Keppel & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and is reputed one of the foremost print-connoisseurs in the country .

		In this connection it is also announced that `` The Print-Collector 's Quarterly , '' the only American periodical devoted wholly to engravings and etch - ings , will be taken over by the Museum .

		Mr.
Carrington	PERSON	has been editor of the '' Quarterly '' from its beginning nearly two years ago .

		A considerable enlargement of the present collections of prints in the
Boston	LOCATION	Art Museum and in the
Fogg Museum	ORGANIZATION	at
Cambridge	LOCATION	, and the organizing of a national society of print-lovers , are among the things Mr.
Carrington	PERSON	hopes to accomplish ... THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE , long before and ever since
Hamerton	PERSON	wrote so convincingly about it , has been to thousands the only life worth living .

		This conviction is voiced again by the new president of
Amherst	LOCATION	in his inaugural address .

		Dr.
Meiklejohn	PERSON	began his talk to the assembled college thus : '' What - ever others may say , the teacher knows that the primary business of the college is intellectual rather than technical or professional .

		The college is pri - marily not a place of the body , nor of the feelings , nor of the will .

		First of all , it is a place of the mind .

		And the justification of intellectual training is , first , that thinking is one of the most wholesome , most captivating , most satisfying of human pursuits .

		And second , more important still , that thinking is good because of its contribution to life .

		Our funda - mental educational principle is that if a human life has been translated from forms of feeling to those of ideas , life has become more successful . ''

		It is safe to predict that the importance which at
Amherst	LOCATION	has ever been attached to the things of the mind will suffer no diminution at President
Meiklejohn	PERSON	's hands ...
MRS. HOWE	PERSON	'S MEMORIALTPORTRAIT , the gift of those many admirers of hers who have delighted to contribute toward this testimonial which is now formally presented to the
Bostonian Society	ORGANIZATION	, was unveiled the other day in the council chamber of the
Old State House	ORGANIZATION	, no room for it having been found in
Faneuil Hall	LOCATION	or the
Old South Meeting House	ORGANIZATION	where attempts were made to have it hung .

		Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's son-in-law , Mr.
John Elliott	PERSON	, was the artist naturally and fittingly chosen to paint the portrait , and he is thought to have achieved a re - markable likeness .

		Mr.
Edwin D. Mead	PERSON	, one of the speakers of the occasion , expressed his satisfac - tion at seeing the portrait hung in the historic old building , and added : `` One would have to weld together two women of the colonial period to match Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	, and those two women would be
Anne Hutchinson	PERSON	and
Anne Bradstreet	PERSON	. ''

		Of Dr. and Mrs.
Howe	PERSON	's old friends , it was pleasing to note the attendance of Mr.
Frank B. Sanborn	PERSON	, who made a short address .

		Of course the `` Battle Hymn '' was sung , to make the occasion complete .

		THE DIAL 329 00ks .

		THE HOUSE OF
BRONTE	LOCATION	.

		A veritable
House of Usher	ORGANIZATION	that lonely par - sonage at
Haworth	PERSON	must have been , at least it so stands forth in one 's mental picture of it blank , bare , bleak , and ominous , at the very end of the steep and narrow street that climbs between its double row of gray stone houses to the apex of the hill .

		The ancient gray stone church with its square and solid tower stands opposite , and from the gray front of the little house its five upper windows stare down upon the mouldering tombstones of the parish grave - yard an accompaniment as symbolic as that of the dark and stagnant tarn .

		This picture of the house is insistently suggested when one recalls the history of the Brontes .

		It has evi - dently impressed
Miss Sinclair	PERSON	, the author of this latest study of the three remarkable sisters whose literary achievement has brought such fame to this strange family .

		Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	says : '' It is the genius of the Brontes that made their place immortal ; but it is the soul of the place that made their genius what it is .

		You can not exaggerate its import - ance .

		They drank and were saturated with
Haworth	PERSON	.

		...
Haworth	PERSON	is saturated with them .

		Their souls are henceforth no more to be disentangled from its soul than their bodies from its earth . ''

		The pathetic drama of
Patrick Bronte	PERSON	's house - hold loses none of its significance in Miss Sin - clair 's narrative .

		The shadow of death hovers over the family from the beginning to the end .

		Eighteen months after their advent at
Haworth	LOCATION	the mother was buried in the vault of the gray stone church , and on the flat stone above her grave was carved the text `` Be ye also ready . ''

		The five little
Bronte	PERSON	girls were sent away to a school , the
Clergy Daughter 's School	ORGANIZATION	, which happened to be situated `` in an unwholesome valley . ''

		Then
Marie	PERSON	, aged twelve , was brought home to die ;
Elizabeth	LOCATION	, aged eleven , followed her sister .


Charlotte	LOCATION	,
Emily	PERSON	, and
Anne	PERSON	were now at
Haworth	LOCATION	again , and there they lived undisturbed by further tragedy for seven years .

		Their activities were in part domestic , but by no means limited by the gray walls of the parsonage , the old stone church , or the sombre cemetery .

		The freedom of the moors was theirs , the dun and purple moors surrounded , as Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	describes them , by the sinuous , wave-like hills grand from the ideas of solitude and loneliness that they suggest .

		And now they entered another * THE THREE BRONTES .

Branwell	PERSON	, a coloring as unique as it was intense .

		It is not uncommon for chil - dren to live in a playland of strange fancies , but here was something different from the experience of normal childhood . ''

		For a considerable num - ber of years they were the ' Islanders . ' ''

		These are our three great plays that are not kept secret . ''

		And then there were the secret plays ,
Emily	PERSON	's and
Charlotte	LOCATION	's , '' shy and solitary flights of
Emily	ORGANIZATION	's and
Charlotte	LOCATION	's genius , '' Miss Sinclair terms them .

		They had begun to write . ''

		They seem to have required absolutely no impulsion from without , '' she says . ''

		The difficult thing for these small children was to stop writing . ''

		And from this singular school of authorship came in due time that astonishing group of novels which has served for wonderment and comment ever since .

		As was to have been expected ,
Miss Sinclair	PERSON	's study of the Brontes is vivacious , dramatic , frank , and unconventional .

		She apologizes for her book on the ground that too much has been said already about
Charlotte	LOCATION	and her family , so much , indeed , that the truth itself is buried under a confused tangle of distorted facts .

		She does not spare the biographers .

		Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	is censured for injustice to
Patrick Bronte	PERSON	, the eccentric head of the house , whom Miss Sinclair describes as '' a poor , unhappy and innocent old man . ''


George Henry Lewes	PERSON	is '' gross and flippant '' ; and as for Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	, '' there is nothing from her fame downward '' that she did not grudge
Charlotte	LOCATION	.

March , 1855	DATE	,
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	died then in her thirty-ninth year .

		Her mother 's death had occurred at the same age , and
Branwell	PERSON	, too , had died at thirty-nine .

		Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	's book will interest all who are interested in the
Brontes	LOCATION	; it is a study that has unusual value .

		The passion , the spirit of revolt , the elemental in the work of
Charlotte	LOCATION	and
Emily	PERSON	, are here given sympathetic emphasis .

		To Emily the biographer gives a leading place ; `` Wuthering Heights '' is in her estimation superior to ``
Jane Eyre	PERSON	, '' and
Emily	PERSON	's poems receive highest praise .

		It is the figure of
Emily Bronte	PERSON	, tall , strong , and unconquerable , solitary and unique , that dominates Miss
Sinclair	PERSON	's im - agination at the conclusion of the story she has so vividly retold .

		But once again , in her con - cluding chapter , she harks back to that gray stone house on the hill as she found it , when a child , in the vivid pages of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's wonderful life : '' I knew every corner of that house .

		I have an im - pression -LRB- it is probably a wrong one -RRB- of a flagged path going right down from the Parsonage door through another door and plunging among the tombs .

		I saw six little white and wistful faces looking out of an upper window ; I saw six little children going up and up a lane , and I wondered how the tiny feet of babies ever got so far .

		I saw six little
Bronte	PERSON	babies lost in the spaces of the illimitable moors .

		They went over rough stones and walls and mountain torrents ; their absurd petticoats were blown upwards by the wind , and their feet were tangled in the heather .

		They struggled and struggled , and yet were in an ecstacy that I could well understand .

		... And , all through , an invisible , intangible presence , something mysterious , but omnipotently alive ; some - thing that excited these three sisters ; something that atoned , that not only consoled for suffering and solitude and bereavement , but that drew its strength from these things ; something that moved in this book like the soul of it ; something that they called ` genius . ' ''

		There is no question of the genius of Char - lotte and
Emily Bronte	PERSON	.

		But genius commonly arrives by the broad highway of worldly knowl - edge ; so still the wonder grows how the tiny feet of babies ever got so far .

		To the layman the most interesting articles in the

		EXPLORATIONS IN THE VASTY DEEP .

		* The great incentives toward exploration which have spurred adventurous spirits in the past to hazardous endeavor are rapidly disap - pearing .

		Flags fly at both the poles .

		The inte - riors of the continents have been charted , the culture of even the remotest tribes of men has been described and their folk-lore recorded , and the big game of the jungles and plains is fast disappearing forever .

		The explorer of , the future must turn to ultra-mundane spheres for novelty , or perchance must seek laboriously to unravel the secrets beneath the surface of our own little planet .

		Much remains to be done in the mapping of the ocean floor ; in determining temperatures , salinities , and currents in the sea ; in detecting the fate of the immense quantities of nitrogenous matter washed from the continents yearly into the sea ; in analysing the slowly accumulated deposits which make up the soft ooze of the ocean bottom ; and , above all , in determining the kind , extent , distribution , and natural history -LRB- or oecology , to use a more modern term -RRB- of the plant and animal life of the sea , and enabling man fully and safely to reap the harvests of the sea .

		Here is work which demands not only the knowledge and training of the scientific specialist as well as the perseverance and self - abnegation of the saint , but also all those qualities of hardihood , enthusiasm , daring , im - agination , and ingenuity which the successful explorer of unknown polar or tropical regions must possess .

		It is not without significance that the three authors of the works here reviewed and all of their collaborators live on the borders of the storm-tossed but fertile
North Sea	LOCATION	, and that a Scotchman , a Norwegian , and an Englishman should write of the sea and its problems .

Michael Sars	PERSON	, '' a staunch little steamer built on the main lines of a com - mercial trawler and named for one of
Norway	LOCATION	's illustrious zoologists .

		Sir
John Murray	PERSON	, joint author of `` The Depths of the Ocean '' and the patron of the expedition , was a member of the scientific staff of the famous Challenger Expedi - tion of 1872-1876 and later the director of the researches carried on upon its collections .

		He was also editor of the fifty quarto volumes of `` Reports '' and author of the `` Summary of Results '' of this expedition , forming the most adequate account of the life of the sea as yet published .

		Such leadership at once made the cruise of the `` Michael Sars '' in the
summer of 1910	DATE	, in the tropical and northern
Atlantic	LOCATION	, noteworthy in the annals of marine exploration .

		It made possible an attack upon the problems of the sea with the most modern fully-tested equipment , elaborated by the
International Commission	ORGANIZATION	, in experienced hands and under expert guidance of the highest order .

		Brief though this expedition was , its results are of far more significance than those of any other since that of the Challenger .

		Some of the discoveries recorded are the detec - tion of tidal currents in the deep sea far from land , running a clock-wise course throughout the day ; the accurate measurement and analysis , by means of the centrifuge , of the very minute life in ocean waters which has usually escaped detection even with the finest silk nets ; the de - termination by photographic plates of the depth to which light of different parts of the spectrum penetrates the ocean waters , and a new concep - tion of this `` light floor '' of the sea and its relation to the coloration , distribution , and move - ments of the denizens of the deep .

		The collec - tions brought up by the vastly more efficient types of collecting apparatus used by the `` Michael Sars '' afforded not only many inter - esting and bizarre types of fishes and other animals new to science , but also more accurate determinations of the vertical distribution and relative abundance of the various elements in the population of the open sea .

		Throughout the work there is constant corre - lation of the results with the discoveries of earlier workers in the same field , and many suggestions as to the problems requiring further work for their solution .

		The book is written for the intel - ligent reader , and is an authoritative epitome of our present knowledge of the sea , its physical constants , environmental features , of the struc - ture and composition of the ocean floor , and of the varied life of the sea and the factors which condition its occurrence and distribution .

		Not - withstanding its composite authorship , the work is uniformly well written , and is never lacking in interest .

		It is superbly illustrated with many original drawings and colored plates , as well as with maps revised in accordance with the latest data .

		The Challenger Society for the Promotion of the
Study of Oceanography	ORGANIZATION	has prepared , under the able editorship of its secretary , Dr.
G. Herbert Fowler	PERSON	, a useful work on '' The Science of the Sea , '' intended to serve as a hand - book of practical oceanography for both profes - sional and amateur scientists interested in the ocean .

		It is a scientific treatise , compiled by eminent authorities , on the various phases of the exploration of the marine world .

		It is authori - tative , up to date , and comprehensive in its scope .

		Technicalities are so reduced or eliminated that one need not be a specialist in order to use the work intelligently .

		The questions that arise whenever a scientific cruise of even slight pro- portions is undertaken are numerous and per - plexing .

		The results of practical experience in matters of outfit , equipment , collecting methods for plants and animals , instruments for oceano - graphic work with soundings , salinities , temper - atures , and currents , are here assembled in convenient form for reference .

		The exploration of the air , water , shore , sea bottom , the plants and animals of the sea , details of yacht equip - ment , etc. , are dealt with , and there are useful directions for dredging and trawling , for fishing at sea , and for the preservation of marine organ - isms .

		A chapter on whales and seals discusses also the scientific bases for the reported existence of sea serpents .

		Valuable suggestions for record - ing scientific data are added by the editor .

		The pages include conversion tables of nautical measurements in English and metric units , a classified list of manufacturers and dealers sup - plying equipment for marine expeditions , a list of important books on the subject , and a list of the marine biological stations of the world .

		The volume will not only be of great assistance to all scientists concerned in those fields which have to 332 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, do with the ocean , but should also serve to in - crease popular interest in the life of the sea and in the exploration of its secrets on the part of amateurs whose facilities to render service to science in this direction are often excellent , and whose aid is so often gladly given when adequate direction is available .

ATWOOD KOFOID	PERSON	.

		THE 3STEW
GRAXT WHITE SHAKESPEARE	ORGANIZATION	.

		* Were it only as a tribute to American schol - arship , this new edition of Shakespeare should be welcome .

		Though
Verplanck	LOCATION	and
Hudson	PERSON	may not be forgotten ,
Richard Grant	PERSON	White was as surely the first notable American Shake - spearean editor as Dr.
Furness	PERSON	, lately passed away , was the second .

		White was many things besides dramatic and musical critic , journal - ist , linguist , and novelist ; but it is mainly his work in the Shakespearean field that has kept his name alive .

		We are carried back more than fifty years to a time when scholarship and literature , and literature and journalism , were not yet divorced in our land , when professors wrote poetry unashamed , and newspaper corre - spondents might quote
Virgil	PERSON	with full editorial approval .

		White was a product of those condi - tions , neither debarred by his inbred culture from an influential active career nor yet estranged by the distractions of such a career from scholarly pursuits .

		His edition of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was pre - pared during the most tumultuous years of our history , when White himself was doing much by his `` Yankee Letters ! '

		to the
London	LOCATION	`` Specta - tor '' to set the cause of the North in a clearer light before the British public .

		White 's critical interest in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	was aroused by the publication of
Collier	PERSON	's notorious `` discoveries '' of marginal corrections in an old Folio copy , the claim of which to any special deference he vigorously denied , publishing his arguments at considerable length .

		He then set about editing Shakespeare himself , completing the work in twelve volumes .

		We are informed by
Jaggard	ORGANIZATION	's '' Shakespeare Bibliography '' that the undertaking was financed by
T. P. Barton	PERSON	, founder of the
Boston Shakespeare Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		Lowell , then editor of the newly-launched `` At - lantic Monthly , '' reviewed the early volumes in
1859	DATE	, and deliberately pronounced the edition * THE NEW RICHARD GRANT WHITE SHAKESPEARE .

		Revised , supplemented , and annotated by
William P. Trent	PERSON	,
Benjamin W. Wells	PERSON	, and
John B. Henneman	PERSON	.

		In twelve volumes .

		Illustrated .

		Boston : Little ,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` the best hitherto published . ''

		This was in the generation of Knight ,
Collier	PERSON	,
Dyce	PERSON	, and Staun - ton , all of whom preceded the
Cambridge	LOCATION	editors .

		White 's text was characterized by a regard for the general superiority of the
First Folio	ORGANIZATION	, duly tempered with a sense of its defects ; by great acuteness in eliciting the meaning of obscure passages ; and by occasional boldness in emen - dation .

		He was really a pioneer in his deter - mined restoration of Elizabethan forms and spellings whenever modernization threatened to impair either sense or beauty .

		He was the first , for example , to restore the possessive it , and to reduce to regularity the manifest intention of the Folio printers in respect to the pronunciation or elision of e in the termination ed .

		Not always of course , was his judgment sure .

		In so characteristic a Shakespearean phrase as '' Now is he turned orthography '' -LRB- Much Ado , ii .

		3 .

		2 1 -RRB- , he deserted both Quarto and Folio for
Rowe	PERSON	's emendation , `` orthographer . ''

		And in the equally characteristic `` It were an alms to hang him '' -LRB- Ibid .

		164 -RRB- , he followed
Collier	PERSON	's folio , printing `` It were an alms -LSB- - deed -RSB- to hang him . ''

		It may be said in passing that he adopted more than a hundred readings from
Collier	PERSON	's folio marginalia , a sufficient evidence that he was willing to accept that critic 's emendations on their own merits .

		The volumes were pro- vided with introductions and notes , a memoir of Shakespeare , an essay on his genius , and a his - torical sketch of the text ; and all this matter has been faithfully retained in the present new edition , with only such editing as the additional light of fifty years seems to require .

		The '' Me - moirs '' read a little oddly in this day of cold documentary biography : `` To the now childless couple there came consolation and a welcome care in their first-born son , whom , on the
26th of April , 1564	DATE	, they christened and called
William	PERSON	.

		... Of the day of his birth , there exists , and probably there was made , no record .

		Why should it have been otherwise ?

		He was only the son of a Warwickshire yeoman , '' etc. .

		Yet the very slight annotation that has been called for on the part of the revisers testifies alike to
White	ORGANIZATION	's thoroughness and accuracy , and to the meagreness of later additions to our knowledge .

		Before examining the editorial work of this new edition , it should be noted that White , late in life , agreed with another publisher to apply his ripened scholarship to the task of revision , the result of which was the Riverside edition of
1883	DATE	.

		The text of the `` Riverside '' shows countless variations from his earlier text in the minor details of punctuation , etc. , and appears
1912	DATE	.

		J THE DIAL 333 to have been set up from
the Globe	ORGANIZATION	edition of the
Cambridge	LOCATION	editors , with which it tallies closely in these details .

		At the same time , it pre - serves the more distinctive features of White 's first text , and there is abundant evidence to sup - port his statement that the revision had received `` in the most minute particulars his careful attention . ''

		Though stoutly asserting his dis - trust of all conjecture , he ventured upon several emendations bolder than any in his first text .

		Thus , the famous `` dram of eale '' which `` Doth all the noble substance of a doubt To his owne scandle '' -LRB- Hamlet , i. 4.36 -RRB- becomes '' The dram of evil Doth all the noble substance oft adulter To his own scandal . ''

		And any one familiar with Prince
Hal	PERSON	's rebuke to Falstaff , '' Peace , chewet , peace ! ''

		-LRB- 1
Henry IV.	ORGANIZATION	, v. 1 .

		29 -RRB- , will experience some conflict of emotions when he reads '' Peace , suet , peace ! ''

		Likewise , to
Celia	PERSON	's question , '' But is all of this for your father ? ''

		-LRB- As You Like It , i. 3 .

		10 -RRB- ,
Rosalind	PERSON	is not permitted to give the tra - ditional answer , '' No , some of it is for my child 's father , '' but * `` t '' No , some of it is for my father 's child . ''

		This change , he declared , was not made on any ground of
Rosalind	PERSON	's delicacy , but solely because the text does not give the fitting spontaneous reply .

		It is very certain that
White	ORGANIZATION	's judgment in these matters was never warped by sentiment , as Dr.
Furness	PERSON	's sometimes was .

		For prosaic passages , at least , the more prosaic interpreta - tion was likely to meet his approval .

		When
Benedick	ORGANIZATION	suspects
Claudio	PERSON	of being in love , be - cause , forsooth , '' When was he wont to wash his face ? ' '

		White accepted the words quite literally , remarking that in
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's time our race had not yet abandoned itself to a reckless use of water .

		Lowell , never over-reverent himself when there was any opportunity for a jest , protested against this vulgarizing of
Benedick	ORGANIZATION	's meaning , maintaining that '' wash '' referred to cosmetics .

		But there is no evidence that White ever heeded the protest .

		And the present writer feels that if he could have submitted to White a very simple interpretation of one of
Lear	PERSON	's mad utterances , '' We '11 go to supper i ' the morning '' the interpretation , namely , that the neglect of
Lear	PERSON	's daughters in not having din - ner ready for him on time is still rankling in his mind , he would have found one sym - pathetic listener .

		Turning now to the new edition which bears the imprint of the same house that issued the first , fifty years ago we find it to be sub - stantially a reprint of that first edition , with occasional slight variations in the text , and with the original notes edited and often abridged to make room for others added by the revisers .

		As for the text itself , it is hard to see wherein it has gained by this revision , since the work ap - pears to have been done with either too little care , or too much caution , to justify its being done at all .

		For example , the opportunity was not taken to throw out the disfiguring `` alms -LSB- - deed -RSB- '' mentioned above , though White him - self discarded it in his own revision .

		We still have
White	ORGANIZATION	's earlier punctuation in `` moving , delicate , '' and '' mannerly , modest , '' though he later agreed with the
Cambridge	LOCATION	editors in think - ing that '' moving-delicate '' and '' mannerly - modest '' better express
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's intention .

		We still have the nonsense of '' Doth not the gentleman Deserve as full , as fortunate a bed , As ever Beatrice shall couch upon ? ''

		though here again White , along with the
Cambridge	LOCATION	editors , reverted to the correct original texts , expelling the intruded first comma .

		And we still have the old spellings in '' Full fadom five thy father lies , '' and '' With twenty mortal mur - thers on their crowns , '' which White -LRB- very un - reasonably , we think , even in his day -RRB- insisted on retaining .

		The textual variations that have been admitted are faithfully indicated , but usually with nothing to tell whether they are alterations adopted by
White	ORGANIZATION	himself in his second edition , or new alterations made by the revisers .

		Indeed , the second , or Riverside edition , gets rather scant courtesy ; there is even , for example , no hint of
White	ORGANIZATION	's emenda - tion of the famous '' dram of eale '' passage mentioned above .

		The revisers ' own notes are marked by great caution .

		As gleanings from the contributions of modern editors , they are useful , but there is seldom a note of independent value .

		Modesty , of course , was to be preserved , in deference to the scholar whose merit they have so handsomely acknowledged .

		Yet it seems , for instance , a little naive to remark , upon Hamlet 's '' too too solid flesh , '' that `` White collected several passages in which adverbs were used in this way ' with inten - sifying iteration , ' '' when every reader of
Eliza	PERSON	- bethan literature knows that these reduplications were plentiful as blackberries , and that it is rather our modern ears that find a peculiar inten - sification in them .

		Again , when
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	writes -LRB- Sonnet II . -RRB-

		, `` This fair child of mine Shall sum my count , and make my old excuse , '' we are told in a note that '' old is obscure , pos - 334 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, sibly it means ' complete , ' see Wyndham . ''

		But `` my old excuse '' means simply '' excuse for my age , '' an elliptical form of expression that can be paralleled in Shakespeare a hundred times over .

		There appears to be a change in the character of the notes in the last few volumes , beginning with '' Hamlet , '' which may be due to the unfor - tunate death of Professor
Henneman	PERSON	while the work was in progress .

		Of course , the purpose of the revisers was merely to bring the work up to date , without making any profession of afford - ing new light .

		The sum of the matter is that for the Shakespearean student who has access to
White	ORGANIZATION	's own editions , this new edition , how - ever scholarly and accurate in the main , is negligible .

		But for the Shakespearean reader and book - lover , it is quite otherwise .

		The publishers have cooperated in producing a charming set of books .

		The type is very large , the lines are unobtrusively numbered , and the more import - ant notes are set at the bottom of the page .

		There are forty-eight illustrations , mostly Gou - pil photogravures from paintings , for example ,
Carl von Haff	PERSON	ten 's '' Elsinore '' and
Ford Madox Brown	ORGANIZATION	's '' Cordelia 's Portion . ''

		The set has been prepared in various forms , to suit various tastes and purposes ; but for the buyer of mod - erate means and for actual use , the '' pocket edition , '' in full limp leather , would appear to be very near perfection .

		The volumes differ from those of many such editions in possessing the dignity of real books , being large enough to look well on the shelf , though still small enough to be slipped conveniently into the pocket .

		It is the sort of edition that invites intimacy and begets a lifelong attachment .

		A WOULD-BE DISTURBER or THE WORLD 'S PEACE .

		* In the course of history the
Saxon	PERSON	race came to power and greatness .

		It still possesses its greatness , but has lost its power .

		This loss of power is to be attributed to several circum - stances , chief among which are the entrance of new powers into the international arena , the de - velopment of land-transportation making these newer nations independent of sea - transportation , and the decline of militancy among the Saxons themselves .

		This condition of things promises to end the greatness of the

		the dominance in world affairs to others .

		If the
Saxon	PERSON	race is to survive , it must abandon its foolish complacency , it must revive its mili - tancy through universal compulsory service im - posed by the government , and , finally , it must establish the military and naval unity of the Empire and the complete separation of the mili - tary and naval systems from the civil govern - ment of the dominions and the colonies .

		Thus runs the argument of '' General ''
Homer Lea	PERSON	's '' The Day of the Saxon . ''

		That it is not a new argument will be instantly obvious .

		But simple as the proposition is , these pages , which overflow with clever epigrams and other evi - dences of literary skill , befuddle rather than elucidate it by endless repetition and especially by the cocksure manner in which the author 's views are stated .

		This assurance does not con - fine itself to interpreting the past or construing the present in a definitive way ; the author even presumes to look into the future , and with the same finality of judgment .

		``
Japan	LOCATION	's maritime frontiers must extend eastward of the
Hawaiian Islands	LOCATION	and southward of the

Japan	LOCATION	draws near to her next war a war with

		In these days of deliberation and scientific reflection a mere assertion is not convincing , however categorically it may be made ; and hence the axiomatic way in which this believer in war and the inevitability of conflict asserts his opinions will not in the least impose upon cool and well-informed men .

		If this book came only into the hands of such it could simply be ignored .

		In the hands of others it may do real harm , for it bristles with a show of learning and scientific understanding of world affairs that will catch the unlearned with consequences none the less dire because of its flamboyant preten - sions .

		The author , though never affiliated with any recognized military organization , has in other connections posed as a '' lieutenant - general , '' and speaks as though he were an au - thority on military and naval matters .

		Phrases such as '' strategic triangles , '' '' arcs of invasion , '' '' angles of convergence , '' '' military spheres , '' `` specific arcs of the British circle , '' and for - midable explanatory charts constructed on prin - ciples which themselves need explanation , help to give a show of learning .

		If all the claims made by `` General ''
Lea	PERSON	were true , if all laws governing human relationships were to be ascertained so positively , this book would be one of the greatest helps known to man for obtaining universal peace ; for we should know exactly what not to do to avoid war .

		The prescient author gives a simple prescrip - tion by which the
Saxon	PERSON	may yet save himself ere it be too late -LRB- p. 239 -RRB- .

		Just how '' General ''
Lea	PERSON	knows so surely the way to save the
Saxon	PERSON	is of the highest interest , considering that '' in this epoch of war upon which the Empire is about to enter , hopes of peace are futile , con - stitutions and kings and gods are without avail '' -LRB- p. 24 -RRB- .

		Would that he had also told us why the
Saxon	PERSON	should be saved ; and what is to be done if some Teutonic or
Slavic Homer Lea	PERSON	teaches his race how to overthrow the
Saxon	LOCATION	.

		We find another inconsistency .

		The
Saxon	PERSON	has loudly boasted of the benefits he has con - ferred upon society by developing and protect - ing liberal institutions ; and , indeed , this is one of his chief titles to fame .

		Yet our author , who would save the
Saxon	PERSON	, states categorically that '' a nation retrogrades in universal political intel - ligence in proportion as its international affairs are controlled by popular prejudice '' -LRB- p. 26 -RRB- .

		That he should consistently oppose democracy is natural , for he realizes , as have others , that war and democracy are incompatible .

		direct gift of God , or a seduction of the devil , to a phenomenon of the larger viscera .

		To-day the tide is setting strongly toward the physio - logical side .

		We may feel an irresistible glow before
Plato	PERSON	's peerless and golden periods on the meaning of beauty ; but for a reasoned explanation we turn to the applied results of individual observation or laboratory research , although not a few conservatives still resent what Bosanquet calls '' analytical intermeddling with the most beautiful things we enjoy . ''

		Our present volume embodies many experi - ences and a few conclusions of two talented observers , who have enjoyed admirable opportu - nities for the leisurely appreciation of European galleries and are also familiar with the litera - ture of the subject and the methods of aesthetic investigation in German and American labora - tories .

		Furthermore , the well-known personal - ity of `` Vernon Lee '' -LRB- Miss Violet
Paget	PERSON	, who is the senior editor , so to speak -RRB- inclines one to turn a ready ear to any of her views on art or literature .

		The nucleus of the book is an essay printed in
1897	DATE	under the caption , `` Beauty and Ugliness . ''

		To this have been added chapters on `` Anthropomorphic ^ Esthetics , '' '' ^ Esthetic Empathy , '' `` The Central Problem of Esthet - ics , '' and '' ^ Esthetic .

		Responsiveness , its
Varia	PERSON	- tions and Accompaniments . ''

		This last , which is the longest chapter , consists of extracts from gallery diaries of ``
Vernon Lee	PERSON	, '' giving the `` rough material of personal experience '' that has gone to mould her view .

		From the foregoing it will be clear that any serious discussion of differences of opinion would imply a treatise equal in length to the 376 pages of the text , so we must limit ourselves to a very brief summary .

		The three central points examined by the authors are as follows : 1 .

		^ Esthetic perception of visible shapes is agreeable or disagreeable because it involves alterations in great organic functions , princi - pally respiratory and equilibratory .

		Such is
Miss Paget	LOCATION	's wording of the aesthetic application of the
Lange	PERSON	-
James	PERSON	theory of bodily emotion .

		2 .

		The phenomenon of aesthetic Einjuhlung -LRB-
Lipps	PERSON	-RRB- , or , as Professor
Titchener	PERSON	has trans - lated it , Empathy . ''

		In looking at the Doric column , for instance , and its entablature , we are attributing to the lines and surfaces , to the spatial forms , those dynamic experiences which we should have were we to put our bodies into similar conditions . ''

		The exist - 336 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, ence of muscular adjustments more considerable than those of the eye , ' resulting in a sense of direction and velocity to the lines thus per - ceived . ''

		Of course the three theories implied by these headings have been the subject of no little discussion for many years ; but the interesting feature is that our authors before publishing the original essay on `` Beauty and Ugliness '' had arrived at their conclusions quite independ - ently , not from oral information or from publi - cations , but `` by accidental self - observation in the course of art historical and practical artistic studies . ''

		As to the validity and relative importance of the three lines of explanation , our two observers have manifestly experienced no little fluctuation of opinion .

		In the final chapter , however ,
Miss Paget	LOCATION	concludes that the dynamic-emphatic in - terpretation is to be emphasized , but that '' for - mal dynamic empathy '' is due , '' not to actually present movements and muscular-organic sen - sations , but to the extremely abstract ideas of movement and its modes residual from count - less individual and possibly racial experiences . ''

		Yet she still attributes importance to imitative movements and mimetic-organic sensations , be - cause they may '' possibly afford a clue to the origin of the odd fact of our associating move - ment and energy with objects and patterns . ''

		And , finally , the aesthetic pleasantness or un - pleasantness of shapes is not due to eye move - ment or any movements connected therewith , but to '' the mental process of formal dynamic empathy , to the interplay of forces suggested by those shapes , and to the pleasantness or unpleasantness of such inner dramas of abstract movement-and-energy associations . ''

		At this point , assuming it is ever reached , the clear-sighted reader will conclude either that the reviewer is impatient or that we are discussing one of the books that are the despair of all honest critics .

		There is more truth in the latter alternative .

		The volume contains a wealth of material , with a number of important conclu - sions , and it is better to have it in this form than not to have it at all ; but the reader has to mine most gropingly for the gold , and the friendliest of reviewers can not blink the fact that the whole series of essays should have been recast and given to us in a finished form .

		After all , the student of aesthetics and the gen - eral reader alike have a right to demand that even the most capable authors shall make their presentation as clear and helpful as a difficult subject will allow .

		The book is in the main well printed , although there is an unusual number of errors in the Ger - man quotations .

		It is sparingly but adequately illustrated , and provided with a good index .

		REGENERATING OUR JUDICIARY .

		* When the
American Colonies	ORGANIZATION	separated from
England	LOCATION	they named among their grievances a tyrannical executive and an insecure judiciary .

		In setting up state governments for themselves , the Americans sought to guard against the former evil by reducing the executive to little more than a mere figure-head , while making the legislature almost omnipotent .

		The real grievance in the case of the judiciary was that it was subservient to a power over which they had no control , and whose interests were different from those of the Americans .

		Failing to discern this , they took the control of the judiciary entirely away from the executive and made it almost independent of the legislature and of the people .

		The mistake of a weak executive soon became apparent , and was avoided in defining the position and power of the President of the
United States	LOCATION	.

		Gradually the state executives were also elevated in position and power , while the tendency ever since has been to limit the power of the legislatures .

		Within recent years popular distrust of the law - making bodies has become very general .

		In some states this distrust has become so acute as to lead to the adoption of the Initiative and the Referendum , the professed object of which is to recover for the people the power of government .

		Of late the third division of our government , the judiciary , has also been subjected to searching criti - cism .

		This criticism has been general , ranging all the way from our most conservative citizens to the most radical agitators .

		Even President
Taft	PERSON	has suggested that a reform in procedure is needed .

		Practically all the party platforms have had some - thing to say on the subject .

		Labor leaders have made their complaints , the state executives have gone so far as to appoint a committee to voice their protest , and even dissenting judges have joined the army of the discontented .

		The existence of the distrust of the judiciary can not be denied .

		That the power to void laws is a usurpation is in the main the view of Mr.
Gustavus Myers	PERSON	also , though he does not hold without qualification that it is a usurpation on the part of the

		Taking advantage of that fact , he thinks , the f ramers of the Constitution so constructed that instru - ment that the judiciary , which they expected to be the bulwark of protection for property against democ - racy , must inevitably exercise the power .

Charles A. Beard	PERSON	in the `` Political Science Quarterly '' for
March , 1912	DATE	, and his work has been greatly supplemented and strength - ened by Professor
Andrew C. McLaughlin	PERSON	.

		After citing numerous cases of the exercise of the power by the state courts prior to
1787	DATE	and giving quota - tions from contemporaries in support of it and ex - plaining the origin of the practice in
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	of the
United States	LOCATION	, he gives the most rational explanation of the custom which the present reviewer has yet seen .

		`` They -LSB- the courts -RSB- asserted this power , '' he says , '' not because they were superior to the legislature , but because they were independ - ent . ''

		This makes it a natural consequence of put - ting into practice the theory of the separation of power .

		He might have continued and pointed out that the present exalted position of the judiciary is largely due to the tendency toward supine submis - sion on the part of the executive and the legislature .

		At least one executive declared that he had as much right to his opinion of the Constitution as the
Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	did to his , and refused to enforce the court 's decree .

		It can not be denied that the courts have often strained the constitutional point in order to declare void a law of which the judges disapproved .

		Such is the only rational explanation of decisions upholding laws regulating the hours and conditions of labor for women and children , and overturning similar laws when designed to protect adult males .

		The courts say that the rule of reason must govern such laws , and by these decisions they have arrogated to themselves the sole power to exercise reason in such cases .

		The next step is to legislation by judicial decision .

		Many cases are cited by Mr.
Roe	PERSON	and Mr.
Myers	PERSON	, but the most notorious is that of the Standard Oil case .

		In
1897	DATE
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	, speaking through Mr.
Justice Peckham	PERSON	, said that they were `` asked to read into the -LSB-
Sherman	PERSON	-RSB- act by way of judicial legislation an exception that is not placed there by the lawmaking branch of the government , '' that is , insert the word '' unreasonable '' ; but this they re - fused to do .

		Mr.
Justice White	ORGANIZATION	dissented .

		Some years later , when Mr.
Justice Peckham	PERSON	and his sup - porters of
1897	DATE	were gone , Mr.
Justice White	PERSON	was elevated to the position of
Chief Justice	ORGANIZATION	and made glad the hearts of the corporations by reading in the word '' unreasonable '' by way of judicial legislation .

		The poor man is not on an equality with the rich in the courts , not because he has no money to employ an attorney or bribe the judges for outright bribery is very rare , but because the judges , having for - merly served as corporation attorneys , naturally lean toward the interests and think in terms of vested rights .

		With them whatever has been still is right , and they continue to draw upon precedents hoary with age .

		Our own courts still cite English prece - dents long since outlawed there , for example , the Priestly Case , which is not yet fully abandoned here .

		Well may the people exclaim , '' Who shall deliver us from this body of death ? ''

		the dead hand of an unjust past .

		It will not be surprising at no distant day to hear the lawyers themselves praying for a second Alexandrian fire to consume the court re - ports , and for legislation to prohibit , or at least greatly limit , their future publication .

		Those who suppose that judges formerly lived in the clear empyrean , above politics and the thought of sordid wealth , will be surprised , not to say shocked , at the revelations made by Mr.
Myers	PERSON	in his '' His - tory of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		The main purpose of his book is to show the close relationship that has always existed between the judiciary and the inter - ests .

		Some of his statements are not altogether con - vincing , but many others are .

		In consequence , many of our heroes begin to lose some of that sanctity with which they have hitherto been enshrined .


Hamilton	PERSON	,
James Wilson	PERSON	, the Morrises ,
Livingstons	LOCATION	,
Schuylers	ORGANIZATION	,
Gorham	LOCATION	,
Dayton	LOCATION	, and others become ordinary mor - tals following the devious ways of gain , some of them through fraud and deceit .

		The most common avenues of wealth in those days were the acquire - ment of vast tracts of land , trade , and banking .

		The very first justices of
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	,
Wilson	PERSON	, Gushing ,
Blair	PERSON	,
Iredell	LOCATION	,
Johnson	PERSON	,
Paterson	LOCATION	, and Chase , are shown to have been allied directly or indirectly with the men following these paths of wealth .

		Even
Jay	PERSON	, hitherto regarded as no less immaculate than the ermine which fell upon his shoulders , was so intimately connected by inherit - ance , marriage , and business alliance with the land - grabbers that one may be pardoned for having some doubts about his disinterestedness .

		As for
James Wilson	PERSON	, lately praised by Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	as a learned jurist , he is found to have been a shrewd Scotchman concerned in almost every questionable land deal of any magnitude , from that of the half-million acre deal in the
Connecticut Reserve	ORGANIZATION	and the three - million acre transactions of the
Holland Company	ORGANIZATION	in
New York	LOCATION	, to the stupendous fraud of thirty-five million acres in the
Yazoo Land Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		His banking experience in
Pennsylvania	LOCATION	, when the legis - 338 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, lature repealed the charter of his bank , taught him a lesson , hence the clause in the Constitution forbid - ding laws impairing the obligations of a contract , of which he was the author .

		As for
John Marshall	PERSON	, Mr.
Myers	PERSON	has left prec - ious little of that halo which so long surrounded his head and which Mr.
Jesse F. Orton	PERSON	did so much to destroy a few years ago .

		It is impossible even to outline here the story of his questionable acts .

		From one or two we may learn the character of the rest .

		Shortly after the
Yazoo	LOCATION	grant was secured from the
Georgia	LOCATION	legislature by corrupt methods ,
Wilson	PERSON	and his associates hurriedly transferred several mil - lion acres to a group of
New England	LOCATION	capitalists .

		When the next legislature wrathfully rescinded the grant , these purchasers set up the defense that it was impairing a contract and was injuring innocent purchasers .

		It is a well-settled principle of law that fraud vitiates a contract , and that there is no such thing as an innocent receiver of stolen goods .

		If a man buys stolen goods in ignorance of the theft he not only secures no title , but must suffer the loss .

		But
Marshall	PERSON	complacently passed over the bribery as a mere fiction , and protected the `` innocent pur - chasers '' by declaring the original grant a contract and therefore irrepealable .

		An individual who has had his horse stolen may have a right to recover it even from an '' innocent purchaser '' but , by some sort of legerdemain , when the government , that is , the people , has been robbed of land , the innocent pur - chaser gets a vested right and the public must lose .

		At this time
Marshall	PERSON	had his heart set upon ac - quiring `` Leeds Manor , '' on some of Lord
Fairfax	LOCATION	's stealings , the claim to which he had bought .

		When
Marshall	PERSON	's case came up he absented himself while Story , who had recently lobbied some bank charters through the
Massachusetts	LOCATION	legislature for himself and others , rendered the decision .


Virginia	LOCATION	had confiscated the property of British subjects and did not allow aliens to hold land in her borders .

		Yet Story held that the
Fairfax	LOCATION	claim was valid .

		When the
Virginia Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	denounced the decision and defied the court , Story calmly reaffirmed his own decision and
Marshall	PERSON	got his manor .

		One good turn deserves another .

		These decisions about the impairment of contracts and the innocent pur - chasers opened the floodgates of fraud which have not yet been closed .

		A few years after the
Fairfax	LOCATION	case one of Lord
Baltimore	LOCATION	's heirs was suing
Charles Carroll	PERSON	for quit rents .

		After the foregoing decision one may reasonably be astonished to find Story upholding the
Maryland	LOCATION	law which abolished quit rents .

		Having been true to the land-grabbers , the cor - porations , and the slaveholders ,
Marshall	PERSON	was fol - lowed by
Taney	PERSON	, the special tool of the last class .

		Then came Chase , put in to validate the anti-slavery legislation and to uphold the interests of his clients , the bankers .

		Such is the meaning of the first legal tender case .

		But the railroads did not like this decision , and they had their attorneys ,
Bradly	PERSON	and Strong , appointed to reverse it .

		And ever since , the corporate interests have generally managed to keep on the bench a majority favorable to them .

		Mr.
Myers	PERSON	nowhere charges
the Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	judges with venal corruption .

		On the contrary he says that , on the whole , they have been peculiarly free from it when it was all too common elsewhere .

		But he does charge that they have been dominated by the ever-expanding capitalist class , which has worked its will by ceaseless fraud and bribery .

		In many instances they have been the paid attorneys of the interests before going on the bench , and they have naturally leaned to them rather than to the common man .

		No wonder , then , that the courts have , in many cases , blocked the wheels of progressive legislation .

		What is the remedy ?

		The recall of judicial deci - sions , say Mr.
William L. Ransom	PERSON	and Mr.
Theo	PERSON	- dore
Roosevelt	PERSON	.

		When Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	first made this proposal it was received by many with derision and denunciation .

		But of the many propositions he has hurled at the American people of late , the recall of judicial decisions rightly understood seems by all odds the best .

		To set this proposition before the people in its true light is the object of Mr.
Ransom	PERSON	's book on `` Majority Rule and the Judiciary . ''

		Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	never has advocated , as many have assumed without investigation , the indiscriminate recall of decisions .

		Suits at law and criminal cases are entirely out of consideration ; but when the courts set themselves in opposition to the will of the people as expressed in a law by declaring the law unconstitutional , then the people should have the right , after due delibera - tion , of saying whether the court 's decision shall remain , the law of the land .

		This , Mr.
Ransom	PERSON	declares , is far less revolutionary than the recall of judges , which is rapidly growing in favor .

		To re - call the judge would not recall his decision , the real end in view .

		Often there is no real occasion to recall the judge , for he may be an honorable and upright man , who honestly believes the law uncon - stitutional .

		Many laws are overturned by a divided court .

		Then may not the people at least decide between the majority and the minority ?

		The trouble with Mr.
Roosevelt	PERSON	's proposition is , not that it is too revolutionary , but that it does not go far enough .

		He would apply it only to state courts .

		Why should even the
Supreme Court	ORGANIZATION	be exempt ?

		No court capable of rendering so foolish a decision as was handed down last
spring	DATE	in the mimeograph case -LRB-
A. B. Dick Company	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- deserves any immunity .

		So outraged was the country that
Congress	ORGANIZATION	at once took steps to recall this decision as far as applicable to future cases by amending the patent law on which the court claimed to have based its action .

		The recall of judges and of decisions will help to remedy matters ; but we need most of all to reclaim our courts from the control of corporation attorneys , who naturally think in terms of corporate interests .


DAVID Y. THOMAS	PERSON	.

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 339 BRIEFS OK NEW BOOKS .

		The typical That the informal essay is once American and more in high favor is indicated by some others .

		j.j ie j ar g e number of collections of essays now being published .

		Even our novelists are turning to this gracious form of literature ; among them , Mr.
Meredith Nicholson	PERSON	, whose collection of reprinted ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' papers bears the title , `` The Provincial American '' -LRB-
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Three of these essays `` The Provincial American , '' ''
Edward Eggleston	PERSON	, '' and `` A Provincial Capital '' are concerned with the ideals and achievements of the
Hoosier State	ORGANIZATION	, where , according to the author , one finds , if anywhere , '' typical Americans . ''

		The typical American is provincial , for '' we have no national political , social , or intellectual centre , '' and every county is a unit , with its own courthouse , town hall , churches , school-houses .

		The typical American is , therefore , self-sufficient , so self-sufficient , in - deed , that the metropolitan tendencies of the rail - way , the telegraph , etc. , are not likely to disturb our romantic variety .

		The typical American is also ex - tremely curious , eager to know what he can know of art , of politics , of other phases of human activity .

		He is fond of brooding and discussion , and is in - creasingly conscious of his own importance in our democratic society ; the sense of the mass the '' fatalism of the multitude , '' in Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's phrase is virtually a danger that has been averted .

		He has instinctive common sense , and , despite the mis - givings of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	, can be relied upon to do the right thing .

		All of which is perhaps mainly another and illuminating version of the frequent re - mark that our farmers are the foundation of Amer - ican excellence .

		From that city of estimable men and women , twentieth-century
Indianapolis	LOCATION	, with its background of `` Hoosier Olympians '' -LRB- of whom Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	writes entertainingly in the initial essay -RRB- , come these cheering and , we believe as well as hope , true views of the modern American .

		In only one re - spect is the author on decidedly uncertain ground , when he tells us that '' the most appalling thing about us Americans is our complete sophistication '' ; com - pared with us , he asserts , the English , the French , the Italians are simply children .

		His evidence is our insistence on '' bigness , '' our farmers ' languidly ready adjustment to the automobile , our children 's cool condescension in the use of the telephone .

		This evidence , though pertinent , is insufficient .

		If it is true that we are sophisticated in our attitude to auto - mobiles , skyscrapers , and other insignia of our ma - terial development , it is likewise true that we are little more than `` children '' in our attitude to lit - erature , music , painting , and the other tokens of intellectual and spiritual activity .

		The English reviews still refer , justly if unpleasantly , to `` that quaint nawete which , since
Dickens	PERSON	wrote '
Martin Chuzzlewit	PERSON	, ' has never ceased to astound the inhabit - ants of older countries . ''

		Compared with the French , the English are naive in the world of ideas ; how far are we , then , from the humane sophistication of the French !

		Aside from this unconscious outcrop - ping , on Mr.
Nicholson	PERSON	's part , of `` the American brag , '' his views on American life are both wisely reasoned and agreeably presented ; he is , indeed , unmistakably one of our foremost essayists . ''

		Should Smith Go to Church ? ''

		is perhaps the most pene - trating of the essays ; when it first appeared in print it evoked so much discussion that no more need be said of it here . ''

		Experience and the Calendar '' and `` The Spirit of Mischief '' are delightful but too fragile .

		The `` Confessions of a ` Best-Seller ' '' is disappointing , and , one might add , typically American in its nawete .

		Dr.
Isador H. Coriat	PERSON	analyzes `` The H y steria of Lad y Macbeth '' -LRB-
Moffat , Yard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in terms of the modern study of the abnormal mind .

		Hers is a case of hys - teria involving alternating personalities and attacks of somnambulism , in which the central inciting theme of the disorder breaks through to expression .

		The sleep-walking scene is but the culmination of the psychopathic state , the genesis and progress of which the drama discloses .

		Unsatisfied longing finds a substitute in ambition , and is reenforced by the suggestion of supernormal , mystic , and prophetic agencies .

		Macbeth is thus affected , and contagiously induces a yet more marked abnormality in his pre - disposed spouse .

		In her case the childlessness plays a direct part in the complex .

		The climax is but the inevitable issue of the slowly incubating psycho - pathic invasion ; and the stages thereof give evi - dence of the growing abnormalities , the unsuccessful repressions , the increasing dissociation of mental states .

		Hallucination of sight and smell in both sub - jects , the automatic washing of the hands in
Lady Macbeth	LOCATION	, the recurrent troubled dreams , the rein - statement of the guilty scenes in momentary alarms , are realistic details true to the diagnosis .

		In all this the insight of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	receives an unusual tribute , though the view is anticipated in other lan - guage by one not unacquainted with the darker side of the mind ,
Coleridge	PERSON	.

		It is not at all implied that the dramatist followed consciously the sequence of episodes in the elaboration of his `` case , '' but only that the same laws that dominate the unfoldment itself are reflected in the dramatic sense that guides the creative impulse of literary portraiture .

		And at this point critics will differ in their preferences of interpretation , some doubting whether the psycho - analysis replaces the interpretation on the level of motives weighed in the every-day balance , others finding a corroboration of such insight by the nicer instruments of science .

		The study is interesting in either light ; and the evidence is set forth with conviction .

		A great ^ * s now ^ en vears since Dr. Tal - evangeiist mage , one of the world 's most popu - seif-portraved .

		j ar preachers , was rather suddenly cut off , at the height of his fame and in the fulness of his remarkable powers , and his voice , which had won the attention of a world-wide audience , was .

		340 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, heard no more .

		He was seventy years old at the time of his death , but neither mind nor body had , until the very last , shown symptoms of senescence .

		Fortunately his own hand had prepared an account of his life up to his sixty-seventh year , and he had left notes and papers from which it was easily pos - sible for another to continue the record to the end .

		This final chapter has now been written by Mrs.
Talmage	PERSON	, and the completed work , `` T. De
Witt Talmage	PERSON	as I Knew Him '' -LRB- the '' I '' being of course the autobiographer himself -RRB- , is issued in attractive octavo form by
Messrs. E. P. Button & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Thomas De
Witt Talmage	PERSON	was born at
Middlebrook	LOCATION	,
New Jersey	LOCATION	, being the youngest of twelve children , and not too heartily welcomed by parents already hard - pressed to provide for his numerous brothers and sisters .

		After leaving school he fancied his talent to lie in the direction of the law , and accordingly studied for that profession , but soon discovered his true bent and was early started in the calling which he did so much to distinguish .

		His autobiography is written in that straightforward , vigorous , heart - to-heart style which won him such popularity as a speaker and writer .

		Shrewdness and humor , warm human feeling , and an abounding vitality speak in its pages .

		An exultant sense of his own unusual endowments shows itself , not in a way to offend , here and there .

		`` In the face of trial , '' he says in one place , '' God has always given me all but super - human strength . ''

		And elsewhere : '' My Gospel field was a big one .

		The whole world accepted the Gospel as I preached it , and I concluded that it did not make much difference where the pulpit was in which I preached . ''

		The burning of three successive buildings -LRB- each known as the
Brooklyn Tabernacle	LOCATION	-RRB- erected for his vast congregation in
Brooklyn	LOCATION	, seemed indeed to indicate that his pulpit was to be no sta - tionary one .

		Mrs.
Talmage	PERSON	's portion of the book , amounting to a quarter of the whole , is by no means the least interesting one .

		It presents the man as she and others of his intimates saw him , with apt selec - tions from his notes and other material .

		Good por - traits and an index are furnished .

		Under the curiosity-provoking title .

		f `` Also and Perhaps '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- Sir
Frank Swettenham	PERSON	has gathered a number of bright and readable sketches , some of them airy trifles from the society world , others glimpses of the author 's personal experiences , and still others more or less impersonal discussions of abstract questions .

		A few far-eastern descriptive sketches , such as one might look for in a book by a writer who has served as Resident-General of the
Federated Malay States	ORGANIZATION	, and as Governor of the Straits Settlements , and who is , moreover , the author of previous works entitled `` British Malaya , '' `` The Real Malay , '' and `` Malay Sketches , '' are to be found in the volume .

		Versatility and a considerable experience of life in various climes and among all sorts of people are among the characteristics illus - trated by these entertaining chapters .

		The two under the headings `` Also '' and `` Perhaps '' are in the form of sprightly dialogues between expert con - versationalists .

		Another , entitled '' Some Proverbs , '' which begins with a familiar Anglicism -LRB- `` Every one who thinks of what they say , either before or after they say it '' ... -RRB- , turns on the mutual contra - diction of certain popular aphorisms , as `` absence makes the heart grow fonder '' and `` out of sight out of mind , '' and also exposes the fallacy of certain other wise saws somewhat as
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	has discoursed in his humorous and sprightly fashion on sundry popular fallacies of the same sort .

		In a more serious vein , and with insight into the deeper realities , the author discusses `` first and last love , '' distinguishing between that first devouring but evanescent passion which represents `` the concentrated desires of mil - lions of ancestors striving through our poor bodies to indulge their special predilections for light hair or dark , brown eyes or blue , '' and the later and more lasting attachment in which , as he says , '' Never to misunderstand , that is the great secret .

		It covers so much .

		Not to expect the unreasonable , not to be disappointed with the obviously natural ; not to forget that however close in sympathy a man and woman may be , they are differently constituted and can not have identical inclinations at every moment of their lives ... Not to misunderstand , that is almost everything . ''

		The book is not only clever , in the best sense of the word ; it is also marked by sincerity and earnestness .

		The ancient Jt is positively refreshing to discover literature of that we have reached a stage in the
Israel	LOCATION	.

		discussion of the dry critical prob - lems of the Old Testament represented by such a volume as Dr.
Henry T. Fowler	PERSON	's `` History of the Literature of Ancient
Israel	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		For scores of years scholars have been wholly absorbed in the technique of biblical criticism , in the minutiae of
Israel	LOCATION	's ancient literature .

		This shop-work had to be done before any large discussion of the litera - ture could be presented .

		Dr.
Fowler	PERSON	has utilized the best results of years of study and experience of a long line of scholars .

		The analysis of the pro- gressive school of biblical criticism forms the woof of his fabric .

		He has likewise rightfully assumed among the Israelites a common Semitic inheritance for an explanation of many of the traditions , cus - toms , and rites of religion found mentioned in the fragment of the literature of the Old Testament .


Israel	LOCATION	was simply one of the smaller Semitic peo - ples of antiquity , whose relations with its neighbors were close and often intimate .

		Granting these conditions , the author then proceeds to arrange the fragments of Hebrew poetry , prophecy , and narra - tion into chronological order .

		As prefatory to each section he presents briefly what he considers to have been the historical subsoil out of which the present product sprang , and even introduces such specimens of other literature as the Babylonian deluge story , to vivify his text .

		Such a background to each kind of literature is important and necessary .

		But even
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIA1 , 341 all of this splendid presentation does not properly constitute a history of the literature of those times .

		Our conception of such a history would include a discussion in clear and succinct language of the rise , growth , and perpetuation of the thought , religious and otherwise , in ancient
Israel	LOCATION	.

		We should expect to find a coordination and articulation of the thought - life of
Israel	LOCATION	stretching throughout the entire period of its literary activity .

		Dr.
Fowler	PERSON	has not quite reached this ideal .

		Professor
C. Lloyd Morgan	PERSON	, in a experience t volume entitled '' Instinct and Expe - rience '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , returns to the insistent problem of the nature of the lower and the higher guidance of conduct , and the interpretation thereof as favoring the hypothesis of a system of ends or of mechanisms .

		Are instinct and intelli - gence separated by a chasm or united by an evolu - tionary bridge ?

		Is the verdict of science decisive for philosophy ?

		Or must science await and reflect the judgment of philosophic interpretation ?

		The controversy has long ceased to be one of terms or usage ; the dissensions , though critical and at times minute , are real .

		The significance of observation and of the lower end of the biological scale is con - ceded .

		Shall we carry back to the simple beginnings the concepts demanded by the higher issues in which we move , shaping them to the lowlier order of events ; or shall we find our clue in the lower , and in such , terms interpret the reconstruction of the higher ?

		For those prepared to follow the more detailed ramifications of this problem as it presents itself to the critical minds of the day , Professor
Morgan	PERSON	's book may be cordially recommended .

		Biologists have always had a taste for philosophy ; and in latter days philosophers have acquired an ear for the biological message .

		Yet the camps are dif - ferently organized .

		Romanticism has given way to realism in both ; but the new allegiance reflects the persistent diversity of temperamental predilection .


M. Bergson	PERSON	's `` vital impulse '' affects the biologist as a poetic intrusion rather than as a scientific concept .

		The man of science still clings to the study of pro- cess , and declines to take his interpretation from the study of sources , even though he may remove them from the region of the unknowable .

		Professor Mor - gan 's valuable contributions to the analytic phases of animal behavior give special interest and weight to the probabilities that appeal to his philosophical judgment .

		A criminal ^ * 8 8a ^ e to P re dict that no detec - latuver 's studies tive story of the season will prove of crime .

		more absorbingly interesting than the group of essays on criminal subjects by Mr.
Arthur Train	PERSON	, formerly Assistant District Attorney of
New York County	LOCATION	, published under the general caption , '' Courts , Criminals , and the Camorra '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- .

		Mr.
Train	PERSON	has a peculiarly breezy and vigorous style , which sometimes narrowly escapes vulgarity , and which for his present purpose is too strongly flavored with paradox ; but every page of the book is readable , and in its general conclusions it bears the stamp of authority .

		A chapter piquantly entitled `` The Pleasant Fiction of the Presumption of Innocence '' maintains , with some success , that the natural and reasonable thing to do , and the thing which as a matter of fact is always done , is to assume the prisoner to be guilty ; in a later essay in this same volume Mr. Train maintains the op - posite thesis with equal success .

		There is a curious chapter on '' Preparing a Criminal Case for Trial '' ; two statistical studies entitled , respectively , '' Sensa - tionalism and Jury Trials '' and `` Why Do Men Kill ? ''

		; two exciting chapters on the work of detec - tives ; and a final series on the
Camorra	LOCATION	, the
Viterbo	LOCATION	trials , the
Mafia	LOCATION	, and the criminal Italian element in
America	LOCATION	.

		The author attended a part of the
Viterbo	LOCATION	session in person , and his decidedly favora - ble account of Italian criminal procedure is probably much more trustworthy than the lurid newspaper `` stories '' which have hitherto provided most of our information on this subject .

		The earlier '' * have alwavs spoken of myself as journal of

Bashkirtseff	PERSON	.

		wr ites
Marie Bashkirtseff	PERSON	in her `` New Journal '' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		If she had been able to do this , as she asserted and perhaps believed she had done , her journal might have been valuable as well as curious ; but the unfortunate child had been promenaded from one end of
Europe	LOCATION	to the other , and kept so constantly on exhibition in hotels and at fashionable resorts , that every phrase she uttered , still more every sentence she wrote , was planned with a startling effect in view .

		It is not truth but extravagance that this morbid twelve-year - old feminine
Rousseau	PERSON	is seeking when she pens her Confessions .

		`` I have determined to end this book , '' she writes , `` for extravagant ideas rarely come to me in these days . ''

		This group of letters extends from
January , 1873	DATE	, to
February , 1876	DATE	, and deals with several more or less genuine love-affairs , the development of a singing voice whose defects had not yet been discovered , and dreary wanderings from
Paris	LOCATION	to Nice and from Nice to
Paris	LOCATION	, with a pur - poseless sojourn in
Rome	LOCATION	.

		These earlier letters have little value in themselves , although of course anything from so brilliant and poignant a writer as
Marie Bashkirtseff	PERSON	later came to be has a certain interest .

		This part of the `` Journal '' appeared in a French magazine two years ago , and
Miss Safford	LOCATION	's transla - tion is probably no more vague and stilted than the original , although she is once or twice clearly inac - curate and now and then entirely unintelligible .

		It takes a sprightly woman with a human interest in everything that is beautiful , and with a facile pen to sketch it , to produce such an entertaining little vol - ume as Miss
Jeannette Marks	PERSON	's `` Gallant Little Wales '' -LRB-
Houghton Miffltn Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The author 's in - terests are concentrated for the present in
North Wales	LOCATION	.

		She adopts the only sane method of study - 342 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, ing a people , she lives among them , observes their chief interests , their customs , their superstitions , their religious zeal , and their artistic temperament .

		She finds a fascination in the arrangements of their homes , the architecture of their hill-top churches , and the superb strength and character of their won - derful castles , such as
Carnarvon	LOCATION	,
Beau Maris	PERSON	, and
Conway	PERSON	.

		Her enthusiasm for
Wales	LOCATION	seems to have been either created or mightily stimulated by reading and pondering on the '' Mabinogion '' ; many of her reflections and comparisons are based on the state - ments made in that famous collection of history and folklore .

		The history , both ancient and modern , of the little commonwealth is a quarry for her nar - rative .

		Dr.
Samuel Johnson	PERSON	's trip through
North Wales	LOCATION	gives her an opportunity which she eagerly utilizes to sketch some of the most disagreeable traits of that otherwise great man .

		She pays her tribute to the marvellous nationalism of the Welsh people as seen in their annual musical festival , the
Eisteddfod	LOCATION	.

		Musicians , poets , and artists by nature , their patriot - ism for their own people shines out with greatest brilliancy in any Welsh event that appeals to their artistic or musical nature .

		The author intends to produce a companion volume dealing with
South Wales	LOCATION	.

		American T P ut the whole 8toI 7 of tn f origin history in and development of our nation into outline . -RSB-

		es8 than three hundred pages of moderate size , and at the same time to make the story thoroughly readable , is not an easy thing to do .

		This Mr.
Edwin W. Morse	PERSON	has undertaken in his '' Causes and Effects in American History '' -LRB- Scribner -RRB- , and the verdict must be that he has suc - ceeded in his undertaking .

		Of course the details have been left out .

		The Civil War occupies but twenty pages , and the Revolution but twelve ; yet the author has made these chapters interesting in manner and complete in outline from the side of cause and effect .

		Not everyone will agree with him in his interpretations , as he has had to touch many sharply controverted questions ; but he is fair in his treatment and in his judgments .

		The book is not confined to our political development , but traces also our industrial , commercial , and literary history down to the present year .

		It will hardly serve , as the author hopes , to interest young people in the subject , but it will be useful in interpreting our history to students and to readers who may have lost themselves in the details of the larger books .

		Records of the `` The Celts in Antiquity , '' by Mr.
Celts	PERSON	in Greek - m - - rv .

		.

		, .

		, , i .

		i and Latin ''
Dinan	LOCATION	, is one of the latest pub - literature .

		lications of the honored house of
Nutt	ORGANIZATION	, which under the wise inspiration of the late savant ,
Alfred Nutt	PERSON	, has done more than any other to make accessible the documents relating to Celtic and mediaeval romance .

		It is the first of three vol - umes which will present in convenient form all ac - counts of the Celts which are found in ancient Greek and Latin writers .

		An accompanying English trans - lation , though it does not always adequately repro - duce the original , will be of service to the general reader .

		Persons competent to use the book for in - dependent researches will consult the original Greek or Latin , which is always printed in full .

		The book will save investigators of Celtic antiquities much arduous toil in searching for the texts they want among numerous scattered and often rather inacces - sible volumes .

		It is interesting to observe that the accounts of the Celts handed down by Greeks and Romans agree with the life pictured in the oldest Irish sagas , not only in general outline , but even in rather minute details .

		One is not surprised to find that both describe in similar terms the method of fighting from the war chariot .

		But it is a note - worthy testimony , both to the authenticity of the Irish sagas , and to the solidarity of the ancient Celtic race , to find the Greek and Latin writers telling of the habit of Celtic warriors to strive for the '' hero 's portion '' at feasts , and of their tendency to resort to blood-shed in order to settle questions of precedence at the banquet , peculiarities which are related in the Irish sagas .

		Mr I ana 's Perhaps the most important work of brie / history
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's declining years was of
Scotland	LOCATION	.

		^ is `` History of
Scotland	LOCATION	from the Roman Conquest . ''

		An abridgment of this has now been published in a single volume entitled `` A Short History of
Scotland	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		To con - dense so large a work into a brief account of about three hundred pages must have been a difficult task ; but the result is fairly satisfactory .

		The chapters devoted to the middle ages are not all that might be desired ; but the author was not interested in the earlier period .

		His interest lay in the struggles of the Stuarts against grasping Englishmen and narrow - minded Presbyterian `` preachers , '' and his treatment of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries -LRB- which make up the bulk of the volume -RRB- have all the excel - lencies and defects that characterize the historical writings of this great Scotchman .

		It has been nec - essary to omit details , but the author 's viewpoint is apparent on every page , and his chief conclusions have been included .

		Readers who are interested in Scottish history but do not feel equal to the more extended works will find Mr.
Lang	PERSON	's `` Short His - tory '' an informing and entertaining book .

		BRIEFER MENTION . ''


Rousseau	PERSON	's Einfluss auf Kliuger , '' by Mr.
F. A. Wyneken	PERSON	, is a recent monograph issued from the Uni - versity of
California Press	ORGANIZATION	.


Klinger	PERSON	was one of the most interesting among the literary friends of
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	's youth , although he has been well-nigh forgotten by all except professional students of literary history .

		Mr.
Joseph McCabe	PERSON	, believing that
Voltaire	ORGANIZATION	is neg - lected by the modern reader , who naturally shrinks appalled from the immense volume of his work , has translated a selection of his prose writings which should help the modern world to become familiar with his essen - tial thought .

		The volume is entitled '' Toleration and Other Essays , '' and is published by the Messrs.
Putnam	PERSON	.

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 343 Mr.
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	's '' Life of
William Morris	PERSON	, '' one of the best of literary biographies , is reprinted by Messrs.
Longmans	PERSON	,
Green & Co.	ORGANIZATION	in their '' Pocket Li - brary , '' of which it makes two volumes .

		Morris 's '' News from Nowhere '' and
Andrew Lang	PERSON	's '' Books and Bookmen '' are other reprints in the same handy series .


Henry Morley	PERSON	's '' A First Sketch of English Litera - ture , '' originally published in
1873	DATE	, has gone through many editions , the latest of which , including a supple - ment bringing the history down to the deaths of Swin - burne and
Meredith	PERSON	, the work of Mr.
E. W. Edmunds	PERSON	, has just been published by
Messrs. Cassell & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		In its present form , the work runs to twelve hundred pages , which makes it possible to present an immense amount of detail .

		The supplement will be found very useful for reference , aside from its considerable critical value .

		Preparatory school teachers with
Browning	PERSON	on their list of poets for classroom study will doubtless be very glad of the help offered them by Miss
Ella B. Hallock	PERSON	in her '' Introduction to Browning '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Eleven poems , followed in each case by two or three pages of suggestive questions designed to quicken the student 's attention to the special meaning or charm of the poem in hand , make up a small volume of 130 pages .

		The selections are , for the most part , of the narrative type .

		Although
Browning	PERSON	is not at his best in this form , this is perhaps the easiest way of approach for the juvenile mind .

		Mr.
J. Herman Randall	PERSON	's `` The Culture of Person - ality '' -LRB-
Caldwell	PERSON	-RRB- is divided into fourteen thoughtful chapters on various aspects of personality , on the train - ing of the mind , the mastery of the affections , the edu - cation of the will , and kindred themes .

		The general tone and purpose of the work may be indicated by a passage from the '' Foreword . ''

		After quoting a page or two from
John Fiske	PERSON	's '' Destiny of Man '' the author continues : `` What is this , in other words , but simply the statement that the ultimate goal of this stupendous evolutionary process , which has been at work in the
Universe	ORGANIZATION	from the beginning , is the development of the whole man , the true and deeper self , the human-divine personality ?

		It can not be read otherwise .

		The total re - sult of all the scientific research , of all the wonderful dis - coveries of the last hundred years respecting Man and his life here upon the earth , reveals as the goal and end of all evolution , the perfectingof the human personality . ''

		The first casual impression gained from Messrs.
Crowell	PERSON	's new edition of
Browning	PERSON	is one of pleasure in the large type and open page .

		So accustomed have we become by long usage to associate
Browning	PERSON	with cramped and minute typography that the contrast af - forded by the present edition is as delightful as it was unexpected .

		In these twelve volumes , of little more than ordinary pocket size , the whole of
Browning	PERSON	's poetical work -LRB- with two of his essays in prose -RRB- is pre - sented in a type as large and a page as generously open as are generally found in the most cumbrous of editions de luxe .

		This fact alone is sufficient to make the edi - tion a favorite one , but it is not lacking in other merits .

		A full editorial apparatus of critical introductions and explanatory notes is supplied by
Miss Charlotte Porter	LOCATION	and Miss
Helen A. Clarke	PERSON	, whose capabilities for a task of this sort were long ago demonstrated .

		Professor
William Lyon Phelps	PERSON	contributes a brief general intro - duction , which the beginner in
Browning	PERSON	will find of value .

		A photogravure frontispiece is included in each volume .

		Altogether , this seems to us by far the most desirable edition of
Browning	PERSON	yet published .

		NOTES .

		A volume of '' Portraits and Studies '' by Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	is announced for early publication .

		Three one-act plays by Mr.
Eden Phillpotts	PERSON	will soon be published in a volume entitled '' Curtain Raisers . ''

		``

Messrs. E. P. Dutton & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Publication of the two concluding volumes of
John Bigelow	PERSON	's '' Retrospections of an Active Life '' has been considerably delayed , and they are not now likely to appear until
Spring	DATE	.

		It is good news that Sir
E. T. Cook	PERSON	, the biographer and editor of
Ruskin	LOCATION	, has prepared a volume on '' The Homes and Haunts of
Ruskin	LOCATION	, '' which will be published in a large volume with colored illustrations .

		Two forthcoming volumes of essays , by English writers , that will undoubtedly prove worth while are Mr.
Arthur Ransome	PERSON	's '' Portraits and Speculations '' and Mr.
Francis Grierson	PERSON	's '' The New Era . ''

		In view of tke Home Rule Bill now impending in
Parliament	LOCATION	, especial timeliness and interest attach to a volume on '' Aspects of the Irish Question '' by Mr.
Sidney Brooks	PERSON	, to be published at once by
Messrs. John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The exclusive rights in English translation to a series of
M. Fabre	ORGANIZATION	's wonderful insect stories have been acquired by '' The English Review . ''

		This house will also publish before long a satirical tale entitled ''
John	PERSON	of Jingalo '' by Mr.
Laurence Housman	PERSON	.

		A new edition of
St. John de Crevecreur	ORGANIZATION	's '' Letters from an American Farmer , '' with a complete biograph - ical introduction containing hitherto undiscovered ma - terial by Miss
Julia P. Mitchell	PERSON	of
Barnard College	ORGANIZATION	, will be issued in the
spring	DATE	by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mrs.
William O Brien	PERSON	's '' Unseen Friends , '' just an - nounced by Messrs.

		Among the well-known authors dealt with are
Christina Rossetti	PERSON	, Mrs.
Oliphant	PERSON	, and
Charlotte Bronte	LOCATION	.


Robert Barr	PERSON	, the novelist and editor of the
London	LOCATION	`` Idler , '' died at his home in
Surrey	LOCATION	on
October 21	DATE	> 344 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 1	DATE	, Although born in
Glasgow	LOCATION	, Mr.
Barr	PERSON	was educated in
Canada	LOCATION	, and for a time was on the editorial staff of the `` Detroit Free Press . ''

		Since
1881	DATE	he has lived in
England	LOCATION	.

		It is reported that
Gerhart Hauptmann	PERSON	is at work on a new drama dealing with
Homer	PERSON	and his times .

		The first two volumes of
Hauptmann	PERSON	's collected dramatic works , in English , and also a translation of his novel '' Atlantis , '' will be issued at once by Mr.
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	.


Adrian Hoffman Joline	PERSON	, an enthusiastic book collector and the author of several entertaining books about books , died in
New York City	LOCATION	on
October 15	DATE	.

		He was the author of '' Meditations of an Autograph Collector , '' '' Diversions of a Book Collector , '' '' At the Library Table , '' and several other similar works .

		Publication of a new novel by Mr.
James Lane Allen	PERSON	is always an event of literary importance .

		We learn that the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	will issue at once Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's latest work , '' The Heroine in Bronze . ''

		It is said to be the love story of an American college girl and a college man , the scene of which is laid in
New York	LOCATION	.

		Notwithstanding
Meredith	PERSON	's threat that he would '' most horribly haunt '' anyone who wrote a biography of him , several industrious persons are already engaged upon the task .

		The first result will probably be the volume now being prepared by Mr.
Thomas Seccombe	PERSON	for the series of '' Literary Lives , '' published in this country by Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		The first volumes of the eagerly-awaited `` Loeb Classical Library '' will be published immediately by the
Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		They include `` St.
Augustine	PERSON	's Confessions , '' `` Euripides , '' ``
Terence	PERSON	, '' and `` The Apostolic Fathers , '' each in two volumes , and '' Proper - tius , '' in one .

		Other authors are to be added during the next few weeks , twenty volumes in all having been scheduled for the first year .

		The important announcement is made by Messrs.
Lippincott	PERSON	that ``
Julius Csesar	PERSON	, '' the seventeenth volume in the '' New Variorum Edition '' of the works of Shake - speare , is in press for publication early in
1913	DATE	.

		The preparation of this monumental edition was the life work of Dr.
Horace Howard Furness	PERSON	.

		For the past few years he has been assisted by his son , Mr.
Horace Howard Furness , Jr.	PERSON	, who has contributed two volumes to the work , and to whom now falls the task of editing the remaining plays .

		Among the most interesting features of the ``
Atlantic	LOCATION	'' for the coming year will be a selection from
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	's letters to
Lowell	LOCATION	and
George William Curtis	PERSON	; '' My Boyhood and Youth , '' by Mr.
John Muir	PERSON	; `` Tales of My People , '' by Miss
Mary Antin	PERSON	; and '' Confederate Portraits , '' by Mr.

		To a series of articles on modern business affairs , Mr.

		The leading article in the
October	DATE	''
Hibbert	PERSON	Journal '' -LRB-
Sherman	ORGANIZATION	,
French & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is '' Democracy and Disci - pline , '' by the editor , Mr.
L. P. Jacks	PERSON	.

		It points out the perhaps impossible standards of public obedience and flexibility necessary for the success of such social legislation as Lloyd-George is putting through in En - gland and as the Progressive party hopes to put through in
America	LOCATION	.

		With the exception of a paper on the American political and religious situation by a
Massa	LOCATION	- chusetts clergyman , the Rev.
Frank Ilsley Paradise	ORGANIZATION	, the other articles in this number are theological or technically philosophic in their interest .

		391 OUli SPIRITUAL HEALTH .

		Is our culture in a bad way ?

		Are the ideals upon which the soul is fed growing less urgent in their appeal to the modern man ?

		Do we face the prospect of a spiritual decline comparable to that which darkened the world when the ancient civilizations decayed , and mankind groped for centuries to rediscover the light that was lost ?

		These are the questions raised by Dr.
E. B. Andrews	PERSON	in `` The International Journal of Ethics , '' where he discusses `` The Decline of Culture '' in a spirit which many will think un - duly pessimistic , but with a degree of earnest - ness which is deeply impressive .

		His diagnosis of our case does not indicate the menace of any barbarian invasion threatening to overwhelm our civilization , but rather places stress upon the internal causes that seem already to have gone far toward the undermining of our spiritual health .

		The culture which seems to him to be visibly declining is defined as '' the appreciation , not contemplative alone but active and efficient , of the non-economic values . ''

		Its content is en - lightenment , breadth , open-mindeiness , chivalry , honor , generosity , magnanimity , justice , gentle - ness , devotion to principle , the courage of one 's convictions , power to sustain , without courting it , loneliness , resisting popular clamors and mob movements , whether plebeian or patrician . ''

		It will be observed that this analysis has chiefly in mind the ethical rather than the assthetic aspect of culture .

		But even those of us who have framed our faith in accordance with the teach - ings of the most persuasive of the apostles of culture in our own day must remember his insistence upon the proposition that conduct is three-fourths of life .

		At first discussing the subject on some of its more general aspects , Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	speaks of the prevailing modern tendency to shape thought and action into uniform moulds .

		The deaden - ing influences of fashion , of what Huxley called regimentation , of industrialism , bureaucracy , and centralization , are everywhere made mani - fest . ''

		Science enables us to multiply infinitely all the things we invent and to throw them upon the market with cheapening profusion . ''

		`` Let shallow people laugh at
New England	LOCATION	provincial - ism and berate the South for being solid .

		The wise rejoice that so much local apartness sur - 370 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, vives . '' ''

		Centralization annuls not only the baneful and narrow in particularism but , worse still , its sap and vigor . ''

		Its steam-roller `` flat - tens individuals into specimens . ''

		Where in such a world can character , originality , the will to strike into new paths , get foothold ?

		`` It is doubtful whether what might be called the sci - entific mind is holding its own .

		Superstition not unlike belief in ghosts is still wide-spread and rank . '' ''

		There is wide remission of enthusiasm for humanity .

		Few think it articulately ; fewer avow it . ''

		If we have done something to check the crimes of violence , `` the crimes of cunning , secret vices , tricks , however immoral and cruel , that can be worked in accordance with law , and especially offences against personal purity , are everywhere on the increase . ''

		The enumeration of morbid conditions in our social pathology is considerably more extended than the above array of quotations would indicate , and they are matter for much self-searching .

		More specifically , '' the culture pyaemia in American society may be traced , in the main , to four great plexuses of influences : one , the country 's astounding growth in wealth ; a second , the spread of communistic socialism ; a third , bad theory and practice in education ; and a fourth , depressing views of the world , life , and man . ''

		The dominance of the American ideal by the money-making spirit is so pronounced that it everywhere overshadows the higher values of life and the nobler objects of ambition .

		Success is judged by the test of the dollar , and the man who refuses to recognize the validity of this test is viewed askance as a freakish and abnormal per - son .

		The schools and the churches , the theatres and the concert-halls , must be made to `` pay '' ; if they do not '' pay , '' they are discredited . ''

		Wealth-gaining is an obtrusive , all-engrossing phenomenon , overshadowing all else , massive , ubiquitous , obstreperous , never out of sight or out of mind . ''

		If culture is an '' appreciation of the non-economic values , '' it has small chance of growth in such an environment .

		Socialism , which is everywhere gaining upon us , makes no attempt to conceal its levelling purpose .

		It is `` a crusade against the highlands of men 's life in the supposed interest of the bog . ''

		It is essentially a gospel of materialism , and its root appeal is to greed , however that term be disguised under such high-sounding names as justice and brotherhood .

		It would '' build forth the social body utterly without regard to heter - ogeneity , allowing no place for the genius , the artist , the dreamer , the mugwump , the rebel .

		The church in its worst days never meditated rendering life so insipid . ''

		Coming to the third count of our critic 's indictment , one of the chief foes of culture is education , which should be its agent and minister , but which instead , in its cur - rent tendencies , can see nothing for a school to do more important than preparing its victims for the task of earning their livings . ''

		Pesti - lential , '' says Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	, and the word is not too strong `` is the cry for shorter courses , that young people may begin work earlier in life , earn more , and be surer of large families .

		There is no fear that our population will be too small , but much that it will be too mean . ''

		Rigid ad - ministrative systems and the preference given to utilitarian studies are draining our schools and colleges of their spiritual life , and making them factories of automata rather than institu - tions for the higher development of human faculty .

		How can a student whose education has been thus directed to narrow practical ends speak of his school as alma mater , with any sense of the significance of that beautiful expression ?

		Last of his four specific causes for the de - cline of culture , Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	names the phi - losophy of naturalism , which makes a mechani - cal interpretation of the doctrine of evolution , discerning no purpose at work in the universe , and finds in the teachings of Nietzsche its log - ical outcome . ''

		Naturalism can give no reason why any sentiment , impulse , or conviction which in any manner is of advantage to the race should be preferred to any other impulse or conviction as more worthy of consideration or obedience . ''

		`` If naturalism is the truth , morality is but a haphazard catalogue of pru - dential regulations ; beauty is unsubstantial and accidental , not eternal ; and even reason is nothing else but a habit by which our thoughts chance to take one course rather than another . ''

		To our thinking , the chief manifestation of declining culture is found in the very general prevalence of a spirit of indifferentism , of a moral apathy which leads men to think that nothing really matters unless it affects their own personal interests .

		This spirit can con - template the social and political issues of our own time , or the similar issues recorded in the pages of history , with hardly any other emotion than curiosity ; the reactions of enthusiasm and indignation are unknown to it ; it does not really care whether a nation -LRB- even our own -RRB- keeps or violates its plighted faith with others , whether a
Finland	LOCATION	or a
Persia	LOCATION	is strangled by the brutal oppressor , whether a German Em - pire ruthlessly despoils its French and Danish neighbors .

		People ought to care for such things
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 371 as these more than for their daily bread , and a culture which can regard them with indiffer - ence , perhaps even with cynicism , is in perilous need of a physician .

		Although our author takes anything but a cheerful view of the present , he is not without hopes for the future , believing that `` the sources of culture gush perennially . '' ''

		In what quarter of the heavens dawn will first show , it were rash to predict .

		Socialism will run a long course , so will perverse education .

		There are happy signs that wealth-seekers are beginning to distinguish between wealth as a means and wealth as an end .

		Hardest to reform will doubtless be man 's faith .

		Perhaps another Messiah will have to be awaited .

		Meantime , every child of the day may do somewhat to widen the skirts of light .

		As
Emerson	ORGANIZATION	exhorts : ' Bend to the persuasion which is flowing to you from every highest prompting of human nature to be its tongue to the heart of man and to show the besotted world how passing fair is wisdom . ' ''

		THE RETURN OF THE GODS .

		There is no more remarkable occurrence in the vicissitudes of human thought than the birth , the rise to power as a State religion , and the final ex - pulsion of Buddhism from
India	LOCATION	.

		Before it came the gods of the Vedas reigned , sacrifice was offered them , the sacred hearth-fire was kept perpetually lighted , caste was rigidly guarded , the twice-born were regularly initiated and endued with the sym - bolic cord .

		Buddhism , while not a proselytizing or persecuting doctrine , swept away all these things within its limits .

		It was an agnosticism .

		It said that the gods were unknowable and that the soul did not exist .

		Buddhism could not shake oft ' that cen - tral idea of Hindoo thought transmigration .

		But it transferred it from the soul to the character ,
Karma	LOCATION	.

		The sum of a man 's good and bad quali - ties went on living endlessly until the former extin - guished the latter , when Nirvana was attained .

		How character could persist on through innumerable re - births without being attached to a personality , is the difficult point of the doctrine .

		Beautiful and noble as Buddhism was in its ethics , its charity , and its democracy , it killed hope in the heart and imagina - tion in the mind .

		Humanity , Aryan humanity at least , could not stand it .

		After eight or ten cen - turies of growth and domination , it dwindled and practically disappeared from the land of its birth .

		The gods of the Vedas , new-incarnated , came back ; the hearth-fire burned again , and caste was renewed .

		And a great system of
Vedanta	LOCATION	philosophy , of which
Sankara Acharya	PERSON	was the leading exponent , arose to justify the change .

		Of course , with the return of the gods and the belief in immortality , came back the demons and the punishments of hell .

		But the change was worth the cost .

		This new-old religion and philo - sophy gave man back his soul .

		In a smaller way , perhaps , it looks as if something of this kind was about to happen in
Europe	LOCATION	and
America	LOCATION	.

		For fifty years or more the
Gorgon	ORGANIZATION	head of Evolution has turned the heart and soul of man to stone .

		Caught in a mechanical determinism , man - kind has lost its freedom the fluidity which before yielded to all impulses of religion , poetry , and art .

		If it tried to escape in philosophy , it found that philosophy was fixed in an iron system of concepts which opened only on nescience and nihilism .

		Recently the world has become aware of two great thinkers , Eucken in
Germany	LOCATION	and
Bergson	PERSON	in
France	LOCATION	, who have certainly given a new movement to thought , and who may possibly herald a new era .

		To a large extent their philosophies run parallel .

		But
Eucken	PERSON	's tends more in the direction of religion ,
Bergson	PERSON	's more towards an underlying metaphysic .

		The latter seems to be the more thorough , and , if it can be established , ought to prove the more liberat - ing of the two .


Bergson	PERSON	's thought , intensely difficult as it is to grasp in its full development , is yet simple in its leading principles .

		As Darwinism became sum - med up in a few phrases , `` natural selection , '' `` the survival of the fittest , '' `` the descent of man , '' by which the man in the street gained a not inadequate idea of the theory , so Bergsonism is concentrated in a few words or phrases , such as `` intuition , '' `` the Han vital , '' `` duration , `` and `` becoming , '' which fly from mouth to mouth and are easily understood .

		The philosophy is a crusade against both intellectual - ism and naturalism .

		It puts aside , or makes second - ary , the processes of deduction and induction , and proposes a new method whose organ is intuition and whose purpose is to place us in immediate contact with life with the 6lan vital .

		Movement , becom - ing , is of the essence of this act ; and as time has turned into a spatialized concept ,
Bergson	PERSON	substitutes duration for it .

		Creation is original , continuing , and incalculable .

		It may be interesting to trace a little the genesis of this new philosophy .

		Again there is a reminder of Darwinism .

		As
Lamarck	ORGANIZATION	,
St. Hilaire	LOCATION	,
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	, the elder
Darwin	PERSON	, and
Tennyson	PERSON	put forth
Darwin	PERSON	- ian ideas before the theory was formulated , so
Berg	PERSON	- sonism has been in the air for a long time .

		The first anticipatory statement , as far as I know , of
Bergson	PERSON	's method is in the opening pages of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's `` Eureka . ''

		It is very thoroughgoing , and consists of a denunciation of the rival methods of deduction and induction in their boastful claims to be the sole roads to truth , and the suggestion of a third process , intuition , as a short cut across the fields .

		Poe 's weighty and acutely reasoned pages are marked with a show of burlesque and persiflage which has perhaps kept the philosophic thought in them from being recognized .

		Here is a sentence describing the effort to attain intuition , which might almost have leaped out of one of
Bergson	PERSON	's books : '' It seems to me that we require something like a mental gyration on the heel .

		We need so rapid a revolution of all things about the point of sight , that while the minutiae vanish altogether , even the more conspicuous objects blend into one . ''

		But
Poe	PERSON	was a poet , and thought 372 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, in images , so he turned from the metaphysical de - velopment of his method and attacked the problem of the universe from the physical side .

		Cardinal
Newman	PERSON	's `` illative sense , '' the faculty which recognizes propositions before they are stated and resolves problems without logic , is only intuition under another name .


Schopenhauer	PERSON	's Will , under some of its aspects , resembles intuition , and his con - stant preoccupation all his life with the problem of genius shows a bent towards an intuitional doctrine .

		Nietzsche 's valuable illumination of the Greek Dionysian myth is a step in the same direction .

		Von
Hartmann	PERSON	's `` Philosophy of the Unconscious '' is a genuine basis for the new method .

		It has not escaped attention , of course , that
Bergson	PERSON	is expound - ing and expanding the doctrine of
Heraclitus	PERSON	, he who said `` you can not go down into the same river twice , '' the prophet of Becoming .

		There are points of contact with Plotinus and with the
Vedanta	LOCATION	philosophers of
India	LOCATION	.

		But
Bergson	PERSON	has not only gathered up all these threads of thoughts , he has supplied a vast deal more .

		He has made the theory his own as much as
Darwin	PERSON	made his , and what is better he has exhibited it with so much grace of style and richness of illustration that the general reader may be tempted for once to say with
Milton	PERSON	, '' How charming is divine philosophy , Not harsh and rugged as dull fools suppose , But a perpetual feast of nectared sweets Where no crude surfeit reigns . ''

		But is
Bergson	PERSON	's philosophy true ?

		In the ver - nacular , '' will it wash '' ?

		Well , the critics have already begun their work on it .

		Like most sys - tems , it is a strong fortress hanging in air .

		If we can only win to it we shall be safe .

		But it re - quires a leap .

		It requires as strong an act of faith as
Kant	PERSON	calls for after he had broken down the bridge between the phenomenal and the noumenal .

		Yet it is unquestionably true that life is more than mind , more than the concepts of that mind , more than the language in which those concepts are couched .

		We ought to be able to place ourselves in immediate contact with the eternal duration , the continuing creation , the elan vital .

		But the trouble is , if we do so we have no means of communicating the fact to others .

		Intelligible communication can only take effect by means of concepts and language .

		We might each one of us become isolated like a Dancing Dervish in our own ecstasy .

		Perhaps if we transcend sensations , concepts , the unit of apper - ception , the final self , we may not even know we are in ecstasy .

		But in spite of
Bergson	PERSON	's very effective criticism of intellectualism and naturalism , he does not really want to prorogue or abolish those ever hostile but still confederated powers of existence .

		He simply wants to introduce a third force which will vitalize them .

		Every religious enthusiast , every poet , every artist knows that this force call it intuition , in - spiration , or intoxication is the thing that he must rely on for the best that he can do .

		It is the some - thing not himself , which , after he has labored and struggled and assembled his materials , comes in a flash as it were and makes his work valuable .

		The minds of poets have more than any others been the paths for this unearthly influence .

		The '' divine phrensy , '' the '' divine fire , '' have always been terms applied to these seizures .

		The Greeks in their
Diony	PERSON	- sian myth tried to give a wider effect to this power by a cult of intoxication .

		The chief value of the Bergsonian philosophy seems to me to be the liberating of the human mind in this direction .

		It is a justification of religion , poetry , art , all the imaginative and emotional pro- ducts of our nature .

		These have been in danger of being killed off by the general acceptance of mechanical naturalism .

		If , as in
India	LOCATION	, the gods come back , they will bring with them all the fresh warm feelings and great imaginations from which
spring	DATE	poetry and the arts .

		There will be '' One common wave of hope and joy Lifting mankind again . ''

		In speaking above of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's contribution to the new method of knowledge , I have used the phrase '' a short cut across the fields . ''

		In a great measure that is what
Bergson	PERSON	's philosophy really is .

		He invites us to leave the too stony , dusty roads of in - tellectualism and naturalism and follow him across country .

		The grass is springy beneath us , flowers bloom around , the air is fresh and sweet , we come into the shade of trees and seat ourselves by living fountains .

		It is a delightful adventure .

		Perhaps our short cut will not lead us to the
City of Truth	ORGANIZATION	, but certainly neither of the two great highways which mankind has tramped for so many centuries seems to have done that .

		We can not be worse off than we were , and we may gain much delight by the way .

		Perhaps if we can keep in sight of the old routes we may combine all their advantages at once .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		A LIBRARY MOVEMENT IN
BARODA	LOCATION	which promises to quicken the hitherto sluggish library activity of all
India	LOCATION	starts with the formation of a
Baroda Library Club	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- twenty-five charter members -RRB- and the estab - lishing of a `` Library Miscellany , '' or quarterly peri - odical devoted to public-library interests in
Baroda	LOCATION	and in
India	LOCATION	generally .

		Mr.
J. S. Kudalkar	PERSON	, editor of the magazine , was called from
America	LOCATION	two years ago by the
Maharaja Gaikwad	PERSON	, pioneer of the mod - ern library movement in
India	LOCATION	, to do for that coun - try , as far as possible , what has already been done for this in the founding of free libraries for the people .

		The first number of the `` Miscellany '' has reached us , and proves to be a highly interesting and enterprising publication , its three sections -LRB- English ,
Gujarati	LOCATION	, and Marathi -RRB- being devoted to library matters both domestic and foreign , especially to the bibliothecal renaissance or perhaps naissance would be the better term now receiving attention and encouragement in
India	LOCATION	.

		An elaborate `` Scheme
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIA1 , 373 of Classification for Sanskrit Libraries '' is given , in which the grand divisions of literature are designated by vowels , gutterals , palatals , cerebrals , dentals , semi - vowels , and sibilants , including the aspirate .

		This may remind one of the new classification adopted by our Library of
Congress	ORGANIZATION	, a classification in which the letters of the alphabet play the chief role , with numbers as subordinates .

		Not all classifiers , it is evident , see literature in decimally-divided sec - tions .

		The best wishes of American library workers go out to Mr.
Kudalkar	PERSON	, to the Maharaja Gaikwad who is supporting him , and to all other participants in the movement to place books in the hands of the toiling millions of
India	LOCATION	.

		THE POET 'S EMOTIONS IN THE FACE OF IMPEND - ING DEATH ought not to be unworthy of record when that poet happens to be one of the greatest of his time , if not of all time .

		In Mr.
Edmund Gosse	PERSON	's reminiscent article , `` Swinburne at Etretat , '' in the
October	DATE	`` Cornhill , '' he relates the poet 's bathing ad - venture that nearly cost him his life , in the late sum - mer of
1868	DATE	.

		The timely appearance of a fishing smack on the scene prevented the premature silen - cing of the voice that was presently to entrance the world -LRB- or some part of it -RRB- with the `` Songs before Sunrise . '' ''

		I asked him , '' writes Mr.
Gosse	PERSON	, `` what he thought about in that dreadful contingency , and he replied that he had no experience of what peo - ple often profess to witness , the concentrated pano - rama of past life hurrying across the memory .

		He did not reflect , on the past at all .

		He was filled with annoyance that he had not finished his ' Songs before Sunrise , ' and then with satisfaction that so much of it was ready for the press , and that
Mazzini	PERSON	would be pleased with him .

		And then he continued : ' I reflected with resignation that I was exactly the same age as
Shelley	PERSON	was when he was drowned . '

		-LRB- This , however , was not the case ;
Swinburne	PERSON	had reached that age in
March , 1867	DATE	; but this was part of a curious delusion of Swin - burne 's that he was younger by two or three years than his real age . -RRB-

		Then , when he began to be , I suppose , a little benumbed by the water , his thoughts fixed on the clothes he had left on the beach , and he worried his clouded brain about some unfinished verses in the pocket of his coat . ''

		So here again we have an instance of the failure of an actor in a real-life drama to rise to the dramatic possibilities of his part .

		They do these things better in fiction .

		A SUMPTUOUS BOOK CATALOGUE , which collectors will undoubtedly preserve for its own sake , quite apart from the interest of the items which it records , is that of ' - two hundred extraordinarily important books , manuscripts , and autograph letters '' offered for sale by Messrs.
Pearson	PERSON	of
London	LOCATION	.

		It is a beautifully-printed quarto , whose many illustrations , facsimiles , and detailed descriptions , increase one 's desire to see and handle and own some of the liter - ary curiosities enumerated .

		For mere costliness , the first place in the collection is held by the copy of the '' Antiphonary '' supposed to have been presented by
Francis I.	PERSON	to
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		on the
Field of the Cloth of Gold	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a splendid manuscript with beautiful miniatures attributed to
Fra Benedetto	LOCATION	, and is encased in what `` is believed to be the finest Renaissance binding in the world , '' the work of Roffet .

		It is yours for three thousand pounds ster - ling .

		A more modest appeal is made by
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	's ``
John Woodvil	PERSON	: A Tragedy , '' first edition , original boards , uncut , and offered at sixty-three pounds .

		Especial curiosity is excited by the description of a letter from
Lady Hamilton	LOCATION	to
George IV	ORGANIZATION	.

		-LRB- then Prince of
Wales	LOCATION	-RRB- after
Trafalgar	ORGANIZATION	, with a lock of
Nelson	ORGANIZATION	's hair .

		Letter and hair await purchase at six hundred pounds .

		The
Burbage	PERSON	portrait of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, `` in its original pure and untouched state , '' is ready to be hung over your study table as soon as you choose to send Mr.
Pearson	PERSON	the six hun - dred and fifty pounds named as the price .

		But if you have n't that amount at hand just now , perhaps a copy of La
Fontaine	PERSON	's `` Fables Choisies , '' first edi - tion , quarto , with numerous vignettes by Chauveau , bound in red morocco , and costing only seventy-five pounds , would better agree with the state of your bank account .

		STEVENSON 'S CONCEPTION OF REALISM is illus - trated by a passage in an overlooked
Vailima	LOCATION	letter recently discovered by Sir
Sidney Colvin	PERSON	while he was overhauling his desks and cabinets in prepara - tion for a change of residence .

		This letter and other
Stevensoniana	PERSON	unearthed at the same time form the subject of an article from the discoverer 's pen in the
November	DATE	`` Scribner . ''

		After referring to certain vexatious delays in the making of the final draft of ''
David Balfour	PERSON	, ''
Stevenson	PERSON	writes : '' At the same time , though I love my
Davy	PERSON	, I am a little anxious to get on again on
The Young Che	ORGANIZATION	- valier .

		I have in nearly all my works been trying one racket : to get out the facts of life as clean and naked and sharp as I could manage it .

		In this other book I want to try and megilp them altogether in an atmosphere of sentiment , and I wonder whether twenty-five years of life spent in trying this one will not make it impossible for me to succeed in the other .

		However , it is the only way to attempt a love story .

		You ca n't tell any of the facts , and the only chance is to paint an atmosphere . ''

		And yet who would ever think of going to
Stevenson	PERSON	's romances -LRB- those in which he had been '' trying one racket '' -RRB- for the facts of life , '' clean and naked and sharp '' ?

		A PROPOSED LIBRARY OF PECULIAR CHARACTER forms the subject of a recent interesting newspaper communication from
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		Everyone familiar with that centre of German book-publishing knows about the
Book-Industry Museum	ORGANIZATION	, with its
Guten	ORGANIZATION	- berg statue in front , and , inside , its collection of examples of printing in different ages , and its illus - 374 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, trations of all the various processes connected with the making of books .

		But this museum , famous and well worth visiting though it is , does not satisfy the booksellers and the printers and publishers of
Leipzig	LOCATION	, who apparently desire a more modernly - equipped institution to signalize the triumphs of present-day book-manufacture in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		There - fore they have urged , with success , the founding of a library that shall contain a copy of every printed work of German make from the first day of
January , 1913	DATE	, onward .

		The city has granted land for the new building , which will be a costly structure but exactly how it is to be paid for does not appear and the expense of maintenance will be defrayed by the kingdom of
Saxony	LOCATION	and the city of
Leipzig	LOCATION	.

		The public use of so exclusively modern a library will be small at first , but with the lapse of time this rawness of youth will give place to mellowness and maturity ; and one need not be a great prophet to pre - dict a comparatively early congestion of its shelves , so rapid is the present rate of book-publication in
Germany	LOCATION	, as elsewhere .

		Even the
Royal Library	ORGANIZATION	at
Berlin	LOCATION	, with its fourteen hundred thousand vol - umes , is likely to be outstripped , in this matter of size of book-collection , before many years .

		THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF LOAFING , especially to students , writers , and literary workers generally , must be urged now and then , even at the risk of encouraging laziness in those constitutionally ad - dicted to unemployment .


Stevenson	PERSON	has said a good word on the fruitfulness of occasional idling , and
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	's biographer has described that great writer 's method of wooing the creative mood by waiting , in masterly inactivity , for the '' inspira - tion tank '' to fill up .

		The annual vacation season is now past , but it is not an unseasonable thing to lay plans for the
summer	DATE	that is coming .

		`` Public Libraries '' publishes , and also reprints as a special leaflet , Mr.
Adam Strohm	PERSON	's
Ottawa	LOCATION	address on `` Efficiency of the Library Staff and
Scientific Management	ORGANIZATION	, '' in which , among other wise counsels , the granting of a generous annual vacation -LRB- of at least a month -RRB- to the library worker is eloquently urged `` not so much because a faithful servant has earned a rest , but because without it life means living at a low level , with the certain result of deadening one 's faculties , ambition and alertness , whereas these should all grow with one 's experience and work . ''

		Dr.
Luther H. Gulick	PERSON	is quoted as asserting that '' growth is predominantly a function of rest , '' and that `` the best work that most of us do is not in our office or at our desks , but when we are wandering in the woods , or sitting quietly with undirected thoughts . ''

		A ROSEATE VIEW OF TURKEY arrests the attention just now in the opening chapter of that deservedly popular book -LRB- recently translated from the German into the mother-tongue of its author -RRB- , `` The Founda - tions of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' by Mr.
Houston Stewart Chamberlain	PERSON	.

		On page six of volume one he says : `` While these lines are being written -LSB-
1897	DATE	-RSB- , the civilised world is clamorously indignant with
Turkey	LOCATION	; the
European Powers	ORGANIZATION	are being compelled by the voice of public opinion to intervene for the protection of the Armenians and Cretans ; the final destruction of the Turkish power seems now only a question of time .

		This is certainly justified ; it was bound to come ; nevertheless it is a fact that
Turkey	LOCATION	is the last little corner of
Europe	LOCATION	in which a whole people lives in undisturbed prosperity and happiness .

		It knows nothing of social questions , of the bitter struggle for existence , and other such things ; great fortunes are unknown and pauperism is literally non-existent ; all form a single harmonious family , and no one strives after wealth at the expense of his neighbor .

		I am not simply repeating what I have read in newspapers and books , I am testifying to what I have seen with my own eyes . ''

		And it is this peaceful
Arcadia	LOCATION	, this perfect Utopia , that now resounds with the clash of arms and the roar of artillery ... HlGH QUOTATIONS ON A YOUNG AUTHOR 'S FIRST EDITIONS must send sensory waves of an agreeable warmth through the cardiac regions of that author .

		It is reported from
London	LOCATION	that certain early works of Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	-LRB- who will not be displeased , we hope , if we consider him still young in years , as he un - deniably is in spirit -RRB- were recently sold at
Sotheby	ORGANIZATION	's for
$ 245	MONEY	-LRB- in terms of American money -RRB- at the same time that Mr.
Thomas Hardy	PERSON	's works , in thirty-eight volumes , first editions , brought
$ 210	MONEY	;
George Eliot	PERSON	's complete works , also first editions ,
$ 270	MONEY	; the volumi - nous
G. P. R. James	PERSON	's ,
$ 127.50	MONEY	; and the rollicking
Charles Lever	PERSON	's romances ,
$ 305	MONEY	.

		Among high prices for single books is to be noted the handsome figure reached by the original edition of '' Alice in Wonder - land '' with its forty-two
Tenniel	PERSON	illustrations .

		This little nursery classic brought
$ 125	MONEY	, and its first ap - pearance is still pleasurably remembered by those not yet old .

		... THE GROWTH OF THE GOETHE MUSEUM AT
WEIMAR	LOCATION	testifies to the rapidity with which the great poet 's works are selling in new editions and new translations , and the steady increase of litera - ture about him and his writings .

		The
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	house has long served as a repository for
Goethe	ORGANIZATION	relics and souvenirs of all sorts , including all the editions of his works and all the books written about him and his works .

		Consequently it is now found too small for the purposes of a museum of this sort , and an addition is to be built , modelled as closely as possi - ble after the smaller buildings that were unwisely demolished in
1890	DATE	.

		They opened on the garden where the poet was wont to take his daily constitu - tional .

		Their replacement will illustrate anew the surprising rapidity with which libraries and museums almost invariably outgrow their quarters , however generous the allowance of space may seem to have been in the beginning .

		THE DIAL 375 COMMUNICA TIONS .

		HACKNEYED PHRASES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Subscribers to THE DIAL , if they read no other than that worthy periodical , would scarcely be justified in writing to you for help against the almost universal and monotonously dreary repetition of hackneyed phrases .

		The more reason that you should use your authority in banishing such banal and senseless terms , if not from the language , at least from the pages of magazines and newspapers pretending to some degree of literary taste .

		It is possibly going too far to say that whenever a writer makes use of expressions like the following , he will have nothing of intellectual value to give to his reader .

		He may occasionally prove pleasantly disappointing , but the chances are that his message will be as worn out and dusty as the road of his mind from somewhere to nowhere .

		The detritus of language is also the veriest dust and mud of thought , and the ruts and hummocks of both wear more and worse with every tramp footfall .

		Experience has demonstrated that argument and reproof are wasted upon the reportorial mind and the editors of the Yellows , but could not something be done with the men '' higher up '' ?

		From a list of many old sins by a multitude of sinners I now single out only a few illustrations : '' Gathered together . ''

		Could there be more foolish and useless tautology ?

		And yet it will be found re - peated many times in the pages of every number of most periodicals .

		Why not vary it with `` collected together '' ?

		And to make it more ridiculous why not the threefold `` gathered and collected together , '' or , indeed , '' gathered and collected together into a col - lection '' ?

		May not the single word '' gathered , '' or '' collected '' be made to serve ?

		Worse , if possible , assuredly more certain to pop up , is the trite old `` as a matter of fact . ''

		Facts and truths are always certain to mean little to the minds of those who make use of such a pompous phrase , and such repe - titions and attritions deceive only those who wear them out in the vain attempt to simulate judgment .

		Let us delete every word of the stodgy simulacrum , and go at once to state what is the matter and the fact . ''

		Call attention '' is another pretender .

		Better suited to the mental condition of the '' caller '' would be '' bawl . ''

		A modest writer would of course say '' ask , '' '' invite , '' '' request , '' etc. . ''

		It is to be hoped . ''

		One trusts that there may be an end made of this bit of stuckupishness , and of '' met with , '' both of which one meets in every second page of the popular writer .

		A PROPOSED INSTITUTE OF BUSINESS AND AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		Readers of THE DIAL will perhaps remember previ - ous articles by the present writer suggesting the estab - lishment of a
Bibliographical Institute	ORGANIZATION	.

		The plan was rather an academic one , and concerned chiefly , if not exclusively , with the interests of men of learning .

		I have gradually , through stages that do not here need to be explained , come to understand that there is another world than that of abstract learning , that needs attention from bibliographers and librarians , namely , the world of affairs , of industry , of business .

		The needs of this world are only in part identical with that of the other , its needs are very largely in other directions .

		What the business man and manufacturer wants is information about facts , not about theories ; and facts are not always to be found in books .

		The following , therefore , is a development of my previous plans , better adapted , as I believe , to the needs of our everyday world .

		An Institute is needed for the organization of the collec - tion and imparting of exact and reliable information about facts and ideas .

		It is important that a means of communica - tion be established between those who seek and those who have to impart special information about new facts and ideas .

		In order to obtain exact and reliable information on any sub - ject it is necessary to know where such information is to be found , and what sources of information are most reliable .

		The proposed
Institute	ORGANIZATION	would first of all collect information about available sources of information ; it would prepare a directory of directories , a catalogue of catalogues , a list of addresses of workers and investigators , a guide to special collections of written and printed material , of specimens and models , as well as to the expert special knowledge not yet public property .

		The
Institute	ORGANIZATION	would offer its services to organize bibliographical and index work , much of which is now done by isolated agencies and individuals , resulting in duplication and waste without making all the existing knowl - edge available .

		It would also undertake research and index work that does not come within the field of any other agency .

		The
Institute	ORGANIZATION	would , in a word , be a clearing house of ideas and an organizer of research .

		Many problems of today , that seem new to us , are really not new at all ; we often find in old books and magazines important information about matters and methods that were once in vogue , but are now forgotten , and which might aid in solving problems that have just come to the surface .

		For instance , farming with dynamite , which now is written up in this country as an entirely new thing , has been practiced in
Germany	LOCATION	for several years .

		When a new idea like that of scientific management is presented , or a new discovery made , such as the X-rays , the
Institute	ORGANIZATION	would collect information in regard to similar ideas of older date , or other discoveries that have led up to the one that at the mo - ment fills the public mind .

		In the present scarcity of meat a new problem seems to confront the whole world ; here it might be the function of the Institute to search for informa - tion about earlier or more recent problems of similar char - acter , in order to find out how they were met , or how they solved themselves .

		Every day someone wants to find out where certain kinds of information may be found ; for instance : Where is the most complete collection of statisti - cal material about the resources and business possibilities of
South America	LOCATION	?

		Where has the problem of vocational edu - cation which just now has been brought before us by Mr.
Cooley	PERSON	, been most satisfactorily solved ?

		What is the Raif - feisen system , and can it be adopted in this country ?

		How might the rural free delivery best be utilized as an agency for the progress of the rural population ?

		These and other questions that press forward for solution can not be answered by an isolated institution , however munificently endowed ; the world 's knowledge is not collected in one spot , it is scat - tered all over the world and must be searched for all over the world .

		The
Institute	ORGANIZATION	would therefore establish close relations with other institutions of similar nature in other countries , and direct connections with the large libraries , museums , schools , and learned societies and institutions of the world .

		The proposed
Institute	ORGANIZATION	would supplement the work of the libraries and museums .

		The latter collect and preserve the materials of research , catalogue them , and hold them avail - able for investigators .

		The
Institute	ORGANIZATION	would go one step further , prepare the material for use , and even indicate its probable value for the purpose of the inquirer .

		It would act as an intermediary between the investigator and his material .

Nov. 16	DATE	, tto RECOLLECTIONS OF L.OTJIS XAPOLEON .

		* '' The late
Baron d'Ambe	PERSON	`` s , '' who figures as the author of these '' Intimate Memoirs of
Napoleon III.	PERSON	, '' seems to have been in close touch with
Louis Napoleon	PERSON	for the larger part of the latter 's life .

		It is not quite true , as he cries out in a burst of grief at the unfortunate ruler 's death , that
Louis	PERSON	was '' the playmate of his childhood , '' since they met for the first time in
Switzerland	LOCATION	in
1833	DATE	; but the ardent enthusiasm of disciple - ship which
Louis	PERSON	possessed the strange power of exciting seized this young man of twenty and was never cast off entirely , though with the last years he was only the devoted friend and ad - mirer , no longer the blind and confident follower .

		Baron d'Amb ^ s helped to organize the at - tempted revolution from
Strassburg	LOCATION	in
1836	DATE	.

		He was on hand when
Louis	PERSON	made an effort to enter
France	LOCATION	by way of
Boulogne	LOCATION	, in
1840	DATE	.

		He followed his friend on his campaign in
Italy	LOCATION	, always unofficially , and thought of joining the expedition to
China	LOCATION	, in
1860	DATE	, but was restrained by meeting one day , at the turning of a street , '' an extraordinary being , yellow , hideous , with a bony face and wicked little eyes . ''

		He said to himself : `` No , I wo n't cross the sea to go where such folks live . ''

		It is to be feared that his friendship was not worth as much to the Emperor as he himself imagined .

		While other supporters of the Pretender suffered imprison - ment and persecution , he himself seems never to have been in the slightest danger or even to have attracted a great deal of attention .

		He proudly notes the phrase `` Paladin of discre - tion '' which his master applied to him , but there is no evidence that this discretion was ever put to any particularly severe test .

		To d'Ambe 's , distrust of the coup d'etat was indisputable evidence of alliance with `` forces of revolt and anarchy '' ;
Victor Emmanuel	PERSON	and
Cavour	PERSON	were not patriots , but only `` Foxy and Company , '' scheming to make trouble for
France	LOCATION	; the Jews were `` stinking vermin everyone would extermi - nate if possible '' ;
Vichy	PERSON	, like
China	LOCATION	, was a tire - some place where `` I sha n't come again ... deeply attached to the Prince as I am '' ; and Morny was the object of apparently unmixed envy because he `` gave himself up madly to love , gambling and drinking . ''

		Amiable and * INTIMATE MEMOIRS OF
NAPOLEON III	PERSON	.

		Personal Reminiscences of the Man and the Emperor .

		By the late
Baron d'Ambes	PERSON	.

		Edited and translated by
A. R. Allinson	PERSON	,
M.A.	LOCATION	.

		In two volumes .

		With illustrations from the collec - tion of
A. M. Broadley	PERSON	.

		Boston : Little ,
Brown , & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		witty and often exceedingly shrewd d'Ambes undoubtedly was , but scarcely a '' Paladin of dis - cretion . ''

		On one occasion when he reproached
Louis	PERSON	for not having confided in him , the Em - peror replied , '' But , my friend , I remembered that you were writing your memoirs . ''

		The first chapter is a labored attempt to prove that
Napoleon I.	PERSON	was the father of
Napoleon III	ORGANIZATION	.

		The subject is not of a sort that Anglo-Saxons choose to discuss freely ; but a review of the evi - dence shows rather conclusively that
Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		was not the son of
Louis Bonaparte	PERSON	, though it fails utterly to prove that he was the son of the first Napoleon .

		This discussion is redeemed from idle scandal-mongering by the concluding sentence : `` Be this as it may ,
Napoleon III	PERSON	.

		is certainly , above all morally , of the race of the great Corsican whose life-work he has striven to emulate , both in his acts and in his aspirations . ''

		With all his faults and failures ,
Louis	PERSON	exercised an influence and accomplished a result that set him immediately below his marvellous uncle , and leagues away from the other irresponsible weaklings who bore the name of
Napoleon	ORGANIZATION	.

		If it be true that youthful inclinations indi - cate a divine purpose ,
Louis	PERSON	was providentially intended for a ruler .

		He himself says that he felt his destiny from the age of seven .

		He had a hand in political affairs in every country his mother 's wanderings dragged him into .

		In
Italy	LOCATION	, though he denied it himself later , he must have been a
Carbonaro	PERSON	.

		At least his elder brother was , and d'Ambes asserts that the latter 's sud - den death was due not to the measles , but to the stiletto of a comrade when pressure from his family made him incline to defection .

		It was this early Italian complication which helped determine the Emperor 's half-hearted interfer - ence with
Austria	LOCATION	and
Naples	LOCATION	, an interference which made him only enemies , and which played its part in his final downfall . ''

		My uncle , ''
Louis	PERSON	said to
Thierry	PERSON	in
1838	DATE	, '' was
Caesar	PERSON	.

		I will be Augustus . ''

		And when sentenced to perpetual confinement at Ham , he remarked quietly that the word '' perpetual '' was not in the French language .

		Entering
Paris	LOCATION
eight years later	DATE	, after the outbreak of
February , 1848	DATE	, he passed a barricade , the stones of which some passers-by were restoring to their proper positions in the pavement . ''

		Come , young man , '' said a woman to the new arrival , '' help us put back the paving-stones in place . '' ''

		My good woman , ''
Louis	PERSON	replied , '' that is precisely what I have come to
Paris	LOCATION	for . ''

		His lieutenant is quite as confident .

		At their first interview in
Switzerland	LOCATION	, the Prince chanced to remark , as
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 377 they strolled past a bank of hortensias , '' I love the flowers beyond measure .

		They have about them something royal , '' '' Imperial , '' d'Ambes put in softly .

		Louis 's belief in his own destiny , however , did not prevent his frequent use of clever tricks .

		It is difficult to generalize with regard to this puzzling and contradictory character , but it may safely be said that at least during the early part of his career he was a consummately skilful demagogue .

		His '' police de poche , '' the little notebook full of data with regard to the local dignitaries he was to meet on his popular tours , to be used in charming them by showing them how famous they were and by his sympathetic interest in their personal affairs , won him thou - sands of votes .

		But there is no question that
Louis	PERSON	had a good heart and a brain fertile in expedients for making the lot of the common people easier .

		Mr.
F. A. Simpson	PERSON	's luminous work on '' The Rise of Louis Napoleon '' gave us the completest study in English of his early labors in this direction , and the Baron d'Ambes touches lovingly on various evidences of a thought for the comfort of the many which could not always have been selfishly prompted .

		Defeated , broken , and dying at
Chislehurst	LOCATION	, he yet busied himself with plans for utilizing the heat from the lower floors of the great European tenement houses the floors occupied by the wealthy to warm the rooms above where the poorer families lived .

		The Empress does not appear to great advan - tage in these pages .

		D'Ambes stamps as calum - nies the attacks upon her character which were made before her marriage , but he is sure that notwithstanding her charms and her family 's enterprise she would never have been Empress if
Napoleon	PERSON	had not been refused beforehand by half the royal princesses of
Europe	LOCATION	; and he ascribes the larger part of the blame for the successive acts of interference in foreign affairs , which pushed
Napoleon	PERSON	and the Empire further and further toward the edge of the precipice , to her bigoted Catholicism and her meddling vanity . ''

		L'Empire , c'est la paix , '' it is true , but how much of a safeguard is that , when '' L'Imperatrice , c'est la guerre '' ?

		The last fifty pages of the book , those deal - ing with the Prussian War and the fall of the Empire , are of thrilling and poignant interest .

		D'Ambes saw the end long before it came , and he had taken
Bismarck	PERSON	's measure the moment that man of blood and iron appeared above the horizon .

		`` It is often a great help to matters for a statesman '' -LRB- this was written in
January , 1870	DATE	-RRB- `` to possess qualities the most widely at variance with the temperament of the nation that he governs . ''

		Was not that the secret of
Bismarck	LOCATION	's power and success ?

		Was he not the most violent and independent of men , working with the most quiet and docile of national ma - terial ?

		Bismarck could never have done his work with Frenchmen , or even with English - men ;
Prussia	LOCATION	would have been long in taking the first rank among nations without
Bismarck	PERSON	.

		Such flashes of insight as this redeem many pages of purposeless detail or frivolity .

		Napoleon is not even distantly related to many sections of the diary . ''

		There is a man Zola who has taken up Manet 's defense . '' ''

		Everybody is reading and talking over
Victor Hugo	PERSON	's
Les Miserables	LOCATION	.

		It is a gigantic success . '' ''

		Scribe is not dead .

		He lives again in
M. Victorien Sardou	LOCATION	... This
Sardou	ORGANIZATION	is only thirty , and bids fair to command success . ''

		Such are some of the entries .

		Extending from
1838	DATE	to
1873	DATE	, the notes touch the fascinating social and intel - lectual life of
Paris	LOCATION	at a thousand different points .

		The
Baron	PERSON	was still alive to write an introduction to the present work in
July , 1893	DATE	.

		It is a pity that he did not continue his memoirs up to that time .

		THE HUMBLE-BEE AS A HOBBY-HORSE .

		* '' We gave up Euclid and the Rule of Three And nature - studied the Bumble-Bee . ''

		Punch .

		The Bee has been discussed by innumerable writers for the last two thousand years and more ; it is the subject of every kind of disser - tation , even of numerous jokes .

		One of these latter , which has been a favorite with the news - papers , relates how a young person of the city , visiting in the country , observed honey upon the breakfast table .

		`` I see you keep a bee , '' was the innocent remark .

		People who smile at this seem no less funny to the entomologist when they let the fact escape that they imagine there is only one kind of bee .

		The bee , so-called , is in fact only one of many thousand species , and the most learned work on honey-bees no more than introduces us to the study of bees in general .

		It may even be objected that such a work be - gins at the wrong end of the subject , and that to really understand the socialism of the higher bees we must trace its evolution from the indi - vidualism of the primitive kinds .

		* THB HUMBLE-BEE .

		Its Life-history and How to Domesticate It .

		By
F. W. L. Sladen	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .


New York	LOCATION	:
The Macmillan Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		378 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	's work , now before us , does not do this , but it does give us an excellent picture of the life and habits of the humble-bee , which in some respects stands just below the hive-bee in social rank .

		Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	is a well-known expert on honey-bees , and it is from this interest that he has been led to consider bees in general , and to attempt the domestication and careful study of humble-bees .

		He has been abundantly repaid for his trouble , and has succeeded in describing his observations so well that many readers will share his pleasure , while some will doubtless attempt similar work of their own .

		The book is full of remarkable new observa - tions , and is a `` nature book '' of the best type .

		The illustrations are original and very good , both drawings and colored plates .

		It is a dis - advantage that the bees described are British species , all different from those found in this country ; but even this is not altogether to be regretted .

		The general discussion will no doubt apply almost equally well on both sides of the world , while the treatment of the European kinds may serve as a model for similar work in this country , leaving the student to make his own original observations , following a carefully worked-out plan .

		If any fault is found with Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	, it will probably be on the ground that he permits himself a certain Maeterlinckian freedom of expression which will not please the modern school of experts on animal behavior .

		Thus he tells us how Psithyrus , the usurper-bee , invades the nest of the humble-bee , slays the proper queen , and establishing herself as the ruler of the house , has her offspring brought up by the humble-bee workers .

		All this is accurately described , with many new details ; but we are assured that when the Psithyrus settled in the humble-bee nest , the poor humble-bee queen `` was visibly depressed and ill at ease . ''

		`` As time went on she grew nervous and languid , and showed increasing fear and suspicion of the unwelcome guest . ''

		Finally , on the tenth day after the first appearance of the Psithyrus , the humble-bee queen and three workers were found lying dead outside the nest .

		`` Evidently the three workers had sacrificed their lives in a futile attempt to destroy their mother 's murderess . ''

		Personally , I do not object to this sort of thing , as long as the writer is careful to describe ap - pearances , and we are careful to remember that every word must not be taken literally .

		As a matter of fact , literature is necessarily full of expressions which , while inaccurate perhaps if judged by the actual meaning of the words , nevertheless convey a vivid idea of what really took place .

		It would not help us much , from any point of view , to state instead that the pres - ence of the Psithyrus inhibited the normal activ - ities of the humble-bee , and led to the exhibition of imperfectly coordinated motor reactions .

		Wherever there are boys -LRB- young boys or old boys -RRB- who like to get the most out of nature in the long
summer	DATE	days , Mr.
Sladen	PERSON	's book ought to be available .

		It should be put in libraries as a sort of bait for budding naturalists .

		Not all will bite , of course , but if one or two in a town come to admire and watch humble-bees instead of persecuting them , the thing is worth while .

		And who knows what ability , even genius , may somewhere be stimulated in just this way ?

		A NEW STUDY OF AMERICAN TRAITS .

		* When one has examined a number of books on
America	LOCATION	written by foreigners by every manner of visitor from
England	LOCATION	and
France	LOCATION	and
Germany	LOCATION	and
Italy	LOCATION	, and when one has turned in despair to the interpretations by our own journalists , politicians , and college professors , one is inclined to the conclusion that the Land of Opportunity has not yet been discovered .

		Putting our faith in minute inspection , we peer through spy-glass or microscope , but to no avail : our vision , bright for a moment , is soon blurred .

		Or we speed through the country on twentieth - century railway trains , in the hope that the moving picture will record the salient features of our continental nation and finally yield a faithful composite reproduction .

		Or we inquire whether art , that interprete lingua , has not re - vealed the great pulsing heart of
America	LOCATION	with such coy subtlety that she has eluded all our predecessors in the quest .

		But to no purpose do we open our eyes , or shut them , or gaze through them half - closed ; we are wellnigh as far from clear knowledge as were those first bold immi - grants , Captain
John Smith	PERSON	and
William Brad	PERSON	- ford .


America	LOCATION	, then , is yet to be discovered ; and it would be too much to say that Professor
Perry	PERSON	, the latest adventurer , has succeeded in landing on the coveted shores .

		Yet he is closer than all , or nearly all , who have tried before : one derives from his little book a sense of intimacy with American life and of truth of interpretation nowhere else to be had , no other writer has * THE AMERICAN MIND .

Boston	LOCATION	:
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 379 manifested in so great degree mellow experience and broad knowledge lightly held .

		The chapters -LRB- originally lectures -RRB- are graceful , thoughtful , concrete ; incident , example , and apt quotation are always at hand ; humor , an urbane affection - ate humor , enables the writer to delight while instructing as the sober pseudo-classicists would have put it .

		Fluid yet sure in thought , and constantly engaging in style , the book tempts one to read with uncritical haste ; at the risk , as
Emerson	PERSON	said of
Milton	LOCATION	's prose , that we shall become `` fatigued with admiration . ''

		Whoever would read hastily , or think hastily , should ponder long over the first of these lectures , on `` Race ,
Nation	ORGANIZATION	, and Book . ''

		in which Profes - sor
Perry	PERSON	clears the ground with the thorough - ness , and without the excessive assurance , of the American pioneer .

		In particular , our dogmatic foreign critics friends or enemies , they are nearly all dogmatic would do well to read this chapter at intervals while they travel in the
United States	LOCATION	or think us over as they lie in their deck chairs homeward bound .

		The dangers one encounters in generalizing about a race or a nation have often been pointed out since the pleasant days of determinism , but no one has indicated so clearly the unique insecurity in generalization concerning the American people .

		The second chapter , `` The American Mind , '' is a discussion , rather briefer than one would like , of American traits , our alertness , excitability , versatility , curiosity , over-confidence , energy , idealism , radicalism in our brains and conser - vatism in our blood , our individualism and our public spirit .

		The most valuable part of the book follows .

		`` Humor and Satire '' maintains more persuasively than has ever been maintained be - fore the idea that American humor is hardly a thing sui generis , but rather the application of the common fund of humor to American condi - tions of life .

		The remaining three chapters , per - haps the most notable in the book , are devoted to '' American Idealism , '' `` Romance and
Reac	ORGANIZATION	- tion , '' and `` Individualism and Fellowship , '' phases of American spiritual qualities .

		Spiritual qualities have often been denied us , on the assumption that the dollar and the sky - scraper are the only symbols of
America	LOCATION	that must be reckoned with .

		Carlyle was loath to lecture in this country because he thought of it as `` mainly a new Commercial England , with a fuller pantry . ''

		What more is to be expected of a huge democracy , a '' government of the worst , '' as it was sometimes called in Federal - ist days ?

		The dispassionate critical sense of
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	brought him to the conclusion that a great democracy is almost sure to be lack - ing in elevation .

		Emerson , looking for heroes , for surpassing fruit where the soil is so rich , found us running '' to leaves , to suckers , to ten - drils , to miscellany . ''

		It is still feared that democracy is a cult of incompetence , that an equalitarian social organization involves medi - ocrity ; and it is conventional , in an increasing degree , to deplore our instinct for money-getting and our unthinking lust for '' quick returns . ''

		Yet this expanding , restless , mysterious nation has really been , as Professor
Perry	PERSON	remarks , '' the home of idealism , '' from the beginning onward .

		From the day when elect Puritans enjoyed `` the Rapturous praelibations of the Heavenly World '' to our own day of trust in the unlimited possibilities of democracy , spirit - ual
America	LOCATION	has been as vivacious as material
America	LOCATION	.

		Among the writers of books alone , the
Mathers	ORGANIZATION	in the seventeenth century , Ed - wards in the eighteenth , and
Emerson	LOCATION	in the nineteenth are nobly representative of our inner life .

		How pervasive idealism has been in this country no one has pointed out so fully and buoy - antly as Professor
Perry	PERSON	in these three chapters .

		His view is hopeful our defects impress him but slightly and yet is so clear-sighted that only the cynic will fail to share his hope . ''

		In - dividualism and Fellowship , '' the closing chap - ter , is the most interesting in the book , opening up as it does an endless vista for our dreams and speculations .

		Fellowship may mean nothing better than a '' Samaritan Soup and Blanket Society '' ; it is often narrow , fanatical , or silly ; but it must not be forgotten that individualism also had absurd excesses , that it was not only an age of mighty heroes but also '' ... the age of oddities let loose . ''

		The centrifugal always fascinates .

		If , then , the new era of cooper - ation is tending , as one must think , to senti - mentalism and mechanical organization rather than genuine fellowship , we have good reason to believe that we shall see another and more estimable tendency as the years go on .

		Perfect balance is one of the rarest of human qualities ; but it is not for us to deny that the future will witness that interplay of fellowship and individ - ualism that is now our largest hope .

Nov. 16	DATE	, MATHEMATICO-PROCRUSTEAN ART .

		* It is unquestionably the fact that symmetry and regularity are attributes frequently found associated with the beautiful in nature and in art .

		Whether such association , however , is uni - versal and invariable is open to question .

		Still more debatable is the contention that such rela - tionship is of a sort which may properly be termed causal .

		Are objects beautiful primarily because they are symmetrical and regular in their tectonic ?

		If the reviewer correctly understands the essential argument of the somewhat obscure book called '' Nature 's Harmonic Unity : A Treatise on its Relation to Proportional Form , '' by Mr.
Samuel Colman	PERSON	, that author intends to maintain as his primary thesis that the beautiful is necessarily geometric , and as a corollary that the geometric must perforce be beautiful .

		Now these contentions may be true , but the reviewer has very grave doubts about the matter .

		The fundamental difficulty in the case lies in what would certainly seem to be the fact , that if these ideas were true it ought to be possible for a rea - sonably ingenious person to invent a machine which , upon being supplied with an appropriate source of power , would proceed to turn out paint - ings with the appeal of the
Sistine Madonna	ORGANIZATION	or the
Night Watch	ORGANIZATION	, sculpture which would move mankind as does the
Venus de Milo	PERSON	or the
Winged Victory	ORGANIZATION	, music of the order of the Ride of the Valkyries , or poetry like
Shelley	PERSON	's '' To a Skylark . ''

		But somehow everyone knows , in - stinctively and surely , that this is a sheer im - possibility .

		Harmony and symmetry all these things certainly have .

		But just as certainly their harmony and symmetry is not something created primarily by the application of compass and ruler , and no amount of well-printed and illustrated mathematical argumentation is ever going to convince anybody that it is .

		Any dil - igent fool can manipulate a ruler and compass to produce geometrical symmetries and harmo - nies ; but if he supposes that by this activity solely he is going to create something which will make an enduring appeal to the aesthetic in - stincts of his fellow men , he has only to try it in a practical way in order to be undeceived .

		The method of Mr.
Colman	PERSON	's book is to show by the most extraordinarily complicated dia - grams that a great many different objects found in nature or created by man display a more or less definite and harmonious proportionality of parts , and may be enclosed , by the exercise * NATURE 'S HARMONIC UNITY .

		The examples chosen to illustrate this really profound but not altogether novel discovery are numerous and diverse .

		In their diversity kirks the element of deliciously unintentional humor which classifies this book with the lucubrations of other geometrical philosophers who have pre - ceded our author .

		Thus we are shown -LRB- p. 112 -RRB- that a peanut and the
Parthenon	LOCATION	are planned on the same '' ideal angle . ''

		And so on in - definitely : snow crystals and saint 's chapels , peacocks and palaces , milkweeds and mosques , pine cones and porticos , all these things and many more are geometrically Procrustified in the course of the argument .

		One is moved to wonder whether it might not be wise to prescribe the thorough study of the adventures of
Alice	PERSON	as a fundamental part of all elementary mathe - matical training .

		It would certainly have the good effect , as
Septimus	PERSON	said , of tending to '' keep one human . ''

		THE DIAL 381 progress may , as far as we can see , continue into the indefinite future .

		But the ideal values that prosperity should embody , the values that should give real meaning to progress , appear to be wav - ering .

		Religion , personal and political integrity , family obligation , love of truth and beauty , self - control and honesty of endeavor those ideals and abstractions which are the only contributions of the past to present welfare that are of unimpeach - able worth are apparently undergoing important structural changes .

		Whether these changes repre - sent , on the whole , an advance , or whether they are signs of a degeneration which forebodes the ultimate downfall of western civilization , must be left to the constitutional optimists and pessimists to debate .

		Optimists and pessimists , however , must agree that our society suffers from maladies that if neglected will result in serious consequences .

		We are acquainted with the social reformers who hold that nothing short of a thoroughgoing trans - formation of our political and economic structure can bring relief .

		Other reformers , not less zealous , urge that even this could do little good .

		Men are poor , as a rule ; but , as a rule , men are inefficient , self - indulgent , envious .

		As long as men are what they are , the most profound changes in social structure will leave the sources of misery uncontrolled .

		An improved human nature is evidently what we need .

		To improve the nature of the adult , however , seems a task beyond the power of the social reformer .

		Hence his attention turns to the child , and we have a flood of books designed to force upon the citizen a realization of the necessity of the conservation of the child .

		First in the order of urgency is the problem of the defective child .

		Among our public school chil - dren are tens of thousands who suffer from congeni - tal defect of understanding .

		They block the progress of the classes , yet profit nothing themselves .

		There are hundreds of thousands suffering from impaired hearing or eyesight , from under-nutrition or other remediable condition which , as matters stand , assimi - late them , for all practical purposes , with the con - genitally defective .

		It is the plain duty of society to segregate from the body of normal children all those that are abnormal , to provide adequate treat - ment for those suffering from remediable defects , ' and to devise means for the training of those who are congenitally inferior .

		Adequate medical inspec - tion in the schools will perform the cruder work of segregation .

		To draw a distinction between the children whose mental deficiency is due to causes that are removable and those who suffer from incur - able mental taint is a difficult matter .

		The distinc - tion must , however , be drawn ; for it is obviously the duty of society to segregate , as far as possible , tainted stock , to prevent the transmission of the defect to the next generation .

		For this work of segregation we have need of the services of the psy - chologist , who can also give invaluable suggestions as to the training of those whose development has merely been retarded .

		Even the children who are incurably defective in mind may often be trained for useful and reasonably happy lives , provided the teacher can command the best methods that the psy - chological expert can devise .

		Students of education have long known of the wonderful work of this char - acter carried on at the
University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	under Professor
Lightner Witmer	PERSON	.

		We have now in Mr.
Arthur Holmes	PERSON	's '' The Conservation of the Child '' an account of the work of
the University of Pennsylvania	ORGANIZATION	psychological clinic .

		The book is a practical guide , specially adapted to the use of in - vestigators and teachers who wish to undertake a similar work .

		For such it is extremely rich in suggestions as to methods .

		The book contains also much that will interest the general reader who has awakened to the significance of the current eugenic movement .

		Important as are the problems of checking the transmission to future generations of hereditary men - tal taint , and of removing physical defects which tend to retard mental development , there is a problem of even greater immediate importance : the protection of the child against the degrading influences of en - vironment .

		Much of our j uvenile delinquency , much of the criminality of adult life , is traceable , not to physiological or psychological causes , but to the forces for evil that bear upon the neglected child in the city .

		What obstacles the children of the slums must over - come if they are to reach a plane of normal living we are beginning to understand .

		Miss
Breckinridge	PERSON	and Miss Abbott give us , in `` The Delinquent Child and the Home , '' a clearer insight into the condi - tions of the homes that produce delinquents .

		The book presents , to be sure , much evidence of delin - quency due to tainted heredity ; but the main root of juvenile delinquency appears to be unfavorable environment , due to parental vice or ignorance , to poverty , or to the lack of adjustment to American urban conditions of a population of foreign or rural origin .

		The book is a general study of juvenile delinquency in
Chicago	LOCATION	, and is the most thorough and systematic study of its kind extant .

		It not only exhibits the causes of juvenile delinquency , but offers also abundant suggestions for practical re - form .

		Not the least important part of the book are the appendices , containing a very competent discussion of the legal problems involved in the juvenile court , an abstract of juvenile court laws , and `` family paragraphs '' relating to one hundred boys and fifty girls brought before the juvenile court for delinquencies .

		More potent than the disorder and neglect of the home , in producing delinquency and in arresting the `` physical , mental , and moral development of our children , is their economic exploitation .

		Child labor in the factories has for almost a century received the condemnation of all men of intelligence and public spirit .

		The evil is still with us .

		As all American students know , progress in the direction of the aboli - tion of child labor is rendered difficult by the fact that the subject , in this country , is a matter of state legislation ; and each state fears to advance too far 382 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, beyond its neighbors .

		We are , however , advancing ; and little by little the more backward states imitate , in legislation , the measures of those bold enough to prefer the permanent welfare of their children to the transient prosperity of their industries .

		The present state of legislation in this field , throughout the
United States	LOCATION	, is set forth by Mr.
W. F. Ogburn	PERSON	in his `` Progress and Uniformity in
Child Labor Legislation	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Its somewhat forbidding style should not bar this work from the shelves of the student of the labor problem .

		It is a systematic study of com - parative child labor legislation .

		The age limit of each state , the exceptions to the rules of state law , the machinery of inspection , the penalties upon infractions of the law , are here placed before the reader in easily comprehended tables .

		The author hopes his study will be useful to legislators .

		It cer - tainly will be , if , as many believe , we are about to enter upon an era of expert legislation .

		While factory exploitation of child labor has been the subject of reforming agitation for three genera - tions , the exploitation of children in the manifold services of the city street has scarcely been noticed .

		We know comparatively little about the extent of employment of small children as newsboys , street vendors , bootblacks , etc. .

		The effects of such em - ployment upon character receive little thought from the general public who are served by these children .

		Mr.
Edward W. Clopper	PERSON	, in `` Child Labor in the
City Streets	LOCATION	, '' shows that the number of children thus employed is enormous .

		He also emphasizes the fact , pointed out by other social investigators , that such employment is attended by grave dangers to society .

		The children of the streets furnish an ex - traordinarily large contingent to our army of juve - nile delinquents .

		For the child who has gone wrong , through the fault of his guardians , or in consequence of the ad - verse social and economic influences to which he is exposed , there formerly appeared to be little hope .

		Fortunately we have learned that the reform of the juvenile delinquent is far from a hopeless task .

		The bad boy of our city slums can be transformed into a useful and virtuous citizen , provided he receives the proper kind of treatment .

		The whole world has heard of the achievements of Mr.
William R. George	PERSON	and his Junior Republic .

		It can not hear too much about this great work , and will welcome '' Citizens Made and Remade , '' written by Mr.
Lyman Beecher Stowe	PERSON	, upon data furnished by Mr.
George	PERSON	.

		The experience of Mr.
George	PERSON	has given many of the suggestions for Professor
Edgar J. Swift	PERSON	's '' Youth and the Race . ''

		Professor Swift , however , is concerned primarily with the education of the nor - mal youth .

		He is a follower of the school of peda - gogy which sees in the life of the average person an abbreviated repetition of the life history of the race .

		Boyish nature , in this light , loses its inexplicable and irresponsible quality .

		Boyish sins are thrown back upon that modern representative of the prin - ciple of vicarious atonement , primitive man .

		We should recognize the atavistic character of the im - pulses of the child and utilize them in the great work of education .

		Like Professor Swift , Dr.
William B. Forbush	PERSON	, in `` The Coming Generation , '' is concerned pri - marily with the problems of the upbringing of the normal child .

		If Professor Swift 's interpretation of youth is essentially anthropological , that of Dr.
Forbush	PERSON	is essentially human .

		Dr.
Forbush	PERSON	loves children boys especially .

		It is doubtful that he has even studied them scientifically .

		Possibly for this very reason , his knowledge of their nature is profound .

		His book should prove helpful both to parent and to teacher ; it is worth anyone 's while to read it .

		It is difficult for the social reformer to enter the kingdom of pure literature ; and probably Dr.
Forbush	PERSON	's work , in spite of its fine personal qual - ity , must be consigned to the realm of pedagogy .

		The problem of the proper care and training of our children is manifestly one of great complexity .

		The American public school system is , on the whole , an efficient one ; the American public school teachers are as a class devoted and intelligent .

		The schools are not , however , performing all the work we have a right to require from them .

		Moreover , the ser - vices of the teachers must be supplemented by the organized activities of many other social agencies .

		From papers presented at the conferences held dur - ing the
Chicago Child Welfare Exhibit	ORGANIZATION	in
May , 1911	DATE	, now published under the title , `` The Child in the City , '' both the teacher and the interested layman can gain much information as to the possibilities of child welfare work .

		The book contains an enormous mass of information concerning actual achievements in this field in the various cities of the country .

		As would naturally be expected , the material composing the volume is very uneven in quality .

		A number of the papers , however , are of such excellence as to make the volume an important contribution to the literature of social reform .

		There has probably never been a time when a larger proportion of the citizens of a state were willing to engage in the work of social amelioration than at present .

		Much of the social work undertaken by laymen , however , is lamentably ineffective .

		Who has not known of associations of public-spirited men or women , meeting regularly through months or even years , conducting an interminable correspondence , with a view to the accomplishment of some worthy but wholly trivial task ?

		The waste of philanthropic energies in our society must be incredibly great .

		If these energies could be controlled , and directed to the use of our children , many of our problems would solve themselves .

		Miss
Elsa Denison	PERSON	's book on `` Helping School Children '' is essentially a manual designed to impart the technique of organizing the scattered philanthropic forces of society and of ap - plying them to the service of the child .

		The book is a marvel in its multiplicity of practical suggestions .

		No one to whom it is accessible will need to confess his inability to find important social service work to do .

		The pessimist will urge that it is easy to suggest work for children that needs to be done , the funda -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		383 ; mental difficulty which we encounter is in finding men and women who are capable of doing the work .

		The truth would appear to be that we have , in our society , a host of men and women qualified by intelligence and sympathy to assist in the con - servation of the child .

		If they are inactive , it is because the general public does not recognize the worth of the work .

		Values are social .

		If the gen - eral public regards a certain function with indiffer - ence , the individual , however pure his motives and devoted his character , must lose the faith upon which effective action depends .

		The books under review , and others of their kind , are helping to create general interest in the problems of child welfare , and so are establishing the new values upon which , in the last analysis , the solution of these problems must depend .

		RECENT FICTION .

		* The theme of the marital relation is one that the novelists find perennially interesting , and the com - plications that result from ill-assorted unions afford them endless opportunities for discussion .

		Writers of the older school were usually content with the development of a situation in which either husband or wife was obviously at fault .

		The wife was un - faithful or the husband was a brute , and he who ran might read the moral .

		There was always in the background , if not in the foreground , a contrasting ideal of marital felicity , which example was held up for the reproof of the offending hero or heroine .

		But our later novelists will have nothing so obvious , and it is their peculiar delight to devise a situation in which neither party does anything particularly wrong , and yet both are profoundly unhappy .

		Mr.
H. G. Wells	PERSON	is one of the most ingenious of these exposi - tors , and his latest novel , entitled `` Marriage '' tout court , seems to us an elaborate illustration of much ado about nothing .

		His
Marjorie	PERSON	is an extremely attractive young woman with a college education and a rather distressing family .

		She becomes engaged to a writer who is said to be a professional humorist , which fact we must take on faith , since none of his many recorded words for a moment suggests such a thing .

		He is described more accurately as covering every subject which interested him `` with a large * MARRIAGE .

		enveloping shallowness . ''

		From the fate of such a union
Marjorie	PERSON	is saved by a young student of mo - lecular physics who drops one day upon her lawn in a wrecked airship .

		Trafford knows his own mind and is plain-spoken ; the wooing is speedily followed by the wedding , and the skies seem unclouded .

		Un - fortunately ,
Marjorie	PERSON	soon involves the household in unanticipated expenses , for spending is her delight , and
Trafford	ORGANIZATION	gives her carte blanche , although he knows that she has no idea of the value of money .

		The `` society '' bee also gets into her bonnet , and , to meet the increased demands upon him ,
Trafford	ORGANIZATION	gives up his scientific research and takes to money - making unabashed .

		Synthetic rubber brings him a large fortune , and , according to all rational theories , the couple are provided with everything that makes for happiness .

		But instead of realizing his blessings ,
Trafford	ORGANIZATION	becomes filled with a profound disgust with his whole scheme of life , and persuades
Marjorie	PERSON	to join with him in a mad scheme of breaking away from all its artificial entanglements .

		The outcome is that they close their home , place their children in the care of relatives , and set out for of all places in the world Labrador .

		There they strike into the wilderness , establish a solitary winter camp , and talk things over interminably .

		At this point the book ceases to be a novel at all , and becomes a philo - sophical discussion of the deeper meaning of life .

		It is all immensely clever in its introspective analysis , and the interest does not flag although the action is arrested .

		Trafford breaks his leg and becomes delir - ious , revealing himself to
Marjorie	PERSON	in his ravings , to , which she listens patiently for weeks .

		For example '' I ought never to have married her never , never I I had my task .

		I gave myself to her .

		Oh !

		The scandals as though the things they did with themselves and each other mattered a rap ; the little sham impromptu clever things , the trying to keep young and underneath it all that continual cheating , cheating , cheating , damning struggle for money ! ''

		Presently he recovers consciousness , but talks on in the same strain for endless pages , discussing the prob - lems of the rational individual life and the rational organization of society .

		In his earlier books , Mr.
Wells	PERSON	has suggested various nostrums fo * the relief of the world 's imagined discontent , but he seems noT * to have lost faith in them , and to see no clear patL through the tangle .

		What he does not see is that the tangle is largely of his own creation , and that reason is slowly but surely working out its triumph over unreason in the ordering of human affairs .

		As for
Trafford	ORGANIZATION	and
Marjorie	PERSON	he leaves them on their way back to civilization , with a vivid experience to remember , but with nothing definitely solved , bear - ing with them their unhappy temperaments , which do not promise for them any greater peace of mind in the future than in the past .

		`` Maarten Maartens '' confesses that he owes the inspiration of `` Eve v to ``
Effie Briest	PERSON	, '' Theodor 384 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	,
Fontane	ORGANIZATION	's famous novel .

		It is an intimate story of Dutch life , full of the types of character which the author portrays with such delicate insight .

		It offers a variation upon the familiar `` triangular '' situation with which the majority of modern novels are concerned .

		The heroine is an imaginative crea - ture with a passionate sense of beauty , whose up - bringing has been of a nature to develop her native artistic temperament .

		The man whom she marries is the wrong one a prosaic person who is a model of all the homely virtues , a well-to-do landowner and ambitious politician , but narrow in his outlook , and wholly incapable of understanding the woman to whom he is married .

		The man who makes her an unfaithful wife is an aviator , who achieves fame by flying from the Hook to
Harwich	LOCATION	and back , an exploit with which all
Europe	LOCATION	resounds .

		When the news of his death in
Paris	LOCATION	comes to her , ahe makes confession of her guilt , and departs with her child to geek the protection of the nuns in a near-by convent .

		The author describes this story as `` an incident of Paradise regained , '' which leaves one questioning .

		Is it really to regain Paradise to find happiness in an illicit love and to bear all the practical consequences of such a lapse ?

		Like most of its predecessors , this book is largely one of conversations keen , witty , and often wise which reveal the inmost natures of the interesting and very human group of people with which it is concerned .

		It comes very near to being a work of genius .

		The Irish humorist who writes under the name of ''
G. A. Birmingham	PERSON	'' is rapidly acquiring an enthusiastic clientele of American readers .

		Six of his novels have now appeared in the American edi - tions , and in the latest of these the author 's powers of whimsical invention show no signs of exhaustion .

		The appetite for his work grows by what it feeds on , and `` Priscilla 's Spies '' proves to be no less delightful than its predecessors .

		Priscilla is a re - freshingly nice girl of the torn-boy variety , and the prompt way in which she enlarges the experience of her cousin , the priggish public school boy who comes to visit her in the west of
Ireland	LOCATION	, is highly diverting .

		Her escapades have an imaginative touch .

		They are chiefly concerned with running to earth two mysterious strangers a young man and a young woman who appear in those parts , and cruise about the islands , camping in remote places .

		Priscilla pre - tends to believe that they are German spies engaged in the nefarious task of charting the coast .

		In reality they are a runaway couple a curate and his bride escaping from the paternal wrath of the bride 's father , who is the official at the head of the
War Office	ORGANIZATION	.

		When the latter arrives upon the scene , the game is up , but it is too late for him to do anything but forgive .

		Incidentally , there is disclosed the sec - ret of one of the islands , which the natives prevent visitors from approaching by a most ingenious and complicated system of lying .

		They have the best of reasons , for the island in question is the scene of a flourishing native industry of the kind which is dis - couraged by the revenue officers .

		Priscilla is a joyously original creature , and stands next in our affections to Lalage among the author 's heroines .

		Her occasional comments upon English poetry -LRB- which she has reluctantly studied in school -RRB- fur - nish one of the most entertaining features of the story .

		Sir
Arthur Doyle	PERSON	's `` The Lost World '' is a tale of amazing adventures in
South America	LOCATION	.

		A basaltic plateau , near the upper course of one of the tribu - taries of the
Amazon	LOCATION	, has in prehistoric ages been cut off by a cataclysmic elevation from participation in the life of the rest of the continent , and upon it have been preserved down to our own days such dragons of the prime as dinosaurs , and ichthyosaurs , and plesiosaurs , and iguanodons , besides a race of ape-men not much higher than the gorilla in develop - ment .

		To this region a well-assorted party of four explorers make their way , and have a most exciting time of it .

		These fearsome beasts , hitherto known only to palaeontology , are made to live and ravage before our very eyes , and the denizens of the Indian jungle are made to seem tame in comparison .

		The explorers barely escape with their lives , and return to
London	LOCATION	to tell their story with sensational effect , bringing with them as an exhibit a live plesiosaurus .

		The story is told by a newspaper reporter , who had joined the expedition to acquire merit in the eyes of a young woman named
Gladys	PERSON	, who was to be satis - fied with nothing less than a hero .

		When he returns , sad to relate ,
Gladys	PERSON	has well-nigh forgotten him , and found consolation in the arms of one Potts , a solic - itor 's clerk , who is anything but a hero .

		This is the only love-interest of the story , but it has enough in - terest of other sorts to atone for this culpable sin of omission .

		Since the lamented death of
Vaughan Kester	PERSON	, which occurred soon after the publication of his sterling novel , `` The Prodigal Judge , '' two posthu - mous novels from his pen have seen the light .

		One of them , `` The Just and the Unjust , '' was a poor performance , which added nothing to his reputation .

		The other , `` The Fortunes of the Landrays , '' now published , is a much finer work , and approaches within measurable distance the ideal which the pub - lic delights to envisage under the style of the
Great American Novel	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is a typical story of American life during the
last half of the nineteenth century	DATE	, not the life of the great centres of population , which gets exploited in our newspapers and other works of fiction , but the life of the small community , in which the interests and purposes of our national character are less obscured and sophisticated in their expres - sion .

		The Landrays are one of the pioneer families of
Benson	LOCATION	,
Ohio	LOCATION	, and we first make their acquaint - ance in the year of the
California	LOCATION	gold discovery .

		The two brothers who represent the family , finding their fortunes somewhat decayed , join the Argonauts in their quest , taking the overland route , and become the victims of an Indian massacre .

		Their widows , one of whom has a son , are thus left in
Benson	LOCATION	to carry on the family tradition and sustain the family fortunes .

		The son , grown to manhood at the outbreak
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 385 of the Civil War , enters the army and remains in it until
Appomattox	LOCATION	puts an end to the struggle .

		He then goes into business , makes a failure of it , and dies , leaving a son to keep the name alive .

		This son , grown to manhood , and about to marry a girl whose family fortunes we have also followed for three gen - erations , is the chief object of our interest when the story ends , or rather stops short , at the beginning of the present century .

		We thus have a situation not unlike that of the play called `` Milestones , '' and a treatment which is necessarily episodic .

		Whatever unity the plot possesses is due to the two characters whose lives span the entire period of the narrative .

		These are
Virginia Landray	LOCATION	, the widow of one of the ill-fated gold-hunters , and
Jake Benson	PERSON	, the suc - cessful lawyer and man of substance , who persistently presses his suit upon her only to be definitely rejected .

		When faithfulness and devotion fail to achieve their aim , he becomes unfaithful , and , having charge of her business affairs , defrauds her in a peculiarly mean and revolting way , hoping to retain a hold upon her through her poverty .

		The way in which the fraud is eventually disclosed illustrates one of the many ingenious devices whereby the end of this novel is linked with its beginnings .

		It comes through the recovery of a document entrusted by
Stephen Land	PERSON	- ray to the keeping of a small boy in the camp of the gold-seekers just before they are wiped out by the Indians .

		This boy is rescued , grows up in the household of a Mormon elder , becomes a prosperous ranchman , and ,
fifty years later	DATE	, accidentally learns into whose hands the document should be given .

		The long arm of coincidence has to be worked in many other ways also to work into one pattern the many threads of this romantic history , but the ingenuity of the author is unfailing , and he does not strain our incredulity overmuch .

		In observation , variety of in - terest , and power of characterization , this book , with its presentation of a cross-section of the American life of its period , is really a noteworthy performance .

		`` A Man 's World , '' by Mr.
Albert Edwards	PERSON	, `` is the story of how I , born at the close of the Great War , lived , and of the things commonplace and unusual which happened to me , how they felt at the time and how I feel about them now . ''

		A book thus described does not fit easily into the conventional literary categories , and the author is quite right in his renunciation of the title of novelist , saying that the work has no unity '' except the frame of mind which led me to write it , which has held me to task till now . ''

		These prefatory observations whet our expectations , for a story which should live up to the formula above given would obviously be something out of the com - mon. .

		It would substitute reality for artifice , sincerity for simulation , and insight for the play of superficial observation . ''

		A Man 's World '' does all of this , and more , giving us in the form of autobiography a pic - ture of everyday life which impresses the reader with its absolute honesty , and makes for the enlargement of his sympathies .

		It must be said also that it makes for the confusion of moral values , for it holds up `` free love '' as a tenable alternative to legalized marriage , and it bids us accept the metamorphosis of a foul - mouthed prostitute into a virtuous wife of high spirit - ual ideals .

		These matters are so dealt with that they do not seem to give offense when we read of them ; it is only upon subsequent reflection , when we view them in the abstract , that we see them as they are .

		The story of the narrator 's life begins in the South , and pictures his mind as it struggles to escape from the bondage of a narrow religious orthodoxy .

		The emancipation is fairly complete , and the boy goes to
New York	LOCATION	to earn his living .

		He drifts into literary hack work until his eyes give out , and then he drifts into social settlement work , in which he finds his true vocation .

		He becomes a sort of missionary in the Tombs , then a probation officer , and in the end a recognized authority upon penology .

		He comes to know thoroughly the seamy side of life , and finds a soul of good in most of the evil things that engage his attention .

		He elaborates no theories , but applies to each case that presents itself a broad human method of treatment which is sometimes effective , and some - times not .

		He goes straight to the heart of each concrete human problem , which is better than any doctrinaire course , even if it lead to mistakes now and then .

		He has all the time the vision of a better social order toward which mankind is slowly groping , and is content to think that he is obscurely helping to bring about the regeneration .

		He wins none of the prizes which we expect to come to the heroes of our novels , and even his one radiant love affair ends in disappointment .

		We leave him in middle life , confused but not embittered , a man who feels that his work is done , and that it has played , in its coral - insect way , `` an integral part in the increment of wisdom . ''

		In the belief that the new generation is less handicapped than the old , and that it will know better how to deal with the problems of poverty , and suffering , and crime , the narrator ends his convincing tale of a human life lived in `` a man 's world . ''

		We notice a few conspicuous errors that ought to be cor - rected , such as '' Compte '' for the French positivist , `` Safchen '' for
Heine	ORGANIZATION	's Sefchen , and ``
Guiseppe	PERSON	, '' the impossible name of the old Garibaldian .

		`` My Love and I , '' by ``
Martin Redfield	PERSON	, '' is a discussion , in autobiographical form , of the problem dealt with by Mr.
Wells	PERSON	in the novel previously reviewed .

		It has nothing of the richness of Mr.
Wells	PERSON	's treatment , and relies more upon the con - ventional motives .

		There is another woman in the case , whom the man loves in secret , although he does not escape from the bondage that keeps him from her .

		He has married a girl simply because she is beautiful , and is left afterwards to make the discovery that she is hard , selfish , and mercenary .

		It is a common experience with men , and the present case is fairly typical .

		The hero is a popular novelist who prostitutes his art to meet the demands of his wife for display and social position .

		She , for her part , constantly wounds his susceptibilities by her inability to understand any ideal of life that is above the artificial and material plane .

		She fawns upon a wealthy spinster in the hope of an inherit - 386 THE DIAL -LSB-
Nov. 16	DATE	, ance , and secretly takes money from a former lover to gratify her mean desires and ambitions .

		There are many quarrels , but no domestic crash , and the other woman remains a star that dwells apart .

		The story has a rare degree of sincerity , which makes it more convincing than most works of fiction .

		Such tragedies will continue to exist as long as men take to themselves wives knowing nothing more of them than may be seen upon the surface , and the interests of society sternly demand that the obligations thus heedlessly incurred shall be kept , whatever their cost of individual suffering . ''

		The Secret of Frontellac , '' by Mr.
Frank K. Scribner	PERSON	, is a mystery story of considerable ingen - uity and picturesque in its setting .

		An American becomes the heir to a French chateau , and proceeds to take possession .

		He finds that it has been a rallying-place for the irreconcilable faction of French royalists ever since the Revolution , and he unearths documents which lead him to believe that somewhere within its precincts are hidden the trea - sure rifled from the royal tombs at St. De `` nis at the time of the sacrilege of
1793	DATE	.

		Searching for this treasure , the occupant becomes aware that his movements are watched , and supposes that the government is suspicious of him .

		Ambushes and attempted assassinations follow , and at last the treasure is unearthed in the shape of gold ingots bearing a modern date .

		It seems that the
Bank of France	ORGANIZATION	has been robbed of a million francs , and that the swag has been planted in the grounds of the castle .

		Whereupon the American is arrested for complicity in the crime , and has a hard time proving his innocence .

		A little elementary science would have saved the author from endowing sulphur with the properties of phosphorus -LRB- a frequent blunder with novelists -RRB- , or from having his hero nonchal - antly pick up the treasure-chest , unaware that a million francs will weigh the greater part of a ton .

		Since the hero has inherited with the castle the guardianship of a beautiful girl , he is richly con - soled in the outcome for the perils that have beset his path .

		Regarding the Revolution as a spasm , yielding only a reluctant and provisional assent to the eighteen years ' reign of the
Orleans	LOCATION	branch as represented in
Louis Philippe	LOCATION	, looking on the present republic , in spite of its forty - one years of vigorous life , as a mistake some time to be rectified , they have lavished on '' Louis XVII . ''

		a passionate devotion only equalled by the Jacobite loyalty to the
Stuart Pretenders	PERSON	.

		These claimants to the English throne had , however , the enormous advantage of being always ocularly in evidence ; while the name and claims of
Charles Louis de Bourbon	LOCATION	, Duke of
Normandy	LOCATION	, were assumed by half-a-dozen men at different times and places .

		As only one of these could be the rightful heir , the ques - tion of identity was of course vital to any successful prosecution of the cause .

8th of June , 1795	DATE	, or was another child , already moribund , substituted for the Dauphin and the latter smuggled out of the prison , to lead a wandering and precarious life for fifty years longer , under the assumed name of Naundorf ?

		Among the various works which have espoused and pressed the cause of Naundorf as the real Louis XVII. , probably the most exhaustive in detail and energetic in spirit has been
Henri Provins	PERSON	's `` Dernier Roi Le ` gitime de
France	LOCATION	, '' which has now been made available for English readers by Miss
Phoebe Allen	PERSON	, in a volume called `` The Last Legitimate King of
France	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Dut	PERSON	- ton -RRB- .

		The work is modestly described as a `` com - pilation , '' based on the researches and writings of
Henri Provins	PERSON	,
Otto Friedrichs	PERSON	, and others .

		It con - stitutes a sustained and elaborate special plea in sup - port of the claim that `` Louis XVII .

		was secretly taken from the Tower in the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	some time be - tween the middle of
October	DATE	and the beginning of
November , 1794	DATE	, and that he left the
Temple	ORGANIZATION	early in
June , 1795	DATE	; that his place in the Tower was sup - plied by a deaf and dumb child , who served as his substitute until probably the end of
March , 1795	DATE	; that the deaf-mute was in his turn exchanged for a second substitute , the moribund child whose death in the Tower and subsequent autopsy did really and truly take place . ''

		After various imprisonments and escapes , the young man emerges in
Berlin	LOCATION	in
1810	DATE	with a passport bearing the name of
Naundorf	ORGANIZATION	.

		For the thirty-five years ensuing , until his death in
1845	DATE	, he led the adventurous life of a Claimant .

		He bore certain physical marks known to have been on the person of the
Dauphin	LOCATION	, and recalled correctly various intimate details of the life in the prison which could have been known to the
Dauphin	LOCATION	only .

		He also pos - sessed two documents in the handwriting of
Marie Antoinette	PERSON	and
Louis XVI.	PERSON	, which were taken by the Prussian government and never returned .

		It is simply amazing , the enormous mass of evidence some of it convincing , some trivial which has been accumulated in this volume of over four hundred pages , to prove the parti pris .


Delia Bacon	PERSON	was by contrast a cold and timorous advocate of her heresy .

		The work is conceived in a spirit of bitterness toward all who were skeptical as to
Naundorf	ORGANIZATION	's pretensions .

		As the prince 's sister , the Duchess of Angoulme , and his uncles ,
Louis	LOCATION	XVIII .

		and
Charles X.	PERSON	, could naturally never be brought to look with anything but a forbidding eye on
Naundorf	ORGANIZATION	's appeals for recogni - tion , the author has no good words for them ; and
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 387
Louis Philippe	PERSON	is also castigated for his refusals to open the claimant 's case when repeatedly begged to do so .


Europe	LOCATION	's interest in the '' Cause , '' which had grown somewhat tepid , was roused to a fitful warmth by the recent appeal -LRB-
1911	DATE	-RRB- made to the
Senate	ORGANIZATION	in
Paris	LOCATION	by the descendants of Naundorf for favorable consideration of their claims ; and some hitherto unpublished evidence was brought to light , which is included , with all the rest , in the present work .

		On the whole , the book may be recommended as a spirited though one-sided representation of one of the great mysteries of history .

		The '' man ^ * s an amaz i n g thing that any farthest down '' American , in a seven weeks ' race in
Europe	LOCATION	.

		through
Europe	LOCATION	, from
Scotland	LOCATION	to
Sicily	LOCATION	and from
Sicily	LOCATION	to
Scandinavia	LOCATION	, should dis - cover enough that is new to serve as material for a book worth the reading .

		That such a book should throw light upon important problems of our own is still more amazing .

		The wonder of it disap - pears , however , upon the mention of the author 's name , for
Booker T. Washington	ORGANIZATION	is a professional wonder-worker .

		What Mr.
Washington	PERSON	set out to find was the `` man farthest down '' in European countries , in order to compare his position with that of the man farthest down in
America	LOCATION	, the negro .

		This , at any rate , was his avowed purpose ; his unavowed design was to discover what hope for the future the most wretched of Europeans might justly entertain , and to bring back some of that hope to his own people .

		Wretchedness enough he found .

		He saw youths in the sulphur mines subject to a worse slavery than the negroes have ever known in
America	LOCATION	.

		He saw coasts that must be guarded by soldiers to keep wretched peasants from stealing the waters of the sea .

		He saw women serving as beasts of draught and of burden .

		In some of the countries visited he saw evidence of race prejudice more bitter , race oppression more cruel , than that of our own country at its worst .

		But everywhere , he found reason to believe , conditions are gradually improving .

		The man farthest down is rising .

		And in some cases this appears to be due to the very fact of racial oppression . ''

		Of the three sections of the Polish race , German , Rus - sian and Austrian , there are two in which ... the -LSB- Polish -RSB- people are oppressed , and one in which they seem to be , if anything , the oppressors .

		In Russian
Poland	LOCATION	and in
German Poland	LOCATION	the Polish are making a desperate struggle to main - tain their national existence , but in these two countries the Poles are prosperous .

		... In Austrian
Poland	LOCATION	, on the con - trary , where the Austrian government , in order , perhaps , to hold the political aspirations of the Ruthenians in check , has given them a free hand in the government of the prov - ince , ... they have made less progress . ''

		Not more than two hundred and fifty years ago so gifted a man as
Holberg	PERSON	could believe that intel - ligence and political capacity are by nature denied to all but the hereditary aristocracy .

		There are still cultivated Englishmen who will assert that the Irish lack capacity for government ; we who have been governed by them know better .

		The German is con - vinced of the political incompetence of the Poles ; the Poles , of that of the Ruthenians ; the
Hunga	PERSON	- rians know of a certainty that the Slovaks lack civic qualities .

		We who have seen Germans and Poles and Ruthenians , Hungarians and Slovaks , under equal laws , and with equal opportunities , gradually transforming themselves into typical Americans , know what value to place upon Old World super - stitions of congenital inferiorities and superiorities , social and racial .

		We have our own congenital superiorities and inferiorities white and black .

		Possibly these alone of their kind are real and eternal .

		Even so , they need not prevent a vast improvement in the lot of the black man .

		lightly from Miss
Maude M. Hoi	PERSON	- bach 's '' In the
Footsteps of Richard Coeur	ORGANIZATION	de Lion '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown	PERSON	,
& Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The writer is not content with following those footsteps , biographically , to her hero 's last fateful strides before
Chaluz	PERSON	.

		She pro- ceeds , in the second part of the book , to lead us through various regions once traversed by him , pointing out whatever footprints still remain and also inviting our attention to much scenery which -LRB- like Quince 's `` bill of properties '' -RRB- but slenderly illuminates the main plot .

		Does the work as a whole , then , belong to the genus Travel or Popular Biog - raphy ?

		In body , to the latter for part one takes up two-thirds of the book ; in spirit , however , chiefly to the former .

		Part one presents us with a scenic life of the Lion-Heart ; and does so , on the whole , excellently .

		The writer has had a keen eye for all that is picturesque in the chronicles ; and her con - siderable narrative and descriptive powers enable her to make effective use of what constitutes her dis - tinctive equipment , an extraordinary familiarity with the scenes of
Richard	ORGANIZATION	's activities .

		In part two the lion , indeed , is off the stage ; but the atmosphere remains the same .

		The author has something of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's skill in reminding us of what has happened '' behind the scene '' ; and when allusion to
Richard	PERSON	fails why , then there is Herod or
Napo	ORGANIZATION	- leon .

		So that in part two
Richard	PERSON	, aided by others , illuminates the landscape ; whereas in part one the landscape illuminates
Richard	PERSON	.

		To be sure , towns and countrysides can throw but little light on a man 's inner nature unless he happens to be an architect or a landscape gardener .

		And it is unfortunate that
Miss Holbach	PERSON	implies , in her opening chapter and elsewhere , an intention of rendering a truer picture than has yet been of
Richard	PERSON	's personality .

		She adds nothing , in this respect , to accounts given in the various historical works -LRB- particularly in
Kate Norgate	PERSON	's admirable book on the Angevins -RRB- which she quotes so liberally in her own text .

		Like many other makers of popular biography , she seems oblivi - ous to the fact that nice discrimination as well as historic bent , and much logical thinking as well as whole-hearted interest , are required for the delinea - tion of a notable individuality .

		Miss
Holbach	PERSON	's 388 THE DIAL -LSB-

		Indeed , her whole book rings true .

		Hall for calling his collection of studies of eminent men who appealed to his , as to so many others ' , interests in his pilgrimages to
Germany	LOCATION	, `` The Founders of Modern Psychology '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		To the last of the group , who is properly accorded the largest space , the title rightly belongs .


Wilhelm Wundt	PERSON	, who this year celebrated his eighti - eth birthday , has in his own career witnessed the emergence of a new insight into the nature of the world of mind and the methods of its pursuit , and himself played a pioneer 's part in the occupation .


Helmholtz	PERSON	was a versatile genius who solved a con - siderable range of problems by which the psycholo - gist eagerly profited .


Fechner	PERSON	has a quasi-legitimate rank as a founder ; but the sketch presented though less engaging than the slighter essay of James shows the otherwise directed bent of his major in - terests .

		Von
Hartmann	PERSON	,
Lotze	PERSON	, and
Zeller	PERSON	are rightfully claimed by philosophy and have had but a negligible influence in shaping modern psychology , though they labored in fields where a psychological harvest -LRB- or gleaning -RRB- was inevitable .

		But apart from Dr.
Hall	PERSON	's title , his collection of studies deals with notable men who made notable contributions to the philosophic renaissance of the nineteenth century in
Germany	LOCATION	.

		They seem heroic figures , despite their proximity to our own outlook ; and yet the studies carry a reminiscent air .

		Dr.
Hall	PERSON	had a living ac - quaintance with all these men , casual in some cases , but enough to catch the direct inspiration of personal contact which attracted the scholarly-minded of his generation to the seats of learning in
Germany	LOCATION	, and kept them there long enough to catch its spirit and successfully transplant it to the new world .

		The studies make difficult reading , unrelieved by felici - ties or facilities of presentation ; they often suggest the careful digest of a conscientious student , yet one keeping in mind the principles of interest that give unity of interpretation , and the critical sense that must weigh and judge as well as record the data of judgment .

		There is often a plethora of detail that reflects the formlessness which the younger Germans are discarding as an impediment of progress , how - ever imposing as the baggage of learning .

		As a record of the contributions of a related group of scholars who made a critical epoch in the
Wissen	LOCATION	- schaft which is our direct heritage , the volume oc - cupies a unique place and serves a helpful purpose .

		Superstition ManV P arts f
India	LOCATION	ffer a rich and omens of harvest for the anthropologist or

Edgar Thurston	PERSON	has garnered an attractive bundle of sheaves , which he presents in a volume entitled '' Omens and Superstitions of
Southern India	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
McBride , Nast & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The au - thor was formerly Superintendent of the
Madras Government Museum	ORGANIZATION	and of the Ethnographic Sur - vey of the
Madras Presidency	ORGANIZATION	, and has published a number of works on kindred subjects .

		The present contribution contains twelve chapters , with such captions as `` Snake Worship , '' `` Charms , '' `` Human Sacrifice , '' `` Magic and Magicians , '' and `` Rain - making Ceremonies . ''

		The general treatment seems to represent a compromise between the scientist and the layman , but inclining rather to the latter .

		The net result is a volume that does not enlarge the boundaries of science , but does treat its deliberately limited field with considerable thoroughness , while reporting much that is interesting for the general reader .

		As an illustration of the latter phase , we may adduce the story of the idol protected from desecration at night by a cobra . ''

		When the doors are being shut , the snake slides in , and coils itself round the lingam .

		Early in the
morning	TIME	, when the priest opens the door , it glides away , without attempting to harm any of the large number of spec - tators , who never fail to assemble . ''

		More thrilling is the account , twice recorded , of the
Shanan	PERSON	who was working on the top of a palmyra palm when a high wind broke off the stalk and he was wafted gently to the earth by a huge leaf , which acted as a natural parachute .

		Again , there is much suggestiveness in an instance of demon worship : the demon was an English officer , killed about a hundred years ago , and the worship '' consisted in offering to his manes spirituous liquors and cheroots . ''

		Then another paragraph will send a very different current along the reader 's nerves : `` As recently as
1902	DATE	a
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean magistrate in Ganjam received a petition , asking for permission to perform a human sacrifice , which was intended to give a rich colour to the turmeric crop . ''

		And even later than this there have been unmistakable examples of the slaying of children to procure the help of some god .

		Exact - ing students will regret that Mr.
Thurston	PERSON	has not always indicated more clearly the value he places on his authorities , although his sources of informa - tion are generally given .

		The author 's English is simple and unstudied almost to an extreme .

		The volume is well printed and generally presentable .

Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , evolution .

		j s a C0 n e ction of nature essays of a kind that is new , not only in Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's work , but in literature .

		It was to be expected that Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	, who has more of the scientific attitude than had any of his predecessors in nature writing , would turn sooner or later to questions of geology and biology , and he has at last done so in a book that is both wise and entertaining .

		It is the result , as he remarks in the preface , '' of the stages of brood - ing and thinking which I have gone through '' in embracing the doctrine of evolution .

		Most of us accept this doctrine quite as our forebears normally
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 389 accepted the doctrines of Christianity without question , almost without interest ; and we avoid learned treatises on the subject because they are presumably dull .

		Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's essays are in the main a visualization of evolution , an attempt to open our eyes and our minds to '' Primal Energies '' and `` The Hazards of the Past '' and all the infinitely wonderful events that took place on `` The Long Road '' ; they are an emotional yet thoughtful in - quiry into the problems of modern science science touched with emotion .

		As such , they are thoroughly readable , despite the prevalence of Mr.
Burroughs	PERSON	's inveterate weakness , repetition .

		`` I am aware , '' he writes , `` that there is much repetition in them '' ; there is indeed , and it wellnigh spoils them .

		The first essay is a marvel of lack of evolution in style : back and forth it runs , and across , like a dog seeking the scent .

		The annoyance that the reader suffers is diminished somewhat by the skilful arrangement of the essays ; they become more and more specific as we go on , and the semi-narrative essays , such as '' Holidays in
Hawaii	LOCATION	, '' afford some relief .

		The concluding chapter , on `` The Gospel of Nature , '' contains soonany interesting and significant remarks that one finds it difficult to forbear quotation .

		A great military General
Sherman	PERSON	at the head of an commander as academy of half a hundred undis - college president .

		c i p ii ne d boy s , and pestered with such petty administrative details as the detection and punishment of the young scapegrace who had daubed with hair-oil all the blackboards and chairs in one of the recitation rooms , presents a picture not at all familiar to those in whose imagination he is either marching victoriously through
Georgia	LOCATION	or standing shoulder to shoulder with Grant in repuls - ing with heavy loss the assaults of Confederate armies .

		Yet this is the picture of him , painted chiefly by himself , that is offered us in a noteworthy volume compiled and edited by Professor
Walter L. Fleming	PERSON	, of the
Louisiana State University	ORGANIZATION	, and published by the
Arthur H. Clark	PERSON	Company of
Cleveland	LOCATION	.

		`` General
W. T. Sherman	PERSON	as College President '' is succinctly described on its title-page as `` a collection of letters , documents , and other material , chiefly from private sources , relating to the life and activities of General
William Tecumseh Sherman	PERSON	, to the early years of
Louisiana	LOCATION	State Uni - versity , and to the stirring conditions existing in the South on the eve of the Civil War ; 1859-1861 . ''

		Sherman applied for and obtained the position of superintendent of the
State Seminary of Learning	ORGANIZATION	at
Alexandria	LOCATION	, upon its organization in
1859	DATE	, and he entered on his new duties with the opening of the year 1860 , holding also the professorship of engi - neering , architecture , and drawing .

		He remained at
Alexandria	LOCATION	, ably guiding the fortunes of what was ere long to become the
State University of Louisiana	ORGANIZATION	until the strained relations between
North and South	ORGANIZATION	made him feel in honor bound to relin - quish his post and throw in his lot with the
Union	ORGANIZATION	.

		His personal and official correspondence for those two years is now for the first time brought to light by one enjoying exceptional facilities for the col - lecting and editing of these interesting documents , and the volume , suitably illustrated and sufficiently annotated , forms a valuable appendix or companion piece to
Sherman	PERSON	's `` Personal Memoirs . ''

		It shows the man at a critical period of his life .

		A treatise ?

		r -
Hubert Parry	PERSON	's `` Style in Mus - on style in ical Art '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- consists of a musical art .

		series of lectures delivered recently at
Oxford	ORGANIZATION	.

		While the volume has the necessary academic completeness , it maintains also the interest which appeals to the larger audience .

		Style , Dr.
Parry	PERSON	tells us , `` may be considered from as many points of view as there are causes or conditions which induce it .

		They interlace and mingle without necessarily disturbing or confusing one another .

		Some are plain and easily distinguished , and some are hard to define ; some are elementary , inevitable , persistent ; some are elusive and resultant .

		Material causes , general causes , psychological , racial , and per - sonal causes , associations and conditions of present - ment , all influence and control its variations , of which anyone with a glimmering of artistie or literary sense is conscious . ''

		This passage indicates the method of treatment .

		To each phase of the subject is devoted one or more lectures , and the historic or evolutionary procedure is followed in each case .

		From the first instinctive recognition of an element through its conscious manipulation up to its free and artistic use the unfoldment proceeds .

		One wonders why the treatment is not made more systematic ; Dr.
Parry	PERSON	announces the principles underlying the mass of material , but he employs these principles only in the subsidiary phases , not in the whole .

		This gives a somewhat encyclopaedic aspect to his discussion , but the accumulation of detail is after all very well ordered .

		The subject of style is here treated with the consideration which its importance demands .

		The work is remarkably comprehensive , and indeed is authoritative in its field .

		The great art with which it deals is discussed not only from the side of its technique , but also from the side of its content or significance .

		It is a work which deserves the serious attention of all who are interested in music .

		The story of this up-hill struggle is told with briskness and vivacity in `` Thirteen Years of a Busy Woman 's Life '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , a noteworthy piece of autobiography signed by Mrs.
Alec Tweedie	PERSON	.

		In her `` prologue '' she refers , with a mingling of epi - gram and philosophy , to the discipline of misfortune . ''

		Mrs.
Tweedie	PERSON	's biography of her father , Dr.
George Harley	PERSON	, and her books about
Mexico	LOCATION	and its seven-times president are well known , as also are others of the thirteen volumes she has produced in as many years .

		Her large output of newspaper and magazine writing in the same period was probably what chiefly paid the household bills , though it will be sooner forgotten .

		Her account of her various travels in quest of book-material , of the hardships and bodily dangers she has faced , of the illustrious persons she has met , and a great variety of other matters such as a bright and observant woman knows how to make the most of in a narrative of the kind she has so entertainingly written , will be greatly enjoyed by those who like to read of real life strenu - ously lived by energetic people .


Washington	LOCATION	and In Wsvolume entitled ``
Washington	LOCATION	Lincoln as and Lincoln '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , Mr.
Robert	PERSON	related leaders , yf
McLaughlin	ORGANIZATION	attempts a rather unusual task .

		Inasmuch as the names of
Washington	LOCATION	and Lincoln are generally coupled as the two great - est of our history , it has seemed to the author that the relation of these two leaders in governmental action and theory should be traced .

		He assumes a general conviction , '' which deepens with the years , that the two ' Fathers ' mastered the ideas that con - stitute the basis of our national structure , '' and he endeavors to show that the two men acted on the same great principles of government , the `` im - perial ideal '' with power lodged at the centre dis - tinct from and in addition to power in the parts .

		Both the aristocrat and the democrat subscribed to the political creed that power as expressed in law , is derived from the people , `` yet the words did not mean exactly the same to each .


Washington	LOCATION	saw the people in the law ; Lincoln saw the law in the people . ''

		Mr.
McLaughlin	PERSON	traces the course of our political development , from the English attempt at parliamentary control in
1765	DATE	through the revolu - tionary era , the constitutional era , the national era , and the civil war era , to show
Washington	LOCATION	's theory of government and his influence upon the course of affairs , and then
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's , and to show that the abuse of its power by the controlling group called both to leadership for the correction of these abuses .

		The attempt is interesting , but hardly convincing in the matter of establishing the close relation in ideas that he sees between the two leaders .

		The house in which he was born , the stone on the spot where he was supposed to have sat as a boy to watch the Duomo a-building , the battered portrait on the
Bargello	LOCATION	wall , these have seemed almost his only remaining memorials in the modern city .

		In a book entitled `` With Dante in Modern Flor - ence '' -LRB-
Dutton	PERSON	-RRB- , Miss
Mary E. Lacy	PERSON	has recorded and described whatever now remains to throw light on the '' Divina Commedia '' or its author .

		With its help , the reader or tourist may reconstruct in great measure the
Florence	LOCATION	in which
Dante	ORGANIZATION	lived until , under sentence of death , he became an exile for twenty years .

		The picture of those times , in politics , in art , in society , and religion , is briefly but vividly drawn ; and the twenty-eight illustrations , though mostly modern , help to connect present and past .

		A concluding chapter , '' Florence Repentant , '' relates how all too late the city that the poet so passionately loved has done and continues to do all that is in her power to wipe out the shame of centuries .

		BRIEFER MENTION .

Wilfrid Jackson	PERSON	has translated
M. Auatole France	PERSON	's ironic masterpiece `` La Rotisserie de la Reine Pe ` dauque , '' and the work is published by
John Lane Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
W. J. Locke	PERSON	contributes an introduction , which seems to afford a felicitous conjunction of wits .

		A sense of filial obligation has led Miss
Helen Nicolay	PERSON	to carry out a plan long cherished by her father of sup - plementing his great history of Lincoln and his times by a small and more intimate volume portraying the man as
Nicolay	PERSON	knew him in the close association of many years .

		He had collected a great mass of anecdotes and incidents illustrating
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's personal traits ; but the work was not done , and now the daughter has ful - filled her father 's unfinished task in the volume entitled '' Personal Traits of Abraham Lincoln '' -LRB- Century -RRB- .

		No new light is thrown on
Lincoln	ORGANIZATION	's career or character , but the work is valuable in that as far as may be it separates the man from the times and shows him as he was in his daily life and personal relations .

		Such chapters as those on '' Lincoln 's Attitude toward Money , '' '' President Lin - coln , his Wife and Children , '' `` Daily Receptions of the Plain People , '' '' Life at the
White House	ORGANIZATION	, '' and '' His Reason and his Heart '' give the reader a new and clear insight into the character of
Lincoln	LOCATION	.

Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		That Shakespeare can be retold with delight and edification ,
Charles Lamb	PERSON	proved once for all ; and though one hesitates to commend this method of making the dramatist 's acquaintance , doubt - less there are times when a short cut may serve a use - ful purpose .

		There may be readers , too , who can not relish such language , for example , as that of the angry
Douglas	PERSON	, seeking out the king among those who are fnr - nished like him , '' I 'll murder all his wardrobe , piece by piece ! ''

		but would really prefer to be told that ''
Douglas	PERSON	hastens away , vowing he will kill all the kings on the battle-field , since a number of knights are incased in royal armor . ''

		For all such ,
Miss Guerber	PERSON	's book is to be commended .

		Its method brings out , with con - siderable emphasis , the instructive value of this epic cycle of plays .

		463 A TEACHER OF THE SPIRIT .

		`` A questioner , scrupulous yet hopeful , a teacher of the spirit and doer from the heart , '' such is the characterization of
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	given us by Mr.
Edward Waldo Emerson	PERSON	in his memorial address before the
Archaeolog	PERSON	- ical
Institute of America	ORGANIZATION	at the
Toronto	LOCATION	meet - ing of
1908	DATE	.

		This address , together with a briefer one by Mr.
William Fenwick Harris	PERSON	, is now published in a tastefully made volume by the
Houghton Mifflin Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and offers a welcome foretaste of what awaits us when the official biography of that great scholar and good citizen shall at last see the light . ''

		The written word abides , yet sometimes merely on shelves , '' once said Mr.
Norton	PERSON	.

		It was rather by the spoken word , reinforced by the engaging personality of the speaker , that
Norton	PERSON	influenced his contemporaries , and made them feel that he approached as closely as was humanly possible to that ideal type of the American gentleman which most of us cherish in the secret chambers of the heart .

		To count - less men of the younger generation he seemed the ripe scholar , the wise counsellor , and the perfect friend , who embodied all the virtues best worth emulating , and his example stood forth as the fine flower of the great democratic experi - ment in which are centred the fairest hopes of mankind .

		It will be difficult for a future gen - eration to realize all that
Norton	PERSON	meant to those who were his contemporaries , and who were mentally and spiritually fitted to appreciate 428 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, the unerring taste and unfailing sanity that informed his outlook upon art and life .

		The printed page has preserved only a fraction of the utterances which constituted his influence , and even those are so scattered , in periodicals and in the books to which he contributed edi - torial matter , as to be inconvenient of access .

		No better service could be done the future than that of collecting these fugitive pages , and in - cluding them within the covers of two or three volumes .

		Of
Norton	ORGANIZATION	's sincere kindness and unselfish desire to be helpful , many instances are treas - ured by those who knew him .

		The following are given by Mr.
Emerson	PERSON	: `` He kindly came to our little farming village , as
Concord	LOCATION	was forty years ago , to tell us about
Turner	PERSON	in our Lyceum , and , unasked , not only brought ten of
Turner	ORGANIZATION	's water-color sketches and bade me hang them in our public library for a week ; but , hearing that two or three boys and girls had tried to copy them , wrote ' keep them a fortnight longer . '

		For a further instance of his great generosity , let me record that once , hearing of some one in
Portland	LOCATION	,
Maine	LOCATION	, who cared for
Turner	ORGANIZATION	, he packed up and sent several of his own pictures thither .

		The great
Portland	LOCATION	fire came and destroyed them all . ''

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	gives us these further instances : '' Professor
George Herbert Palmer	PERSON	once told me a charming story which well illustrates the desire to serve and the kindliness of which I have spoken .

		In prepar - ing the text for his edition of the poet whose name he bears ,
Palmer	PERSON	found it necessary to use the first edition of
Herbert	PERSON	's works , but a copy was not to be had , although
Quaritch	PERSON	, who is supposed to find anything , was author - ized to offer an extravagant price for it .

		Learning that
Norton	PERSON	possessed a copy ,
Palmer	PERSON	with some trepidation ventured to ask if he might use it for a day or so .

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	was leaving for his
summer	DATE	home at
Ashfield	LOCATION	, but nothing must do but
Palmer	PERSON	should take the book for the
summer	DATE	.

		When not in use the treasure was carefully locked away in a safe , and was returned the day the owner came back from
Ashfield	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Norton	PERSON	listened with great interest to
Palmer	PERSON	's account of the profit he had had from the book .

		Next morning the latter found a neat packet in his hall , with a note to this effect in Mr.
Norton	PERSON	's exquisite handwriting : ` Mr DEAR PALMER : I realized
last night	TIME	after you had gone , that this book belongs to you rather than to me .

		Will you please accept it ? '

		`` Another story , one of many , illustrates the same qualities .

		A young instructor in
Cambridge	LOCATION	was keenly anxious to possess a certain book of rarity and price .

		Norton had a copy , and knew the younger man 's desires .

		Meeting the instructor one day upon the street ,
Norton	PERSON	remarked quite casually , ' I have just seen a copy of your book at the Cooperative , and at a very reasonable price . '

		No time was lost in the purchase .

		It was only long afterwards that the happy possessor realized how strange it was that such a book should be in such a place at such a price . ''

		These anecdotes serve to show how generously he gave himself and his possessions to thos ^ who were merely acquaintances or less than that .

		How he gave himself to the elect among his friends , to
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Carlyle	PERSON	and
Clough	PERSON	and
Stephen	PERSON	andFitzGerald and
Lowell	PERSON	, may be read in the correspondence and journals of these men .

		Truly he had , like such men as
Stedman	PERSON	and
Howells	PERSON	, a genius for friendship .

		Norton 's undeviating advocacy of righteous - ness in public affairs , fearlessly undertaken when it meant opposition to popular clamor , made him a mark for the criticism of mean and malicious persons , and he suffered not a little from their attacks .

		He was called un-American because he championed the merit system in the civil service , and opposed the spirit of imperial - ism which so fatally undermined our national principles after the war with
Spain	LOCATION	.

		He could not `` keep his ear to the ground , '' which he characterized as '' surely not the attitude most favorable to catch the message from on high . ''

		He was called a pessimist because he would not admit that all was for the best in our triumph - ant democracy , and '' was impatient of optim - ism , being too sensitive to the evils of his day , public and private , and the dangers already looming even over
America	LOCATION	as results of low standards in politics , in trade , in culture , in con - duct , to be content in waiting for things to work out right in secular time . ''

		He was too passion - ate an idealist to observe these tendencies in silence .

		He lived in a time when , as he once wrote to a friend , '' the advocates of culture and the maintenance of morality in politics find their best type in Mrs.
Partington	PERSON	.

		At any rate , let us use our brooms as briskly as we can till the tide quite drowns us out . ''

		He never lost his faith in a spiritual purpose in the world , work - ing '' darkly , but O for good , for good , '' and never expressed that faith more strikingly than when , not long before his death , he told a friend that '' if his life were to be lived again , he should like to live in
Chicago	LOCATION	, because he seemed to see working there , through the vulgarity and com - mercialism necessarily found in a young and prospering American town , a power for good , which would in time come to its own . ''

		Mr.
Harris	PERSON	, speaking of what
Norton	PERSON	did for archaeology , quotes a letter from Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	re - ferring to the work of the
Archaeological Insti	ORGANIZATION	- tute . ''

		It is going to dig up some gods in
Greece	LOCATION	if it can get money enough .

		I suppose they may be required in some quarters to supply an apparent want . ''

		It was the `` apparent want '' symbolized by the gods of
Greece	LOCATION	that
Norton	PERSON	made it his life work to attempt to supply the want of reason in our thinking , and righteous -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 429 ness in our public and private conduct , and beauty in our daily lives .

		Quoting Mr.
Harris	PERSON	once more : '' That standard of true excellence to which he ever held himself , he insisted on for others , and men rallied about him all over the country .

		The simple existence of such a man with no private ends to serve , who is always ready and willing to tell his fellows the truth , and who does it clearly and unflinchingly , is a blessing to a community , demanding for its ennobling influence a gratitude that can not be overpaid , stimulating and leading men to high achievement , and maintaining those qualities of dignity , of skill , and of high ideals which were so conspicuous in his own personality . ''

		CURRENTS AND EDDIES IN THE HOLIDAY BOOK FLOOD .

		An attempt to write a treatise on the book harvest of this holiday season , a harvest amounting to thou - sands of different works , would inevitably leave the writer filled with regret that he had not confined his attention to a small part of that bewildering whole , or even to a single author or volume .

		The German specialist who in his last years lamented that he had not devoted his life to one of the Greek particles , and not to them all , would have been scandalized at the thought of undertaking a survey of the tons of books that fall from the printing presses of the world in a single season .

		Yet the making of a few notes as one watches from a safe distance the yearly liter - ary freshet may be permissible .

		As usual , the great mass of this periodic flood is composed of books written or compiled in an honest , utilitarian , and wholly uninspired endeavor to pro- duce something acceptable to the publisher and not distasteful to the reader .

		Literary skill , scholarly industry , abounding resourcefulness , and a keen instinct for the timely and for what shall be at least transiently interesting , with occasional revelations of curious learning or unusual scholarship , are all to be noted among the qualities contributing to the salability of the printed product , to which also the illustrator 's art has added its welcome share in full measure .

		This stupendous total of plodding literary labor seems to be demanded , year after year , and the patient workers are not wanting to the task .

		One is reminded of that great majority among the bees and ants which consists of toilers fitted for their monotonous duties by certain expert manipulations in the pre-natal stage whereby they are enabled to perform their laborious part undistracted by the vivid emotions and errant impulses necessary to ensure the perpetuation of the race .

		Good workmanlike execu - tion , without a gleam of inspiration , and with little or nothing of striking originality , is what we find in the great mass of printed matter issued in such impressive bulk and with so agreeable an accompani - ment of exterior ornamentation and pictorial illustra - tion , as the annual holiday season approaches .

		Of course no rule is without its conspicuous exceptions , and so in the great company of holiday books there are , first and last , not a few that deserve to live and will live after the season for which they are immedi - ately provided is over .

		Every writer of a Christmas book is privileged to hope and does hope that his work may prove to be of this enduring sort .

		Ever recurring in the Yuletide literary output are the volumes of apt selections pleasantly commemo - rating the Christmas season .

		`` Christmas with the Poets , '' ``
Santa Glaus	PERSON	in Song and Story , '' `` The Yule Log in Legend and Tradition '' under such attractive titles appear , as surely as '' Winter comes to rule the varied year , '' a sufficient number of hand - somely bound and illustrated volumes which show off .

		well on the drawing-room table and are gladly picked up and looked through by the caller waiting for my lady 's appearance .

		Almost equally sure of publication is the annual volume on happiness , either a compilation from standard authors or an independ - ent attempt to point the way to that elusive good which all the world is ever seeking and rarely holding in conscious possession .

		A considerable contribution is also annually made to the `` literary landmarks '' series , books showing diligent reading or at least much careful examination of a host of authors , in the search for topographical allusions or other matter suitable for this class of literary geography .

		`` Lon - don in Literature , '' or ``
Paris	LOCATION	in Poetry , '' or `` His - toric Haunts in
Hong Kong	LOCATION	, '' may be taken as typical forms of the title chosen for this rapidly-growing series .

		Closely allied to it is the travel-book enriched with literary references and quotations , a kind of book that could be written without going outside the four walls of one 's library , and probably is some - times so written , arm-chair travels , in short , both as to writer and reader .

		At an appreciable remove from this general class of geographic-literary works stands the never-failing book of more or less matter-of-fact travel , a kind of literature that in these days must be either descrip - tive of strange lands , if there be any such still left , or the chronicle of journey ings in familiar lands under unusual conditions .

		`` A Year with the Yookaghir Tribes , '' as a hypothetic example , would seem to promise more of novelty than `` Our Summer in
Switzerland	LOCATION	'' ; and `` Ballooning in the
Balkans	LOCATION	'' or '' Aeroplaning in the Andes '' or `` Across the
Pacific	LOCATION	in a Canoe '' should offer more excitement than '' Six Weeks in
Europe	LOCATION	'' or '' My Trip to
Bermuda	LOCATION	. ''

		The Tailed Head-Hunters of
Borneo	LOCATION	, and other Head - Hunters , presumably tailless , in the
Philippines	LOCATION	, have recently excited some curiosity among hardy explor - ers and novelty-seeking readers , and at least three substantial volumes , one English and two American , have very lately testified to this awakened interest .

		Of country-life books and nature-study books the already generous supply is this year still further increased , but with some moderation of zeal on the part of the so-called nature-fakirs .

		In the depart - ment of reprints , the sumptuously-illustrated holiday edition is every year becoming more conspicuous .

		Striking and often beautiful cover-designs , such as were unknown twenty years ago , and colored illus - 430 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, trations , often astonishing in their combination of gaudy hues , but of late showing marked artistic improvement , make their vehement appeal to the eye on every book-counter .

		In the struggle for existence , a book published in these crowded days often owes much of its suc - cess or failure to its title .

		The invention of new and striking book-titles is becoming daily more difficult , though the rapid growth of our vocabulary helps to relieve the embarrassment .

		A short and apt and attention-compelling name every book that hopes for popular success must have .

		A title in fifteen or twenty lines , such as pleased our leisurely ancestors would not now be tolerated .

		For brevity nothing could well surpass the title of a current novel which calls itself `` Who ? ''

		Another is entitled `` C Q , '' self-explanatory and briefer than '' The Wireless Man , '' which appears on the cover of another novel of the season .

		Familiar and even stale by this time is the title of which `` The Rejuvenescence of Reho - boam '' -LRB- though there is no such book -RRB- may be taken as the type .

		Not very dissimilar in form , and not unsuccessful in its appeal to curiosity , is the actual title , `` The Woman of It . ''

		Among other rather unusual book-names this year may be noted the following , '' Cease Firing , '' '' Why Women are So , '' `` Do Something !

		Be Something ! '' ''

		Around the Clock in
Europe	LOCATION	, '' '' Martha-by-the-Day , '' and , beau - tifully descriptive of a collection of poems , `` A Dome of Many-Coloured Glass . ''

		Between '' C Q '' and ''
Hevy News	ORGANIZATION	of an horryble Erthquake which was in the Citie of
Scarbaria	LOCATION	,
Morocco	LOCATION	.

		In the present yere of xlii .

		The xiii .

		day of
June	DATE	.

		And also how that a Citie in Turky is sonke , '' there stretch nearly three and three-quarters centuries of development in the art of book-making and book-naming .

		Intoler - ably long and wearisome and taxing to the memory would those sixteenth-century book-titles be to us now ; and unendurably abbreviated and whimsical and absurd would many of those of our day have seemed to our great-great-great-grandfathers .

		What book fashions , in respect to the minor details here briefly touched upon , the next three or four centuries shall develop , no man now living can even remotely conjecture .

		On the whole , the season 's literary stream leaves with the beholder sitting on the bank an impression of surprising volume and a disposition to wonder where all those tumbling waters will finally empty themselves .

		Also an image remains of the fresh - ness and sparkle of many a ripple on the flood 's surface , and at the same time a sense of calmer and stronger currents underneath , with a consciousness of the inevitable sediment that all great bodies of flowing water carry along for a while until it settles to its long rest on the ocean 's bottom .

		And so the literary , like the physiographic , circulation goes ceaselessly on , year after year , bringing health and happiness and renewed life , and insuring against stagnation , mephitis , and their attendant ills .

		PERCY
F. CAS UAL	ORGANIZATION	COMMENT .


GERHART HAUPTMANN	PERSON	'S VARIETY IN UNITY is emphasized by Professor
Edward Everett Hale	PERSON	in a study , contributed to the
Boston	LOCATION	`` Transcript , '' of the German playwright to whom has just been awarded the
1912	DATE	Nobel Prize for literature . ''

		Hauptmann is always
Hauptmann	PERSON	, '' we are as - sured , but his methods of expression have a Protean diversity . ''

		He does not , like some artists , grad - ually develop a form , a manner , a style by which we may know him .

		Zola perfects a method and a theory ; we need not say he is always alike , but certainly his work is all of a piece .


Henry James	PERSON	's later work differs from his earlier , but it is all a clear development and each step seems natural enough in view of the one before .


George Meredith	PERSON	perfects his wonderful instrument and accustoms us to it .

		It is not so with all .


Stevenson	PERSON	was always experimenting .

		One can never guess what
Anatole France	ORGANIZATION	will produce .

		The leading dramatists of our day have usually held to a few resembling forms ...
Maeterlinck	PERSON	, it is true , has written all kinds of things .

		But not even
Maeterlinck	PERSON	has written in so many forms as
Hauptmann	PERSON	.


Hauptmann	PERSON	himself adds to the sense of diversity by giving curious names to his dramatic forms , a social drama , a thieves ' comedy , a dream poem , a fairy tale play , a dramatic poem , a glass-house fairy tale , a
Berlin	LOCATION	tragi-comedy these terms are not exactly the names of literary forms , but they certainly signify very different things . ''

		The writer finds , what perhaps few would look for , points of resemblance between the subject of his essay and
Byron	PERSON	, and his study concerns itself with various other matters of interest to admirers of the German playwright .

		FOGGY IMPRESSIONS OF ENGLISH AUTHORS are possessed by even maturer students than the fifty first-year college girls who , according to a writer in `` The School World , '' were subjected to a simple test of their knowledge of the classic literature of their own tongue , and were found surprisingly de - ficient in the mere elements of the subject .

		A list of writers was given , comprising Chaucer , Shake - speare ,
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	,
Ben Jonson	PERSON	,
Milton	LOCATION	,
Dryden	PERSON	,
Pope	LOCATION	, Dr.
Johnson	PERSON	, Fielding ,
Coleridge	PERSON	,
Wordsworth	PERSON	,
Byron	PERSON	,
Keats	PERSON	,
Scott	PERSON	,
Jane Austen	PERSON	,
Dickens	LOCATION	,
Thack	PERSON	- eray ,
George Eliot	PERSON	,
Rossetti	PERSON	,
Matthew Arnold	PERSON	,
Tennyson	LOCATION	, and
Browning	PERSON	, and it was required to place each in his or her half-century and name one of each writer 's works .

		The chronology of the answers was amazing ,
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	being placed by some as late as the last half of the eighteenth cen - tury , and even in the first half of the nineteenth ,
Milton	PERSON	anywhere from the thirteenth to the nine - teenth , and
Wordsworth	PERSON	and
Tennyson	PERSON	as far back as the sixteenth , with Chaucer ranging over nearly the whole of the Christian era .

		But all the girls were safe when it came to naming a work by
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	and one by
Milton	LOCATION	, while forty were equally at home with their Chaucer ,
Scott	PERSON	, Ten -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 431
Tennyson	PERSON	,
Thackeray	PERSON	,
Dickens	PERSON	, and
George Eliot	PERSON	.

		Thirty showed the same familiarity with
Spenser	ORGANIZATION	, Pope , and
Wordsworth	PERSON	.

		But all these names were on the list of college entrance requirements .


Ben Jonson	PERSON	, Fielding , and
Rossetti	PERSON	, however , not being on the list , were correctly placed by only three girls .

		When it came to naming the authors of cer - tain designated works , varying degrees of ignorance were displayed , four-fifths of the students being able to place the `` Canterbury Tales , '' `` Faerie Queene , '' ``
King Lear	PERSON	, '' `` In Memoriam , '' and `` The Mill on the Floss , '' but only one knowing the authorship of `` Adonais , '' while other titles evoked a variety of random guesses .

		What wonder that the critics of our system of education charge us with encour - aging vagueness and superficiality in the learner ?

		RESPECT FOB LITERARY PROPERTY prevails among men and women of honor , and stays the hand from plagiarism , piracy , the stealing of ideas , and similar practices .

		There is also another kind of respect for literary property , a respect that will bear further cultivation , especially among freauenters of public libraries .

		This respect , it will at once be surmised , is the feeling that forbids the mutilation , defacement , or theft of books , periodicals , or other reading mat - ter provided by the library for public use and enjoy - ment .

		Reference was recently made in these col - umns to the indefensible practice of marking favorite passages in books not one 's own .

		Familiar to all is the juvenile prank , which seems to the small person so immensely clever and amusing , of writing on the fly-leaf , or on an early page , '' If my name you wish to see , look on page two hundred and three , '' with a similar rhyme on the designated page referring the reader to another page , and so on until the circle is complete , and the young vandal hugs himself with glee at the thought of the seeker 's fruitless search for his -LRB- the vandal 's -RRB- valuable autograph .

		No amount of legislation , no system of police will ever completely cure , or even very greatly diminish , evils of this sort .

		A stub of a pencil , or a small pen-knife , held concealed in the hand , can accomplish unlimited mischief under the very eyes of the official in charge of a reading-room or reference-room or other pub - licly accessible department of a library , and to catch the culprit red-handed is rarely possible .

		Of course the remedy lies in a quickening of the public con - science , a fostering of the sense of what is seemly , a realization of the stupidity and brutishness of all acts that disregard the rights of others .

		Travellers in
Japan	LOCATION	tell of beautiful carved fences that border the public road and yet remain permanently unmu - tilated by destroying jack-knives .

		In this country the carving on public fences is done by the ubiqui - tous small boy , or even by the college student , and takes chiefly the form of personal initials and the Greek letters designating certain secret societies that flourish in schools and colleges .

		Some day all this sort of thing will be universally recognized as * ' bad form , '' and as unallowable as a buffet below the belt in a boxing-match or at least we hope so .

		WHAT GREAT AUTHORS PRIDE THEMSELVES ON is by no means always their best writings , or even their writings at all .

		What one does easily and naturally and well has a way of seeming less admir - able to the performer than a painfully and imper - fectly executed piece of work for which he is not suited .

		That is probably one reason why so many authors and artists of assured fame have longed to win laurels in walks of life to which their feet did not naturally turn .

		In this connection it is interest - ing to note a little peculiarity of
Guy de Maupassant	ORGANIZATION	's as recorded in a reminiscent article by an intimate woman friend of his , in '' La Grande Revue . ''

		He was proud of his physical strength , says the writer , and liked to speak about it ; and she recalls his lift - ing her by her belt and holding her at arm 's length , and also his walking laughingly across the room with a heavy arm-chair in each hand .

		She even believes he prided himself more on this muscular dexterity than on his literary genius .

		This may remind the reader of Dr.
Holmes	PERSON	's unfeigned delight in the bits of wood-work or cabinet-making with which he varied the monotony of literary composition , keeping a set of tools in one of his desk drawers for such recrea - tional uses .

		The recent biography of
Mark Twain	ORGANIZATION	shows him to have prided himself on his mathemat - ical talent , though he commonly arrived at an incor - rect result in his laborious calculations .

		In one of these self-imposed exercises in later life he figured out his own pecuniary liabilities as twice what they actually were , and passed a wakeful night in conse - quence ; but his delight on discovering his error in the morning seems to have more than made up for the loss of sleep .

		At another time we find him calcul - ating the number of light-years separating us from Alpha Centauri , and the figures , reproduced in fac - simile , are certainly impressive , whatever other quali - ties they may lack .

		GENIUS AND PERSONALITY are rightly associated together .

		The theory of impersonal genius , whereby a great epic -LRB- like the `` Iliad '' or the '' Odyssey '' -RRB- can come into being spontaneously without any assign - able authorship , has by this time been pretty well ex - ploded , although Wolf for a long while made the greater part of the academic world believe that a brew of commonplace minds could somehow , if left to simmer long enough , take on the flavor of trans - cendent genius .

		Those who have never allowed themselves to be overawed or convinced by the array of Teutonic learning in support of the conglomerate authorship of Homer 's poems can now congratulate themselves as they see the learned world coming around again to their own position .

		The first chapter of Mr.
Chamberlain	PERSON	's masterly book , `` The Founda - tions of the
Nineteenth Century	ORGANIZATION	, '' contains some pas - sages that will please them .

		The late
Andrew Lang	PERSON	was one of the sturdiest believers in
Homer	LOCATION	, and also in
Shakespeare	LOCATION	.

		A posthumous work of his , announced for publication , indicates by its table of contents the attitude of the writer toward th ti - Shakespeare school . ''

		Shakespeare ,
Bacon	ORGANIZATION	, the 432 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, Great Unknown '' is the book 's title , and its chapters deal with the Baconian and anti-
William	PERSON	positions , the `` silence '' about Shakespeare , that impossible He , the schooling of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, Mr.
Churton Collins	PERSON	on
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	's learning , contemporary recognition of Will as an author , the later life of
Shakespeare	ORGANIZATION	, the preoccupations of
Bacon	LOCATION	, and other kindred topics .

		Nevertheless , there will probably always be disbeliev - ers in the Shakespearean authorship of the plays , just as there will always be disbelievers in the rotundity of the earth .

		... THE DEMOLITION OF A FAMOUS LIBRARY BUILD - ING will begin about Christmas time , when
Gore Hall	PERSON	will have ceased to shelter the library of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	and will yield place to the magnificent structure given by Mrs.
Widener	PERSON	in memory of her son ,
Harry E. Widener	PERSON	-LRB-
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	' 07 -RRB- , who at his death in the wreck of the `` Titanic '' left his fine collection of books to his alma mater .

		The removal of the books from
Gore Hall	LOCATION	has for some time been going on at the rate of about fifty thousand volumes a week ; but as the entire library numbers somewhat over a million volumes -LRB- though not all housed to - gether -RRB- the work of transfer to temporary quarters in other college buildings is no speedy process .

		It was to the generosity of
Christopher Gore	PERSON	, seventh governor of
Massachusetts	LOCATION	, that
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	owed its once greatly-admired library building which was first occupied in
1841	DATE	, fourteen years after
Gore	PERSON	's death and his bequest of two hundred thousand dollars to the college in
Cambridge	LOCATION	.

		In those intervening years the corporation had deliberately and wisely deter - mined to erect a building that should be fire-proof and '' in material and architecture an enduring mon - ument to the memory of the most munificent of all the benefactors of the
University	ORGANIZATION	; ... since the security , the capacity , and the means of convenient arrangement and display which such a building affords would be among the more powerful induce - ments to intelligent and liberal minds to contribute toward filling its alcoves and enlarging its useful - ness . ''

		In the short space of a quarter-century what had seemed so vast an emptiness was crowded with books , and ever since then , despite additions to the structure , the congestion has been growing more pro- nounced .

		It is pleasant to learn that the name and memory of
Christopher Gore	PERSON	will be perpetuated in one of the three freshmen dormitories about to arise on the bank of the
Charles River	LOCATION	, somewhat apart from the main group of university buildings .

		ANCIENT SERVIAN POETRY is of a richness and beauty suspected by few .

		One of the marked char - acteristics of this gallant people that has been so sturdily contending for its national independence is its imagination , its poetic temperament , as Professor Pupin of
Columbia University	ORGANIZATION	, honorary Servian consul at
New York	LOCATION	, is reported recently as saying .

		It is wonderful and admirable that a race deprived of education during five centuries of Moslem oppres - sion , and robbed of all knowledge of its ancient liter - ary language , should still be able to preserve in the form of folklore and verse of extraordinary beauty the details of every important event in its history .

		Goethe is said to have learned the old Servian tongue in order to gain access to this rich mine of native poetry so little worked by scholars and writers , though it appears that the
University of Vienna	ORGANIZATION	has lately caused several hundred thousand lines of this poetry to be translated into German .

		The Servian minstrel , old and blind , perhaps , or supporting himself on crutches , is a not unfamiliar sight , making his way with his one-stringed lute from place to place and singing to the peasants the brave deeds of their fore - fathers .

		It is not strange , by the way , that the peo - ple object to being called Servians , which suggests a derivation from the Latin servus , a slave .

		They wish to be known as free and independent Serbs .

		A CERVANTES MUSEUM has been established , or at least started , at
Valladolid	LOCATION	, where the house once occupied by the author of ``
Don Quixote	PERSON	, '' together with the two adjoining houses , has been bought by

		THE DIAL 433 will respond with like generosity in helping to equip the educational library with such material of the above-named sort as may be available .

		A HINT FROM QUINTILIAN , whose `` Institutiones Oratoriae '' are not now much read even by classical students , is conveyed to those desirous of perfecting their literary style and enlarging their vocabulary , by a writer in the current `` Hibbert Journal '' who makes a study of ancient and modern methods of education , with the Roman rhetorician for a text .

		After quoting
Quintilian	PERSON	's advice to read the ancient Latin authors , first because they supply a fine liter - ary vocabulary , and secondly because they are models in the arrangement of their matter so as to instruct and inform by orderly sequence and not by clever phrase-making alone , the writer continues : `` Quin - tilian 's lesson for us to-day , then , would be Receive gratefully the large heritage of language which you have received from your literary predecessors , and study it by progressive stages , and employ its vocab - ulary when occasion requires .

		If an old word ex - isted in English say in Elizabethan times hold by that word , or re-introduce it , rather than some modern catchword spawned by slang or perverted from Cockney French . ''

		Or , to put this more briefly in our own words -LRB- and
Milton	PERSON	's -RRB- , cultivate the habit of avoiding such terms and phrases as would have made Quintilian stare and gasp .

		THE TWO LATEST FRENCH ACADEMICIANS , Gen - eral Lyautey , conqueror of
Morocco	LOCATION	, and Professor
Emile Boutroux	PERSON	, philosopher and author of `` Le Moi Subliminal '' and other works , including a notable preface to the French edition of
William James	PERSON	's `` Varieties of Religious Experience , '' present a pleas - ing contrast to the mind 's eye and illustrate in their dissimilar personalities the broad catholicity of judg - ment that , in this instance at least , has placed them both among the Immortals .

		Yet it should not be inferred that
General Lyautey	ORGANIZATION	is exclusively a man of arms and of warlike deeds .

		He handles the pen , it appears , with as much dexterity as the sword .

		Two articles of his in the `` Revue des Deux Mondes '' -LRB- one entitled '' Du Role Colonial de 1 ` ArmeV ' the other , `` Du Role Social de 1 ` Officier '' -RRB- have won warm praise , and , apart from their sub - stance , are said to be well worth reading `` merely as literature . ''

		Professor
Boutroux	PERSON	's early work on `` The Contingency of Natural Laws , '' his thesis for the doctor 's degree in
1874	DATE	, was a vigorous assault on the then prevalent doctrine of determinism , and it marked him as a thinker of originality and force .

		THE VIGOROUS GROWTH OF LIBRARY CATALOGUES , u. ir rapid increase in physical dimensions , especially when they take the form of card-catalogues , as they commonly , and wisely , now do , is something rather disturbing to the mental peace of a librarian already cramped for space in the upbuilding of the institu - tion under his charge .

		Some one has facetiously forecast the time when the card-catalogues of the
Boston Public Library	ORGANIZATION	and the
Harvard Library	ORGANIZATION	will meet on the bridge over the
Charles	PERSON	-LRB- known as the
Harvard	ORGANIZATION	bridge -RRB- and special conveyances will be provided for those desiring to consult distant drawers in this five-mile catalogue of the two famous collections .

		But even the compactness of a printed catalogue does not by any means make a large li - brary 's catalogue a volume for the pocket .

		This is forcibly brought to mind by an announcement from the
State University of Iowa	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- in a neat little `` Hand - book of the Library '' -RRB- that it `` has just strengthened its bibliographical collection by the addition of the British Museum catalog of printed books , '' a work extending to some ninety large volumes and still growing .

		The contemplation of those serried ranks brings home to one the truth of that hackneyed quotation from '' Eeclesiastes , '' xn. , 12 .

		COMMUNICATIONS , `` THE PERIL OF EXTERNALISM . ''

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		I beg your permission to file my objections to your recent editorial on '' The Peril of Externalism , '' based upon a recent paper by Professor
Joseph Jastrow	PERSON	on '' The Administrative Peril in Education . ''

		What you say , and what Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	has said , is what has been said by others .

		But it seems to me to lack founda - tion in fact , or at least , it represents a widespread state of things from which there are many exceptions .

		It may be true that '' externalism , '' as you term it , fails to attract strong men to the profession of teaching and that it does not foster a vigorous intellectual life in our universities .

		It is true that there are institutions with - out strong men and with conditions hampering to free - dom of thought and expression .

		But is this due solely or chiefly to the method of administration ?

		And it is true also that there are institutions manned by robust scholars who enjoy complete freedom .

		The latter group may be smaller than the former , but it exists .

		I speak from intimate personal knowledge , for I have had the honor of holding a chair in an institution of this high character for nearly a quarter of a century .

		And yet this institution is governed by a self-perpetuating board of trustees ; it has a president who does not hesitate to exercise authority ; and its administration seems to con - form to the method you hold to be harmful .

		In theory the ultimate power over everything is absolutely in the hands of the trustees ; and sovereignty must be lodged somewhere .

		In practise every one of the separate schools has its owu faculty and is expected to control its own internal affairs .

		The department to which I belong is substantially autonomous ; that is to say that we recom - mend men for vacant chairs and for promotion , our recommendations being always accepted by the presi - dent and by the trustees who also deal with us as liberally as the finances of the university will permit .

		In theory this may be autocracy ; in practise it is democracy .

		I find in your article this quotation from Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	: `` Prosperity is statistically measured ; hence the desire for more buildings and costly ones ; for more instructors , many of them occupied in work that the college should re - quire and not provide ; and more and more students who must be attracted toward the local Athenopolis and away from the rival one ; accordingly the hills are all reduced to easy grades and new democratic -LRB- not royal -RRB- roads to learning are laid out 434 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, for those who do not like the old ones .

		Requirements are set not to what collegians should learn but to what they will ; as at the circus the strip of bunting is held ostentatiously high until the horse with its fair burden is about to jump , when it is inconspicuously accommodated to the possible performance . ''

		Again I admit that there may be institutions of this sort ; but if they exist , I should like to know their names .

		I think that the time has come for a bill of par - ticulars .

		I crave more specification and less declamation .

		At the institution which I know best the conditions are the reverse of this .

		Buildings continue to be erected , provided always by special gift and never out of the free funds of the corporation .

		Students also increase in numbers , but not as a result of any lowering of stand - ards .

		On the contrary , these standards have been steadily raised in the several professional schools , every one of which now requires two or three years of college work as a prerequisite for admission , and every one of which is making severer demands upon the students after they are admitted .

		In the college itself there has been a steady improvement in the students ; they work now , most of them , as very few of my classmates worked when I was an undergraduate .

		They are alert , intelli - gent , interested .

		They are in fact the exact opposite of those described in another passage that you quote from Professor Jastrow : '' Students have no intellectual interests , no applications , no knowledge of essentials , no ability to apply what they assimilate ; they are flabby , they dawdle , they fritter and frivol , they contemn the grind , they seek proficiency in stunts , they drift to the soft and circumvent the hard ; undertrained and overtaught , they are coddled and spoon-fed and served where they should be serving ; and they get their degrees for a quality of work which in an office would cost them their jobs . ''

		I have visited a score of American colleges east and west ; and nowhere have I met undergraduates of this type .

		If Professor
Jastrow	PERSON	actually knows a single institution harboring such creatures , he owes it to the cause of education in the
United States	LOCATION	to step forward frankly and let us know its name .

		AN AMERICAN PROFESSOR .

		CULTURE AND SOCIALISM .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		While every thoughtful reader of the editorial in your last issue must agree with Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	as to the present condition of our spiritual health , I venture to think that there are many who will take decided excep - tion to much of his reasoning .

		In the first place , a conception of culture narrowed down to an '' appreciation of the non-economic values '' leaves something to be desired .

		There have been , and are to-day , persons of not wholly contemptible intellect who maintain that ethical and aesthetic values are almost inseparably interwoven with economic and social values , that , indeed , the advance of economic forces has always been the base of cultural and religious no less than of political and social progress .

		But even disregarding this view , is it anything less than ludicrous to look for '' appreciation of the non-economic values '' in a civilization such as ours is to-day where economic values are so all-pervading and all-powerful ?

		Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	is quite obviously a thorough-going indi - vidualist , and as such it is no doubt comforting to him to think of socialism as a rigid economic theory standing rooted to-day where it stood a half-century ago , being of those who , as Miss
Scudder	ORGANIZATION	says , '' find it more con - venient and more consonant with prejudices of which they are unaware , to accept the blatantly materialistic tone of some current socialism at face value as represen - tative of the whole movement . ''

		Socialism , to him , is '' a crusade against the highlands of men 's life in the supposed interest of the bog '' ; `` it is essentially a gospel of materialism , and its root appeal is to greed '' ; it would '' build forth the social body utterly without regard to heterogeneity . ''

		Now I think it is no less than the truth to say that socialism , as the majority of its adherents understand it to-day , is the exact and polar opposite of all these things .

		It is , if it is any - thing at all , a crusade to rescue mankind from the bog , and give him his chance at the highlands ; instead of being a gospel of greed , it is an organized revolt against greed ; free play for the development of heterogeneity is one of its primary and basic purposes .

		Except in the consciousness of a few irreconcilables , the old warfare between socialism and individualism is in fact at an end .

		Few things are more clear to an open and rational mind than that not only are the two con - ceptions not antagonistic , but that each is essential and complementary to the other .

		As Oscar Wilde remarked , over twenty years ago , socialism is of value simply be - cause it leads to individualism . ''

		We socialize what we call our physical life , '' says Mr.
Havelock Ellis	PERSON	, `` in order that we may attain greater freedom for what we call our spiritual life . ''

		The class-conscious revolution - ary socialism of
Karl Marx	PERSON	is to-day as obsolete as the violent , almost insane individualism of his contemporary ,
Max Stirner	PERSON	.

		In the place of these we now have a great far-reaching system of social moralization and regenera - tion that promises to every individual a rational hope of freedom and self-realization .

		If we reject that hope , what other is there ?

		Perhaps it should be sufficient for us to know , as a writer in your last issue tells us , that '' reason is slowly but surely work - ing out its triumph over unreason in the ordering of human affairs , '' and we should rest content in the con - templation of that automatic and beautiful process .

		But there are some persons , like Mr.
Wells	PERSON	, who prefer not to wait , who prefer doing what they can to hasten mat - ters along a bit .

		And even were we all to wait , in serene and confident inaction , what would become of culture meanwhile ?

		For as surely as it is impossible to gather grapes from thorns and figs from thistles is it impossible that sound culture should
spring	DATE	from the conditions of economic restraint and social wrong in which we live .

		What
William Morris	PERSON	said of art is equally true of all cultural activity , '' it has no chance of a healthy life , or , indeed , of a life at all , till we are on the way to fill up the terrible gulf between riches and poverty . ''

		And until that gulf is filled , what ethical right have any of us , however exempt from the common lot our own lives happen to be , to devote ourselves to the concerns of abstract culture ?

		We know what choice
Ruskin	PERSON	and
Tolstoy	ORGANIZATION	and
Morris	PERSON	made when it came to a decision between cloistered culture and social warfare ; and in the aggravated conditions of our own day , their choice is far more emphatically incumbent upon us .

		Nowadays '' there is wide remission of enthusiasm for humanity , '' thinks Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	.

		He is doubtless right ; but such enthusiasm for humanity as does exist will be found in largest part among those who , whether or not they call themselves socialists , are yet fighting the good fight for all that present-day socialism represents and embodies .

		And until that fight is won , it is idle to look for anything other than a constantly accelerating decline of culture .

		THE DIAL 435
MR. BENNETT	PERSON	VISITS
AMERICA	LOCATION	.

		* Quite as extraordinary as Mr.
Arnold Ben	PERSON	- nett 's delicate and masterly manipulation of one type of fiction is his facility at any sort of lit - erary work .

		He has edited a woman 's magazine with success and relish .

		He can turn out a best - seller with dispatch , and a play with inconceiv - able celerity .

		His advice to the man in the street on the conservation of leisure moments has exactly that happy mingling of commonplace and suggestiveness that the man in the street craves .

		And so , when Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	visited
America	LOCATION
last winter	DATE	, to see and to be seen , it was inevi - table that his retrospective impressions should be promptly forthcoming , as promised ; and that they should be , in quality , competent , spicy , of a carefully measured depth and a carefully determined cogency .

		Being of a highly unemo - tional temperament , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	never over - reaches himself .

		Everything that he has written , including '' Your United States , '' is a completely unified product .

		When Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	decides to skim the surface of an experience , he does so thoroughly and with deftness , without illusions about the importance of his occupation , and with no disconcerting dips below or flights above to mar the symmetry of his achievement .

		In short , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	has a feeling for '' key '' that , in the almost appalling variety of his literary pro- duct , keeps each group peculiarly distinct and makes it very difficult to amalgamate them all in any general estimate of the man .

		Taken individually , you may scorn all his works ; but , as the psychological phenomenon that pro- duced them , Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	is truly to be won - dered at . ''

		Your United States '' is naturally under - taken in lighter mood .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's stay among us was of the briefest .

		In due course he visited
New York	LOCATION	,
Boston	LOCATION	,
Chicago	LOCATION	, Phila delphia ,
Washington	LOCATION	, and
Indianapolis	LOCATION	, which latter city he refers to unquestionably as at pres - ent our chief literary centre .

		Everywhere that he went , but particularly in
Indianapolis	LOCATION	, he had friends old friends , that is , besides the enthu - siastic crowds of would-be acquaintance that beset his path .

		Under their efficient guidance he savoured the quality of our hotels and our * YOUR UNITED STATES .

		home life , travelled , and went sight-seeing , except in
Washington	LOCATION	, where , escaping from control , he insisted upon '' doing '' the Capitol building in thirty minutes , as a slight but suit - able retaliation upon Americans for their cur - sory treatment of the sacred sights of
Europe	LOCATION	.

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	was so exhausted by this magnifi - cent feat that he refused to look at anything more in
Washington	LOCATION	save such of the streets and avenues of the city as he could view peace - fully from the '' sea-going hack '' that had taken him to the Capitol .

		Now it is rather difficult to believe that the sophisticated and brilliant Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, sea - soned resident of
London	LOCATION	and
Paris	LOCATION	, and familiar of other European capitals , found the diversion that he professes in his '' Cook 's view '' of Wash - ington , just as it is difficult to believe that he was as completely overwhelmed as he would appear by the glories of the `` Lusitania , '' or as bewildered by the crookedness of
Boston	LOCATION	; that he stood awe-struck before
Lowell	PERSON	's study windows , was thrilled with romantic wonder in a
Chicago	LOCATION	mail-order house , or was `` positively intoxicated '' by the glorious spectacle of Fifth Avenue at its finest .

		In other words , we are inclined to write down the best parts of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's American impressions as very clever , very entertaining , and entirely fictitious .

		It is only one more case of the
Bennett	PERSON	astuteness . ''

		Who , '' thought he , '' would see this
America	LOCATION	most interestingly ?

		Why , surely the provincial Englishman with an imagination that same fellow whose romantic impressions of
London	LOCATION	-LRB- under my signature -RRB- have lately delighted the readers of a certain British weekly . ''

		It is one of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's cleverest tricks , this ability to assume naivete convincingly , to sketch bril - liant pastels , emanating romance and mystery , of city streets , grand hotels , gay restaurants , straggling suburbs ; to make life seem as color - ful and wonderful and mystically idealistic as it is to the perennial heart of youth .

		After all , what Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	frankly and soberly thought about
America	LOCATION	has probably often been thought and said before .

		Indeed there are pages and chapters in his book to prove this bits that he might well have given to the greedy interviewers who swooped down upon him even before he had landed on our shores .

		It is surely a matter for gratification that Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's book is not merely an extended interview .

		The essential quality of the impressions may be caught , as well as anywhere , from the account of Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's first sight of
New York	LOCATION	be - ginning after he had entered a '' rickety and con - 436 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, fined taxi , '' and mistaken a policeman , '' flashing forth authority , gaiety , and utter smartness , '' for an archduke .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	continues : '' The rest of the ride was an enfevered phantas - magoria .

		We burst startingly into a very remarkable deep glade on the floor of it long and violent surface - cars , a few open shops and bars with commissionaires at the doors , vehicles dipping and rising out of holes in the ground , vistas of forests of iron pillars , on the top of which ran deafening , glittering trains , as on a tight - rope ; above all that , a layer of darkness ; and above the layer of darkness enormous moving images of things in electricity a mastodon kitten playing with a ball of thread , an umbrella in a shower of rain , siphons of soda - water being emptied and filled , gigantic horses galloping at full speed , and an incredible heraldry of chewing - gum ... Sky-signs !

		In
Europe	LOCATION	I had always in - veighed manfully against sky-signs .

		But now I bowed the head , vanquished ... ` You must not expect me to talk , ' I said . ''

		Of course much criticism and opinion is neces - sarily included , incidentally to the narration of such experiences as this .

		Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	does not , for instance , admire our sky-scrapers except as symbols ; he dislikes our restaurants , abhors our Pullman cars , and sharply arraigns the vaunted luxury of our Limited trains ; he discounts our sporting spirit , though he approves the technique of our national game ; he lauds our standard of domestic comfort in home and hotel ; he finds hopeful signs in our theatres , a lack of the finest public spirit in our citizens ; and , finally , he dis - covers `` the essential
America	LOCATION	'' in `` the long , calm streets '' of
Indianapolis	LOCATION	, maple-shaded and set with the homes of the solid middle class .

		Perhaps it was because Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	unex - pectedly discovered the essential
America	LOCATION	in
Indianapolis	LOCATION	that he cut short his intended and well-advertised progress to our Western coast ; or perhaps the terrifically swaying sleeping cars deterred him from penetrating beyond
Chicago	LOCATION	.

		Whatever the reason , the event was fortunate .

		The real Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	might have been enter - tained and even edified by the sight of other phases of the essential
America	LOCATION	, phases less calm and ordered than the streets of Indianap - olis , which house , we are told , Victorian ladies and old silver tea-things , besides important lit - erary pretensions .

		But there was ample material east of the
Mississippi	LOCATION	to provide Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	, the author , with romantic adventure , unhappy disillusionment , not too poignant to hold possi - bilities of humor , and a vivid impression of native traits , culminating on the maple-shaded streets of
Indianapolis	LOCATION	.

		More of our
United States	ORGANIZATION	would have been superfluous .

		Mr.
Frank Craig	PERSON	's pictures are as '' smart '' as Mr.
Bennett	PERSON	's text , from which they seem to have caught the prevailing note of genial , inconse - quent picturesqueness .

		They give the book somewhat the appearance of a clever society novel an appearance not wholly misleading .

		CHAUCBR ix PROSE .

		* Why should we modernize Chaucer to-day ?

		Was not Landor right in holding such a project to be futile ?

		`` I would rather see Chaucer quite alone , '' he wrote , '' in the dew of his sunny morning , than with twenty clever gentlefolks about him , arranging .

		his shoestrings and but - toning his doublet .

		I like even his language .

		I will have no hand in breaking his dun but richly-painted glass to put in -LRB- if clearer -RRB- much thinner panes . ''

		In Lander 's time , moreover , when early English was more like a foreign tongue than it is to-day , there was greater need of a rendering into the modern idiom than at present , when
the Globe Edition	ORGANIZATION	provides a text not difficult to read after a slight acquaintance with the language of the fourteenth century .

		The public , however , has taken a different view of the question .

		For two centuries it has eagerly bought and presumably read good , bad , and indifferent imitations and translations of various parts of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's works .

		The long list of modernizers is virtually headed by
Dryden	PERSON	, who in his `` Fables '' -LRB- 1700 -RRB- included para - phrases of `` The Knight 's Tale , '' `` The Nun 's Priest 's Tale , '' `` The Wife of Bath 's Tale , '' and the character of the
Parson	ORGANIZATION	.


Dryden	PERSON	's work found great favor throughout the cen - tury ; as late as 1787
Walpole	LOCATION	remarked that he loved Chaucer better in
Dryden	PERSON	and Bask - erville f than in his -LSB-

		Closely following

George Ogle	PERSON	, who in

William Lipscomb	PERSON	.

Charles Cowden Clarke	PERSON	's `` Riches of Chaucer '' -LRB- 1835 -RRB- remained popular throughout the cen - tury , being three times reprinted .

		A century after
Ogle	PERSON	came
Richard Hengist Home	PERSON	with his '' Poems of Chaucer Modernized , '' to which contributions were made by

J. P. Briscoe	PERSON	as late as

Saunders	PERSON	's edition of `` The Canterbury Tales '' -LRB-

		In
1870	DATE	two renderings of `` The Canterbury Tales '' were published :
Frederick Clarke	PERSON	's did not go beyond the first volume , but that of
Purves	PERSON	, including several others of Chaucer 's poems , was twice reprinted .

		The late Professor Skeat in his last years translated at least ten of '' The Canterbury Tales , '' `` The Le - gend of Good Women , '' '' The Romaunt of the Rose , '' and the minor poems .

		Mr.
MacKaye	PERSON	himself published in
1904	DATE	the version of the Prologue and ten tales which is here , we believe , reproduced ; and that this volume had a good sale may be inferred from the fact that he now joins with Prof essor
Tatlock	PERSON	in bringing out the first modern English rendering of Chaucer 's complete works .

		Many other modernizers are mentioned by
Miss Hammond	PERSON	in her bibli - ography ; and it is evident that there was a demand for the work of these mediators or middle-men since the poorest of it seems to have been welcomed by the public .

		* If we are to have a modernization of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	, let it be in prose .

		We doubt if the genius exists or ever will arise who could even remotely sug - gest , continuously and for any length of time , in a contemporary verse rendering , the tone and flavor of
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's poetry .

		It is hard enough * For an elaborate criticism of several of these modern - izers one should consult Professor
Lounsbury	PERSON	's entertaining `` Studies in Chaucer , '' iii .

		154-240 .

		to put any early poet into modern verse , since the shifting of the accent toward the beginning of words has ruined the language from the point of view of facility in rhyme .

		In spite of this handicap some have , to be sure , rendered parts of Chaucer in readable verse ; but their attempts have not come much nearer to being Chaucer than Pope 's `` Iliad '' came to being Homer .

		A quotation or two may illustrate our point .

		Here is Troilus 's prayer to Cupid when he finds that
Criseyde	PERSON	has departed -LRB- v. 582 ff . -RRB-

		: `` Than thoughts he thus : ' O blisful Lord Cupide , Whan I the proces have in my memorie , How thou me hast werrey 'd on every side , Men might a book make of it , lik a storie !

		What nede is thee to seke on me victorie , Sin I am thyn , and hoolly at thy wille ?

		What joye hast thou thine owne folk to spille ? '' '

		Wei hastow , Lord , ywroke on me thyn ire , Thou mighty God , and dredful for to greve !

		Now mercy , Lord !

		Thou wost wel I desire Thy grace most of alle lustes leve , And live and deye I wol in thy bileve : For which I naxe in guerdon but oo bone , That thou Criseyde ayein me sende sone . '' '

		Distreyne her herte as faste to retorne As thou dost myn to longen her to see : Than wot I wel that she nil not sojorne .

		Now , blisful Lord , so cruel thou ne be Unto the blood of Troye , I preye thee , As Juno was unto the blood Thebane , For which the folk of Thebes caughte hir bane ! ' ''

		WORDSWORTH . '' '

		TATLOCK-MACKAYE . ''

		Then he thought , ' O blessed lord Cupid , when I remember the history , how thou hast warred against me on every side , men might make a book of it like a tale .

		What need hast thou to seek a conquest on me , 438 -LSB-

		What joy is it to thee to destroy thine own folk ?

		Lord , well hast thou wreaked thine ire on me , mighty god , deadly to offend !

		Show mercy now , O lord !

		Thou knowest well I crave thy grace above all dear pleasures , and will live and die in thy faith ; in guerdon of which I ask but one boon , that thou send me back Criseyde speedily .

		Let her heart long to return as eagerly as mine to see her ; then I wot well she will not tarry .

		Blessed lord , I pray thee be not so cruel to the blood of Troy as Juno was to Theban blood , for which the folk of
Thebes	LOCATION	had their destruction ! ' '

		Wordsworth has here shown great skill in pre - serving the original form ; yet .

		he has mistrans - lated werreyed and has given a misleading turn to the Jast line .

		For a second illustration we choose the ac - count of the stranger knight 's entrance in '' The
Squire	PERSON	's Tale '' : '' This strange knyght that cam thus sodeynly , Al armed , save his heed , ful richely , Saleweth kyng and queene , and lorde 's alle , By ordre , as they seten in the halle , With so heigh reverence and obeisaunce , As wel in speche as in contenaunce ,
That Gawayn	PERSON	, with his olde curteisye , Though he were comen ageyn out of fairye , Ne koude hym not amende with a word ; And after this , biforn the heighe bord , He with a manly voys seith his message After the forme used in his langage ,
Withouten	PERSON	vice of silable , or of lettre ; And for his tale sholde seme the bettre , Accordant to his wordes was his cheere , As techeth art of speche hem that it leere .

		Al be it that I kan nat sowne his stile , Ne kan not clymben over so heigh a style , Yet seye I this , as to commune entente , Thus much amounteth al that ever he mente , If it so be that I have it in mynde ... '' LEIGH HUNT . ''

		The stranger , who appear 'd a noble page , High-bred , and of some twenty years of age , Dismounted from his horse ; and kneeling down , Bow 'd low before the face that wore the crown ; Then rose , and reverenc 'd lady , lords and all , In order as they sat within the hall , With such observance , both in speech and air , That certainly , had
Kubla	ORGANIZATION	's self been there , Or sage Confucius , with his courtesy , Return 'd to earth to show what men should be , He could not have improv 'd a single thing : Then turning lastly to address the king , Once more , but lightlier than at first , he bow 'd , And in a manly voice thus spoke aloud ... '' TATLOCK-MACKAYE .

		`` This strange knight , who came so suddenly , all armed full richly save his head , saluted king and queen , and all the lords by order as they sat in the hall , with such deep reverence and obeisance as well in speech as in bearing , that though
Gawain	PERSON	with his antique cour - tesy were come again out of fairyland , he could not have corrected this knight in a word .

		And then before the high table he spake his message in a manly voice , after the form used in his language , without fault in syllable or letter ; and , that so his story should seem the more acceptable , his cheer accorded with his words , as the art of speech teaches them that learn it .

		Albeit I can not follow his style , nor climb over so high a stile , yet to the general understanding I say this , which was the purport of all that ever he said , if so be I have it in memory .

		... '' It will be observed that Hunt cut down the num - ber of lines by one-third without any correspond - ing gain in force or elegance .

		His substitution of
Kubla Khan	PERSON	and Confucius is inexplicable , and would seem to be an unwarrantable liberty ; even if we assume that these men were patterns of courtesy -LRB- and we know of no such tradition -RRB- , the fact remains that
Chaucer	PERSON	does not mention them and does mention the familiar
Gawain	PERSON	.

		Moreover , Hunt has introduced ideas not in the original : the age of the Knight , his dismounting from his horse , his bowing after he kneels , his second bow to the
King	LOCATION	.

		Certainly it is of less importance to adhere to the original form than it is to render accurately the thought .

		Hence the superiority of prose , in which the translator can devote himself unreservedly to the thought .

		This has evidently been the view of the present translators .

		They hold that so many words and idioms have undergone subtle changes in mean - ing since
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's time that the general reader needs more than a bare text and glossary .

		They believe that it is all-important to get at
Chaucer	ORGANIZATION	's thought .

		In accordance with this belief they have tried to be as faithful to the original as possible while avoiding four things : rhyme and excessive rhythm -LRB- which we take to mean the rhythm of verse -RRB- , obscurity , extreme verbosity , and excessive coarseness .

		The general verdict of the critic must be that they have succeeded admirably .

		While the present translation is worthy of high praise , some of the notes are disappoint - ingly meagre .

		It means little to say that the '' Physiologus '' was an early book `` on the na - tures of animals . '' '

		An essential trait was that they connected the characteristics and habits of animals with the beliefs and observances of Christianity .

		Under `` Venus ' hour ' 1 it would have been easy to add the particular hour -LRB- the second before sunrise on
Monday	DATE	-RRB- presided over by the goddess .

		The astrological terms should also have been explained more fully .

		Under '' Roncesvalles , ''
Tyrwhit	ORGANIZATION	's plausible conjecture might well have been added .

		For the class of readers who require illustra - tions , Mr.
Warwick Goble	PERSON	has embellished the volume with over thirty full-page illustrations in

		color .

		In themselves , considered without refer - ence to the text , they are excellent and include much that is beautiful ; they do not , however , represent anything like our idea of Chaucerian scenes , and we doubt if very many readers will be found to whom their appeal is strong .

		For some , these pictures will be a hindrance rather than a help to the imagination .

		The picture of
Emily	LOCATION	, for example , has a beautiful setting ; but the features of the girl as here drawn are hardly such as to cause all the trouble set forth in '' The Knight 's Tale . ''

		The reproduction of
Blake	ORGANIZATION	's picture in outline on the end-leaves is effective .

		The make-up of the volume leaves nothing to be desired .

		The paper is excellent , the page of good proportions , and the type clear .

		The binding , which is in keeping with other features of this handsome volume , helps to make it one of the most desirable gift-books of the season .


CLARK S. NORTHUP	PERSON	.

		AN ALBUM FROM GREEK AND ROMAN PAYS .

		* Apart from mankind 's innate interest in any face as an expression of human nature , we may say that portraits from ancient
Greece	LOCATION	and
Rome	LOCATION	appeal primarily to the student of history and the lover of plastic art .

		For the former , they frequently preserve the actual lineaments of a man or woman depicted with almost photo - graphic accuracy , or transmit a character study carved in the spirit of a modern portrait painter .

		For the latter , they often provide beautiful ob - jects of aesthetic charm , and more often repre - sent instructive links in the development of style and treatment .

		The famous portraits of
Pericles	LOCATION	, for instance , reveal to us something of the statesman , the general , and the cultured humanist ; but they also offer a goodly pleasure to the eye , and at the same time tell us that the sculptor loved the beautiful as deeply as the characteristic , and show us how far he was master of his chisel and marble .

		As to the essential merit of a portrait , we are all ostentatiously agreed that it is '' truth to life . ''

		But beneath these shortest and simplest of words are rooted quarrels that seem to be as old as the pyramids .

		The observing visitor at the perfectly arranged
Egyptian Museum	ORGANIZATION	in
Cairo	LOCATION	will find realism and conventionalism facing each other at least as early as the Old Kingdom , say three thousand years before
Christ	LOCATION	; and that , too , in representations of the * GREEK AND ROMAN PORTRAITS .

Anton Hekler	PERSON	.

		same man in the same tomb .

		Of course , the purpose of the statue has to be considered in these cases ; but the elements of the debate are there , and we have no doubt that the contro - versy dates back to the first moment in the his - tory of man that saw two sculptors capable of choosing and of executing their choice .

		In Greek portraiture , our best authorities have felt that the tendency toward an idealiz - ing representation was the stronger .

		In addi - tion to the monuments , they adduce to the much-quoted authority of Aristotle , who says that good portrait painters , while reproducing '' the distinctive form of the original , make a picture which is like the subject and yet more beautiful . ''

		But we may point out that it is easy to carry this belief too far , and that not a few artists must have followed the practice of giving feature for feature and line for line with relentless realism .

		Demetrius , the much - discussed exponent of this style at the close of the
fifth century	DATE	, did not shrink from represent - ing a distinguished Corinthian general in most uncompromising detail , '' with a protuberant paunch , a ragged wind-tossed beard , and a bald head '' ; and he can hardly have stood alone even in that age .

		In later
Greece	LOCATION	, certainly , there was no lack of realism .

		Pliny tells us , for instance , that Lysistratus `` looked upon likeness in every detail as the chief aim of por - traiture , and that he went so far as to use plas - ter casts to transfer actual forms to his work . ''

		And the question is even more keenly debated to-day .

		Realism , conventionalism , idealism , im - pressionism , and illusionism , not to mention futurism or a dozen other extravagances , have become so rampant that there is some truth in
Oscar Wilde	ORGANIZATION	's paradox that a portrait tells us absolutely nothing about the sitter and a great deal about the maker .

		Naturally , we should be grateful if
Rossetti	PERSON	's prayer could be realized and a woman 's portrait might show us '' beyond the light that the sweet glances throw , and re - fluent wave of the sweet smile , the very sky and sea-line of her soul . ''

		But to very few painters or sculptors has such skill been vouchsafed , nor can many spectators catch even the vision that the work of the cunning craftsman legitimately embodies .

		So most of us declare with a sigh or a smile that we have two ordinary eyes and something within us that feels pleasure or dis - pleasure , satisfaction or dissatisfaction ; and the average amateur , if he reaches any decision as to what makes the difference in a portrait , gen - erally does not become more definite than Sir
Joshua Reynolds	PERSON	, who concludes that the like - 440 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, ness , as well as the grace , of a portrait '' con - sists more in preserving the general effect of the countenance than in the most minute finishing of the features , or of any particular parts . ''

		At this point we may briefly describe the offering presented by Dr.
Anton Hekler	PERSON	to readers or workers who are interested in such topics as those suggested above .

		His volume is a generous quarto , containing three hundred and eleven plates of illustrative Greek and Roman portraits from the
fifth century B.C. to the fourth century	DATE
A. D	ORGANIZATION	.

		In connection with these the author gives us forty pages of com - ment .

		He has also prepared a serviceable bibliography , and an excellent table of illus - trations , which gives the home of each portrait and often refers to some treatise in which the statue is discussed .

		If we add that his ex - amples are well chosen , we shall probably con - vey our belief that the album offers convenient as well as extensive material for an approach to the study of Greek and Roman portraits .

		From such a wealth of material we must make an arbitrary choice , and if we first point out that Dr.
Hekler	PERSON	deals with his general theme historically , we may content ourselves with instancing his treatment of
Socrates	LOCATION	.

		As it happens , this offers an enlightening glimpse at our author 's method , while the subject is one of perennial interest .

		Who will ever forget the description of this homeliest of high thinkers given by
Alcibiades	LOCATION	, gloriously drunk , in the Symposium of Plato ?

		`` I say he is exactly like the figures of Silenus , which may be seen sit - ting in the statuaries ' shops , having pipes and flutes in their mouths ; and they are made to open in the middle , and there are images of gods inside them . ''

		Here then was a dainty task for the worker in marble : to show the satyr mask and the god within .

		Such at least was the task , if , as Socrates himself had demanded , the sculptor was to express the activity of the soul in his forms .

		As a basis for his comment Dr.
Hekler	PERSON	gives us the
Naples	LOCATION	bust , the small bronze at
Munich	LOCATION	, the head in the
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	at
Rome	LOCATION	, and two views of the term in the
Villa Albani	LOCATION	.

		After pointing out how natural it was that the interesting artistic and physiognomical problem of the head of Socrates should have occupied Greek sculpture for sev - eral centuries , he proceeds : `` No less than three types have come down to us , which also represent three different stages of art-development .

		The first type , best represented by the
Naples	LOCATION	bust -LRB- PL 19 -RRB- and the small bronze at
Munich	LOCATION	-LRB- 111 .

		2 -RRB- is a sober , naturalistic portrait of the fifth century which renders admirably the most striking elements of the outward man and is content to forego the deeper , more intense vitality of the spirit .

		The face here has a certain coarse , boorish cast .

		The treatment of the beard recalls that of the head of Homer in the
Vatican	ORGANIZATION	.

		In the course of the fourth century the prosaic naturalism of this head was transmuted by the hand of a great artist into lofty significance .

		In this second portrait-type -LRB- PI .

		20 -RRB- the ugly forms acquire an unsuspected wealth of expressive power ; the spectator feels himself to be in the presence of a highly gifted , gentle , and benevolent being , whose intelligent eyes and large mouth with its parted lips sug - gest an agreeable loquacity .

		We would fain ascribe this masterly creation to the genius of Lysippos ; literature credits him with the execution of a statue of Sokrates ; and our example is stylistically akin to his works .

		The treatment of the beard and hair is a strong point in support of the hypothesis .

		Later , the Silenus-head of Sokrates underwent a final free transformation bearing all the accents of the Hellenistic period .

		It is repre - sented by a head in the
Villa Albani	PERSON	-LRB- PL 21 -RRB- .

		Here the artist , careless of likeness , was concerned above all to ren - der his conception of the daemonic energy and enthusi - astic fervour of the martyred philosopher , with all the realistic resources of a fully matured art .

		This tendency removes the
Albani	PERSON	head from the domain of reality into that of ideal portraiture . ''

		Herewith we are plunged into the centre of a central problem .

		Granted a trained observer , skilled in physiognomy and versed in the condi - tions of plastic representation , how much can he confidently and reliably tell us about the inten - tions of the sculptor and the characteristics of the subject revealed by the statue .

		Now any man who has worked under a master like
Peter	PERSON	- sen will admit that the possibilities are large ; but there have been many startling contradic - tions and still more startling reversals of opinion among the experts , and , when all concessions are made , the margin of error is so appallingly wide that the most modest of reviewers may be par - doned for differing rather frequently from the conclusions of an author .

		Dr.
Hekler	PERSON	has been laudably conservative in assigning names to doubtful portraits ; but in dealing with the char - acteristics conveyed by a portrait , and with the intentions of the sculptor , he often exhibits a comprehensiveness and finality that can hardly be justified in the present status of our knowl - edge .

		However , he was barred from any ade - quate balancing of probabilities for his readers by his goodly array of reproductions , if his work was to be compassed in one volume ; and he would probably be the first to admit the possi - bility of legitimate differences of opinion .

		In passing to the Roman section of our trea - tise we find ourselves debating an old question .

		More than a quarter of a century ago , in a bril - liant and most readable contribution , ''
Vernon Lee	PERSON	'' declared that Roman portraiture had in - troduced something new and wonderful into sculpture .

		In this contention she has been en -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL thusiastically supported by Mrs. Strong ; but despite the hopeful studies of such workers as the latter and Professor
Wickhoff	PERSON	, who repre - sent the extreme in the advocacy of Roman inno - vation , there is still more than a little cloud of doubt about the '' new and wonderful '' element as manifested in portraiture .

		Detailed modifi - cations of treatment there assuredly were ; but further than that it is difficult to go without a faltering hesitancy .

		Dr.
Hekler	PERSON	, too , feels that there is an essential difference between the two groups represented by Hellenistic and Roman portrait sculpture , and gropes for the specifi - cally Roman element in this later art .

		However , he insists that `` there is no breach of continuity , but a perfectly organic development '' ; and , if we understand him aright , he explains the differ - ence rather by the Roman national physiognomy and character than by essential modification of the means employed in achieving artistic effects .

		At any rate , Roman portraits are just as inter - esting as Miss Paget declared them to be in '' Euphorion '' : `` Of this Roman portrait art , of certain heads of half - idiotic little Caesar brats , of sly and wrinkled old men , things which ought to be so ugly and yet are so beautiful , we say , at least , perhaps uuformulated , we think , ' How Renaissance . ' '

		And it is desperately hard to refrain from considering some of the portraits in this section of Dr.
Hekler	PERSON	's volume .

		The history of the Roman Empire seems to stand before one in a sort of personification .

		Thirteen portraits of
Augustus	LOCATION	, from boyhood to old age , suggest the days of transition from Republic to
Principate	LOCATION	.

		The Claudian degenerates recall the wild trag - edy of the Caesars , even if we can not quite agree that '' they reveal more of the dark atmosphere of those days of cruelty and terror than the most circumstantial accounts of historians . ''

		And so we might trace the story through the days of national decline to the ruler who cham - pioned the religion of the despised
Nazarene	LOCATION	.

		But fully as interesting to the student of human nature , and more interesting to the lover of art , are the private persons , named or nameless .

		From the Pompeiian banker , with his keen American face , to the two boys , who are so alike and yet so unlike , the reader , or , as one might better say , the spectator , may observe a range of masculine faces that constantly challenge his human interest or critical acumen .

		Nor will he find less attraction in the representatives of the other sex , from
Julia	LOCATION	, with her architectonic coif - fure , to the lady with softly waving hair who suggests a well-known English writer .

		And he who loves a contrast is invited to turn from the austerity of
Livia	LOCATION	as an elderly woman to the girlish grace of the so-called
Minatia Polla	LOCATION	, be - loved of every visitor to the Museo delle Terme .

		But the lure of this collection and of memories from the days when we first lingered in Roman galleries is tempting our pen far beyond all permissible bounds , so we must simply add , what is already obvious , that to us the volume seems both valuable and enjoyable .

		It is difficult to turn from such thoughts to unfavorable criticism of details ; but a few points require notice .

		For instance , might we not have had just a word on Egyptian portrait sculpture ?

		Some examples are truly remarkable , and despite the independence of Greek artistic development , it is inconceivable that it was not touched by some tiny breath of influence from the valley of the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		Again , is it absolutely sure that artistic activity always begins with abstractions , and that the first essays in the portrayal of human beings are consequently rather abstractions than imita - tions ?

		On the contrary , is there not considerable evidence , as well as the evolutionary probability , that individual men and particular animals were among the earliest subjects of nascent depic - tion ?

		In lamenting our loss from the perish - ing of painted figures and faces , Dr.
Hekler	PERSON	mentions as our only relics of importance the mummy portraits of
Egypt	LOCATION	; but the stelae dis - covered a few years ago at Pegasae are certainly not without value .

		And , finally , when the work was being made ready for English-speaking read - ers , why were the most common Greek names not given in their ordinary form ?

		One really feels ill at ease in the presence of Aristotcles and Epikuros when one has known them so long and so familiarly as
Aristotle	ORGANIZATION	and Epicurus .

		However , these minor points and a few more like them , even if they worry a reviewer , are negli - gible in comparison with the general services of the volume .

		The type is clear , the reproductions satisfac - tory , the binding very simple , and the price as low as the nature of such a publication would reasonably admit .

		442 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, A DISCIPLE OF PATER .

		* It is ten years since
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	died , and according to the happy phrase chosen as the title of his volume of critical studies , he now returns to cross again his own threshold and to receive for a little the greetings of his friends .

		The clamor of those years has drowned voices far louder than his , but his friends have not forgotten him .

		As a poet , he is in the strictest sense a minor poet , a seeker of effects exquisitely refined ; and in his prose , too , it is upon the delicacies of emotion and thought that he loves to dwell , and upon the felicities of phrase that will alone express them .

		These are , of course , qualities that do not compel a hearing from the crowd ; and even for those whom Pater calls '' disinterested lovers of books , '' they seem nowadays to have lost their appeal .

		One won - ders sometimes if it is not the neglect of the Greek and Latin classics , the loss from our training of that attention to detail which an appreciation of the classical literatures perpetu - ally demands , that is responsible for the prev - alent taste , even among persons who read , for the broad , the slapdash , and the bizarre .

		Well , such persons will not care for
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	, ' nor for his master ,
Walter Pater	PERSON	, for the style of both calls for a somewhat more discriminat - ing literary palate than it is the fashion nowa - days to cultivate .

		Nevertheless , there will no doubt always be some persons , not very numer - ous nor much given to voicing their opinions in the market place , who take a quiet satisfaction m such writing as this , and who feel a kind of friendship for the author of it . ''

		In an age of extraordinary vehemence , '' writes
Johnson	PERSON	of
Erasmus	PERSON	, `` his delicacy , his subtlety were bound to be ineffective . ''

		The writer of these words would probably not be surprised to find himself little read ; yet inasmuch as the Erasmian method and the Erasmian temper , in spite of their manifest defects , have had in every age their warm admirers , so he may count for many years to come upon a small and perhaps an in - creasing circle of appreciative friends .

		Appreciative and admiring , but not uncriti - cal .

		They will find in this volume , for instance , more than a touch of sheer preciosity , a naive parade of learning and allusiveness , and , once at least , a defect of taste , curiously unexpected m these careful pages .

		`` The later sweeter es - sayist ,

Charles	PERSON	; no one could call the cold , corrupt Lord Chancellor ' Saint
Francis	PERSON	. ' ''

		No one , in - deed , we agree with a shudder ; but why go so obviously out of one 's way to produce so poor a pleasantry ?

		These are plainly faults of imma - turity not , to be sure , of immaturity of years for he was thirty-five when he died , but of that sort of immaturity which is the differentia of the minor gift , whether in poetry or prose .

		We have called Pater his master , but in his evident consciousness of his verbal successes he does not remind us of the elder and the greater man .

		For
Pater	PERSON	illustrates his own dictum that '' beauty is only fineness of truth . ''

		One feels that he is absorbed in the adequate expression of his diffi - cult and involved thought , while his pupil not seldom appears to be turning his fine phrases for their own sake .

		This is only to say that his writing is not of the first , or even of the second order ; but at its best , its charm is that of the dawn of an exceedingly sensitive and subtle talent for criticism and of a rare gift of expression .

		He has another mark of the minor prosaist , a chameleon-like quality that causes his style to vary , within certain limits , its cadence and color with the work upon which he is engaged .

		If he is writing of Pater , he writes like Pater ; if on a subject that would have appealed to
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, like Lamb .

		Or , perhaps it would be more correct to say that when he writes of men whose nature is akin to his , he abandons himself to his genius and instinctively praises them in their own vein .

		To Arnold and
Newman	PERSON	he is not akin , and though he writes of them , he does not write in the least like them ; but the paper on
Stevenson	PERSON	is not ^ unlike
Stevenson	PERSON	, `` The Work of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	'' is such a piece of criticism as Pater him - self in his youth might have signed , and while there is no essay on
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	, there is an essay on a subject that
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	might have chosen , treated m the manner in which
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	would have treated it .

		In the paper on
Octavius Pulleyn	PERSON	, an obscure seventeenth century poet , a poet , indeed , of but one extant poem , we hear what seems the very voice of Elia : `` Nominis umbra , he is a ghost , of whom I know nothing ; whilst his little bird , the least of birds , lives merry and musical yet .

		Octavius and his like , phantom gentlemen m the haunted thicket ' of old years , have a singular fine charm .

		Until some plaguey investigator of libraries , of Rolls and
Record Offices	ORGANIZATION	, unearth my twilight friend , he is mine to dream over , mine to play with .

		I can enter him a student at the
Inns of Court	ORGANIZATION	- make him a tavern wit or playhouse censor ; I can turn him into a country squire , and give him a comely manor in the taste of
Inigo	LOCATION	.

		We stroll there together through the < Itahanate garden , ' with its statua and busto , and
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 443 pass out into a green coppice .

		It shall be the old
May morning	DATE	of merry
England	LOCATION	, May of clear sunlight and soft wind ;
Octavius	PERSON	shall quote me his
Horace	PERSON	, and I cap him with my dearer
Virgil	PERSON	.

		An air of the scholar 's affectation sits prettily upon us , an Oxford touch .

		We would fain esteem ourselves Younger Plinies of the time , and a neat copy of verses is our pride .

		Octavius has a decent fair knack at imitation of the great Mr.
Cowley	PERSON	, and ever a gratulatory ode at a friend 's service .

		So go we gently through the
May morning	DATE	of a dream ; of winter nights , we ' drink tobacco ' by the fire of logs in a parlour of black panel , and pore together upon the medals of popes and emperors .

		Of such sort is my Octavius ; and if I weary of him in such sort , he shall proceed ambassador to the
Hague	LOCATION	, and send me word of tulips . ''

		In the short paper , too , entitled `` An Old Debate , '' the debate , to wit , over the compara - tive charms of town and country , he is , like Lamb , all on the side of the town , and praises
London	LOCATION	with a warmth caught from '' A Londoner '' : '' After all , other people are very companionable .

		Caesar held in mistrust the lean , who think too much ; others have misliked the haters of children , of music , and of bread ; for ourselves , we will be friends with no man who goes down the Strand with an Odi profanum on his lips . ''

		His fondness for
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	is one of many tastes that he shares with
Pater	PERSON	, for nowhere has Pater written with a more penetrating sympathy and a more quiet perfection of style than in the essay on
Lamb	ORGANIZATION	.

		Indeed , as we have already intimated , this volume is full of echoes and suggestions of Pater .

		The four papers that open it treat of Pater 's humor , his views of Plato , and his work as a whole , in the tone of a confessed admirer and disciple .

		Not , however , of an undiscrim - inating admirer .

		More than once he takes pains to admit that two opinions may be held of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's place in criticism .

		It is as if he felt the neces - sity of guarding himself against the charge of a too uncritical discipleship .

		There are pages of Pater in which '' we seem to take less than our customary pleasure . ''

		It is possible to differ with him in his views of Plato , of
Botticelli	ORGANIZATION	, of the Renaissance . ''

		A discreet judgment '' dare not class him with the greatest .

		Yet these , we feel , are concessions forced from him by the knowledge that without them his praise would seem too unmeasured .

		There is a sentence at the close of '' The Work of Mr.
Pater	PERSON	'' which tells the story : '' There is yet deeper sorrow , upon which I can not touch , save to say that to younger men concerned with any of the arts , he was the most generous and gracious of helpful friends . ' '

		Certainly Pater has never been praised so justly , so finely , so entirely in his own man - ner , as in these pages .

		It will be remembered , too , that one of
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	's most exquisite poems and one of the most successful brief thren - odies in our language was dedicated by him to the memory of his master .

		His debt to Pater is felt not only in such formal tributes as these , but upon almost every page of the volume .

		The names dear to Pater recur again and again ,

Thomas Browne	PERSON	,
Pascal	PERSON	,

		Every now and then one comes upon echoes of
Pater	ORGANIZATION	's own language , as in the affectionate repetition of the delightful word '' umbratile , '' familiar to lovers of `` Marius . ''

		The style in general is thoroughly Paterian .

		There is the same delicate precision of phrase , the same repudiation of the superficial , the obvious , the approximate , the same unremitting effort to pluck out the heart of some subtle personality and enshrine it in an epithet .

		And the re - semblance goes deeper than style .

		The mind of the disciple was evidently profoundly akin to the mind of the master .

		We may say of him what he says of Pater : `` Things hieratic , ascetic appealed always to him . ''

		For this reason , the papers on
Pascal	PERSON	,
Thomas a Kempis	PERSON	,
Patmore	PERSON	,
Henry Vaughan	PERSON	, '' The Soul of Sacred Poetry , '' are among the best in the volume .

		For this reason , too , we meet everywhere allusions to
Newman	PERSON	.

		His characteristic phrases are quoted , and his authority is invoked as if a mere refer - ence to him were sufficient to settle any moral or spiritual question . ''

		To the present writer , '' we read , `` the thirty-six volumes of
Newman	PERSON	, from the most splendid and familiar passages down to their slightest and most occasional note , are better known than anything else in any lit - erature and language . ''

		There is one notable particular , however , in which he forsakes the example of his master .

		One of Pater 's most characteristic and admirable critical habits was his refusal to speak severely of anyone .

		In the whole range of his writings , there is not a line of harsh criticism .

		He writes only of those whom he can praise , justly believ - ing that for a subtle and penetrating genius like his , there is an ample field for action in the true , the beautiful , and the good .

		But inferior talents may be more inclusive , and it is refreshing to find that
Johnson	PERSON	can wield on proper occasions and to our taste his occasions are all proper a trenchant pen .

		Even his strictures on
Byron	PERSON	seem to us not too severe , and his plain speaking on the Bashkirtseff we find peculiarly timely in the light of a new , and we think quite unneces - sary , volume of her letters and journals . ''

		A dis 444 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, eased and silly soul , '' he calls her , and the letters `` are the letters of an hysterical lady 's - maid . ''

		We do not forget that
Lionel Johnson	PERSON	, as a poet , is a prominent figure in the Gaelic revival , and it would not be proper to pass over without mention the papers in this volume that deal with the movement .

		They are not , however , among the most valuable of these studies , and , indeed ,
Johnson	PERSON	's interests and inspirations were too wide and his powers , both as critic and as poet , too great to permit him to be confined within the limits of any movement , however admirable .

		In fact , the paper entitled '' Poetry and Patriot - ism in
Ireland	LOCATION	'' seems to be , in part , his own apology , written in reply to those who thought the harp of Tara the only suitable instrument for a poet who was really devoted to the Irish cause .

		He makes the plea that
Ireland	LOCATION	is truly honored by all her distinguished sons , even though their muse be not strictly '' patriotic . '' ''

		There seems to be no place for a poet , '' he writes , '' who , though he be intensely national in temperament and sympathy , may be unfitted by nature to write poetry with an obvious and immediate bearing upon the national cause '' ; and he urges that Irish literature be encouraged and developed '' in a finely national , not in a pettily provincial , spirit . ''

		We end as we began .

		These essays are for the few , not for the many .

		The author of them , like his own
Octavius Pulleyne	PERSON	, did not seek '' to fill the irritated air with agitated echoes '' ; but like that '' umbratile , quiet man , '' he would be heartily content with '' a miniature immor - tality , '' a fame far short of the highest , and a circle of friends intimate , affectionate , and secure .

		With Introduction by
John Barrett	PERSON	.

		Illustrated .


New York Thomas Y. Crowell Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		what Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	invariably achieves , no matter what his theme or what the path of approach .

		He enters the remote periods of the
Holy Roman Empire	ORGANIZATION	with the same fresh enthusiasm as that with which he examines our own contemporary institutions ; he throws himself wholeheartedly into sympathy with the difficult past as well as with the changing present ; he prophesies to dry bones and makes them live again .

		Perhaps no other critic , certainly no other foreigner , '' hath walked along our roads with step So active , so inquiring eye , or tongue So varied in discourse . ''

		If this is true of
North America	LOCATION	, which he knows so well , how infinitely more so of the
Southern	ORGANIZATION	republics , to which he has made but one visit .

		But what a fruitful visit it was !

		Such an inquir - ing eye is his that it has searched out in a few months everything worth seeing , penetrated the inmost recesses of thought , and glimpsed things which we never dreamed were there .

		It is usual for writers on
South America	LOCATION	not always of judicial temperament to range themselves definitely on the side either of the optimists or of the pessimists .

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	does neither , for he - writes with a detachment born of the trained mind accustomed to tracing na - tional evolutions from their historical past to their immediate present .

		Indeed , the first sign that a new land is approaching maturity is when that land begins to have leisure , or when others think it profitable to cast a look backwards and realize the lesson of its past .

		What a past it has been for
South America	LOCATION	, what a varied tale is unfolded !

		Not the least interesting part of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's volume deals with historical evolu - tion , and his treatment is as judicial and impar - tial as it is logical and discriminating .

		If we may venture a criticism so early in our notice , however , it would deal with his bias against the Spanish colonial system a bias which might almost be termed injustice ; for there is no doubt in the mind of the present reviewer that , how - ever unfortunately it worked out , the system itself was fundamentally sound , and that if it had only allowed for more or even any self - government the whole course of future events might have been altered .

		The only other point of possible objection deals also with presumable injustice .

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	says : '' Those who quote the age of Queen
Victoria	PERSON	and the age of
Lewis	PERSON	-LSB- szc -RSB- the Fourteenth as instances to support the doctrine that eras of successful war and growing power herald , or coincide with , an epoch of literary creation , may expect to find that the inces - sant strife which has kept hot the blood of the citizens of some republics , and the rapid material progress
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 445 of others , promise an era of intellectual production in
South America	LOCATION	.

		Of this , however , there has been no sign .

		National spirit seems little disposed to flow in this channel .

		In the southern republics there is plenty of energy , but not much of it is directed towards art or science or letters . ''

		Such a judgment may be true enough in com - parison with nearly any European country , but to those who have been impressed with the art of the Peruvian painter Bacaflor , or of the Chilean artist Sotomayor ; to those who are familiar with the verse and fiction , in which perhaps
Colombia	LOCATION	and
Brazil	LOCATION	excel -LRB- and there are many who first came to realize the importance of
Latin America	LOCATION	as a literary power through the polished work of the late Brazilian ambassador ,
Senhor Nabuco	PERSON	-RRB- ; to those who recognize the value of the treatises on international law by the internationally known Argentine authority on the subject , Dr.
Drago	PERSON	to all such Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's statement would seem to demand modification .

		But as a rule the author 's criticisms and they are few considering his opportunities to make them are constructive , free alike from scorn and condescension .

		Perhaps the most important contribution of the present volume is its help toward a better understanding , largely fostered by the author 's generous and sympa - thetic point of view .

		This is the spirit , for in - stance -LRB- though his favorite country seems to be
Chile	LOCATION	-RRB- in which he describes
Brazil	LOCATION	.

		`` Not even the great North American republic has a territory at once so vast and so productive , '' a territory which , if in the hands of the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Saxon	PERSON	race , would in thirty years have fifty millions of inhabitants .

		But to Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	`` second or third thoughts suggest a doubt whether such a consummation is really in the interest of the world .

		May not territories be developed too quickly ?

		Might it not have been better for the
United States	LOCATION	if their growth had been slower , if their public lands had not been so hastily disposed of , if in their eagerness to ob - tain the labour they needed they had not drawn in a multitude of ignorant immigrants from Cen - tral and
Southern Europe	LOCATION	? ' '

		British ownership , however , does not necessarily mean prosperity or development even when the natural resources are not lacking .

		Bordering
Brazil	LOCATION	there is the colony of
British Guiana	ORGANIZATION	, with territory as large as
Great Britain	LOCATION	, the possessor of boundless re - sources . ''

		For nearly a century it has formed part of the British empire , yet its population is less than four souls to the square mile . ''

		But surely Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's observation as to our own development is just , and it can not do us harm fully to realize the logic of it .

		Such considerations as these , around which an infinite text and argument might be woven , form the basis for the latter half of the volume .

		Eleven of the sixteen chapters contain a simple narration , interspersed with glowing appreciation of the grandeurs of nature , of what Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	saw both of the country and its inhabitants .

		In the remaining chapters , as might have been ex - pected , the distinguished author draws liberally on his knowledge of history to give more point to his views .

		Not even Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	deems him - self qualified to give us general reflections on the future of these republics as a body , for they are too diversified to be treated collectively ^ But he does venture individual conclusions which are worthy of the most attentive consideration , , and he so far avoids undue optimism as to con - tent himself with saying : '' The troubles of these ninety years have , accordingly , nothing in them * that need dishearten either any friend of Span - ish
America	LOCATION	or any friend of constitutional freedom . ''

		If we stopped here we should give a very im - perfect impression of Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's volume ; but no review can do full justice to a work which must immediately be regarded as the last word on the subject , to us of the North a necessary com - plement to '' The American Commonwealth . ''

		One or two errors should be corrected in the next edition .

		Perhaps the most flagrant of these proclaims that `` the area of
Brazil	LOCATION	is about 3,300,000 square miles larger than that of the United States '' !

		Dom Pedro is throughout called '' Don . ''

		An excellent index and some good maps complete a handsome volume .

		All books of foreign travel are divided into two classes those which are meant to be read and enjoyed at home , and those which are to - be packed in a bag and consulted , something after the manner of a guidebook , on the spot * If Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	's volume is one of the few which - belong to both classes , two other recent works of South American travel , not less interesting in their way but in a vastly more confined ex - tent , must be placed in the second .

		Mr.
Caspar Whitney	PERSON	's '' The Flowing Road '' derives its - title from the nature of his travel , he tells of five separate overland and river expeditions into the heart of
South America	LOCATION	, all of which were largely undertaken by canoe and on streams more or less connected .

		Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	's success - ful attempt to reach the unknown land at the head of the
Orinoco River	LOCATION	, through the un - friendly Indians and almost impassable natural barriers , when all save one native companion had fled , presents the other side of South Amer - 446 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, ican travel in a most engaging and romantic way .

		Mr.
Bryce	PERSON	did not reach this part of the continent , and if he had he would no doubt have been lavishly entertained by the Colombian and Venezuelan governments .

		All the official pro- vision that Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	sought was help in procuring trustworthy guides , help not partic - ularly efficacious .

		It is curious that more or less the same region traversed by Mr.
Whitney	PERSON	, that of the lower
Orinoco	LOCATION	, is described in the volume by Mr.
Lindon Bates	PERSON	, Jr. , entitled '' The Path of the Conquistadores . ' '

		The trail of these picturesque old conquerors Mr.
Bates	PERSON	followed in an expedi - tion which started from
Trinidad	LOCATION	, proceeded up the
Orinoco	LOCATION	to Angostura , and thence on mule - back into the interior of
Venezuela	LOCATION	near the sur - mised location of the legendary
Golden City of Manoa	ORGANIZATION	, in the search for which so many adven - turers have given their lives .

		This volume is slighter in substance than in form , due to very large print and to the many and usually excel - lent illustrations .

		The text , however , forms an interesting mixture of fact and gossip about what is no doubt the least known and esteemed portion of the continent .

		One of the more conventional books of South American travel is Mr.
H. W. Van Dyke	PERSON	's '' Through
South America	LOCATION	. ''

		It is introduced with a preface , by Mr.
John Barrett	PERSON	, which rather '' writes down '' to the reader in such a way as to imply that both book and preface are intended as an elementary course for those who know little of South American history , institu - tions , or nature .

		If such be the case , the volume has fulfilled its intention ; nowadays , how - ever , with the ever-increasing flood of
Latin	LOCATION	- Americana , there seems little need for a further essay in a field which for the last ten years has been covered to satiety .

		But the present work , having much to commend it besides its admir - able form and illustrations , should not be dis - missed so superficially .

		The author has a happy way of expressing himself , and conveys his en - thusiasms so naively as to make us instinctively share them if we do not read too carefully .

		Though he by no means catches the spirit of such a book as Mr.
Arthur Ruhl	PERSON	's '' The Other Americans , '' or imparts the thrill of new dis - coveries conveyed in Mr.
Bingham	PERSON	's '' Across
South America	LOCATION	'' -LRB- which latter title , by the way , is a serious omission in Mr.
Van Dyke	PERSON	's bibliog - raphy -RRB- , he does succeed in bringing home to us a pleasantly agreeable picture of life and nature in
South America	LOCATION	.

		HOLIDAY PUBLICATIONS .

		I. BOOKS OF TRAVEL AND DESCRIPTION .

		A few of
New England	LOCATION	's many famous and historically interesting
summer	DATE	resorts are treated with the knowledge and sympathy of long acquaint - ance by Mr.
F. Lauriston Bullard	PERSON	in his '' His - toric Summer Haunts from
Newport	LOCATION	to
Portland	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which Mr.
Louis H. Ruyl	PERSON	has adorned with thirty-two admirable drawings , printed on a tinted background .

		The haunts are all on or near the coast ,
Newport	LOCATION	,
Plymouth	LOCATION	,
Quincy	PERSON	,
Lexington	LOCATION	,
Concord	LOCATION	,
Sudbury	LOCATION	-LRB- included for its Wayside Inn -RRB- ,
Marblehead	LOCATION	,
Gloucester	LOCATION	, Salem ,
Haverhill	LOCATION	and
Amesbury	LOCATION	-LRB- the `` Whittier country '' -RRB- ,
Newburyport	LOCATION	,
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, and
Portland	LOCATION	.

		From the abundance of history and tradition , literature and legend , touching these fine old towns , Mr.
Bullard	PERSON	has taken with a free hand , yet not with - out discrimination , for the enrichment of his book , while his own running commentary is packed with welcome explanation and suggestion and allusion .

		Writing of Salem , for example , he reminds us that ''
Hawthorne	PERSON	was not an admirer of Salem , but in Salem he lived , almost as a recluse , for years . ''

		And he wrote much about the old seaport , about its custom-house , its town pump , its now famous seven - gabled house , its `` Main Street '' -LRB- which is now Essex Street -RRB- , and its romantic history .

		As the author points out , `` Salem has no less than eight
Hawthorne	LOCATION	houses : the house of his birth , the house of his youth , the house of his courtship , the house in which
James T. Fields	ORGANIZATION	persuaded him to surrender the manuscript of ` The Scarlet Letter , ' these and the
House	ORGANIZATION	of the
Seven Gables	LOCATION	, the custom-house , and two other houses in which the writer lived , account for some twenty-five years of his life . ''

		At
Portsmouth	LOCATION	the
Aldrich	PERSON	house , now the
Thomas Bailey Aldrich Memorial Museum	ORGANIZATION	, will be to many the chief object of interest .

		The book is of most inviting appearance , its rich binding displaying the
Wayside Inn	ORGANIZATION	, stamped in gilt on the front cover .

		That ancient bit of advice , If you wish to learn a subject thoroughly write a book about it , seems to have been followed faithfully by Mr.
Philip San	PERSON	- ford
Marden	PERSON	, who , when he was reading up for a vSit to
Egypt	LOCATION	, failed to find just the kind of book he required for his enlightenment ; and so , on his return from the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	country , he has himself filled the gap and written the compactly informing and at the same time readable and enjoyable book that his own need had shown to be lacking .

		At any rate , this seems to have been the genesis of his '' Egyptian Days '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , a volume similar in character and scope to his `` Travels in
Spain	LOCATION	, '' which met with a kindly reception three years ago .

		What the intelligent tourist most wishes and needs to know , to make his Egyptian travels enjoyable and fruitful , is what Mr.
Marden	PERSON	has tried to furnish in his six -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 447 teen scholarly chapters , which are evenly divided between lower
Egypt	LOCATION	and the regions further up the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		The illustrations , forty-three in number , are mostly from photographs taken by the author , and the map at the end of the book is from his hand .

		A typical Egyptian scene in bright colors adorns the front cover .

		The volume is a fine piece of work in all respects a suitable gift to the intending winter tourist or sojourner on the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	.

		One who can find such charm and fresh delight in a solitary canal-boat journey through rural
England	LOCATION	as Mr.
E. Temple Thurston	PERSON	has found in his month 's meanderings on board the `` Flower of Gloster , '' and who can so well transfer his daily experiences and impressions to the printed page , ought not to seek in vain for readers .

		`` The ` Flower of Gloster ' '' -LRB-
Dodd	PERSON	-RRB- , named from the newly and gaudily painted barge which he secured for his rather unusual form of outing , is written in much the same light-hearted , high-spirited vein as
Stevenson	PERSON	's `` Inland Voyage . ''

		`` I would not for a kingdom , '' says Mr.
Thurston	PERSON	, '' have missed those few weeks in the heart of En - gland , far distant from any of those main thorough - fares where the dust of motors powders the face of Nature till she is worse than some painted thing .

		Scarce a soul is to be met along those winding tow - paths , for you may be sure that where a canal runs from one town to another , that is the longest way it is possible to go . ''

		From Oxford to
Inglesham	LOCATION	, by these devious windings , the `` Flower of Gloster '' made her leisurely way , towed by faithful
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	, while
Fanny	ORGANIZATION	in turn was driven by
Eynsham Harry	LOCATION	at thirty shillings a week and `` found , '' though he would have gladly accepted considerably less .

		The copious illustrations of the book include six colored plates and are all from the deft hand of Mr.
W. R. Dakin	PERSON	.

		That so much of interior
England	LOCATION	and
Wales	LOCATION	is accessible by canal-boat will be a surprise to most readers .

		The remorseless railway , with its short cuts and its saving of invaluable time , has put the inland waterways very much into the class of `` back num - bers , '' so that Mr.
Thurston	PERSON	's voyage strikes one as decidedly novel and interesting and worthy of imi - tation .

		Something distinctly out of the ordinary in
Euro	ORGANIZATION	- pean travel literature is presented by Mr.
George Wharton Edwards	PERSON	in his ``
Marken	PERSON	and Its People '' -LRB-
Moffat	PERSON	-RRB- , which is described on the title-page as '' some account written from time to time both during and after visits covering some considerable space of time upon this most curious and comparatively un - known island unknown in spite of the fact that thousands of tourists visit it each year , but of the character or life of these strange people they know little or nothing . ''

		The island in question , which is really a number of small sandy hillocks separated by shallow canals and strongly dyked against the invad - ing Zuyder Zee , would probably remain uninhabited in any quarter of the globe where dry land is less at a premium than in
Holland	LOCATION	.

		It is surmised that the terrors of the Spanish Inquisition first caused the colonization of the unpromising islet , and the original manners and customs of these early settlers have been largely preserved to this day .

		In seventeen chapters and twenty pencil sketches and a colored frontispiece the author makes his readers somewhat familiarly acquainted with
Marken	PERSON	-LRB- `` Marriker '' the natives call it -RRB- and its delightfully unsophisticated inhabit - ants .

		The book is as striking to the eye in its elab - orate and Dutch-like exterior ornamentation as it is appealing to the interest in its reading matter .

		A volume refreshingly original in recent travel literature is presented by Mr.
Charles Fish Howell	PERSON	in his `` Around the Clock in
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Houghton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The plan of the work is explained to the eye by the cover design , a clock dial with the names of twelve European cities running around it ; and this plan is further elucidated by the author in his preface .

		His purpose was to convey in words a picture of each of these twelve places at what he has considered its typical hour .

		Thus
Edinburgh	LOCATION	is described as seen in the early afternoon , from one to two o'clock ; Ant - werp from two to three ;
Rome	LOCATION	from three to four ;
Prague	LOCATION	from four to five ;
Scheveningen	LOCATION	from five to six ;
Berlin	LOCATION	from six to seven ;
London	LOCATION	from seven to eight ;
Naples	LOCATION	from eight to nine ;
Heidelberg	LOCATION	, from nine to ten ;
Interlaken	LOCATION	from ten to eleven ;
Venice	LOCATION	in the hour before
midnight	TIME	; and gay and wicked
Paris	LOCATION	in the hour after
midnight	TIME	.

		Mr.
Harold Field Kellogg	PERSON	has drawn twenty-five views -LRB- a vig - nette at the beginning of each chapter , and a larger plate inserted a little later -RRB- to embody , visually , the author 's thought .

		Venice claims the added distinc - tion of furnishing a motif for the book 's frontispiece , a view of the
Piazza San Marco	ORGANIZATION	from the Grand Canal .

		Mr. and Mrs.
Walter Hale	PERSON	's `` Motor Journeys '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- is made up of thirteen breezy narrative chapters that have appeared separately in `` Harper 's Magazine '' and other periodicals , with numerous illustrations by Mr.
Hale	PERSON	and an appended discus - sion by him of the cost of this mode of sight-seeing .

		Mrs.
Hale	PERSON	-LRB-
Louise Closser Hale	PERSON	-RRB- has written the rest of the book .

		It is in western
Europe	LOCATION	and northern
Africa	LOCATION	that the scene of the story for it has some of the fascination of fiction is laid .

		As to practi - cal matters , Mr.
Hale	PERSON	, who has made seven motor tours in
Great Britain	LOCATION	and on the Continent in the
last eight years	DATE	, asserts that the daily expense can be kept down to ten dollars or even less .


France	LOCATION	is the motorist 's paradise ; the roads are the best in
Europe	LOCATION	, and the hotel bills , except in the large cities , are moderate .

		But gasolene costs about twice what it does in
England	LOCATION	, for some unexplained reason .


Spain	LOCATION	stands at or near the other end of the scale for desirability to the automobilist .

		The artist 's drawings for this series of motor journeys are many in number and tasteful in design .

		They are repro - duced in such a manner as to convey the general impression of etchings .

		Intending motor - tourists will find the book of especial interest and full of useful hints and information .

		Some voyagers , like Captain
Amundsen	PERSON	and Com - mander
Peary	PERSON	, seek the uttermost ends of the earth , 448 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	> and then record their perilous adventures for admir - ing thousands to read ; others , like
R. L. Stevenson	PERSON	, content themselves with an inland voyage or a coast - wise cruise , and let their inventive fancy play about the simple incidents of the outing in a way to amuse their host of appreciative readers .

		Mr.
E. Keble Chatterton	PERSON	is one of the inland voyagers , and his `` Through Holland in the Vivette '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is the variously entertaining logbook of '' the cruise of of a 4-tonner from the Solent to the
Zuyder Zee	PERSON	, through the Dutch waterways , '' with sixty illustra - tions , harbor-plans , charts , etc. .

		As shown by '' Down Channel in the Vivette , '' Mr.
Chatterton	PERSON	knows how to get the very most out of a yachting trip such as the present volume describes .

		A few of his chapter - headings -LRB- such as '' A Chapter of Accidents , '' '' Southampton Water to
Ramsgate	ORGANIZATION	, '' ''
Ramsgate	ORGANIZATION	to
Calais	LOCATION	, '' ``
Calais	LOCATION	to Ostende , '' and so on , with landings at
Dordrecht	LOCATION	,
Amsterdam	LOCATION	, and other im - portant points -RRB- may serve to indicate the nature of the book 's contents .

		The author had as sailing mate Mr.
Norman S. Carr	PERSON	, who sketched and photo - graphed for the book 's embellishment .

		It is a good substantial volume , ably planned and pleasingly executed .

		Opportunity for the study of primitive savagery in darkest
Africa	LOCATION	is constantly narrowing with the invasion and settlement of those regions on the part of Europeans , so that in a few years it may be impossible for an explorer to produce such a book as Mr.
M. W. Hilton-Simpson	PERSON	, F.R.G.S. , F.Z.S. , F.R.A.I. , has written in '' Land and Peoples of the
Kasai	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		It is `` a narrative of a two years ' journey among the cannibals of the equatorial forest and other savage tribes of the south-western
Congo	LOCATION	, '' and is illustrated with many process-prints from photographs taken in most instances by the author , and also with eight colored plates .

		A large folding map of the Belgian Congo follows the read - ing matter , and a ten-page index closes the book .

		The work shows the careful personal observation that gives value to books of its class .

		The author rejoices at having been able '' to amass a great num - ber of objects for the British Museum '' and `` to turn to good advantage the opportunities we had enjoyed of studying the primitive African negro before he has been materially changed by contact with the European . ''

		To disabuse oneself of any lingering preconception that
Switzerland	LOCATION	is a country to be visited only in
summer	DATE	, one merely needs to open Mr.
Edmund B. d'Auvergne	PERSON	's ``
Switzerland	LOCATION	in Sunshine and Snow , '' a book that portrays with pen and camera the charms of the Swiss winter as nowise inferior to those of the Swiss
summer	DATE	.

		A chapter devoted to the native cold - weather sports finds appropriate place in the book , side by side with one on '' Winter in the Alps . ''

		Other sections treat in agreeable detail of the
St. Bernard	LOCATION	dogs , the guides , the Lion of
Lucerne	LOCATION	,
Chillon	LOCATION	,
Neu	PERSON	- chatel ,
Berne	LOCATION	, the
Bernese Oberland	LOCATION	, `` the Protest - ant
Rome	LOCATION	, '' which is , of course ,
Geneva	LOCATION	, the land of
William Tell	PERSON	, the Swiss lowlands , and other districts and features of this favorite European playground .

		Incidents of travel and other personal experience enliven the author 's pages and make it abundantly evident that he is writing from 110 second-hand or guide-book information .

		He loves his
Switzerland	LOCATION	, and he makes his feeling contagious .

		Thirty-six typical views , four of them colored , help to transplant the reader , in imagination , from his arm-chair to the lakes and mountains whose like are nowhere else to be found .

		Ornate binding , large print , an index to - the proper names in the book , and a good box to hold the volume are all duly provided .

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		The
Scottish Border	ORGANIZATION	has something in its very name that suggests romance , and of this agreeably suggestive quality Mr.
A. G. Bradley	PERSON	has made the most in his rambling sketches of southeastern
Scot	PERSON	- land which he has gathered into a volume under the title , `` The Gateway of
Scotland	LOCATION	, or
East Lothian	LOCATION	, .

		Lammermoor , and the Merse '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
A. L. Collins	PERSON	contributes eight cheerful views in the opulent hues of nature or even with somewhat more than nature 's opulence in this matter of color and fifty-seven soberer drawings in black and white .

		Mr.
Bradley	PERSON	well says that the region chosen by him for description and comment is almost an unknown land to the great travelling public .

		His very first chapter , on Berwick-on-Tweed , will catch the average reader cherishing the mistaken fancy that this old town is on Scottish soil ; and , indeed , as the author remarks , `` that the whole south - eastern corner of what by every law of nature and common sense should be the Scottish county of
Berwickshire	LOCATION	beyond Tweed , even to the measure of some eight square miles of pastoral and tillage upland , is English soil , remains , I feel morally certain , a geographical and political curiosity only understood by Borderers . ''

		And what , furthermore , will ninety-nine non-Scottish readers out of a hun - dred conceive to be designated by such geographical names as
East Lothian	LOCATION	, Lammermoor , and the Merse ?

		The book is well worth a nearer acquaint - ance , if only for the sake of clearing up these obscurities .

		Good line drawings that convey the impression of wood-cuts diversify in pleasing manner the pages of Mr.
Percy Allen	PERSON	's u Burgundy , the Splendid Duchy '' -LRB- Pott -RRB- , and not even the eight water-colors by the same artist -LRB- Miss
Marjorie Nash	PERSON	-RRB- can make us forgo our partiality for the less elaborate but more satisfying sketches .

		The reading matter which these illustrate and enliven comprises a series of '' studies and sketches in
South Burgundy	LOCATION	, '' interweaving per - sonal experience and learned comment in a way to win the reader 's attention and make him consider - ably wiser in the art , history , traditions , and customs of the duchy than he was before .

		Burgundy has played no unimportant part in European history .

		The author reminds his readers that `` it saw the genesis of a religious movement that was the great - est feature of eleventh and twelfth century history .

		Cluny was a nursery of popes ; Citeaux became a

		THE DIAL 449 breeding-ground of saints ; their abbots lorded it over mighty kings ; they dictated to potentates and princes ; they bent all western
Europe	LOCATION	beneath their sway . ''

		Mr.
Allen	PERSON	's book is one of the best of its class , written not for the passing season , but for permanent keeping and repeated reading and con - sultation .

		Its appeal to the eye also makes it an attractive gift book .

		HOLIDAY BOOKS OF HISTORY .

		Local history has no more enthusiastic devotee than Mr.
Stephen Jenkins	PERSON	, careful chronicler of Broadway 's numberless points of historic interest from
Bowling Green	ORGANIZATION	to
Albany	LOCATION	, and more recently author of a companion volume on `` The Story of the Bronx '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , which traces the borough 's settlement and growth from its purchase by the Dutch -LRB- from the Indians -RRB- in
1639	DATE	to the present day .

		As with its predecessor , '' The Greatest Street in the World , '' this work is the product of years of research and note - taking .

		The author says in his preface : `` The preparation of this history has taken over a decade , during which time I have jotted down various facts and incidents as I have run across them , either in books , or in the daily press , or in magazines .

		I have kept no account of the sources from which I have drawn my facts , so that I can furnish no bibliography . ''

		But he acknowledges indebtedness to
Bolton	PERSON	's and
Scharf	PERSON	's histories of
Westchester County	LOCATION	.

		`` The earlier his - tory of the Borough , '' he tells us , `` can be found in both these works , if one has plenty of time to search for it . ''

		Among his most interesting chapters are those touching on colonial manners and customs , the
Bronx	LOCATION	during the Revolution , the churches , early and later means of communication , and ferries and bridges .

		More than one hundred illustrations and maps are interspersed , the former from photographs taken by the author , and the latter so chosen as to represent the borough 's topography at the close of each distinct period in its history .

		The frontis - piece of the book is a reproduction of Mr.
E. W. Deming	PERSON	's painting , '' The Purchase of Keskeskeck ,
1639	DATE	, '' and there are numerous other illustrations .

		An excellent index of nearly twenty double-column pages completes the volume .

		The springing of our
American Boston	ORGANIZATION	from the loins of old
Boston	LOCATION	in
England	LOCATION	, whose famous church -LRB-
St. Botolph	LOCATION	's -RRB- is more than twice as old as the younger city which derives its name , indirectly , from the patron saint of the
Lincolnshire	LOCATION	town , is not yet so hackneyed a theme of historical narrative as to render superfluous Mr.
Albert C. Addison	PERSON	's volume of original research and entertaining comment and discussion , `` The Romantic Story of the Puritan Fathers , and their Founding of
New Boston	LOCATION	and the
Massachusetts Bay Colony	ORGANIZATION	, together with Some Ac - count of the Conditions which Led to their Departure from Old
Boston	LOCATION	and the Neighboring Towns in En - gland '' -LRB- Page -RRB- .

		The length of the title , the greater part of which is really a sub-title , but worth noting for the sake of completeness , need not dismay any intending reader .

		The book itself is of moderate proportions , diversified with frequent illustrations from old and new
Boston	LOCATION	, especially the former .

		In fact , the parent rather than the lusty offspring claims the chief attention , which is gladly accorded .

		In the table of contents such promising headings as the following arrest the eye , The Mayflower Pilgrims , The Puritan Exodus , A
Boston	LOCATION	Adventure ,
John Cotton	PERSON	,
Quaint Services	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston Church	LOCATION	,
Mutila	LOCATION	- tion of the Town 's Maces ,
Church Life	ORGANIZATION	in
Boston	LOCATION	,
The Lincolnshire Movement	ORGANIZATION	, Faith and Flight of Cotton , Old
Boston	LOCATION	in
Cotton	ORGANIZATION	's Day , The Bostons and `` The Scarlet Letter , '' Links with Old
Boston	LOCATION	, and
Cotton	ORGANIZATION	's Successors at
St. Botolph 's	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book is highly ornamented , with page-borders in olive green , tinted illustrations from photographs , a useful index , and a neat box to preserve all these good things from defacement .

		Miss
Mary Caroline Crawford	PERSON	has in former books succeeded so well in transporting her readers to the early times of
Boston	LOCATION	that large expectations are excited by the appearance of her '' Romantic Days in the Early Republic '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		What she did so well for her own city in '' Old
Boston	LOCATION	Days and Ways '' and '' Romantic Days in Old
Boston	LOCATION	'' she now does for a larger constituency , selecting such portions of history and tradition as may restore to us with something of charm and fascination the by-gone days of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	,
New York	LOCATION	, Washing - ton ,
Baltimore	LOCATION	,
Charleston	LOCATION	,
Richmond	LOCATION	,
New Orleans	LOCATION	, and , in a concluding chapter ,
Boston	LOCATION	once more and certain other cities of
New England	LOCATION	.

		Naturally , good use has been made of such interesting char - acters as
Hamilton	PERSON	and
Burr	PERSON	,
Jerome Bonaparte	PERSON	and his wife ,
Lafayette	LOCATION	, and
Franklin	PERSON	, and
Andrew Jackson	PERSON	, and many others .

		The materials for such reconstruction of the past are abundant ; the merit of the book lies in their skilful use .

		No formal bibliography of her manifold theme is drawn up by the author , but her pages contain frequent incidental references to her authorities .

		A pleasanter way to study American history the history of our manners and customs , and something about our great men and women of the past could not be imagined than the way opened to the reader of Miss
Crawford	PERSON	's chatty and anecdotal volumes .

		As in her former works , illustrations from old prints and portraits are given in profusion .

		A re-issue in two volumes of Mrs.
Elizabeth W. Champney	PERSON	's three volumes on the French ch & teaux -LRB- feudal , renaissance , and Bourbon -RRB- is among the season 's notable books of travel and description . ''

		Romance of the French Chateaux '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- will in its new form attract fresh readers .

		Its author 's skill and artistry in interweaving the history and legend of the scenes visited by her are familiar to readers of her other `` romance '' volumes on the French abbeys , the Italian villas , and the Roman villas .

		Her artist-husband , one gathers from her pages , accompanied her on her travels , and supple - ments the photographs that adorn her volumes with occasional less mechanical representations of things 450 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, seen .

		Among the famous castles pictured and described in the present work are to be noted the chateaux of
Mont St. Michel , Falaise	ORGANIZATION	,
Gaillard	PERSON	,
Josselin	PERSON	,
Laval	LOCATION	,
Cbateaudun	LOCATION	,
Chaumont	LOCATION	,
Nantes	LOCATION	.


Amboise	LOCATION	,
Pau	LOCATION	,
Les Rochers	ORGANIZATION	, and others of equal celebrity .

		Les
Rochers	ORGANIZATION	serves as excuse , if any were needed , for devoting considerable space to Madame de Se ` vigne ' and her circle .

		An index to the varied riches of these agreeable volumes would have in - creased their usefulness .

		The retention of the old page-numbering is a little confusing , but not easily avoidable .

		Otherwise the workmanship is all that could be desired .

		Prepared especially for members of the City His - tory Clubs , the twenty-four monographs comprising '' Historic
New York	LOCATION	during Two Centuries '' -LRB- Put - nam -RRB- were originally published some years ago in two volumes .

		Their present collection in one-volume form at a moderate price ought to enlarge their circu - lation .

		The staff of editors and writers -LRB- including such names as
Maud Wilder Goodwin	PERSON	,
Alice Car	PERSON	- rington
Royce	PERSON	,
Ruth Putnam	PERSON	,
Eva Palmer Brownell	PERSON	,
Alice Morse Earle	PERSON	,

George Everett Hill	PERSON	,
Elizabeth Bis	ORGANIZATION	- land ,
John B. Pine	PERSON	,
Talcott Williams	PERSON	,
Spencer Trask	PERSON	, and others of like prominence -RRB- is one to carry weight with all readers , and the subjects treated such as ``
Fort Amsterdam	LOCATION	in the Days of the Dutch , '' `` The Early History of Wall Street , '' `` The City Chest of
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	, '' `` Old Greenwich , '' `` King 's Col - lege , '' `` The Bowery , '' `` Tammany Hall , '' `` Bowling Green , '' `` The Doctor in Old
New York	LOCATION	, `` and `` Early Schools and Schoolmasters of
New Amsterdam	LOCATION	'' form an inviting list .

		Sixty-two illustrations and maps contribute to the attractiveness and value of the volume .

		By the use of thin but opaque paper , one not unwieldy volume , entitled `` Colonial Homesteads and their Stories '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , has been formed from the two already favorably known as '' Some Colonial Homesteads '' and `` More Colonial Homesteads , '' written some years ago by her whose pen-name -LRB- `` Marion Harland '' -RRB- is a guaranty of good literary quality and skilled workmanship .

		The stories of colonial life with which the above-named works abound will attract new readers to the present one - volume re-issue .

		Exceptional facilities for gathering the information they contain were enjoyed by the writer , who was received as a guest at the various homesteads pictured in her pages , and who had placed at her disposal all sorts of family records and faded manuscripts and curious mementos of a by-gone time , from which to frame her graphic chapters .

		The illustrations comprise both exterior and interior views and portraits , and are in lavish abundance .

		The southern and middle
Atlantic States	LOCATION	are chiefly represented in the mansion described , so that there remain many old
New England	LOCATION	houses for the full and intimate treatment which they , no less than these others , richly deserve .

		The original division into two parts , with full index to each , is preserved in the one-volume form of the work .

		HOLIDAY AKT BOOKS .

		A novelty in the literature of arts and crafts is presented in `` A Book of Hand-woven Coverlets , '' by
Eliza Calvert Hall	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
William Alexander Obenchain	PERSON	-RRB- , whose `` Aunt
Jane	PERSON	of
Kentucky	LOCATION	'' has made her name well-known in a rather different department of literature .

		The old-fashioned hand - woven coverlet is to her an object of human as well as of artistic interest , and she evidently feels that if she could understand it , woof and all , and all in all , she would know what God and man is .

		In it she sees `` poetry , romance , religion , sociology , phil - ology , politics , and history . ''

		Four years of search and travel in many states were spent in gathering facts and designs for her book ; it was a new field of study , and she had to break her own road through the wilderness .

		Even if , as she intimates , there still remains a vast unexplored domain of coverlet-lore , her book is still a considerable and a praiseworthy achievement .

		Its ten agreeable chapters afford us a glimpse into the primitive times of the spinning - wheel and hand-loom ; introduce to us the mountain weavers of
Virginia	LOCATION	,
North Carolina	LOCATION	,
Tennessee	LOCATION	, and
Kentucky	LOCATION	, where indeed `` women are working at wheel and loom just as their great - great-grand - mothers worked '' ; discuss the mysteries of coverlet designs and colors and names ; touch on the historic and family associations of the `` storied coverlet '' ; and , finally , appeal to the reader to rescue and cher - ish any heirloom of the coverlet kind that may be lying unappreciated in attic or storeroom .

		Sixteen colored plates and forty-eight in half-tone present to the eye as many patterns of hand-woven coverlets .

		The photographic process has transferred the mi - nutest details of web and design to the page , and where colors have been used the beauty of the pat - tern is still further reproduced .

		The text is printed in unusually clear type , and the handsome binding shows , very appropriately , a pleasing coverlet design on the front cover .

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- The poetry of motion is lavishly pictured and adequately described in three notable volumes on the modern art of dancing , chiefly stage dancing .

		First , there is Miss
Ethel L. Urlin	PERSON	's `` Dancing , Ancient and Modern '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- , a compact and useful treatise , giving briefly the history of the chief varieties and some minor varieties of the dance , even including the cake-walk , the Apache dances , Maori dances , and the danse macabre .

		As a handy epitome of the whole subject , with pleasing illustra - tions from paintings and from life , the book is to be commended .

		Appropriate selections from the poets are interspersed , and an embossed representation of Miss
Maud Allan	PERSON	exemplifying the latest form of stage dancing adorns the cover .

		The second work is Mr.
J. E. Crawford Flitch	PERSON	's `` Modern Dancing and Dancers '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , a volume of quarto size enlivened with colored plates as well as with many half-tone illustrations .

		The author devotes one chap - ter to a cursory historical view , '' The Ancient and Modern Attitude Towards the Dance , '' and then gives his attention to the ballet in different countries ,
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 451 the skirt dance , the serpentine dance , the high kick - ers , the revival of classical dancing , Russian dancers , oriental and Spanish dancing , the revival of the morris dance , and the future of dancing .

		Believing as he does that `` when the art historian of the future comes to treat of the artistic activity of the first dec - ade of the twentieth century , he will remark as one of its most notable accomplishments a renaissance of the art of the Dance , '' he handles his theme with befitting seriousness and , what is more , engages the serious interest of the reader .

		Some good reproduc - tions from
Sargent	LOCATION	and other painters are among the illustrations of this sumptuous volume .

		Last but not least , we have Mr. and Mrs.
Charles H. Caffin	PERSON	's rich quarto volume , `` Dancing and Dancers of Today '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , or , as the subtitle reads , `` The Modern Revival of Dancing as an Art . ''

		Together with some tracing of the history of modern dancing there are chapters on individual dancers :
Isadora Duncan	PERSON	,
Maud Allan	PERSON	,
Ruth St. Denis	PERSON	,
Gende	LOCATION	,
Mordkin	LOCATION	,
Pav	PERSON	- lowa ,
Sacchetto	ORGANIZATION	, and
Wiesenthal	ORGANIZATION	; and also chap - ters on the ballet , the Russian dance-drama , court dances , eccentric dancing , and folk dancing .

		Forty - eight large plates from photographs illustrate the work , which is ornately bound and boxed .

		Mr.
Frank Roy Fraprie	PERSON	, having already written agreeably of Bavarian inns and Scottish castles and
Munich	LOCATION	art galleries , confines his attention for his this year 's book to a single great artist and his works . ''

		The Raphael Book '' -LRB- Page -RRB- is described in its sub - title as '' an account of the life of
Raphael Santi	PERSON	of
Urbino	LOCATION	and his place in the development of art , to - gether with a description of his paintings and fres - coes . ''

		Fifty-four full-page plates , six of them in color , reproduce or at least suggest to the reader 's eye the chief masterpieces of this artist who first made religious painting something more than a stiff conventionality .

		New facts are of course not to be sought in any re-telling of the story of
Raphael	ORGANIZATION	's life ; but new points of emphasis , new opinions on debatable questions in his art , and fresh enthusiasm for his genius , are always possible and in order .

		It is in this freshness of presentation and hearty enjoy - ment of
Raphael	ORGANIZATION	's peculiar merits that the strength of Mr.
Fraprie	PERSON	's book lies .

		The volume ends with a useful list of pictures painted by or attributed to
Raphael	PERSON	, and a twelve-page index .

		The many illus - trations and handsome binding of the work make it a suitable gift book .

		It is neatly and strongly boxed .

		Of increasing interest because of increasing rarity is the old colonial homestead exemplified by the
Cabot	PERSON	house at Salem , the
Fowler	PERSON	house at
Danvers	LOCATION	, the
Jewett	PERSON	house at
Georgetown	LOCATION	,
Mass.	LOCATION	, the
Warner	ORGANIZATION	house at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	, and a number of others still standing in the older towns of our
Atlantic States	LOCATION	. ''

		Colonial Homes and their Furnishings , '' by Miss
Mary H. Northend	PERSON	, is a volume rich in descriptive details of such early and noteworthy examples of domestic architecture as are to be found in old Salem ,
Marblehead	LOCATION	,
Danvers	LOCATION	,
Newburyport	LOCATION	, and other places not far distant , with a considerable study of old colonial furniture and decoration all elaborately illustrated with more than two hundred plates .

		It was illness and a desire for occupation to divert her thoughts that first turned the author 's attention to the subjects treated in her book , and now , she tells us in her preface , she has one of the most valuable existing collections of photographs illustrating those subjects .

		Her arrangement of topics , as indicated in the table of contents , is note - worthy .

		First she discusses old houses in their total - ity , then colonial doorways , door-knockers , old-time gardens , halls and stairways , wall-papers , chairs and sofas , sideboards and bureaus and tables , f our - posters , mirrors , clocks , old-time lights , old china , old glass , old pewter , and old silver .

		The largeness of the book 's pages admits of some unusually fine illustra - tions , as for instance that of the Nichols garden , the
Middleton	LOCATION	house , the Andrew-house doorway , and others that might be named .

		Clear type , a full in - dex , and a rich and appropriate binding are among the book 's excellences .

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Mr.
Henry C. Lahee	PERSON	has given so much attention to the rise of grand opera in this country as to qualify him for his latest undertaking , a volume on '' The Grand Opera Singers of To-day '' -LRB- Page -RRB- , the object of which , he tells us in his preface , '' has been to - give some account of the leading singers who have been heard in
America	LOCATION	during the present century . ''

		But `` those whose careers have been touched upon in ' Famous Singers of Yesterday and To-day , ' and in ' Grand Opera in
America	LOCATION	' are not mentioned , , except perhaps casually , in this book . ''

		The histories of the leading American opera houses are followed with some account of the various singers appearing on their stages , and criticisms of these opera singers are quoted from authoritative sources .

		The seven chapters deal with the Metropolitan Opera-House under
Maurice Grau	PERSON	, the same under
Heinrich Conried	PERSON	, the
Manhattan	LOCATION	Opera-House under
Oscar Hammerstein	PERSON	, the Metropolitan -LRB- again -RRB- under
Gatti	PERSON	-
Casazza	PERSON	and
Dippel	PERSON	, the
Boston Opera-House	ORGANIZATION	under
Henry Russell	PERSON	, and the Chicago-Philadelphia Com - pany under
Dippel	PERSON	.

		The list of singers treated with pen and camera within the ample compass of the book is too long to be given here .

		Among the im - presarios , the variously gifted and boldly enterpris - ing Mr.
Hammerstein	PERSON	attracts most attention .

		A short concluding chapter , briefly retrospective and forward-looking , ends with the passage from
Shaler	PERSON	's '' Individual '' which promises more for the future development of music than for any other of the fine arts .

		The book , in its red and gilt binding , and with its clear print and numerous portraits of opera singers in their characteristic roles , is a notably attractive volume .

		Last
January	DATE	Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	went to
Panama	LOCATION	to make drawings of the Canal , and he found , when he arrived , that his visit had been well timed for catching views of the great works in their most stu - pendous stage and before the letting in of the water should have partly hidden those marvels of cyclopean engineering .

		A volume of twenty-eight reproduc - tions from his original lithographs , preserving as 452 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, many views of the '' big ditch '' and its surroundings on the eve of its completion , is the result of his excur - sion .

		``
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	's Pictures of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- is the title of the volume , in which the artist 's pen has cooperated with his pencil in conveying some adequate impression of the won - ders that confronted him .

		Picking his points of view with an eye to effect , and provided with an official pass that left him at liberty to risk his neck as boldly as he chose , Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	was able to repro - duce scenes that no photographer has yet caught ; and he has imparted to them the charm and the aesthetic suggestion that no camera can capture .

		His Introduction and comments are an excellent aid to one 's appreciation of both the engineering enterprise itself and the artistic undertaking of the undaunted sketcher .

		A most engaging and lovable personality was that of the late
William T. Richards	PERSON	, widely known for his paintings of the sea in all its varied moods .

		In Mr.
Harrison S. Morris	PERSON	's small volume , ''
William T. Richards	PERSON	: A Brief Outline of his Life and Art '' -LCB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , is presented a pleasing portrait of the man and artist from the hand of one who knew him well and esteemed him highly .

		Richards was no mere painter of pictures ; in him was `` a touch of life beyond the monopolizing palette ... He was apt in all the pleasant devices of conversation , full of humor and quiet laughter , full of diverting stories from his travels and his contact with life in many countries , and full of that large acquaintance with books that furnishes a ripe mind with overflowing talk . ''

		Fourteen `` masterpieces of the sea , '' as Mr.
Morris	PERSON	rightly calls them , and one landscape are reproduced from
Richards	PERSON	's canvases , and portraits of the artist and his wife are also given .

		In all its details the book is a handsome piece of work as well as an excellent bit of biography .

		HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE . ''

		The Life of the Bee , '' that wonderful book of
M. Maeterlinck	PERSON	's which is neither science nor natural history , nor prosaic fact of any sort , but poetry and suggestion and beauty , all with a substantial basis in truth -LRB- which is itself the most suggestive and beautiful thing known -RRB- , comes out again this season in a finely-illustrated edition printed on heavy paper with generous margins , and ornately bound and boxed .

		The excellence of Mr.
Alfred Sutro	PERSON	's lim - pid translation is already recognized .

		The illustra - tion , done by Mr.
Edward J. Detmold	PERSON	, will be found no whit inferior : his flower pictures have the effect of water - colors , or rather of nature itself ; and his bees hovering over them can almost be heard to buzz , so that , as in the case of the famous bee painted by
Quintin Matsys	PERSON	of old , a nervous person might be inclined to draw forth pocket-handkerchief and flirt them away .

		There are thirteen of these exquisite designs , loosely mounted on heavy tinted paper , while the cover further displays the artist 's skill .

		In all its appointments this edition of a work whose aim is `` to speak of the bees very simply , as one speaks of a subject one knows and loves to those who know it not , '' is in beautiful accord with the high aim of its author .

		The book is of quarto size , which gives ample scope to both printer and illustra - tor to do their best work .

Dodd	ORGANIZATION	,
Mead & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- In rich holiday attire appears Mr.
Kipling	PERSON	's '' Kim , '' the orphan lad of
Lahore	LOCATION	who , though he owned a European costume trousers , a shirt , and a battered hat `` found it easier to slip into Hindu or
Mohammedan	DATE	garb when engaged on certain businesses , '' and who , `` as he reached the years of indiscretion , learned to avoid missionaries and white men of serious aspect who asked him who he was and what he did .

		For
Kim	PERSON	did nothing with an immense success . ''

		He knew the wonderful walled city of
Lahore	LOCATION	from end to end , was intimate with men who lived stranger lives than were ever dreamt of by Haroun al Raschid , and his whole existence was a continuous `` Arabian Nights '' tale .

		But , remarks the author , missionaries and secretaries of charitable societies could not see the beauty of it .

		The beauty of it , or at least the interest of it , has nevertheless appealed to thousands of readers , and many more are likely to be drawn to the story by this handsome edition , illustrated with reproductions of the series of terra cotta placques designed for the story by the author 's father ,
J. Lockwood Kipling	PERSON	, and having as end-leaves a colored reproduction of one of
Verest	LOCATION	- chagin 's paintings .

		Colored borders set off the plates , which are themselves tinted , and the binding is in red and gold .

		-LRB-
Doubleday , Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- In a handsome two-volume edition , for which the type was entirely reset , and which has sixty-four well - chosen illustrations , '' The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci '' reappears in Mr.
Herbert Trench	PERSON	's authorized translation from the Russian of
Dmitri Merejkowski	PERSON	.

		It is ten years since this remarkable romance of a great artist 's life was first offered to English readers by its present publishers -LRB-
G. P. Putnam	PERSON	's Sons -RRB- , and in that time , as is announced on the reverse of the title-page , it has had no fewer than eight re-printings .

		The plates provided for this edition embrace a large number of reproductions of
Leonardo	LOCATION	's paintings and of other works of contemporary artists , also portraits and views in abundance .

		The late disappearance -LRB- and repeatedly reported reappearance -RRB- of the famous ''
Mona Lisa	PERSON	'' portrait from the
Louvre	LOCATION	gives especial timeliness to this fine edition of the Russian roman - cer 's book ; and his chapter , in the second volume , on ''
Mona Lisa Gioconda	PERSON	'' acquires a current inter - est apart from its own literary merits .

		The artist 's portrait of himself , in the
Uffizi Gallery	LOCATION	, furnishes a frontispiece for the first volume , while his `` Mona Lisa '' performs a like service for the second .

		The volumes are attractively bound in blue and gilt .

		In a new edition , uniform with recent reissues of Dean
Ramsay	PERSON	's and
John Gait	PERSON	's pictures of Scottish life and character , there is now revived that classic of the early nineteenth century , `` The Life of Mansie Wauch , Tailor in Dalkeith '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , by
David Macbeth Moir	PERSON	, contemporary and friend of
John Gait	PERSON	and a writer gifted with an exquisite humor
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 453 and a deft touch in the portrayal of personal oddi - ties .

		Contributing frequently to ''
Blackwood	PERSON	's Mag - azine '' in the twenties in fact it was there that '' Mansie '' made its appearance as a serial
Moir	PERSON	gained a reputation that was further increased by the rapid reissue in edition after edition of his mas - terpiece , the book now under consideration .

		Mansie is a most laughably and lovably conceited person , as depicted by himself in this his alleged autobiography .

		In the mere record of his birth he can not conceal his foible , for he speaks of his father and mother as '' little , I daresay , jalousing , at the time their eyes first met , that fate had destined them for a pair , and to be the honoured parents of me , their only bairn . ''

		The tremendously important events of
Mansie	ORGANIZATION	's sartorial career , of his courtship and mar - riage and all the little domesticities of his life , make the richest of reading as told by the chief actor in the drama .

		The book was well worth reviving , and in its present handsome form , with colored illustra - tions from oil paintings by Mr.
Charles Martin Hardie	PERSON	, R.S.A. , it is a book to own and to keep .

		It is almost half a century since the late
John Hay	PERSON	struck that vein of popular ballad poetry that proved so rich during the short time he worked it .

		`` The
Pike County Ballads	LOCATION	, '' first collected in an unpreten - tious volume that achieved a circulation far smaller than it deserved , are now issued in handsome form , with illustrations admirably suited to their character , by the
Houghton Mifflin Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
N. C. Wyeth	PERSON	is the artist , and he prefaces his work with a short in - troduction . ''

		I have endeavored , '' he says , modestly , `` to add my mite to these already potent lines ; to lift the curtain intermittently , to draw the veil aside cautiously , and look upon the unsuspecting folk of
Pike County	LOCATION	. ''

		Seven colored and a greater number of uncolored drawings admirably catch the spirit of the ballads .

		On the book 's front cover are depicted three typical
Pike County	LOCATION	characters , and the end - leaves bear representations of still other specimens of the same gentry .

		In a serviceable and beautiful '' pocket edition , '' the romances of The'ophile
Gautier	PERSON	, translated and edited by Professor
F. C. de Sumichrast	PERSON	, of
Harvard University	ORGANIZATION	, illustrated with full-page photogravure plates of a striking nature , and flexibly but strongly bound in limp leather , are issued in a uniform set of ten volumes by
Messrs. Little , Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and are offered in sets only .

		The `` Travels '' of the same author , also translated by Professor
de Sumichrast	PERSON	, are published in a set of seven volumes , uniform in style with the novels , by the same publishers .

		Any one of these seven volumes may be bought separately .

		Introductions , presenting in brief and readable form much bibliographical and biographical information and occasional critical comment , are supplied by the translator .

		The richness and color of
Gautier	PERSON	's style seem to have been well reproduced in this version of his works , of which the travel volumes especially show him to be a master of vivid description , seizing upon what is most characteristic in the different countries visited .

		This opportunity to obtain a uniform set of his writings in so trustworthy a version and at moderate cost should not be neglected either by libraries or by individual purchasers .

		In the year following its first appearance , and already with a circulation of one hundred and thirty - five thousand to its credit , Mr.
Jeffery Farad	PERSON	's ro - mance , `` The Broad Highway , '' comes forth with its charm renewed and heightened in a holiday edition printed from new plates , with twenty-four colored pictures by Mr.
Charles E. Brock	PERSON	, and an additional one on the front cover of the artistic binding .

		Mr.
Brock	PERSON	's previous work has marked him as an illustra - tor quite equal to the task of doing justice to
Peter	PERSON	and
Charmian	PERSON	, Black
George and Prue	PERSON	, Sir
Maurice Vibart	PERSON	, and the Ancient , and the other leading char - acters of this vivid romance .

		Drawing and coloring alike are remarkably well done , and not even the beautiful heroine herself could have been more ac - ceptably conceived .

		A short preface of thanks to his hospitable public is furnished by the author , who naturally finds himself in a mood to rejoice that the stony and difficult part of the highway over which he and
Peter	PERSON	have travelled to success and prosperity is now well passed .

		-LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- '' The
Burlington	LOCATION	Library '' -LRB- Little ,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- is well represented this season by two new volumes ,
Keats	PERSON	's `` Poems '' and
Kingsley	PERSON	's `` Water-Babies , '' each provided with twenty-four graceful illustrations in color , and each also artistically jacketed and boxed .

		Mr.
Averil Burleigh	PERSON	's pictures for the
Keats	PERSON	volume are beautifully drawn .

		The even distribu - tion of the plates through the book , at every six - teenth page , as a rule has resulted in a certain severance of picture from the poem it illustrates , which might have been avoided a slight discord that is repeated in `` The Water-Babies . ''

		Miss
Ethel F. Everett	PERSON	's colored drawings for this ever - popular story show understanding of the author 's intention and are designed in the true spirit of fairy-land .

		Few if any inexpensive color books can match this
Burlington	LOCATION	series , which now contains seven well-chosen volumes .

		Rabelais , in the vigorous seventeenth-century English of Sir
Thomas Urquhart	PERSON	, and copiously illus - trated with appropriate drawings by Mr.
W. Heath Robinson	PERSON	, appears in a two-volume edition at a moderate price .

		The antique flavor of this time - tested version corresponds well with the archaism of Rabelais 's style , and the humorous conceits of the illustrator fall no whit behind the amusing inventions of the author .

		More than one hundred of these draw - ings are interspersed .

		The volumes are tastefully and strongly bound .

		-LRB-
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- HOLIDAY ANTHOLOGIES .

		Although Mr.
Alfred H. Hyatt	PERSON	's volumes , `` The Charm of
London	LOCATION	'' and `` The Charm of
Venice	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- , are compilations as to their reading mat - ter , the range and variety of the selections and the superior quality of the illustrations -LRB- from water - colors by Mr.
Yoshio Markino	PERSON	and Mr.
Harald Sund	PERSON	-RRB- give the books an excellence not attained by 454 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, the ordinary holiday publication of this sort .

		Each of the volumes contains about two hundred well - chosen extracts in prose and verse from approved sources , including American as well as English authors .

		Twelve excellent reproductions of water - color drawings are provided for each volume , those for
London	LOCATION	being from Mr.
Mariano	PERSON	's brush , those for
Venice	LOCATION	from Mr.
Sund	PERSON	's .

		The Japanese artist 's style is already familiar to the many readers of his books ; and Mr.
Sund	PERSON	's drawings are equally pleas - ing in their way .

		It is remarkable how carefully the former artist , coming of a nation whose art seeins to us so devoid of the principle of perspective , has rendered the perspective , especially the atmos - pheric perspective , in his
London	LOCATION	scenes .

		The deli - cacy and finish in both sets of illustrations make them a delight to the eye .

		For its maximum of wisely-chosen Christmas verse within a minimum of space , no compilation of its sort could well surpass Mr.
Edward A. Bryant	PERSON	's '' Yule - tide Cheer '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- , which has brought together all the familiar old carols and poems of the season , and also a good number of the newer and less familiar pieces of verse appropriate to the same joyous season all arranged according to subject in eight sections , `` Yule-tide Anticipations , '' `` The Yule Log , '' ''
Santa Claus	LOCATION	and Other Saints , '' ''
Christmas Day	DATE	, '' '' Christ - mas in Sacred Song , '' `` Christmas Carols , '' `` New Year 's , '' and `` Epiphany . ''

		Poems as old as the
Anglo	ORGANIZATION	-
Norman	PERSON	carol of the thirteenth century , sup - posed to be the oldest extant carol in our tongue , and as modern as Father
Tabb	PERSON	's and Mr.
Bliss	PERSON	Car - man 's Christmas pieces , find a place in the book .

		To the table of contents and the index of titles and first lines an index of authors might wisely have been added .

		The little volume is tastefully printed and bound and boxed , and has an appropriate frontispiece .

		Of late years , no holiday season has been complete without its book on the cheerful art of being happy .

		This season accordingly brings forth an elaborately ornamented and at the same time pleasing volume of prose and verse selections compiled by Miss
Jennie Day Haines	PERSON	under the title '' A Book of Happiness '' -LRB-
Jacobs	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Orison Swett Marden	PERSON	, that indefati - gable preacher of the gospel of success , contributes the first extract , and Mrs.
Browning	PERSON	occupies the place of highest honor , at the end of the list .

		Be - tween the two there must be nearly a thousand other quotations , short and long , prose and verse , grouped in chapters appropriately headed .

		To the indeter - minate `` Selected '' are credited a considerable num - ber of passages .

		From Leigh Hunt comes one of the shortest and best : '' It is books that teach us to refine our pleasures when young , and to recall them with satisfaction when we are old . ''

		Whether or not happiness will come by taking thought , no more attractive book of its sort could be asked for as a gift volume .

		The latest but not the least addition to the series of volumes devoted to poems of places comes from the editorial hand of Mr.
J. Walker McSpadden	PERSON	, and is called '' The Alps as Seen by the Poets '' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The poems , selected with good j udgment from the great poets , and from some of their minor fellow-singers , are grouped geographically and in - alphabetic order under such headings as
Appenzell	LOCATION	,
Berne	LOCATION	,
Fribourg	LOCATION	,
Geneva	LOCATION	, etc. .

		Sixteen colored views of Alpine scenery , bringing out , here and there , some admirable effects of light and shade on lofty moun - tain peaks , are furnished by Mr.
A. D. McCormick	PERSON	, Mr.
J. Hardwicke Lewis	PERSON	, and Miss May
Hardwicke Lewis	PERSON	.

		The cover design is striking and appro - priate .

		The editor has written an introduction , and the printer has used his best and clearest type .

		MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS .

		Chloe , the wife of old Crispin the mushroom - gatherer , was `` worn to a frazzle '' with the care of her ten children -LRB- all bad but one ,
Boadicea	LOCATION	-RRB- , and so she looked about for a '' minder '' to relieve her of care , and finally sent for her nephew Bill , who cleaned the boots .

		It is the entrancing story of '' Bill the Minder '' which Mr.
W. Heath Robinson	PERSON	has told r with pen and pencil , '' for such youngsters from nine to ninety as love their '
Peter Pan	PERSON	' and ' Alice in
Wonderland	LOCATION	. ' ''

		No one would have sus - pected Bill of having the makings of a good minder in him ; hence the surprise and delight with which his many and original methods of baby-minding are viewed by every appreciative reader .

		He took to the calling with the enthusiasm of an artist .

		Nat - urally , therefore , he carried off all the prizes at `` the great annual Minding Tournament held by the
Duke	ORGANIZATION	to celebrate his birthday . ''

		The astonishing adven - j tures of Bill and the children whom he minded , end - ing with the siege and capture of Troy , will keep a whole family in entertainment for many a winter 's evening .

		The pictures sixteen colored plates and innumerable line drawings are admirably in har - mony with the rollicking , whimsical , delightfully absurd tenor of the tale they illustrate : and they are , in their way , good art also .

		The book is of large octavo dimensions , handsomely and strongly bound and boxed , and printed in the clearest of type .

		It is a veritable treasury of mirth and clever - ness .

		-LRB-
Holt	PERSON	. -RRB-

		The wholesome delights of an out-door life in the
summer	DATE	are pictured with pen and camera in Mrs.
Frances Kinsley Hutchinson	PERSON	's book , '' Our Country Life '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- , which is written after a ten years ' test of that mode of existence on a woodland retreat in
Wisconsin	LOCATION	.

		Nature-study , especially bird-study , chicken-raising , gardening , boating on the near-by lake , entertaining visitors , motoring to points of interest in the neighborhood , these and similar health-giving pursuits and recreations fill the days of Mrs.
Hutchinson	PERSON	and her household during the long vacation season ; and sometimes they seek the retreat for a breathing-spell in the winter also .

		A glance at the chapter-headings of her book will excite desire to explore its pages .

		In an engaging manner the author tells of her garden , the bantams r the lake , the exhilarating experience of sleeping under the stars , the country in
winter	DATE	, the story of
1912	DATE	.

		J THE 455 Nan -LRB- a motherless bird -RRB- , the little daily doings of the family , and so on .

		A multitude of photographic views , charming bits of rurality , including various aspects of the foliage-embowered and vine-clad home of the writer , make the book most attractive to the eye .

		There is a veritable riot of vegetation in these pictures , though the primness of one formal garden is also exhibited .

		The volume is fittingly bound in green , with end-leaves depicting green lawn and spreading trees , and a low-roofed building in the background .

		A picture-book of children , for lovers of children , with accompanying verses by Mr.
Burges Johnson	PERSON	, comes from the
Thomas Y. Crowell Co.	ORGANIZATION	in sumptuous quarto form , with the title `` Childhood . ''

		The pic - tures , twenty in number , are full-page plates from photographs taken by
Cecilia Bull Hunter	PERSON	and
Caro	PERSON	- line
Ogden	PERSON	, and present as many aspects of happy infancy and early childhood , with occasional accom - panying glimpses of motherhood and grandmother - hood .

		In a vein not unlike that of
Eugene Field	PERSON	, Mr.
Johnson	PERSON	furnishes appropriate lines for each illustration .

		The verses are printed in brown on heavy paper , with ornamental initial letters and a simple page-border .

		The illustration to each set of verses follows it on the next right-hand page , being loosely attached and bordered with brown .

		The left - hand pages are blank inviting additional rhymes or pictures , or both , from home talent and based on home themes .

		A large outdoor scene , with a sturdy urchin in the foreground , ornaments the cover , which itself is in light-brown cloth , artistically stamped in gilt .

		This is just the book for the young mother and the growing family , and is not without attrac - tions for the old who have once been children themselves .

		Every landscape has as many aspects as it has beholders .

		The Swiss views which we see through Mr.
G. Flemwell	PERSON	's eyes in his exquisitely-illustrated volume , '' The Flower-Fields of
Switzerland	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- , are by no means the same as those pic - tured in any of the several other noteworthy
Swit	PERSON	- zerland books of the present season .

		Mr.
Flemwell	PERSON	is a flower-lover , a flower-painter , and a botanist .

		He writes the flower-names with capital initial letters in his book , and he sees flowers as the chief feature of the landscape .

		Hence his beautiful colored pic - tures of Swiss mountain slopes and brooksides and nooks and corners are resplendent with nature 's choicest hues .

		His earlier work , '' Alpine Flowers and Gardens , '' met with deserved success , but left un - treated those aspects of the Alpine fields , especially in
spring	DATE	, which have won his enthusiastic admira - tion , and which he now so admirably reproduces .

		Each view , loosely mounted on heavy paper , is like a water-color for delicacy .

		Flower effects , in mass at a distance , and in detail in the foreground , are given with unusual skill , and the accompanying com - ment and description from his pen are in good taste .

		He closes with a plea for the introduction of this feature of Alpine loveliness into
England	LOCATION	, where the daisy , the buttercup , and the dandelion might well be supplemented by many examples of the Swiss wild-flowers .

		Mr.
Henry Correvon	PERSON	, horticulturist at Floraire near
Geneva	LOCATION	, and a friend of the author , prefaces the book , which contains reproductions of twenty-five of the author-painter 's water-colors , not counting the one on the cover .

		It is one of the most strikingly beautiful volumes of the season .

		Two of the late
Katharine Prescott Wormeley	ORGANIZATION	's most important translations from the French `` Illustrious Dames of the Court of the Valois Kings '' and `` The Ruin of a Princess '' are now , a dozen years after their first appearance in an edition too expensive for popular purchase , repub - lished in handsome but less costly form , with all the original illustrations , and with no curtailment of text , by the
Lamb Publishing Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		It is from
Brantome	ORGANIZATION	's `` Vies des Dames Illustres '' and `` Vies des
Dames Galantes	PERSON	, `` with
Sainte-Beuve	PERSON	's ``
Monday	DATE	Chats '' on five of the chosen dames , that the trans - lator has drawn her material for the first-named work ; and from
Madame Elisabeth	PERSON	, the Duchesse d'Angouleme , and Cl ^ ry , Louis the Sixteenth 's valet , that she gets her account of '' the ruin of a princess , '' that unfortunate lady being
Madame Elisabeth	PERSON	her - self .

		Brant6me 's style , his ingenuous frankness in recording various sorts of rascality perpetrated by his contemporaries , need not here be commented on .

		It makes brisk and not seldom amusing reading .

		The pathos in the undeserved tribulations of the heroine of the other work will appeal to every reader not wholly bereft of pity .

		The well-known smoothness and trustworthiness of
Miss Wormeley	LOCATION	's rendition have contributed much to the popularity of the many works bearing her name as translator .

		The two volumes here named are uniform in style , each having eight photogravures , and each being excellently printed and handsomely bound in blue and gold .

		Our ever-increasing interest in the Land of the Rising Sun , a land that has so recently emerged from the semi-darkness of her mediaevalism into the glare of modernity , makes welcome and timely such a variously informing and curiously entertaining volume as Mr.
F. Hadland Davis	PERSON	's `` Myths and Legends of
Japan	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Crowell	PERSON	-RRB- .

		It is the fruit of careful study and wide reading , the now sufficiently numerous standard authorities on things Japanese having been pressed into service in the compiling of the book .

		No country has a richer folklore than
Japan	LOCATION	, and Mr.
Davis	PERSON	's chapter-headings alone con - vey some idea of its range and variety .

		He has collected the noteworthy legends concerning the national heroes and warriors , the fox that so often figures in popular tales , the majestic Mount Fuji - yama -LRB- `` the Never-dying Mountain '' -RRB- , Yuki-onna -LRB- `` the Lady of the Snow '' -RRB- , dolls , butterflies , fans , thunder , tea , birds , trees , mirrors , bells , and innu - merable other things ; and there are added a brief treatise on Japanese poetry , a list of the native divini - ties , a bibliography , an index of poetical quotations , and , finally , a combined glossary and index to the entire work .

		Miss
Evelyn Paul	PERSON	has produced thirty - 456 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 1	DATE	, two colored pictures in which she is remarkably successful in embodying that indefinable quality at once recognized as so peculiarly pleasing in native illustration .

		She has made the book a thing of beauty as well as one of entertainment and instruction .

		An artist 's wife , herself a woman of letters , assumes , for the first time apparently , the cares and responsibilities of a housewife in
London	LOCATION	, and straightway has a succession of memorable and frequently harrowing experiences with her domes - tics .

		Beggars , too , of many sorts , but chiefly of the most respectable appearance , help to vary the mo - notony of her existence . ''

		Our
House	ORGANIZATION	, and
London	LOCATION	out of Our Windows '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , by Mrs.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, with pictures by Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	, tells , in a sprightly fashion the story of this experiment at home making under unfamiliar conditions .

		The `` house '' was in reality a flat , three flights up and with a command of sundry picturesque views of roofs and river and busy street views that the artist has turned to account , in his well-known manner , for the further enlivening of his wife 's already lively narrative .

		Sixteen of these glimpses of ``
London	LOCATION	out of our windows '' are offered , de - picting with Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's customary charm and skill many of the most characteristic aspects , both by day and by
night	TIME	, of the greatest of modern cities .

		In this new and handsome edition , with the added attraction of Mr.
Pennell	PERSON	's illustrations , the book is sure to find the wide circle of readers which it so well deserves .

		A stern parent , or one who tries to be stern , a pretty and rather saucily self-reliant daughter , an ardent and determined lover , a steam yacht belong - ing to the stern parent , some blue ocean , a transac - tion in real estate these and sundry other persons and things , skilfully compounded and flavored with sentiment , spiced with wit , and embellished with the illustrator 's art , go to make up Mr.
Ralph Henry Barbour	PERSON	's annual demonstration of the incontro - vertible truth that `` love will find a way . ''

		The tale is of the briskly entertaining sort , with an abundance of spirited dialogue and a sufficiency of incident , and its title is `` The Harbor of Love . ''

		Mr.
George W. Plank	PERSON	illustrates it in color , and Mr.
Edward S. Holloway	PERSON	supplies the decorative page-borders and other ornamentation .

		-LRB-
J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- A little tale of courtship and marriage and par - enthood amid surroundings of rural simplicity and beauty and quiet is told by Miss
Clarice Vallette McCauley	PERSON	in `` The Garden of Dreams '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		A prologue and a series of letters , chiefly from the hero to a sympathetic woman friend , with others from the heroine to her dead father and other per - sons not dead , unfold the drama , and we take leave of the happy pair rejoicing over the birth of a son .

		Miranda is the appropriate name of the unspoilt maiden whom the Ferdinand of the romance though that is not his name wooes and wins .

		The little volume is tastefully printed , with tinted page - borders , and an ornamental binding THE SEASON 'S BOOKS FOR THE YOUXG .

		The following is a list of all children 's books published during the present season and received at the office of THE DIAL up to the time of going to press with this issue .

		It is believed that this classified list will com - mend itself to Holiday purchasers as a convenient guide to the juvenile books for the season of
1912	DATE	.

The Century Co.	ORGANIZATION	, which position he has held since that time .

		A prom - inent member of the

		His frequent visits to
London	LOCATION	gave him opportunity for personal ac - quaintance with the foremost writers and artists of his day , by whom he was held in affectionate regard .

		The passing of a famous publisher is noted with regret in the recent death of
William Blackwood	PERSON	, grand - son of the founder of the house of
William Blackwood	PERSON	and Sons , and a man so well known among writers and with so many memorable experiences to record in his diary -LRB- if he kept one , as is now hoped to have been the case -RRB- that a volume of very readable reminiscences ought to be forthcoming at the hands of his literary executor .

		His success with the magazine that came into his hands with his assumption of the management of the business a generation ago was not the least of his triumphs . ''

		Blackwood 's '' is an object of especial interest to us by reason of its having served as a model for our fore - most literary monthly when
Lowell	PERSON	and Fields were planning that noteworthy undertaking more than half a century ago , and both magazines have had to contend with the difficulties arising from the recent remarkable vogue of the low-priced illustrated monthly .

		The late Mr.
Blackwood	PERSON	was a man of culture , educated at
Glasgow University	ORGANIZATION	, the
Sorbonne	LOCATION	, and
Heidelberg	LOCATION	, and was esteemed an accomplished letter-writer by his cor - respondents .

		A selection from his letters , if nothing more , ought to be given to the public at an early date .

London	LOCATION	Spectator : '' The range of these six hundred and thirty pages of
Meredith	PERSON	's correspondence is so enormous that it is difficult to make up one 's mind at what point to approach it .

		The volume of Meredith 's personality was immense , and here we see it in full flood through sixty strenuous years .

		Every line is animated by his wonderful relish and curiosity for life .

		On every page there waves his banner , and beneath it rumbles and flashes all the artillery of his passionate and brilliant eloquence . ''

		The Bookman : `` He had all the gifts of a superior letter writer : grace , variety , and vision : devoid of self - consciousness and with no weather-eye cocked on posterity and the reviewer 's table .

		506 THE CASE OF POETRY .

		In the conditions of current literary activity there are symptoms of a desire to do something for poetry .

		It is a laudable desire , although its full justification depends upon the assumption that poetry is in need of coddling , and upon the further assumption that encouragement or incentive will be likely to increase its amount and improve its quality .

		As far as increasing its amount is concerned , we have grave doubts of the wisdom of any concerted propaganda .

		A large acquaintance with such nurslings of the muses as may be generically described as '' Badger poets '' has made us perhaps unduly pessimistic .

		Some hundreds of volumes of metrical exercises labelled poetry come under our observation every year , and we can only say of them with Othello , '' But yet the pity of it ! ''

		The combination of misguided taste with overweening conceit which alone can account for these vapid outpourings is one of the least lovely phenomena of human nature , and we endure its manifestations only because of the hope that springs eternal in the critic 's breast , the hope that this stagnant corruption may perchance blossom when we least expect it into some miraculous flower of song .

		The hope is sometimes fulfilled , as it was once with us in glorious measure when an uninviting volume came to our hand , eliciting at the first glance only some such reflection as '' another tiresome allegory , `` but upon closer examination revealing such wonders of beauty as we had not dared to dream our age and country capable of produc - ing .

		For that volume was `` The Masque of Judgment , '' and it made us understand how a lover of poetry must have felt in
1667	DATE	, discov - ering for himself `` Paradise Lost , '' or in
1820	DATE	, opening the pages of '' Prometheus Unbound . ''

		478 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Genius prepares such surprises for the world from time to time , and no age is too prosaic to admit of their possibility .

		We would not then say a word in deprecation of any earnest effort to provoke the poetic spirit into activity , although the fruits of such an effort are likely to prove for the most part innutritive and insipid .

		The only thing that gives us pause in the contemplation of such stimuli as are offered to poets in the way of prizes or of oppor - tunities for publicity , is the question whether any such encouragements are likely to evoke song in cases where silence would otherwise obtain , or whether their application has any potency to en - dow the singer with a higher rapture or a more authentically creative expression than would in any case be his . ''

		In far retreats of elemental mind Obscurely comes and goes The imperative breath of song , '' and inward compulsion rather than outward incentive seems to be the law of its being .

		The history of `` prize poetry , '' on the one hand , and the history of genius in its struggle with adver - sity , on the other , provide reasonable confirma - tion of this view .

		The effort `` to do something for poetry '' is signalized this year by the launching of two little magazines devoted to the interests of this art . ''

		The Poetry Review , '' of English origin , is '' devoted to the study and appreciation of modern poetry of all countries , '' and , beginning with next
January	DATE	, will change its periodicity , becoming a quarterly instead of a monthly , thus coming into comparison with our own quarterly '' Poet-Lore , '' which has maintained its noble cause for many years .

		It will also open in
London	LOCATION	a bookshop for the sale of poetry , in which '' purchases will be strictly optional . ''

		The other new venture is Miss
Harriet Monroe	PERSON	's '' Poetry , '' the delightful little monthly published in
Chicago	LOCATION	, to which we have previously called attention .

		Being generously subsidized , this periodical is assured of at least five years in which to further its aims , and we trust that the end of that term will find it standing securely on its own feet .

		If it does not succeed in evok - ing anything new and strange , it will at least have served to bring together in convenient form a considerable quantity of the best current verse .

		Speaking of the fear expressed in some quarters that it '' may become a house of refuge for minor poets , '' Miss
Monroe	PERSON	makes some pointed remarks : '' Paragraphers have done their worst for the minor poet , while they have allowed the minor painter , sculptor , actor worst of all , architect to go scot-free .

		The world which laughs at the experimenter in verse walks negligently through our streets , and goes seriously , even reverently , to the annual exhibi - tions in our cities , examining hundreds of pic - tures and statues without expecting even the prize-winners to be masterpieces . ''

		The point is well taken , although we find the term '' minor '' a convenient one for the expression of a fact , and would rather see its use extended to the other arts than tabooed when speaking of poetry .

		Of course , no artist quite relishes having his work dubbed with this adjective , but the poet who resents being classified as `` minor '' may be glad that he is called nothing worse .

		When Mr.
Slason Thompson	PERSON	some years ago published an anthology , which he styled '' The Humbler Poets , '' he discovered that several of the men whom he had honored by inclusion nursed a decided grievance , and he was the recipient of letters from them indignantly denying that they were `` humble . ''

		In projecting what he calls '' The Lyric Year , '' Mr.
Mitchell Kennerley	PERSON	, a
New York	LOCATION	publisher , has undertaken an extremely interesting experi - ment in poetical encouragement .

		The volume for
1912	DATE	, now published , is thus introduced by the editor : '' If the usual volume of verse by a single author may be termed a one man 's show , if poems appearing in the magazines may be compared to paintings handled by dealers , if time-honored anthologies may be called poet - ical museums , ' The Lyric Year ' aspires to the position of an Annual Exhibition or Salon of American poetry , for it presents a selection from one year 's work of a hundred American poets . ''

		Since this publication was widely heralded , and since with the announcement went an offer of three prizes aggregating one thousand dollars , we are not surprised to be informed that nearly two thousand poets submitted works to the jury , and that no less than ten thousand poems were entered in the competition .

		The result as now published thus represents the winnowing away of ninety-nine per cent of chaff , each of the poems printed being but one out of a hundred of those submitted .

		A peculiarly gratifying feature of this exhibit is found in the fact that it includes so many of our best-known names .

		It is to be feared that all our living poets -LRB- now that
Moody	ORGANIZATION	is no more -RRB- are `` minor , '' but there are degrees of minority , and if we may venture to suggest such a thing as `` an emerged tenth / ' we should perhaps find it in the following list of those here represented : Mr.
Carman	PERSON	, Mr.
Cawein	PERSON	, Mr.
Markham	PERSON	, Mr.
Scollard	PERSON	, Mr.
Torrence	PERSON	, Mr.
Woodberry	PERSON	, Mrs.
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 479
Dargan	PERSON	, Mrs.
Dorr	PERSON	,
Miss Peabody	LOCATION	, and
Miss Thomas	LOCATION	.

		In making this invidious selection , we mean to intimate merely that these ten have per - haps more firmly-established reputations than the remaining ninety , and not that their work is necessarily finer than that of many among the others .

		And nothing about the whole matter is more striking than the fact that the three prize awards do not go where we would have thought it a priori probable that they would go , but instead to three men whose names are absolutely unknown to the general reading public .

		And yet , comparing with the others these prize poems of Mr.
Orrick Johns	PERSON	, Mr.
Thomas Augustine Daly	PERSON	, and Mr.
George Sterling	PERSON	, we can not fairly say that the distinction awarded them is unde - served .

		If they are not clearly superior to all the others , we should hesitate to say that any of the others overtopped them .

		And it is , on the whole , extremely gratifying that three unknown men should emerge to head the list in such a competition as this .

		Mr.
Orrick Johns	PERSON	, whose poem is thus adjudged the best of the ten thou - sand submitted , is a youth of twenty-five ; he has now become a marked man , and has only to fulfil the promise of this poem to become a famous one .

		In one matter only , we are inclined to say a word of adverse criticism concerning this anthology .

		When the editor confesses that in his selection he '' has endeavored to give prefer - ence to poems fired with the
Time	ORGANIZATION	spirit and marked by some special distinction , rather than mere technical performances , '' we think that he has gone astray .

		We should like , did space permit , to enlarge upon this thesis , but will be content with referring instead to Mr.
Hermann Hagedorn	PERSON	's `` Note on Contemporary Poetry '' in `` The North American Review '' for
December	DATE	, which convincingly refutes the critical heresy above confessed .

		As this writer justly says : '' A poet need not limit himself to-day , any more than in the time of Homer , to the stories and the background of his own age , to speak to it truths which the man in the street will admit are vital , real .

		Unless he be a rare anachronism , he will express his age unconsciously , even though he sing of the Seven Buried Cities of
Cibola	LOCATION	. ''

		Quoting from a Japanese critic who says that '' American poets bother too much with social reform and what not , '' Mr.
Hagedorn	PERSON	further observes that '' social reform is matter for sociology or any other science that deals with the passing manifestations of life , not for poetry ... For art , at its best , is not an escape from life nor a criticism of life , but an expansion of life into regions which ordinary human experience can not otherwise reach . ''

		This argument , coupled with the editor 's con - fession , makes us feel a vague suspicion that among the poems rejected under the false canon there may have been some that would have raised the average excellence of '' The Lyric Year , '' high as that average now is .

		In any such selection , Art , rather than the expression of the Zeitgeist , should be looked to for the decisive test .

		CASUAL COMMENT .

		NOISE AND THE BOOK-TRADE AND SOME OTHER THINGS are interrelated in a curious manner .


Paris	LOCATION	, with its steam trams , its gigantic , iron-tired , steam motor-trucks , and its boisterous fetes foraines , or , freely translated ,
Coney Islands	LOCATION	on wheels not to speak of a hundred other noise - producers has achieved the unenviable fame of being the least quiet city in the world , or , which is the same thing , worse than
New York	LOCATION	for quantity and quality and variety of din .

		So horrid is the uproar that one can no longer saunter with any pleasure up and down the boulevards , or along the quays where the book - booths used to invite to blissful quarter-hour of browsing among rare early editions or other succu - lent herbage of the literary sort .

		Hence the book - dealers and others are organizing a chapter in the vigorous young society of the
Friends of Silence	ORGANIZATION	.

		Book-writing , no less than book-reading and book - selling , is interfered with by noise , and authors , especially if they be city-dwellers , should be among the first and the most active of the members in this anti-racket confederation .

		They can not all afford the luxury of a sound-proof study , h la
Carlyle	LOCATION	, even if sound-proof studies were really sound-proof , which , unless they are suspended in vacua , they can not be .

		Mr.
Henry Wellington Wack	PERSON	, of the
New York	LOCATION	Bar , at a recent meeting of the Psycho - logical Section of the Medico-Legal Society , made a vigorous remonstrance against unnecessary noises in cities , pointing out the nervous and other disor - ders caused thereby , and the waste of energy , as well as of health and comfort , attributable thereto .

		The nervous belt of the
United States	LOCATION	he makes to extend in width from
Boston	LOCATION	on the north to
Washington	LOCATION	on the south , and thence across the continent ; and `` this is the region of noise , neuras - thenia , hysteria , brain-storms , mythomania , nerve - specialists , money madness , and the asbestos con - science . ''

		Eliminate avoidable noises , and the life of the average city-dweller would be prolonged seven years as the life-insurance actuaries will tell you . ''

		But the average resident of large cities has had his auditory nerves so coarsened , and has trained his voice so harshly , that he is more con - scious of the absence than the presence of noise .

		In other words , he does not feel normal unless the varied stimuli of noise are at play upon his senses .

		Deprive him of this noise-cocktail and he becomes somnolent ; thinks he is dying . ''

		Thus Mr.
Wack	PERSON	.

		480 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Our urban public libraries are not the least sufferers from street noises ; their reading-rooms , especially in
summer	DATE	when the windows are open , have more of pandemonium about them than the `` still air of delightful studies . ''

		... Or THOSE WHO KNOW NOT THE PUBLIC LIBBABT the number is larger than librarians like to admit even to themselves .

		But the proportion of these non - users to the users of this beneficent institution is cer - tainly diminishing , in our own country at least .

		The latest report of the
Springfield	LOCATION	-LRB-
Mass.	LOCATION	-RRB- City Library tells us that '' the whole number of cardholders en - rolled in the present series , which began
December 15 , 1908	DATE	, is 30,665 .

		This figure does not include the many persons served by the deposit system , of whom no statistics are available . ''

		Springfield 's pop - ulation , as given by the census of
1910	DATE	, is 88,926 .

		Thus it seems to be safe to conclude that at least one - third of the inhabitants of that typical
New England	LOCATION	city are library-users .

		In
Boston	LOCATION	, whose census fig - ures for population are 670,585 , and whose regis - tration figures in the year following that census were 86,913 , the library-users appear to number less than thirteen per cent of the inhabitants .

		In the
Balti	LOCATION	- more '' Sun '' there has just come to our notice a letter to the editor deploring the small ness of the number of persons registered as book-borrowers at the
Enoch Pratt Free Library	ORGANIZATION	, which is virtually the public library of the city .

		Lament is made that '' only about five per cent '' of the population are thus registered .

		Of course there are in
Baltimore	LOCATION	other beside public libraries that serve many stu - dents and readers , as there are in
Boston	LOCATION	and
Springfield	LOCATION	, and statistics of all sorts are notoriously deceptive ; but the official announcement of such an encouraging state of things as is met with in the
Springfield Report	LOCATION	is always pleasant to read .

		A MEMORABLE FRIENDSHIP was that between
Lowell	PERSON	and
Charles Eliot Norton	PERSON	.

		Many of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's letters to
Norton	PERSON	to `` Ciarli '' as he playfully called him in Italian spelling are to be found in the two rich volumes of
Lowell	ORGANIZATION	's correspondence .

		Some of those written by
Norton	PERSON	in reply are now made public in the record of the '' Letters of Friendship '' series appearing in `` The
Atlantic	LOCATION	Monthly '' and composed of selections from
Norton	ORGANIZATION	's letters to those with whom he was most intimate .

		Using at first the more formal opening , '' My dear
Lowell	PERSON	, ''
Norton	PERSON	soon changed this to `` My dear James '' and then '' My dearest
James	PERSON	, '' becoming warmly affectionate and receiving no lesser warmth in return .

		In a letter of
December , 1861	DATE	, from
New York	LOCATION	we note the following : `` How good the new number of the
Atlantic	LOCATION	is !

		I have read and reread your letters in it , always with a fuller sense of the overflowing humor , wit , and cleverness of them .

		You are as young , my boy , as you were in the old time . ''

		And in one written soon after
Lowell	PERSON	's appointment as Minister to
England	LOCATION	, the following is significant : `` It is an immense mistake , it seems to me , to think it necessary to live at a great expense as Ambassador .

		You can live with dignity and propriety in
London	LOCATION	on the Minister 's salary , and be just as much liked as if you spent double , and more respected .

		I think Motley never gained by his lavishness , but on the contrary exposed himself to criticism that was not unfounded . ''

		At the time of the appearance of `` Leaves of Grass ''
Norton	PERSON	speaks in praise of it , and adds : `` It is a book which has excited Emer - son 's enthusiasm .

		He has written a letter to this ` one of the roughs ' which I have seen , expressing the warmest admiration and encouragement .

		It is no wonder he likes it , for
Walt Whitman	PERSON	has read the Dial and Mature , and combines the character - istics of a
Concord	LOCATION	philosopher with those of a
New York	LOCATION	fireman . ''

		For other good things in this series of letters the reader will be glad to consult the De - cember `` Atlantic . ''

		... A PUBLISHER OF THE OLD SCHOOL has passed away in the recent death of Mr.
Frank Hall Scott	PERSON	, who had enjoyed four decades of activity in the publishing business in
New York	LOCATION	, almost half of that time being president of the
Century Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		`` Enjoyed '' is here used advisedly , Mr.
Scott	PERSON	's discharge of his duties having nothing of the perfunctory about it .

		Filled with a sense of the publisher 's responsibility to the public , he seems to have regarded the business of issuing books as a sort of educational crusade .

		What there was in it , pecuniarily , for him , appears to have been his last thought .

		Toward authors , espe - cially young and struggling authors , he showed a friendly bearing and at times a most unprofessional tenderness of heart .

		An obituary notice of him tells of his final acceptance of an already declined manu - script .

		The writer was a woman .

		Calling upon Mr.
Scott	PERSON	after that gentleman had endeavored to make her aware that her literary offering was not desired , she pleaded her cause so well that when the publisher came out from the interview he bore her manuscript in his hand and told his associate , `` I 've had to take it . ''

		`` Had to ? ''

		queried the other .

		`` Why , how did you come to do that ? '' ''

		She wept so .

		What is more , she used up her own handkerchief and had to borrow mine to weep in .

		I could n't stand that .

		I guess we can sell a few copies . ''

		Mr.
Scott	PERSON	was a Hoosier by birth , a graduate of the
Pennsylvania Military Academy	ORGANIZATION	, a holder of the honorary degree of L.H. D. from
Marietta College	ORGANIZATION	, a director of the
American Publishers ' Association	ORGANIZATION	, and was sixty-four years old at the time of his death .

		... THE POSSIBLE SOLUTION OF A LINGUISTIC MYS - TERY is presented in the new theory propounded by Professor
Jules Martha	PERSON	of the Sorbonne as to the character of the ancient Etruscan language , that baffling problem of philology that has puzzled scholars for many a century .

		It appears that he has traced certain resemblances , both in vocabulary and in syntax and inflections , between the tongues of the so-called agglutinative group of languages which includes the speech of the
Finn	ORGANIZATION	, of the Lap ,
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAJL 481 and of the Hungarian and the hitherto untranslat - able language of the prehistoric dweller in
Tuscany	LOCATION	.

		Following this scent , he is reported to have de - ciphered the meaning of a number of Etruscan inscriptions , among them being certain contracts for the sale of land and a prayer to the god of healing ; and he has also succeeded in interpreting the least illegible of the writings on the wrappings of the cele - brated mummy in the museum at Agram in
Croatia	LOCATION	.

		This mummy is of the time of the Ptolemies , but not Egyptian in its wrappings and inscriptions ; and the latter are found by Professor
Martha	PERSON	to be a ritual for the use of sailors .

		If the key to Etruscan inscriptions has thus really been found , it will be a discovery of great importance ; and if at the same time light is thrown on the anomalous group of modern languages to which the Etruscan is said to bear a striking resemblance , the possible outcome of it all will be doubly interesting .

		THE CUMULATIVE BATE OF A LIBRARY 'S GROWTH in these days when the multiplication of books goes on in something like geometrical progression , is almost enough to take one 's breath away .

		In a pamphlet bearing the title , `` University of
Michigan Library	ORGANIZATION	, 1905-1912 .

		A Brief Review by the Librarian , '' a striking instance of rapid library growth is noted .

		`` More books , '' writes Mr.
Koch	PERSON	, `` have been added to the
University Library	ORGANIZATION	during the seven years of my librarianship than in the first sixty years of the history of the
University	ORGANIZATION	.

		Or , to put it another way , if the present growth of the
Library	ORGANIZATION	continues , it will , by
December 1914	DATE	, be double in size what it was when I came to the Library in
1904	DATE	. ''

		With increase in size comes also a more than proportional increase in expense , because , for example , `` it costs more to put a book into a large library than in -LSB- to -RSB- a small one , because more and higher grade labor is required to find whether the book is not already in or ordered for the library .

		It costs more to classify a book in a large library than in a small one ; more time and more skill are required to correctly place a new book in a collection where there are many books in the same field than where there is but a handful of books on the subject . ''

		And so with cataloguing and labelling and shelving ; so also with keeping in good order and repair , and with meeting the appli - cant 's demand for any specified book , the increased size of the collection necessarily causing more steps , more pages , perhaps a greater number of desk attend - ants .

		The small library , therefore , has certain reasons for thankfulness of which it is not always conscious , but to which it will perhaps have its eyes opened in that near future when it shall have become a large library .

		... THE BOOK-SWINDLER IN THE TOILS of the govern - ment drag-net is a sight to rejoice gods and men .

		Twelve such swindlers of the ever-gullible newly - rich book-buyer have been indicted on the charge of unlawful use of the mails in advertising and selling so-called '' de-luxe '' editions that have in reality about the value of so much tinsel ; and the drag-net is still out .

		This praiseworthy action of the public authorities will perhaps serve , among other things , to make more than one owner of what he considers an extraordinarily valuable library open his eyes to the comparative worthlessness of the greater part of his collection .

		Better had it been for that man if he had spent in hiring the services of a competent librarian a quarter part of the wealth he has thrown away on showy bindings and cheap illustrations ; then the other three-quarters might have secured him a library really worth owning .

		The magnificent collection of Mr.
J. Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	, for instance , splendidly housed and properly cared for , contains not a single example of the book-fakir 's unholy art ; for his librarian ,
Miss Belle Greene	PERSON	, is reputed one of the most expert members of her profession , and has had a larger experience in the buying of literary rarities than anyone you will be likely to meet in a long day 's journey .

		Nor is Mr.
Morgan	PERSON	himself by any means a helpless innocent in the hands of the persuasive and plausible book swindler .

		It is safe to say that he knows almost as much , in a large and general way , about rare books as he does about railroads .

		... THE PHILIPPINE LIBRARY has begun issuing a monthly `` Bulletin , '' the first number containing a brief prospectus and a copy of the '' Law Creating the Philippine Library , '' with a classified list of recent additions to the library .

		It was three and one-half years ago that all libraries belonging to the
Insular Government	ORGANIZATION	were by legislative enactment consolidated into the `` Philippines Library '' under a managing board consisting of the secretaries of Public Instruction , the
Interior	ORGANIZATION	, and
Finance and Justice	ORGANIZATION	, with two other members appointed annually by the Governor-General .

		After many vicissitudes the library has secured good quarters in the old
Army	ORGANIZATION	and
Navy Club	ORGANIZATION	building , which will hence - forth be known as the Library building ; and the entire collection of books under its control , but not all in this one building , numbers more than one hun - dred thousand volumes .

		It is to be noted , with some regret , that '' a fee of five pesos per annum or fifty centavos per month is charged for the privilege of drawing books from the
Circulating Division	ORGANIZATION	-LRB-
American Circulating	ORGANIZATION	library -RRB- . ''

		The other priv - ileges of the library are free .

		Mr.
James A. Robertson	PERSON	is librarian ,
Miss Syrena	LOCATION	McKee chief cataloguer ,
Miss Bessie A. Dwyer	PERSON	chief of the circu - lating division , and
Sefior Manuel Artigas	PERSON	y Cuerva curator of the ''
Filipiniana Division	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		PSEUDO-LATIN , SPOKEN AND WRITTEN , enlivens the monotony of existence by movyig to innocent mirth the person sufficiently conversant with his '' Harkness '' or his ``
Allen	PERSON	and
Greenough	PERSON	'' to know something about declensions and conjugations .

		A
New York	LOCATION	newspaper prints a large and imposing illustrated advertisement of a limited express train between two principal cities , '' bringing these great 482 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, metropoli together in daily intercourse . ''

		This is even worse than the unfortunate attempt of a recent writer of repute to pluralize status by using the form stati .

		The promoter of a certain industrial enter - prise wrote us some time ago offering to send a number of the company 's prospecti for distribution .

		And , finally , to complete this list of irregular plurals in i , the toastmaster at a college alumni dinner not long since allowed himself to refer to the curriculi of our higher institutions of learning .

		Will anj ` one now question the value of a classical education when it enables the proud possessor of it not only to enjoy a laugh at such grammatical slips as the foregoing , but also , in an unguarded moment , as with the college-bred toastmaster above named , to give cause for mirth in others ?

		The Latinist has joys undreamt of by ignorami .

		A NOTEWORTHY GIFT TO THE LIBRARY OF GRESS has placed it under great obligation to Mr.
J. Pierpont Morgan	PERSON	.

		He has presented it with a volume containing what is the desire of all Ameri - can autograph-collectors and the despair of most of them , namely , a complete set of the `` Signers . ''

		With an autograph letter preceding the signature in most instances , this collection of the fifty-six historic names affixed to the Declaration of Independence , each in the handwriting of the one to whom it belonged , is a treasure well worth preserving in the national library , which has hitherto , with shame be it confessed , been lacking in any such evidence of patriotic pride .

		It was probably because Mr.
Mor	PERSON	- gan had learned this fact , with '' chagrin and regret , '' as he says , that he took steps to supply the deficiency .

		The early damage to the Declaration itself , from unskilful handling in preparing a facsimile of the instrument , renders all the more important this pre - servation of a set of the signers ' autographs on the government 's part .

		COMMUNICA TIONS .

		`` EXTERNALISM '' IN OUR COLLEGES .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		There are three good reasons why it is unnecessary for me to reply to the communication of '' An American Professor '' in your issue of
December 1	DATE	.

		His protest is against certain positions of your editorial rather than of my article -LRB- which I can not be certain that he has read -RRB- ; the points of issue do not depend upon state - ments or views for which I am responsible , though I may in a measure agree with them ; the points of issue lie somewhat apart from the central theme of my dis - cussion .

		Yet I can not expect that those interested in the matter will take the pains to draw these distinctions .

		The '' American Professor , '' whose lot seems to have fallen in pleasant places , sets forth that his own inter - ests and pursuits have not been seriously affected by the prevalent mode of university administration .

		To the casual reader this personal statement might give the erroneous impression that such an instance is ex - ceptional .

		It reminds one of a pre-election anecdote : the young daughter of the house , after listening to the political views of the guests at her father 's table , remarked to the solitary member of the group : '' I know some one else who is going to vote for
Taft	LOCATION	. ''

		My own statement of the '' American Professor 's '' case is much stronger than his .

		I note : '' Critically temperate state - ments admit the enormous power which he -LSB- the president -RSB- wields to mitigate or to aggravate the evils of the sys - tem . ''

		I have made it plain that there are many insti - tutions which suifer little fr , om these evils because of the spirit of their administration .

		There are doubtless hundreds of professors whose activities have not suf - fered from the system ; and in the judgment of a great majority of the professors who answered Professor
Cattell	PERSON	's inquiries , there are infinitely more whose careers have been unfortunately affected , and who are strongly opposed to the present form of government .

		My own opinion is thus expressed : `` The successes achieved under the present system are in my judgment partly due to the compensations that lie in every sys - tem , however unsuitable , yet more largely to the miti - gations exercised under considerations foreign to its temper , more plainly to violations of its provisions , to concessions and forbearance . ''

		If the '' American Professor '' believes that the privileges which he en - joys would be endangered under the system of larger corporate control by the Faculties , his arguments upon which that belief is founded are entitled to consider - ation .

		I have made it plain that in all such discus - sions it is the average situation , not the best , that is to be considered ; and it is the trend favored and the temptations offered -LRB- not the result of departure from that trend and the resistance of temptation -RRB- that must decide as to the worthiness of one or another form of government . ''

		The unwise authority and false responsibility of the presidential office invites the in - cumbent to attempt impossible tasks ; invites him to adopt irrelevant standards , '' etc. .

		As to the actual situation , I prefer to accept the cumulative opinion which Professor
Cattell	PERSON	has assembled ; as similarly in my statements I cited the selected opinions of those who had given careful attention to the subject in an aspect broader than the personal one .

		This consensus of opinion goes far enough to be most gratifying .

		The scores of complimentary letters which I have received since my article appeared , I accept as expres - sions of agreement with the importance of the position which I set forth .

		The second issue relates to the undesirable effects upon the student body of some of the forces that main - tain the present system .

		In discussing this point , one of several and not central , but selected because of its popular interest , I took care to indicate that I was presenting the summary of the judgments of others and not my own .

		I cited some witnesses and reflected as best I could the general impression of a large number of papers which I had read .

		To indicate the bearing of these upon my argument , I said : `` Let me concede at once that some of the above trends are within limits legitimate and helpful , and again that they are not wholly or predominantly due to the ad - ministrative influence . ''

		And again : `` Doubtless the causes of the situation so variously complained of , like the cause of the high rate of living , are both deep and wide . ''

		The '' American Professor '' suggests that some institutions deserving to be placed on the blacklist be named , and that I should name them .

		I fail to see either the pertinence or the profit of the suggestion .

		1912 . -RSB-

		483 Such a body as the ''
Carnegie Foundation	ORGANIZATION	for the Ad - vancement of Teaching '' might favorably undertake such an investigation and publish reports -LRB- as has been done in regard to Medical Schools -RRB- that would be helpful if received in the proper spirit , of which there is at present no guarantee .

		It may be that if the '' American Professor '' wrote to some of the more discerning stu - dents of tendencies in the
American College	ORGANIZATION	, he would obtain the names of institutions in which one set or another of the deplored tendencies was particularly marked .

		Taking the description as a composite photo - graph so carefully blended that no individual features are unpleasantly present , I have no difficulty in recog - nizing the appropriateness of the whole to many an insti - tution , though it is not a portrait of anyone .

		Nor have I any intention of adding to the woes of an educational reformer by suggesting even in confidence which one of the sitters for the composite the portrait most favors .

		If the '' American Professor '' will without prejudice write the names of a score of American colleges on slips of paper , and draw a few of these at random -LRB- unless
Minerva	LOCATION	in disapproval of the method protects the issue -RRB- , he will know the names of a few of the institutions to which some of the criticisms moderately apply .

		Even as I write , my attention is arrested by this wholly in - cidental sentence in an address by President
Jordan	PERSON	-LRB- '' Science , ''
December 6	DATE	-RRB- : '' It -LSB- the private institution -RSB- is above all temptation to grant university titles or degrees to the products of four years of frivolity , dis - sipation and sham . ''

		Such sentences by their very casual nature indicate how widespread this charge has become .

		I regret that issues of this type require such large draughts upon personal judgment ; but this is inevitable .

		It is not necessary that they should be rendered yet more uncertain by the undue emphasis of individual experience .

		THE PARALYSIS OF CULTURE .

		-LRB- To the Editor of THE DIAL . -RRB-

		After reading your leading editorial of
November 16	DATE	, on '' Our Spiritual Health , `` and also Dr.
Andre	PERSON	ws 's article in the '' International Journal of Ethics '' on which your editorial is based , may one reader at least testify to the faith that is still in him ?

		That faith is very much shaken upon occasion by contact with certain people ; but those people are neither the readers of Nietzsche nor the Socialists , neither of whom Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	gives any sign that he understands even in the most external and remote way .

		In the first place the doctrine of naturalism is practically dead , and
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	heralded as the expon - ent of its '' logical outcome '' by Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	had a good deal to do with destroying it .

		As against the '' prudential regulation '' theory of morals which Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	mentions the utilitarian moral sanctions , that is to say ,
Nietzsche	ORGANIZATION	thundered valiantly .

		After read - ing the English utilitarians , he impatiently exclaims : `` Man does not seek after happiness ; only an English - man seeks after his happiness .

		I seek not after my happiness , I seek after my work . ''

		And as for Socialism , is it not , in spite of its unfortu - nate but non-essential and obsolescent system of dogma , one of the cultural agencies of the present day ?

		Is it not , indeed , the largest movement against that very spirit which your commentator says '' can contemplate the social and political issues of our time ... with hardly any other emotion than curiosity '' ?

		The spirit of personal culture is strong within the Socialist party ranks .

		Among the men and women there assembled you may not find interest in the particular classical authors who bound `` culture '' for Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	, but you may find interest in contemporary art , literature , and philosophy , both European and American ; and often , too , an appre - ciative valuing of the human side of Greek literature .

		In reality the sinners against whom Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	should thunder are neither the materialists -LRB- if there are any of them left to bow before his wrath -RRB- , nor the Social - ists , both of whom are obviously seeking '' culture '' and who are obviously not `` indifferentists '' for if they were , how did they arrive at their present unpopular and thought-requiring positions ?

		No , the people against whom Dr.
Andrews	PERSON	's fulminations should have been directed are the smug dwellers in his own camp the '' cultured '' people and the '' religious '' people .

		Not the Socialists , but the orthodox churches to-day are afraid of this attitude which we are now discussing under the hackneyed term of culture .

		Let any reader attend first a Christian Endeavor meeting or any social gather - ing of church folk , and then go to a club meeting in any social settlement or to any Socialist assembly , and he will at once detect the difference of intellectual temper between the two groups .

		And the nominally `` cultured '' people simply justify the use of the foregoing qualification when they tell us that their culture is incompatible with the life of the time even when that life is expressed , perhaps crudely , in Socialism .

		As against such an idea , true culture says and the saying shall here be through the voice of Pro- fessor
J. W. Mackail	PERSON	of Oxford that the '' socialist '' motive must dominate the art and poetry of the future .

		In the Introduction to his '' Lectures on Poetry '' Mr.
Mackail	PERSON	says : `` But in the fully socialized common - wealth which , as a dream or vision , mankind begins to have before their eyes , there may be a future for poetry , larger , richer , more triumphant , than its greatest achieve - ments in the past have reached .

		Poetry will become the nobler interpretation of an ampler life .

		That vision is in the future .

		But to some at least , here and now , it is a vision and no dream . ''

		Unless culture means vision , unless it means a sure prophylaxis against the attitude of scolding , while the scolder 's eyes are closed , then it is not the genuine attitude but a mere pedantic pose .

		484 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	,
WILLIAM VAUGHN	PERSON	MOODY .

		* The two handsome volumes in which the com - plete creative work of
William Vaughn Moody	ORGANIZATION	has just been published in definitive form de - serve a heartier welcome than any other publi - cation of the year .

		One of them contains the two prose plays , '' The Great Divide '' and '' The Faith Healer '' ; the other contains the trilogy '' The Fire-Bringer , '' '' The Masque of Judg - ment , '' and a fragment of '' The Death of Eve '' the `` Poems '' hitherto published , a consider - able number of later pieces which now for the first time see the light , and a beautifully written memoir of the poet , written by his friend , Pro- fessor
John M. Manly	PERSON	.

		Each volume has a portrait frontispiece .

		We have spoken of these volumes as containing all of
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's creative work , but this statement requires qualification .

		Everything that
Moody	ORGANIZATION	wrote had the creative quality , and for a full understanding of his genius one must not neglect to take into account his scattered writings in prose , chief among them being the introductions to his editions of
Milton	PERSON	and of '' The Pilgrim 's Progress , '' and the school `` History of English Literature '' which he wrote in collaboration with Professor
Lovett	PERSON	.

		It is pleasant to be informed that another avenue of access to his personality will presently be opened by the publication of a selection from his correspondence .

		Nevertheless , the main thing to be empha - sized about
Moody	ORGANIZATION	is that he was a poet by the grace of God , and such a poet as had not been raised up before him in
America	LOCATION	or even in the English-speaking world since the eclipse of the great line of the older singers .

		The
first decade of the twentieth century	DATE	was the period during which his powers came to fruition , and within which practically all of his work was done .

		He seems , then , to be the one authentic '' maker '' that our young century has given to the world , achieving a height that none of his contemporary fellows-craftsmen in the poetic art , either in
England	LOCATION	or
America	LOCATION	, could attain .

		This being the case , it is upon the poems that our attention should be mainly fixed , for the two prose plays , fine as they are , seem almost negligible in the comparison .

		They show their author as a subtle revealer of human nature and as an expert in psychological dramaturgy , but * THE POEMS AND PLAYS OF

		they give slight evidence of his deeper inspira - tion or of the magnificence of his lyrical gift .

		Those who seek to discover in the circum - stances of his nurture and environment the secret of his power will be completely baffled .

		Born in
1869	DATE	in
Indiana	LOCATION	the commonwealth which has been styled , perhaps somewhat unkindly , the
Boeotia of America	LOCATION	` he was one of the seven children of a steamboat captain .

		There were English , French , and German strains in his blood , happily blended , as the event proved .

		He worked for his education , putting himself through school , academy , and college by means of teaching .

		He took a master 's degree at Har - vard , and a year later joined the staff of the
University of Chicago	ORGANIZATION	, where he taught English for seven years .

		There is nothing in all this which might not be paralleled in the life-histories of thousands of other boys ; if we are to look at all for external influences in the shaping of his genius , we shall find them rather in the friends with whom he chiefly had intercourse , and in the scenes to which he was led by the Wanderlust .

		Walking in the
Black Forest	ORGANIZATION	, bicycling over the Italian mountains , climbing the
Dolomites	LOCATION	, rid - ing through the
Peloponnesus	LOCATION	, '' roughing it '' in the
Colorado	LOCATION	mountains and the
Arizona	LOCATION	desert , visiting the countries of the Spaniard and the Moor these were the recreations of such ad - venturous days as were vouchsafed him during the years in which his was the common lot of working for a living .

		He once wrote : `` I started in to-day on another quarter 's work at the shop with vacation and restored consciousness three months away . ''

		This attitude toward the ap - pointed daily task when that task is the noble one of teaching does not , as a rule , deserve approval .

		But we can hardly blame a man like
Moody	ORGANIZATION	for assuming it , knowing , as we do , his power to become a teacher in a still finer and broader sense , and realizing how such a spirit as his must chafe under any form of routine .

		The '' restored consciousness '' which vacation gave him was a consciousness of the release of faculty which meant for him no hours of idle - ness , but rather a resumption of sovereignty by the creative impulse , urging to days of the most strenuous spiritual endeavor .

		The stupendous task which
Moody	ORGANIZATION	set himself in the trilogy is the highest which poetry has ever attempted .

		It is the task of 2Eschylus and
Dante	PERSON	and
Milton	PERSON	, the task of Goethe in his `` Faust '' and of
Shelley	PERSON	in his `` Prometheus Unbound . ''

		It is
Milton	LOCATION	's attempt to `` justify the ways of God to man '' coupled with the at - tempt of the later poets to justify the ways of
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 485 man to God .

		It was the
Great Synthesis	ORGANIZATION	, under - taken by the emancipated modern spirit , the fusing of God and his world into a monistic scheme .

		`` This thought , '' says Mr.
Manly	PERSON	, `` is set forth in the first member , ' The Fire-Bringer , ' through the reaction on the human race of the effort of Prometheus to make man independent of God ; in the second member , ' The Masque of Judgment , ' through a declaration of the conse - quences to God himself that would inevitably follow his decree for the destruction of mankind ; in the third member , ` The Death of Eve , ' it was intended to set forth the impossibility of separa - tion , the complete unity of the Creator and his Creation . ''

		What has been lost to the world through the tragic fact of the poet 's death before he had put the last window in his Aladdin 's palace may be but faintly surmised .

		Some hints of his intention were given to his intimates , enabling Mr.
Manly	PERSON	to prepare a statement from which we quote .

		Eve , having survived ages of years , '' has undergone a new spiritual awakening , and with clearing vision sees that her sin need not have been the final , fatal thing it seemed ; that God 's creatures live by and within his being and can not be estranged or divided from him .

		Seeing this dimly , she is under the compulsion of a great need to return to the place where her defiant thought had originated , and there declare her new vision of life .

		... In the third act there was to be a song by Eve , the burden of which would be the inseparableness of God and man , during which , as she rises to a clearer and gentler view of the spiritual life , she gently passes from the vision of her beholders . ''

		These suggestions are precious enough , but they only make more poignant our sense of loss .

		We confess that we would rather have had the poem completed than '' the story of Cambuscan bold , '' or the tragedy of the Greek Gotterdammerung which was left half - told in the `` Hyperion '' of Keats .


Moody	ORGANIZATION	's mastery of his material was such as only the greatest artists can exhibit .

		In the trilogy , he shows himself to be equally familiar with the Greek ,
Hebraic	ORGANIZATION	, and Christian myths , to have seized upon their inner significance , and to have saturated his soul with their beauty .

		And when it comes to that supreme test of the poet , the dramatic lyric , what music is at his command !

		Listen to the Song of the Redeemed Spirits : '' In the wilds of life astray , Held far from our delight , Following the cloud by day And the fire by night , Came we a desert way .

		O Lord , with apples feed us , With flagons stay !

		By Thy still waters lead us ! ''

		There is no conceivable process of human thought , susceptible of analysis and exposition , which could produce such a song as this .

		The inspiration of genius will alone account for it , as for the lyrics of
Shelley	LOCATION	, none of which is more beautiful .

		And the same thing may be said of the Songs of Pandora : '' Along the earth and up the sky The
Fowler	PERSON	spreads his net , '' and '' Of wounds and sore defeat I made my battle stay , '' and '' Because one creature of his breath Sang loud into the face of death , '' and , most wonderful of all , '' I stood within the heart of God ; It seemed a place that I had known . ''

		Lyric utterance in English has never achieved higher and purer strains than these .

		We may say of them , as
Symonds	PERSON	says of the lyrics in '' Prometheus Unbound , '' that they '' may be reckoned the touch-stone of a man 's capacity for understanding lyric poetry .

		The world in which the action is supposed to move , rings with spirit voices ; and what these spirits sing , is melody more purged of mortal dross than any other poet 's ear has caught , while listening to his own heart 's song , or to the rhythms of the world . ''

		And added to the wonder of it all is the fact that these songs sprang from the heart of one who was with us in the flesh but yester - day , whose eyes and voice and hand-clasp we remember .

		Half a century hence , it may be matter of boastful pride with young poets to have spoken with one of the college students who in their own youth saw
Moody	ORGANIZATION	plain .

		Nothing could be more superficial , or give more convincing evidence of spiritual blindness than the complaint that has been made against
Moody	ORGANIZATION	for his choice of major themes , speaking of him as of one standing apart from life be - cause he envisaged it through the medium of Greek and Christian myths .

		As Mr.
Manly	PERSON	justly says : ''
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's ideas , though familiar and indeed in many cases ancient themes of art , are made new and vital by subjection to his temperament and culture and by association with the elements of his spiritual life .

		In later years his main themes were social and economic injustice , patriotism , the heart of woman , and the relations of God and the soul , the meaning of human life .

		To the reconception of all these larger issues , he brought the richest intellectual 486 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, and emotional endowment possessed by any American * poet . ''

		The incredulous may retort to this last assertion , '' Du sprichst ein grosses Wort gelassen aus , '' but we believe that time will justify it , and , having once lache le mot in the quotation from Mr.
Manly	PERSON	, we hasten to give it our assent .

		Returning to the original argument , it may be said that even were we lacking all the pieces which are concerned with strictly modern themes , we should still find the modern note dominant in the trilogy , for all its ancient framework .

		As well say that Goethe 's ''
Faust	PERSON	, '' because of its mediaeval subject-matter , had no significance for the modern world , as say that
Moody	ORGANIZATION	's treatment of the Prometheus story was a mere exercise in outworn modes of expression .

		Rather than that , it throbs in every line with the heart-beats of twentieth century thought and feeling , and , so far from harking back to the past , ever opens vistas of the future to our gaze .

		The reasons which persuade us that
Moody	ORGANIZATION	has a place among the great poets may be briefly summarized .

		In the first place , he deals with the supreme issues of life and thought , with the destiny of man , and his deepest delvings into the mystery of the universe .

		He has the cul - tural equipment needed for such a task , and he transfuses its elements in the crucible of his genius until they emerge in new spiritual com - binations .

		His vision is his own , fresh and vivid , and his emotion has unfathomed depths .

		He takes old themes and images , and '' mingles them with unaccustomed but predestined asso - ciations . ''

		Coupled with his vision is a rich and fervid imagination which seems inexhaustible in its command of metaphor , and which invests his thought with new creative shapes .

		A beautiful illustration of this is taken from the great Ode , where he speaks of the common grave of
Robert Shaw	PERSON	and his negro soldiers . ''

		Now limb doth mingle with dissolved limb In nature 's busy old democracy , To flush the mountain laurel when she blows Sweet by the southern sea , And heart with crumbled heart climbs in the rose . ''

		One would have thought this old conceit was done with by the poets , yet
Moody	ORGANIZATION	has enshrined it in a form that owes nothing to his predeces - sors , and that gives it a new significance .

		He was preeminently a sane poet and a sincere one , without a touch of morbidity or preciosity .

		He loved words for their beauty , and had an almost unexampled power to pack rich meanings into a single epithet . ''

		What names the stars have ! ''

		he once said to us when
Antares	ORGANIZATION	was mentioned .

		A word was to him like a jewel , reflecting mani - fold hues from its facets , or like the note of a violin , with its gamut of attendant overtures , which he made us overhear .

		And with all this endowment he had the ear for music without which no great poetry is possible .

		Equally in his lovely lyrical measures , his free dithyrambic passages , and his stately blank verse , he had the sure sense of beauty that was the gift of the Greeks , and of
Milton	LOCATION	, and of
Shelley	LOCATION	.

		We think of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	and
Lanier	PERSON	as our American met - rists , and it is probably an understatement to say that
Moody	ORGANIZATION	was their peer .

		Now that he is made one with nature , now that our grief for the sufferings of his last tortured days has become softened by the ministry of time , we may take comfort from the thought that no poet could , with firmer assurance , face death with the `` Benediction '' of Baudelaire upon his lips : '' Soyez be ` ni , mon Dieu , qui donnez la souffrance Comme un divin remede a nos impurete 's , Et comme la meilleure et la plus pure essence Qui prepare les forts aux saintes volupte 's ! ''

		Je sais que vous gardez une place au Poe ` te Dans les rangs bienheureux des saintes Le ` gions , Et que vous 1 ` invitez a 1 ` e ` ternelle fete Des Trones , des Vertus , des Dominations . ''

		Who , if not the poet of '' The Masque of Judg - ment , '' to whom Thrones , Virtues , and
Domina	LOCATION	- tions were familiars , could with clearer title look forward to participation in God 's everlasting festival ?

		THE LAST DAYS OF THE CONFEDERACY .

		* The most original feature of General
Schaff	PERSON	's '' The Battle of the Wilderness , '' the thing that signally caught the attention of readers , was its application of epic methods to historic narrative .

		In the spiritual framework , the supernatural machinery of that book , the author might almost be credited with the creation of a new form in literature .

		Probably to a good many sincere minds this form was a stumbling-block .

		A dis - tinguished fellow-soldier said to him , '' When you get done with your poetry and get down to history you will write a valuable book . ''

		But he did write a valuable book , an unique book , one aglow with vision and emotion .

		Its peculiar characteristics , its creative artistry , are what make it stand out from the hundreds of nar - ratives and records of the Civil War , though * THE SUNSET OF THE CONFEDERACY .

		By

Boston	LOCATION	:
John W. Luce & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 487 many of these are also told by eye-witnesses and infused with personal emotion .

		In essaying again a study of a single phase of the Civil War , General
Schaff	PERSON	had two courses open to him .

		He might either bring back his new-made myths , his figures of fancy that brood above the scene and intermingle with the actors , or he might trust to plain narrative and the dignity of his theme .

		Very wisely , we think , he has chosen the latter method , except for a few brief and unimportant touches of the old imagination .

		It is very doubtful whether he could have captured again the thrilling effect of his first creations .

		A warmed-up mythology of visions and apparitions would have been fatal .

		Another thing missing in the new book is the story of personal adventure , which , threading the great , glittering , and gloomy scenes of march and battlefield , made them at once more con vine - ing and lent to them an air of romance and gay high spirits .

		We must count this a loss ; though in wholly suppressing himself in the presence of the last great struggle , the author has obeyed the dictates of the finest good taste .

		Everything else that was apparent in the earlier book is here : the vivid phrase ; the easy prose , pulsing as with the systole and diastole of the heart ; the nature-painting , insistent and persistent .

		Probably no historian has ever set his scene with greater definition of view , more elaboration of foliage and flowers .

		The bills , roads , streams , houses are as real and vivid as the hosts which struggle and fight among them .

		As far as theme is concerned the advantage is all with General
Schaff	PERSON	's latest book .

		The battle of the
Wilderness	ORGANIZATION	, that confused and indecisive struggle , that almost undecipherable scroll of events unrolled under the glooms of the tangled scrub-oak forest , has neither the unity nor the importance of the final , fatal week of the Con - federacy .

		Each book covers only the operations of a few days , but in `` The Sunset of the Con - federacy '' all the elements of great tragedy appear clear and distinct .

		The book opens with a scene out of a novel ,
Jefferson Davis	PERSON	and other dignitaries of the South at devotion in
St. Paul 's Church	ORGANIZATION	in Rich - mond , and the pompous sexton marching up and down the aisle to call each one of them sepa - rately out .

		The lines at
Petersburg	LOCATION	have been broken , and the end is near .

		Then follows the panic in the city , the departure of the trains with government officials , the withdrawal of the troops .

		Lee 's seven days ' retreat which ensues is told with amazing minuteness and clearness .

		It is not too much to say that the narrative re - calls the art in De Quincey 's '' Flight of a Tartar Tribe '' or
Tolstoi	PERSON	's description of the rout of Bagration and his Russians in '' War and Peace . ''

		General
Schaff	PERSON	's impulsive prose , which curvets and prances and paws the ground like a high - strung horse , makes good speed and hurries us from side to side of the widespread flight , takes us into
Lee	PERSON	's rushing hampered columns and into
Grant	PERSON	's relentless cohorts of pursuit .

		The objectivity , the open-air quality of the style is noticeable , and not less so its waywardness and off-handedness .

		General
Schaff	PERSON	will interrupt a cavalry charge to get down and paint some field flowers or brookside blooming bushes .

		Yet the whole thing is alive and rushing on .

		Let us give a few specimens of the fresh and vivid writing of the book and first , of its nature painting : '' I wish we could find a good , overlooking spot .

		How will that little elevation down there in the valley answer ; that rises like an old-fashioned beehive on the left of the road and has a brotherhood of four or rive big-limbed oaks crowning it , one of them leaning some - what ?

		Admirably !

		... Well , here we are : oaks spread - ing above us , at our feet violets , liverwort , and
spring	DATE	beauties scattered among acorn hulls , dead leaves , and clustered grass .

		What a reviewing stand , and so near the road that we shall be able to distinguish faces ! ''

		Here is a night piece : '' Yet , reader , for loneliness and every aide who like myself has carried dispatches will bear witness to the truth of what I say give me a park of army-wagons in some wan old field wrapt in darkness at the dead hours of a moonless night , men and mules asleep , camp - fires breathing their last , and the beams of day , which wander in the
night	TIME	, resting ghost-like on the arched and mildewed canvas covers . ''

		And here is a battle picture : '' They were now advancing firmly with colors , and there were so many standards crimsoning each body of troops to their glory the Confederate color-bearers stood by
Lee	PERSON	to the last , that they looked like march - ing gardens blooming with cockscomb , red roses , and poppies ... The road was packed with men , their faces grimly ablaze , colors flying , and over them , like a waver - ing shield of steel , were their muskets at right-shoulder - shift , as they trotted forward to the sound of the now booming guns ; for
Gordon	PERSON	's and
Fitz Lee	PERSON	's veterans were answering the last call of the Confederacy with their old - time spirit . ''

		Perhaps what most of all imparts vitality to General
Schaff	PERSON	's work is the immense gallery of human pictures painted from the intimacy of comradeship or experience .

		Some of these are full-length portraits , some mere heads , some thumbnail sketches dashed in with a phrase .

		And there is no West Point exclusiveness in this commemorative work .

		The author is just as ready to devote a paragraph or a page to some unnamed soldier boy as to the proudest 488 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, general .

		Witness , for instance , the young sen - tinel in gray who turns back the slave dealer from the escaping
Richmond	LOCATION	train , or the young lad with brimming eyes who attracts Major
Stiles	PERSON	's attention at field service and who next day is shot dead .

		Naturally , however , most of the portraits are of men of known name .

		Here is Ouster : '' After his promotion to a generalcy , Custer dressed fantastically in olive corduroy , wore his yellow hair long , and supported a flaming scarlet flannel necktie whose loose ends the wind fluttered across his breast as , with uplifted sabre , he charged at the head of his brigade , followed by his equally reckless troopers , who , in loving imitation , wore neckties like his own . ''

		And here is Sheridan : ''
Sheridan	PERSON	is mounted on
Rienzi	LOCATION	.

		Look at man and horse , for they are both of the same spirit and temper .

		It was
Rienzi	PERSON	who with flaming nostrils carried
Sheridan	PERSON	to the field of
Cedar Creek	LOCATION	, ` twenty miles away ' ; and on the field of Five Forks , the battle which broke Lee 's line and let disaster in .

		Before the final charge there , the horse became as impatient as its rider , kicking , plunging , tossing his head , pulling at the bit , while foam flecked his black breast .


Sheridan	PERSON	gave him his head , when he saw that
Ayres	PERSON	, at the point of the bayonet , was going to carry the day ; off sprang
Rienzi	PERSON	and with a leap bounded over the enemy 's works and landed
Sheridan	PERSON	among the mob of prisoners and fighting troops '' General
Schaff	PERSON	apologizes for not giving much attention to the greater Union leaders , as he had dealt pretty fully with them in his previous book .

		Grant and
Meade	PERSON	, indeed , are kept rather in the background , save toward the close when the former of course takes the centre of the stage .

		But
Lee	PERSON	is painted minutely and lovingly , on the march , at camp-fire , at council .

		Lee is the hero of the book .

		Shall we wonder at this ?

		Is it strange that a Union officer , proud of his army and its leaders , should at the moment of victory draw back , give precedence to a defeated foe , and offer the crown of glory to
Lee	PERSON	and his devoted veterans ?

		No !

		It was their time of tragedy and triumph .

		Except
Napoleon	PERSON	's last campaign before
Waterloo	LOCATION	,
Lee	PERSON	's last year of struggle against the North is the most wonder - ful thing in modern warfare .

		General
Schaff	PERSON	's final tribute to
Lee	PERSON	is too long to quote , but here are its concluding lines : '' No , no eagle that ever flew , no tiger that ever sprang , had more natural courage ; and I will guarantee that every field he was on , if you ask them about him , will speak of the unquailing battle-spirit of his mien .

		Be not deceived :
Lee	PERSON	, notwithstanding his poise , was nat - urally the most belligerent bull-dog man at the head of any army in the war . ''

		Grave and tender and true is the North ; gay and ardent and courteous is the
South !	LOCATION

		But we think that for once the South is beaten out of the field in its own qualities .

		We doubt whether there is any Southern book more chivalrous in generosity of judgment about Southern leaders than is this ; or a more emotional seizure of the passion , pathos , and heroism of the last days of the Lost Cause .

		A POET ix LANDSCAPE .

		* This study of the art of
Homer Martin	ORGANIZATION	by Mr.
F. J. Mather , Jr.	PERSON	, is of the same form as that on the art of
George Inness	PERSON	by Mr.
Daingerfield	PERSON	, which was reviewed in THE DIAL some time since .

		It is a handsome little quarto , beautifully printed , and illustrated with a frontispiece in color and a dozen other reproductions .

		It is to be hoped that these two volumes are only the beginning of a series of monographs upon
Ameri	PERSON	- can Landscape Painters , and that they will be speedily followed by volumes on
Cole	ORGANIZATION	,
Durand	PERSON	, and
Church	ORGANIZATION	, and others after as well as before
Homer Martin	PERSON	.

		It will be difficult to find au - thors as competent as Mr.
Mather	PERSON	, who has an intimate knowledge of his subject as well as wide artistic reading and long practice in criti - cism .

		One addition may be suggested to such volumes : they certainly ought to have a list of the paintings of the painter they discuss , and , one would think , also a bibliography .

		They are necessarily expensive books , but their price is doubtless none too much when the typography and execution are considered , as well as the mar - ket .

		As the publisher seems to have done every - thing that could be asked of him , one would say that the author should do so too .

		If these books are to be merely attractive tokens of regard to be passed around among friends or to lie on club tables they will , of course , need only typography , pictures , and criticism .

		If , however , they are really to take the place of authoritative mono - graphs , they ought to appeal to the student as well as to the amateur .

		And the student , although perhaps not entitled to a bibliography , would seem to be entitled to a list of works .

		Mr.
Mather	PERSON	, of course , has material for a list of
Homer Martin	ORGANIZATION	's work that ought to be more com - plete than anyone else possesses ; it must be the basis of his work .

		And if that work is to receive the intelligent criticism which alone will give it the place it ought to take , others ought to have advantage , at least , of his knowledge of where the materials for study are to be found .

New York	LOCATION	: Frederic Fair - child
Sherman	PERSON	.

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 489 this way a foundation would be laid for a real knowledge of the subject , which would finally be of ultimate use to the student of American art .

		Mr.
Mather	PERSON	's criticism has great and dis - tinguished value ; but if it is to remain a real contribution to the history of American painting , if it is to maintain itself above the ordinary dilet - tante club-talk , it should be reviewed by people who have studied the same materials that he has .

		Not having the advantage of any such knowl - edge of
Homer Martin	ORGANIZATION	's work as Mr.
Mather	PERSON	, and relying on the other hand only on such gen - eral information as to American landscape paint - ing as is open to hundreds of others , I can offer but a desultory and slightly founded criticism of the estimate of
Homer Martin	ORGANIZATION	here offered .

		If my views appear to be based upon an insuffi - cient knowledge it will be largely due , I believe , to the very lack of opportunity for thorough critical study given not only by this monograph but by most works dealing with the general subject .

		And first as to
Martin	ORGANIZATION	's general position .

		Mr.
Mather	PERSON	says that ''
Martin	PERSON	frankly accepted the traditional scenic ideal of landscape paint - ing and always remained faithful to it '' -LRB- p. 15 -RRB- ; that he was '' the last and greatest expression '' of the movement which he himself is said to have called the
Hudson River School	ORGANIZATION	-LRB- p. 16 -RRB- ; that `` he actually realised what had been merely the ambition of
Durand	PERSON	and Cole '' -LRB- p. 15 -RRB- .

		I be - lieve that this is very true as far as it goes , but it does not appear to me to go far enough to be really definitive .

		What was the
Hudson River School	ORGANIZATION	?

		What was '' the ambition of
Durand	PERSON	and
Cole	ORGANIZATION	'' ?

		One would gather from the lan - guage that they had the same ambition .

		That , however , was not the case ; they had very differ - ent ambitions , and their paintings , which look wholly different even to the haphazard amateur , were the expression of very different ideas .

		Now
Homer Martin	PERSON	, to judge from Mr.
Mather	PERSON	's whole treatment , did not have the ideals of either
Cole	PERSON	or
Durand	PERSON	, nor was his accomplishment like that of either .

		The painter who realized what had been merely the ambitions of
Cole	ORGANIZATION	and
Durand	PERSON	was
Frederick E. Church	PERSON	: he had the grandiose romanticism of
Cole	PERSON	and the affec - tionate naturalism of
Durand	LOCATION	.

		Martin would seem to me to have had neither .

		It may be that I misinterpret Mr.
Mather	PERSON	when he speaks of the ambition of
Durand	PERSON	and
Cole	PERSON	, or of the tra - ditional scenic ideal of landscape painting .

		He may mean merely the ambition really to present the wonderful and characteristic notes of Amer - ican scenery , those things wherein
America	LOCATION	was different from the rest of the world , those things which might make , or even necessitate , an '' American School '' of landscape .

		Those things were , in the mind of
Thomas Cole	PERSON	, a glorious liberty and power , wild and often fierce , as ex - pressed in mountain and lake , crag and forest ; and such things he loved to paint with romantic largeness .

		In the art of Durand the dominant idea seems to have been the sufficing energy and strength which created the mountains and forests alike , and hence with him the idea of truth and detail was most important .

		Homer
Martin	PERSON	did not have either of these ideas .

		Yet as you look at his u Lake Sanford '' or '' The Sand Dunes ,
Lake Ontario	LOCATION	, '' you feel as though he had some - thing which superseded both and was naturally finer than either .

		But just what this '' some - thing '' was I do not find in Mr.
Mather	PERSON	's esti - mate , and miss it .

		Mr.
Mather	PERSON	shows that
Martin	PERSON	had the ability to render the grandeur of form and wide space that seemed to him the dominant factors in the American scene , and to render it in the painter 's style ; but I do not find that he has anywhere made a sufficient and convincing statement of the matter .

		The gen - eral estimate , however , whether fully stated or not , is a real contribution : it shows critical insight as well as sufficient knowledge ; it is just the kind of thing we need .

		The second point that I would speak of is the question why
Martin	PERSON	was not popular in his later days .

		He was obviously not , and indeed could hardly sell his later pictures for any sum however small .

		I note the matter because it seems , very characteristic , and indeed explana - atory of
Martin	ORGANIZATION	's whole life .

		Mr.
Mather	PERSON	makes the fact clear , but says that he will merely note it without comment .

		His subject , he says -LRB- p. 63 -RRB- , is `` a particular artist and not the various pseudo-esthetic forms of human vanity . ''

		That , of course , is the case , and yet I believe we should have a better idea of what
Martin	PERSON	's art really was , if we had a definite statement of why it differed from the art in favor in
the later years of the nineteenth century	DATE	.

		It was not till after
Martin	PERSON	's death that his pic - tures commanded any sort of price , and then they became so valuable that they were fabri - cated for the trade .

		Now it seems to me very clear why a public which in 18 ^ 0 , say , admired
Monet	ORGANIZATION	and
Pissarro	PERSON	.

		and would certainly buy pictures like those of
Twachtman	PERSON	-LRB- not to men - tion other men still living -RRB- , would not buy the pictures of
Homer Martin	PERSON	, and I should say that a statement of the fact would make very clear just what
Homer Martin	ORGANIZATION	really was .

		490 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, 1 should range the leading figures in Amer - ican landscape somewhat in this way : first -LRB- after the very beginners -RRB-
Thomas Cole	PERSON	, who expressed the predominating romanticism of his time , which soared aloft like a rocket and blazed out into darkness in the work of
Moran	LOCATION	,
Bierstadt	PERSON	, and Church ; second
Durand	PERSON	, who represented a sort of pre-Raphaelitism which though very pervasive never produced any painter greater than
Durand	PERSON	himself ; then
George Inness	PERSON	, who represents the influence of the Barbizon group and is the greatest man in
America	LOCATION	produced by that influence ; then somebody still living -LRB- one need n't say who -RRB- who will stand for Impressionism ; and finally the painters of our own day .

		Now among these influences and periods , the place of
Homer Martin	PERSON	, as I understand him and his work , is that he continues the ideas of
Cole	PERSON	and
Durand	PERSON	, in the sense already stated , in the time of
George Inness	PERSON	.

		It appears to me very natural that he was never popular , nor even very interesting .

		Not interesting , except , of course , to those who love beautiful painting without regard to periods or influences or theories or fashions , who can be thrilled by noble emotion even when con - veyed by unfashionable technique , and by fine technique even when it has no passion but that of the workman .

		I love the pictures of
Cole	PERSON	; the painting of his time was awful , but I like his grandiose romanticism .

		I love equally the pictures of Inness , though I can not say I have much sympathy with his views on the poetry of nature .

		But there are also a number of painters among our American landscapists who seem chiefly to be painters , without much refer - ence to other people or to any ideas other than their own .

		Such I take to be
Thomas Doughty	PERSON	in our early history , a man who seems to have been quite unable to accommodate himself to the rising passion of his time for crags and cataracts , lakes and mountains .

		So he painted persistently glimpses of the Hudson and views of
Fairmount Park	LOCATION	, for which people cared little in his day and would care little now were it not in recognition of his fine artistic spirit .

		Some - thing of this sort is
Homer Martin	PERSON	, as Mr.
Mather	PERSON	presents him to us , a man in love with the greatness of nature at a time when people were charmed with her littlenesses , a man who would paint a mountain-top or an inland sea at a period when people in tune with their time were absorbed in the poetry of the door-yard , of the pair of bars , of the haystack .

		Other men with ideas like his own could maintain them - selves by the adventitious aid of tropic splendor or exotic associations .

		But
Martin	PERSON	appealed to nothing adventitious , to nothing that was not of the essence of art .

		He had the sentiment of grandeur , and he was bent on rendering it grandly .

		He could not possibly have adopted the combination of the grand ideas of
Cole	PERSON	and the nice minutiae of
Durand	LOCATION	that
Church	ORGANIZATION	and
Bierstadt	PERSON	showed was possible .

		He came fifty years after
Cole	PERSON	and
Durand	PERSON	, and he knew a bet - ter way of painting than either of them .

		So he pleased neither the multitude with his fine execu - tion nor the virtuosi with his noble imagination .

		What a pleasure to find someone to write and someone to publish a monograph upon an Amer - ican landscape painter !

		It is much to be hoped that people will be found to buy and read ; but , after all , the writing and publishing are the main thing .

		I am sure it is as well worth doing as a monograph upon some obscure Italian of the fourteenth century or some Frenchman of the eighteenth .

		It is certainly much more difficult .

		With the old-time obscurity you have quite a limited set of facts to work with : different critics will arrange them in different ways , but there are not enough for more than a conjectural estimate at best .

		THE SAINT OF ASSIST .

		* Since
Paul Sabatier	PERSON	published his Vie de S. Francois sixteen years ago there have been over thirty French editions of the work , an excellent English translation , and several other foreign translations .

		Thus the wonder-story of the great mediaeval saint has become known to thousands of modern readers and students , and has been incorporated into text-books and college courses dealing with European history and culture .

		Yet it is well known that competent critics have * SAINT FRANCIS OF

		1912 . -RSB-

		THE DIAL 491 pointed out how warped and misleading much of
Sabatier	PERSON	's interpretation is , especially his emphasis on the personality of Saint
Francis	PERSON	in conflict with the Church of his time and with the tendencies towards corporate growth on the part of his order .

		The appearance in English , there - fore , of two thoroughly orthodox biographies of Saint
Francis	PERSON	, of popular character , will be wel - comed by Catholic scholars , while the general reading public will have a chance to make the acquaintance of the saint through these new books .

		The first of these is an English trans - lation , by Dr.
T. O'Conor Sloane	PERSON	, of the Danish scholar
Jorgensen	PERSON	's `` Saint
Francis	PERSON	of
Assisi	LOCATION	, '' a detailed and scholarly biography ; while the second is a much more popular work entitled `` Everybody 's Saint
Francis	PERSON	, '' by the well - known
American Roman Catholic	ORGANIZATION	writer , Dr.
Mau	PERSON	- rice
F. Egan	PERSON	.


Jorgensen	PERSON	's book has five excel - lent photogravure illustrations from thirteenth and fourteenth century portraits and manu - scripts ; while Dr.
Egan	PERSON	's simpler chapters are adorned by twenty full-page drawings -LRB- eight of them in color -RRB- by the famous French artist ,
M. Boutet de Monvel	ORGANIZATION	.

		In dealing with the life of Saint
Francis	PERSON	, the Danish scholar adopts a reverential attitude towards the sources , and gives a careful narra - tive account of all that is told on good author - ity concerning his subject .

		He does not indulge in critical discussions or excursions , but states his facts simply and briefly .

		The visions , miracles , and stigmata are either accepted as true or passed over as legends , and we have the story of the saint as known and believed in by his best informed contemporaries and followers .

		The biography is some what symmetrically organ - ized into four books , dealing respectively with
Francis	PERSON	as Church Builder , Evangelist , God 's Singer , and
Hermit	LOCATION	; with an interesting appen - dix , originally the introduction to the Danish edition , on the authorities for the life of the saint .

		Although the original Danish work ap - peared in
1906	DATE	, no attempt has been made to bring this appendix up to date ; and its bibli - ographical value , while considerable , would be much greater had it been revised and new works added .

		It is evident from the foot-notes that
Jorgensen	PERSON	has made very considerable use of the scholarly studies and articles of Professor
Gotz	PERSON	of
Munich	LOCATION	, and yet this critic of
Sabatier	PERSON	and
Muller	PERSON	is barely mentioned in the section on modern authorities .

		That Saint
Francis	PERSON	was a man of his time , that he was thoroughly orthodox in his theology and in his relation to the Church , and that he was in sympathy with the early aspects of his Order 's growth are the views expressed by Jor - gensen .

		As an illustration of his viewpoint we may cite the following paragraph from Chapter IV .

		of Book III. , in regard to the origin and early character of the Franciscan Order : '' The community of
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	, which
Francis	PERSON	of
Assisi	LOCATION	had founded , was from the very first an order of peni - tents and apostles , and
Francis	PERSON	himself was the Superior of the Order .

		He it was who had written the Rules of the Order and had promised obedience to the Pope , he it was to whom the permission to preach was given , and through whom the others participated therein .

		It is certain that the first six
Brothers	ORGANIZATION	had the same right as
Francis	PERSON	to receive new members into the Order , but the the new members were taken to
Portiuncula	LOCATION	, there to receive the robe of penitence from
Francis	PERSON	himself .

		This reception into the Brotherhood was regarded as equivalent in weight to the old time conversion of the orders of monkhood by it one left the world with its pomp and glory .

		As a sign of this the supplicant gave his possessions to the poor . ''

		In such a passage we have no implication of difference of viewpoint as to his Order between Saint
Francis	PERSON	and the
Church	ORGANIZATION	, no hint of a tran - sition of a simple lay order into ` an ecclesiastical brotherhood of formal character , but merely a simple statement of origin and character .

		A great deal of the interest and charm of
Sabatier	PERSON	's life of Saint
Francis	PERSON	lies in the close personal touch between author and subject , and the con - stant effort to convey what the author thinks were
Francis	PERSON	's own feelings and viewpoints .


Jorgensen	PERSON	is content to give the historical facts and happenings as he finds them in the sources , and does not attempt any psychological inter - pretation .

		The result is that
Sabatier	PERSON	is more interesting and stimulating reading , while Jor - gensen must be considered as better historical biography .

		The work of translating
Jorgensen	PERSON	's book from the Danish original has been well done by Dr.
T. O'Conor Sloane	PERSON	, though certain curious errors of translation and phraseology indicate that Dr.
Sloane	PERSON	is not himself a close student of mediaeval monasticism .

		To call the '' Order of Friars Minor '' the '' Order of Smaller Brothers '' seems inexcusable ; nor should the well-known '' Legend of the Three Companions '' be referred to as `` the
Three Brothers Legend	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Other such errors , and many inconsistencies of spell - ing and usage , might be pointed out ; but such criticism is tedious .

		The index to the transla - tion is only fairly satisfactory , being made up largely of proper names , `` stigmata , '' for example , is omitted from the index .

		A useful feature , however , is a special index for the bib - liographical appendix , this index being much better than the one for the main work .

		492 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, Dr.
Egan	PERSON	's '' Everybody 's Saint
Francis	PERSON	'' is an eminently readable and popular account of the mediaeval story of the saint .

		Appearing originally in a well-known monthly magazine , with the remarkable illustrations of M. JBoutet de Monvel as their accompaniment , they were read with pleasure by many persons who ordin - arily do not come into such close contact with mediaeval hagiology .

		In its present form the work makes a most attractive gift-book , and will be especially appropriate for those meditating a winter visit to
Italy	LOCATION	.

		It is apparent that Dr.
Egan	PERSON	's aim has been literary rather than criti - cal or historical .

		It is the legendary Saint
Francis	PERSON	that he is interested in rather than the strictly historical personage .

		The wonderful story of the
Wolf of Gubbio	ORGANIZATION	is given in detail , also the story of the birds ; and we are told , seemingly in all seriousness , that
Francis	PERSON	went among the Mohammedans of
Morocco	LOCATION	'' during the crusade of Saint Louis , '' though in reality
Francis	PERSON	had died thirty-three years before
Louis	PERSON	's crusade to
Tunis	LOCATION	took place .

		Again , Dr.
Egan	PERSON	states that
Francis	PERSON	died '' in the for - tieth year of age , '' on
October 3 , 1226	DATE	, while he gives the date of his birth as
1181	DATE	or
1182	DATE	.

		Attractively as Dr.
Egan	PERSON	tells his story , it is surely to be regretted that he is not more accu - rate and historical in the handling of his subject .

		As a piece of brilliant literary description his chapters are admirable , but they have too much of the quality of a fairy tale .

		From fortress - like
Durham	LOCATION	to brand-new
Truro	LOCATION	, from stumpy
Carlisle	PERSON	to historic
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	, every one of the English cathedrals is sought and scanned by thousands of more or less intelligent visitors .

		Herded and hustled by the verger , they gaze on the storied beauties of arch and buttress , of transept and towers , of rose window and fan tracery ; and then , after inscribing their names in the visitors ' book and depositing their six - pences `` for the maintenance of the Fabric , '' they move reluctantly away , wondering how much they can remember of it all .

		For these and the stay-at-home readers there has been no lack of literary helps , `` before and during and after . ''

		The desiccated but trusty handbooks of
Murray	PERSON	and
Baedeker	PERSON	and the in - valuable volumes of `` Bell 's Cathedral Series '' are portable and useful during the visit ; but larger monographs and more comprehensive treatises have never been wanting to chide and correct the reader 's ignorance , to stir his imag - ination , and to leave him with an adequate appreciation of the architectural and historical significance of these '' masses of gray stone , '' in which , as
Ruskin	PERSON	says , '' the mediaeval builders have left us their adoration . ''

		Mrs.
Van Rensselaer	ORGANIZATION	's well-known book on English
Cathe	PERSON	- drals has for twenty years done this great ser - vice for Americans so far as the twelve principal churches are concerned ; would that she had pushed the plan to completion and had given us the story of the whole thirty-six English and Welsh cathedrals .

		That the subject is one of perennial interest would seem to be indicated by the recent appear - ance , at about the same time , of three books with practically identical titles .

		The largest of these is by Mr.
Thomas Dinham Atkinson	PERSON	, who , in his own words , '' has aimed to sketch the his - tories of our cathedral churches in their broader aspects , and to connect each so far as is possible in narrowcompass with the main stream of archi - tectural history '' ; but also '' to approach the subject from the point of view of the architect the constructor . ''

		Following the main line of cleavage between the old monkish foundations on the one hand and those served by secular canons on the other , the author adds to these the foundations of
Henry VIII	ORGANIZATION	.

		and the new sees created in modern times , and adopts this

		THE DIAL 493 order in his descriptions .

		Within the two chief divisions the canons 1 churches and the monks ' churches the arrangement is topographical , Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	insisting that '' the whole of En - gland may be easily mapped out into districts , each with its distinctive manner ; which is so easily recognizable that an antiquary alighting from an airship would at once take his bearings from the style of the architecture that he saw about him . ''

		The striking characteristics of the two camps are seen in '' the vast Norman naves of the monks in almost every church from
Norwich	LOCATION	to
Gloucester	LOCATION	and from
Durham	LOCATION	to
Rochester	LOCATION	, and in their massy towers from
St. Albans	LOCATION	to
Shrewsbury	LOCATION	.

		The churches of the secular clergy have a warmth of color , a gener - osity of sculpture , a beauty and certain gracious - ness of manner , which characterize the fully developed mediaeval architecture . ''

		The marked differences between French and English cathedrals are re-told and explained the long , low , narrow English churches with their central towers , square east ends , and western transepts contrasted with the short and wide plans , lofty vaults , and faintly emphasized transepts of the French the trim lawns and immemorial elms which lend an air of peaceful seclusion to
Salisbury	PERSON	set over against the high - shouldered roof of
Amiens	LOCATION	rising far above the huddled town at its feet .

		Of these and kindred features Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	writes with professional authority , and in a clear , succinct style which keeps the pages free from any load of techni - cality .

		The story of each church is made graphic by plans and photographs , and alluring by softly beautiful colored plates , which give to the dome of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's its true misty atmosphere and make the spire of
Salisbury	PERSON	like one of Constable 's pictures of it -LRB- without the rainbow -RRB- .

		There is a good index , and a useful chart showing in ver - tical columns the `` biography '' of each cathedral .

		Few slips are to be noted : in the Latin inscrip - tion over
Wren	PERSON	's tomb '' urbs '' should be * ' urbis '' ; and the insertion of the word ''
Salis	PERSON	- bury '' after '' the new town '' on p. xxi .

		would make for clearness .

		On the whole , this is an excellent one-volume presentation of a fascinat - ing and wide-spreading theme .

		In Mr.
Francis	PERSON	Bond we have an old acquaint - ance as a guide , philosopher , and friend for the study of ecclesiastical architecture .

		The first edition of his '' English Cathedrals Illustrated '' was published in
1899	DATE	, and was soon accepted as a standard work , in spite of the fact that it contained no ground plans , so indispensable to reader and visitor alike .

		The work now appears in a fourth edition , with various important changes .

		Beside supplying the ground-plans , Mr.
Bond	PERSON	has rejected the time-honored nomen - clature of Rickman and others , which '' at - tempted to thrust the history of every cathedral into a Procrustean framework of Norman , Early English , Decorated , and Perpendicular periods .

		... In this volume the actual building periods are treated separately , and no attempt is made to cram them into arbitrary imaginary compart - ments . ''

		This seems pretty strong , in view of the acceptance of the traditional divisions by most authorities and the fact that so good an authority as Mr.
Bond	PERSON	was willing to accept them only thirteen years ago .

		Having settled the way in which the biog - raphy of each church should be studied and the interpretation of motive of the different builders , Mr.
Bond	PERSON	adopts the following classification of English and Welsh cathedrals : 13 of the Old Foundation -LRB- pre-Conquest -RRB- ; 13 of the
New Foundation	ORGANIZATION	, receiving a dean and secular canons at the Reformation ; and 10 of modern founda - tion .

		He then proceeds to describe them in alphabetical order , keeping the four Welsh cathedrals by themselves , and reserving for the concluding chapter a brief account of Birming - ham ,
Liverpool	LOCATION	, and
Truro	LOCATION	.

		He writes with the full knowledge obtained from professional training and repeated personal visits to all the cathedrals .

		To his keen technical interest he adds the ardor of an enthusiast , which occasion - ally passes into something like extravagance ; and his superlatives are as numerous as they are pardonable .

		Everyone who has visited the English cathedrals has felt the strain on his emotional nature as he contemplated the special feature or features of each the octagon of
Ely	PERSON	, the spire of
Salisbury	LOCATION	, the stained glass of
Lichfield	LOCATION	and
York	LOCATION	, the situation of Lincoln and
Durham	LOCATION	, the east windows of
Carlisle	LOCATION	,
York	LOCATION	,
Gloucester	LOCATION	; and it is difficult to speak of such glories with a chastened vocabulary .

		Each is the best at the time ; and we can smile with sympathy at such passages as the following , which seem to warn us that if
Exeter	LOCATION	remains unvisited all is lost : '' Whatever else , then , the student and lover of Gothic architecture omits , he must not fail to visit
Exeter	LOCATION	.

		He will find it fresh and different from anything he has seen before .

		Its unique plan , without central or western towers , the absence of obstructive piers at the crossing , the constantly uninterrupted vista , the singleness and unity of the whole design , the remarkable system of proportions , based on breadth rather than height , the satisfying massiveness and solidity of the building , in - side and outside , the magnificence of its Purbeck piers , the delightful color contrast of marble column and sand - 494 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, stone arch , the amazing diversity of the window tracery , the exquisite carving of the corbels and bosses , the wealth of admirable chantries , screens and monuments , the superb sedilia , screen and throne , the misericords , the vaults , the remarkable engineering feat from which its present form results , the originality of the west front and of the whole interior and exterior , place
Exeter	LOCATION	cathedral in the very forefront of the triumphs of the mediaeval architecture of our country . ''

		Mr.
Bond	PERSON	s eulogies , though highflown , are not indiscriminate .

		He passes a severe and mer - ited criticism on the defects of
St. Paul	ORGANIZATION	's , some of them
Wren	PERSON	's own , some forced on him by the prejudice and ignorance of others .

		For example , the change from
Wren	PERSON	's first plan of a Greek cross to that of a Latin cross brought with it the vaulting of the nave with small saucer-shaped domes a most unhappy intro - duction to the majesty of the central dome .

		And the unfortunate dead wall on the sides of the church , reaching from aisle windows to cornice , is condemned by Mr.
Bond	PERSON	in vigor - ous terms .

		He quotes with approval another writer 's characterization of it as '' the , most unmitigated building sham upon the face of the earth '' ; and adds , '' It has absolutely nothing to do at all except to hide away some flying buttresses the very ugliest eye ever saw which Sir
Christopher	PERSON	might well be reluctant to expose to the jeers of the man in the street .

		... It has been urged that it was built to weight the foot of each flying buttress after the manner of a Gothic pinnacle .

		But not even a Gothic baby would have provided continuous abutment for intermittent thrusts . ''

		Aside from extremes of praise and blame , Mr.
Bond	PERSON	's style is generally alert and con - vincing .

		He is decided but not bigoted ; and gives generous space to other people 's impres - sions , reproducing a large part of Mrs.
Van Rensselaer	PERSON	's well-known description of Lich - field , which has almost become a classic .

		Plans and illustrations abound , the latter from excel - lent photographs ; and help to round out very satisfactorily this useful and handsome book .

		The Rev.
James Sibree	PERSON	is a genial and well - informed clergyman who has all his life cherished a hobby for English church architecture .

		As a lad , his first visit to Lincoln opened his eyes and roused his interest ; and though for forty-five years engaged in missionary work in
Madagascar	LOCATION	, his furloughs have been largely filled with visits to his first loves ; the result being a work in two small volumes , appropriately bound in episcopal violet .

		Instead of Mr.
Atkinson	PERSON	's division into monks ' and canons ' churches , and Mr.
Bond	PERSON	's alphabetical arrangement , Mr.
Sibree	PERSON	follows geographical lines , Vol .

		I. being devoted to the northern cathedrals , Vol .

		II .

		to the southern ; which after all is a pretty good plan .

		So we are taken at once to
York	LOCATION	,
Carlisle	LOCATION	, and
Durham	LOCATION	, and ten others ; the remaining nineteen and the four Welsh cathedrals being reserved for the second volume .

		In spite of his modest disclaimers , Mr.
Sibree	PERSON	turns out to be a delightful guide and compan - ion , with plenty of affectionate enthusiasm tem - pered by sound judgment , and plenty of literary as well as architectural perspective .

		He is a good specimen of the English parson at his best , honestly proud of those historic fabrics which have kept their existence through centuries of Catholic gorgeousness , the simpler glories of the Protestant ritual , and the ill-timed assaults of Puritan iconoclasm ; and he is delighted to show them to all who will come with him .

		His little book is well buttressed -LRB- the word seems appropriate -RRB- with various kinds of helps and props for readers ' memories .

		There is , to be sure , no index ; on the other hand , there is a table showing the periods of English architec - ture according to the time-honored nomenclature eschewed by Mr.
Bond	PERSON	; a series of block plans , useful as snowing the comparative sizes of the cathedrals , from lordly York with 63,800 square feet of surface down to little
Oxford	LOCATION	, with its 11.300 ; a glossary of architectural terms ; a good bibliography ; and an abundance of illus - trations from photographs .

		A sketch map shows the distribution of the English and Welsh cathe - drals , their nearness to the coast suggesting the slow progress of Christianity to the interior of the island .

		Another novel feature of the book is an excellent anthology on cathedrals , selected from British and American poets and prose writers .

		It would be difficult to conceive of a more exhaustive history of any building than is com - prised in the '' Memorials of
Canterbury Cath	ORGANIZATION	- edral , '' by
C. Eveleigh Woodruff	PERSON	, one of the `` six-preachers '' of the Cathedral , and
William Danks	PERSON	, residentiary canon .

		The design of the work , which is a thick octavo of five hundred pages , has been '' to write a trustworthy , com - plete , and compendious account of the
Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	from the earliest times to the present day . ''

		As is well known , the history of
Canterbury	ORGANIZATION	falls into two great divisions : first , its existence as a Benedictine church and convent from early
Saxon	PERSON	days down to the sixteenth century ; sec - ond , its conversion by
Henry VIII	PERSON	.

		into a secular foundation with dean and canons , which remains the regime of to-day .

		To accomplish the au -
1912	DATE	.

		J THE DIA1 , 495 thors ' purpose , it has accordingly been neces - sary to confine the range of view strictly to the church and its custodians , namely , the prior and convent before , and the dean and canons after , the '' Reformation '' of the sixteenth century .

		From this aspect it is remarkable how the priors loom and the archbishops dwindle .

		The range of the Primates was nation-wide , sometimes con - tinental ; but the prior and his monks stayed at home with their beloved church , building and expanding , watching and tending , its material fabric .

		They were the real tenants and house - keepers : the Archbishop was too often an ab - sentee landlord , who visited his cathedral only to meddle and disturb .

		So in this deeply inter - esting narrative we read more of
Ernulf	LOCATION	,
Conrad	LOCATION	,
Eastry	LOCATION	,
Chillenden	LOCATION	,
Goldstone	PERSON	, and Sellinge than of even
Becket	LOCATION	,
Stephen Langton	PERSON	, Rich ,
Chichele	LOCATION	,
Cranmer	PERSON	,
Pole	LOCATION	, Laud , and
Juxon	PERSON	.

		Our two writers have collaborated with marked success .

		Mr.
Woodruff	PERSON	's initials are appended to a majority of the chapters ; while to Mr.
Danks	PERSON	we owe , among other things , a long but valuable chapter on `` The Life of the Monastery , '' a vivid and informing picture of mediaeval conventual life .

		The authors have written with full knowledge based on long resi - dence , first-hand examination of the archives , and a discriminating use of such standard authorities as
Somner	ORGANIZATION	's `` Antiquities of Can - terbury , ''
Willis	PERSON	's `` Architectural History of the Cathedral , '' and Dean
Stanley	PERSON	's '' Memorials of Canterbury . ''

		The book is well supplied with illustrations from drawings by Mr.
Louis Weirter	PERSON	, and with tables of all sorts of details pertaining to the economy of the `` metropol - itical '' church , from the marketing accounts of the mediaeval convent down to the last stop in the modern organ .

		These minutiae are for the curious in such matters ; and do not interfere with the success of the work 's aim to be both compendious and readable .

		`` South America '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , `` painted by
A. S. Forrest	PERSON	, described by
W. H. Koebel	PERSON	, '' as its title-page announces , is indeed a book in which the artist 's share is more conspicuous , even if not in real - ity more considerable , than the author 's .

		Seventy - five pictures , full to overflowing of local color in an almost dazzling brilliance of tint , meet the eye as one turns the broad pages of the handsome vol - ume ; and this brave display accords well with Mr.
Koebel	PERSON	's chapters on what he considers to be the continent `` which at the present time holds more romance than any other out of the great divisions of the world . ''

		But it is , as he insists , '' no longer an area populated in parts : it is a continent of pow - erful and growing nations . ''

		He begins his de - scriptive matter with
Argentina	LOCATION	, then follows with
Bolivia	LOCATION	,
Brazil	LOCATION	,
Chile	LOCATION	,
Guiana	ORGANIZATION	,
Paraguay	LOCATION	,
Peru	LOCATION	, and
Uruguay	LOCATION	, and closes with the northern republics ,
Colombia	LOCATION	,
Ecuador	LOCATION	, and
Venezuela	LOCATION	.

		In the opening of chapter seven one suspects a misprint , rather than a confusion of thought on the author 's part , in the assertion that `` from the ascetic point of view
Paraguay	LOCATION	leaves little to be desired '' ; for the writer proceeds to tell us how the country glows with flowers , abounds in tropical luxuriance of verdure , and , in general , '' is not wanting in colour and life . '' ''

		Artistic '' may have been written or intended , not `` ascetic . ''

		Certainly the country seems to have left Mr.
Forrest	PERSON	little to desire from the artistic point of view , since eight strikingly brilliant pictures illustrate the short chapter devoted to the Para - guayans and their wonderful land , whose atmos - phere Mr.
Koebel	PERSON	finds to be `` generally that of romance . ''

		Large print , an adequate map , and a four-page index are among the welcome features of this tropically luxuriant volume .

		Almost ninety years have passed since
Robert Chambers	PERSON	wrote his `` Traditions of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, '' a book twice remodelled and enlarged by him , and now for a third time revived and placed before the pub - lic in an edition enriched with thirty illustrations in color and more than twice as many pen-and-ink draw - ings , a map of the city , old and new , a few additional notes , and an index .

		Mr.
James Riddell	PERSON	is the artist , and he has done his part in a way to please all who open the book .

		The quarto size of the volume admits of unusually large plates , and they are rich in their color effects , while the pen-and-ink sketches have a quieter charm .

		The author 's preface to his edition of
1868	DATE	is reprinted , and it will interest the reader to learn the circumstances attending the first issue of the book . ''

		This little work , '' we are told , `` came out in the Augustan days of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	, when Jef - frey and
Scott	PERSON	,
Wilson	PERSON	and the
Ettrick Shepherd	PERSON	,
Dugald Stewart	PERSON	and

		The subject proved fruitful even beyond expectation , the old inhabitants contributing willingly and abund - antly of their early memories ; and thus came into being the earliest and perhaps still the best of the informal guide-books to
Edinburgh	LOCATION	that have ap - peared in such quantity and variety .

		In its latest form it is a volume of imposing proportions and handsome appearance .

		The land - scapes are all admirable for clearness and finish , and animals and human beings are caught in lifelike pose .

		There are one hundred of these pictures , the frontispiece , showing a woman of
Samaria	LOCATION	, with a water-jar on her head , an infant on one arm , and two little girls at her side , being colored with much verisimilitude .

		The cover of the book , with its red cross on a gold shield , and other appropriate decora - tions , is aesthetically satisfying .

		The spell of

Walter Tyndale	PERSON	,
R. I.	PERSON	, whose volume on the Pharaohs ' country pub - lished a few seasons ago will be remembered as a gift-book of unusual charm .

		Mr.
Tyndale	PERSON	's several Egyptian sojourns since that time have now borne fruit in a new book entitled `` An Artist in
Egypt	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Unlike many of his fellow - artists , Mr.
Tyndale	PERSON	knows how to write as well as to paint , and his spicy record of personal impressions and experiences is decidedly worth while for its own sake .

		But the pictures are still better .

		These consist of twenty-seven reproductions in full color , separately printed and mounted on blank pages , within a border of gold lines .

		They portray with remarkable skill and charm and opulence of color - effect the picturesque scenes of
Cairo	LOCATION	and its neigh - boring country .

		A minor feature of the volume worthy of particular mention is the design for the end-leaves , depicting in soft tints a camel train mov - ing across the moonlit desert .

		For the past or pro- spective visitor to the
Nile	ORGANIZATION	country we could suggest no more appropriate gift than this handsome volume .

		Another agreeable and useful volume about
Edinburgh	LOCATION	and the surrounding country appears in Mr.
Francis Watt	PERSON	's ``
Edinburgh	LOCATION	and the Lothians '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- , with colored illustrations by Mr.
Walter Dexter	PERSON	, R.B.A. .

		The term `` Lothians , '' less familiar to most Americans than to Mr.
Watt	PERSON	and his fellow Britons , seems now to be confined to the counties of
Edinburgh	LOCATION	,
Linlithgow	LOCATION	, and
Haddington Midloth	PERSON	- ian ,
West Lothian	LOCATION	, and
East Lothian	LOCATION	, respectively though in early days
Lothian	PERSON	meant all that part of the Scottish lowlands between the English border and the river Forth .

		Naturally it is with
Midlothian	LOCATION	that the present volume chiefly deals , touching espe - cially on the historic buildings and the literary and art associations of the Scottish capital .

		The remain - ing ten of the book 's twenty-nine chapters take the reader to such historic places as
Hawthornden	LOCATION	,
Ros	PERSON	- lin ,
Haddington	LOCATION	,
Dunbar	PERSON	,
North Berwick	LOCATION	, and Tan - tallon Castle .

		The artist has chosen some of the most interesting scenes for his brush , giving us pleas - ing glimpses of Holyrood and
Arthur	PERSON	's Seat ,
Edin	PERSON	- burgh
Castle	ORGANIZATION	from
Greyfriars Churchyard	LOCATION	,
Roslin Chapel	ORGANIZATION	,
Linlithgow Palace	ORGANIZATION	from the Loch ,
Tantallon Castle	ORGANIZATION	, and other memorable buildings and pictur - esque views .

		A map of the Lothians would have been an acceptable addition to this excellent and attractive volume .

		A quick eye for whatever is novel and distinctive in Norwegian character and Norwegian customs , and for the charms of Norwegian scenery , is pos - sessed by Mr.
Harold Simpson	PERSON	, as proved by his fresh and stimulating volume entitled `` Rambles in
Norway	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		He rambles with a fine resolve to be pleased with whatever he encounters ; and so his chapters bear such headings as these : `` An En - chanted Voyage , '' `` A Haven of Peace , '' '' A Perfect Day , '' `` The Garden of the North , '' `` The Call of the Mountains , '' and `` The Wonderful
Geiranger	PERSON	. ''

		But there is one less cheerful chapter , entitled `` An Unfortunate Day , '' which chronicles the discomforts of a journey from
Vossevangen	LOCATION	to Gudvangen behind a lazy horse and in the rain .

		The rambler found the conditions for rambling peculiarly favorable in
Norway	LOCATION	, especially for one not overburdened with worldly wealth .

		Excellent inns with a daily charge of not more than five kroner -LRB- or about five shillings -RRB- are met with outside the large cities , and on the coastwise steamers the satisfactory quality of the food seems to be only equalled by the steward 's indiffer - ence as to whether payment is tendered or that tri - fling formality is omitted altogether .

		The book , both in its reading matter and in its many illustrations , colored and monotone , inspires a desire to ramble among the lakes and fjords and mountains of the land of the midnight sun .

		After his wanderings in
London	LOCATION	,
Paris	LOCATION	, and Hol - land , Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	turns to
Italy	LOCATION	and gives us '' A Wanderer in
Florence	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , which concerns itself chiefly , as was to have been expected and desired , with the art and architecture of the city of
Giotto	ORGANIZATION	and
Michelangelo	ORGANIZATION	and
Brunelleschi	ORGANIZATION	.

		Appreciative readers will value the book not so much for what it tells us , which is more or less matter of common knowledge , as for the manner of the telling .

		Describing the art treasures of the
Accademia	LOCATION	, he counsels the visitor , before leaving , to
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 497 '' glance at the tapestries near the main entrance , just for fun .

		That one in which Adam names the animals is so delightfully naive that it ought to be reproduced as a nursery wall-paper . ''

		And he pro- ceeds to point out some of its delightful naivetes .

		Concerning Giotto , he thinks that
Ruskin	PERSON	has hurt that artist 's reputation by taking him peculiarly under his wing and persistently calling him `` the Shepherd , '' thus making him appear '' as something between a Sunday-school superintendent and the Creator . ''

		But
Giotto	PERSON	had a dry humor of his own , as proved by his reply to
King Robert	PERSON	of
Naples	LOCATION	when that monarch said to him on a very hot day : ''
Giotto	PERSON	, if I were you I should leave off painting for a while . ''

		`` Yes , '' returned the artist , `` if I were you I should . ''

		Sixteen Florentine views are given in color , the work of Mr.
Harry Morley	PERSON	, and there are thirty-eight half-tone reproductions of famous masterpieces in painting and sculpture .

		Mr.
Adolphe Smith	PERSON	, who claims '' a lifelong ac - quaintance with the Principality of
Monaco	LOCATION	, '' is the author of a large book , '' Monaco and
Monte Carlo	PERSON	, '' which holds within its covers more information about that anomalous little country and its famous gam - bling casino than any other one volume known to us .

		Mr.
Smith	PERSON	has participated in a number of inter - national conferences at
Monaco	LOCATION	, and has otherwise had opportunity to learn about all that is to be learned concerning the subject of his book .

		It is a strange community that he describes , `` a small principality where , proportionately speaking , more money is spent on local government , on public works , on the promotion of original research , on the arts and sciences , than is the case in any other part of the world '' and all without a penny of taxation other than the indirect taxation imposed on users of tobacco and matches and perhaps a few other things .

		The festive foreigner pays practically all the bills , and the croupier collects the revenue .

		It is all an absorbingly interesting story that Mr.
Smith	PERSON	has to tell , and he is well seconded in his undertaking by Mr.
Charles Maresco Pearce	PERSON	, who contributes eight colored drawings , while the camera is responsible for forty-eight uncolored views .

		The book is sub - stantially and handsomely bound , and its typography is of the best .

J. B. Lippincott Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- Introducing his `` Cities of
Lombardy	LOCATION	'' -LRB-
Macmil	ORGANIZATION	- lan -RRB- , Mr.
Edward Hutton	PERSON	says : `` It is my purpose in this book to consider the nature and the history of this country , to recapture and to express as well as I may my delight in it , so that something of its beauty and its genius may perhaps disengage itself from my pages , and the reader feel what I have felt about it though he never stir ten miles from his own home . ''

		Mr.
Button	PERSON	's chapters treat historically and descriptively of a dozen or more Lombard cities , and he has been ably seconded in his undertaking by Mr.
Maxwell Armfield	PERSON	, who contributes twelve exquisite illustrations in color .

		The blue of the Italian sky is caught and perhaps a little too much of it occa - sionally in these sunny views of beautiful north - Italian scenes .

		There are also twelve half-tone illustrations of merit in their mechanical way .

		No lover of
Italy	LOCATION	can fail to find enjoyment in the vol - ume .

		It is of convenient size for the hand or the pocket , has a map adequate to the reader 's needs , and an index .

		In little more than two years the greatest expo - sition ever undertaken , as the San Franciscans proudly maintain , will open its doors in celebration of the completion of the
Panama	LOCATION	Canal ; and it is not too soon to begin reading up about the wonder - ful city where that exposition is to be held .

		Mrs.
Helen Throop Purdy	PERSON	has prepared a full account of ``
San Francisco	LOCATION	, as it Was , as it Is , and How to See it , '' and
Messrs. Paul Elder & Co.	ORGANIZATION	have issued the volume in style similar to that of their earlier books , ``
California	LOCATION	the Beautiful '' and '' The Van - ished Ruin Era . ''

		Paper and print and illustrations , board covers and jacket , everything is in brown of varying shades .

		Twenty-seven chapters give the city 's early history and later fortunes , describe its chief points of interest , furnish glimpses of the men who have made it famous , advise the reader how best to see its noteworthy features , and in closing touch briefly on its environs .

		Maps of the bay region , the city itself , and the exposition site at Harbor View , are added .

		More than two hundred illustrations from photographs and other sources make visible to the eye much that is described in the text .

		It is all a stirring and a remarkable story , this account of a city founded by the Spanif-h , given a new birth by American gold-hunters , and stimu - lated to fresh vigor by the ravages of fire and earth - quake .

		Oxford is pictorially treated , with fine effect , in a volume of colored views , with brief descriptive and historical notes by Mr.
Edward C. Alden	PERSON	, author of a useful guide-book to the
University	ORGANIZATION	. ''

		Fifty Water-Color Drawings of Oxford '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- appears to be the work of more than one hand , though most of the illustrations bear the signature ''
W. Manhison	PERSON	. ''

		Glimpses of many of the college build - ings and along the High Street and elsewhere , with interior views of
Christ Church Cathedral	ORGANIZATION	, outlooks on the
Isis	ORGANIZATION	and the
Cherwell	LOCATION	, and peeps inside some of the quadrangles , are given by the skilful artists whose work is so agreeably reproduced in the book .

		A certain fondness for purplish tints is manifest in not a few of the pictures , but no two persons see nature in exactly the same colors , so that one need not complain .

		The short accompanying comments to the views are welcome in their judicious mingling of description and dates .

		The plates are loosely attached to dark brown leaves , and each is faced by a page of notes .

		Buckram and pasteboard , with an Oxford scene on the front cover and the university coat of arms on the back cover , constitute the binding .

		The picturesque and the mediaeval , says Mr.
Albert B. Osborne	PERSON	, were what he went to find in his first and all subsequent visits to
Europe	LOCATION	; and in `` Picture Towns of
Europe	LOCATION	'' -LRB- McBride -RRB- he gives with pen and camera , and in a few instances with pencil , if we 498 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, mistake not , some of the results of this quest .

		His chapters and his illustrations present in very inviting form some of the picturesque and the historically interesting aspects of
Clovelly	ORGANIZATION	,
Mont St. Michel	PERSON	, Car - cassonne ,
San Gimignano	LOCATION	,
Bussaco	LOCATION	,
Cintra	ORGANIZATION	,
Toledo	LOCATION	,
Ronda	PERSON	,
Bruges	LOCATION	,
Middelburg	LOCATION	,
Ragusa	LOCATION	,
Salzburg	LOCATION	,
Gruyeres	LOCATION	,
Rothenburg	PERSON	, and
Hildesheim	LOCATION	.

		A map of that portion of
Europe	LOCATION	visited by the author is ap - pended .


Northern Europe	LOCATION	, as he acknowledges , he has still to explore ; but for the picturesque in west - ern and southern
Europe	LOCATION	he has had his eyes open , to good effect .

		The book has a striking cover-design , and its many illustrations have unusual charm .

		Some part at least of the fruit of his travels in the Holy Land is offered to his readers by the Rev.
Cortland Myers	PERSON	,
D.D.	LOCATION	, in a little book appropriate to the Christmas season , '' Where Heaven Touched the Earth '' -LRB-
American Tract Society	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Its nine chapters treat of
Bethlehem	LOCATION	,
Nazareth	LOCATION	, the
Wilder	PERSON	- ness of
Judea	LOCATION	, the Sea of
Galilee	LOCATION	,
Jacob	PERSON	's Well ,
Gethsemane	LOCATION	,
Calvary	LOCATION	, the Church of the Holy Sep - ulchre , and the Mount of Olives .

		Colored illustra - tions , chiefly from photographs of scenes in the Holy Land , are interspersed , and a pleasing cover-design adds to the book 's attractiveness .

		Dr.
Myers	PERSON	's chap - ters abound in suggestive comment , literary and historical allusion , and frequent reference to the scriptural account of the events that have made memorable the places visited by him .

		His book , convenient in size for the pocket , would be a good companion for the tourist in
Palestine	LOCATION	; but its readers will not be restricted to the tourist class .

		HOLIDAY ART BOOKS .

		Though the history of American painting and sculpture has engaged the service of many pens , a full account of the reproductive graphic arts in this country would be hard to find .

		Mr.
Frank Weiten	PERSON	- kampf attempts to supply this lack in his careful and interesting work , `` American Graphic Art '' -LRB- Holt -RRB- , whose declared purpose is '' to group scattered farts in a brief but clear review of the whole field of Ameri - can graphic art .

		It is not intended to present a detailed list including every artist who may have practiced any of these arts in this country , but to offer a survey that will bring out salient or char - acteristic personalities and tendencies . ''

		The fifteen chapters of the book treat successively etching , early and modern ; engraving in line and stipple , in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ; mezzotint -LRB- the art of rock and scraper -RRB- ; aquatint and some other tints ; wood-engraving , and the new school of the same ; painter - wood-engraving ; lithography as a business and as an art ; the illustrators ; caricature ; the comic paper ; the book-plate ; applied graphic art , from the business card to the poster .

		Illustrative plates to the number of thirty-seven are scattered through the book , but no attempt has been made to reproduce the colored poster or other colored print .

		The specimens of work in black and white are well chosen and interesting .

		Of peculiar historic interest is the reproduction of
Paul Revere	PERSON	's copper-engraving of the Rev.
Jonathan Mayhew	PERSON	, a print only recently discovered in the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	.

		There is also given a reproduction of the first known wood - engraving executed in the colonies ,
John Foster	PERSON	's portrait of
Richard Mather	PERSON	.

		The work of such noted modern etchers and engravers as
Whistler	LOCATION	, Mr.
Timothy Cole	PERSON	, Mr.
Joseph Pennell	PERSON	, the late
Howard Pyle	PERSON	, and many others , is represented among the plates and receives notice from the author .

		It is a large field to attempt to cover in a single volume , but what has been done within that limit appears to have been well done .

		Mr.
Weitenkampf	PERSON	is Chief of the Arts and Prints Divisions of the
New York Public Library	ORGANIZATION	, and author of `` How to Appreciate Prints . ''

		The present volume will be prized by print lovers .

		The popular series of `` The Art Galleries of
Eu	ORGANIZATION	- rope '' published by
Messrs. L. C. Page & Co.	ORGANIZATION	receives an important addition this year in Mr.
Charles C. Heyl	PERSON	's tasteful volume on `` The Art of the
Uffizi Palace	ORGANIZATION	and the
Florence Academy	LOCATION	, '' to which are added notes on the minor museums of
Florence	LOCATION	, with a bibliography , lists of artists and their woiks , and an index to the book .

		Fifty illustrations from photo - graphs serve to gwre an idea of the chief master - pieces of painting and sculpture described by the author , whose purpose has been to omit the details of technique and to bring his readers face to face with , `` the great , eternal , living soul '' of the artist 's work , `` touching sympathetically upon such elements in the intellectual intent and content of the productions as may afford the keenest enjoyment , coupled with the most complete understanding and appreciation . ''

		His first chapter , entitled `` The Genesis of theRe - naissance : the First Religious Revival , '' gives the suggestive story of San
Giovanni Gualberto	PERSON	and the founding of the monastery of
Vallombrosa	ORGANIZATION	.

		The treasures of the
Pitti Palace	ORGANIZATION	, having been treated in an earlier volume of the series , are omitted in the present work .

		As a popular guide to the art gal - leries of
Florence	LOCATION	, the two volumes together appear to leave little to be desired .

		The illustrations , though small , are beautifully clear , and the commentary abounds in pertinent information and judicious criticism .

		Externally , the issues of this series are attractive to the eye .

		A noteworthy contribution to the literature of the fine arts is made by Mr.
George Leland Hunter	PERSON	in his scholarly and handsome volume on `` Tapestries : Their Origin , History , and Renaissance '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- .

		`` To me personally , '' he declares , `` tapestries are the most interesting and delightful form of art , combin - ing as they do picture interest with story interest and texture interest . ''

		The picture interest and the story interest are to be found in the book 's numerous illus - trative plates -LRB- four of them in color -RRB- and in the author 's accompanying commentary ; the texture in - terest one can fully appreciate only by studying tapes - tries themselves .

		Where the most , famous of them are to be seen may be learned from Mr.
Hunter	PERSON	's pages , as also the historic significance and the peculiar merits of these wonderful products of the weaver 's
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL , 499 and the dyer 's art .

		His chapters treat of the renais - sance of tapestries , Gothic tapestries , Renaissance tapestries , Flemish and Burgundian looms , English looms , the Gobelins , and other famous tapestries , some details as to the texture of tapestries , designs and portraits in tapestries , signatures and makers , shapes and sizes , the
Bible	LOCATION	in tapestries , history and romance in tapestries , light and shade and perspec - tive , the care of tapestries , tapestry museums , sales , expositions , and books , the tapestries in the Metro - politan Museum , and other related subjects .

		The frontispiece is a colored reproduction of the `` Ver - tumnus and
Pomona	LOCATION	'' tapestry in the
Casimir	PERSON	- Pe ` rier collection , a work of art valued at
$ 120	MONEY	000 , and the most perfect
Beauvais	PERSON	-
Boucher	PERSON	tapestry ever seen by the author .

		This and the other colored prints suggest remarkably well the rich harmonies of some of these masterpieces .

		The half-tone illustrations give a good idea of the design .

		A full bibliography and index are provided .

		Miss
Helen W. Henderson	PERSON	's profusely illustrated work on `` The Art Treasures of
Washington	LOCATION	'' -LRB- Page -RRB- is the fourth and latest addition to the handy and attractive series on '' The Art Galleries of
America	LOCATION	. ''

		The purpose of the book , as explained on the title-page , is to give `` an account of the Cor - coran Gallery of Art and of the
National Gallery and Museum	ORGANIZATION	, with descriptions and criticisms of their contents ; including , also , an account of the works of art in the Capitol , and in the
Library of Congress	ORGANIZATION	, and of the most important statuary in the city . ''

		The unwise legislation of a
Congress	ORGANIZATION	not famed for it * discriminating love of the fine arts has so burdened the capital with examples of the showy and futile that one is in danger of losing sight of the lesser number of genuine masterpieces to be met with in a tour of the
Washington	LOCATION	galleries and other public buildings .

		Hence the need of some such in - telligently selective guide and critic as is furnished in
Miss Henderson	LOCATION	's manual .

		In addition to paint - ings and sculpture she gives especial attention to the
National Museum	ORGANIZATION	's collection of aboriginal Amer - ican pottery , the largest and best exhibition of its kind in the world .

		Sixty-six reproductions from photographs illustrate the volume , which also con - tains a bibliography and index .

		Successive phases of the artist 's life from age to age are illustrated in Mr.
Stewart Dick	PERSON	's volume on '' Master Painters : Pages from the Romance of Art '' -LRB- Small .


Maynard & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Its dozen chapters begin with the monkish painters of the fifteenth cen - tury and close with
Rossetti	PERSON	and the Pre-Raphaelites .

		The three chief stages in this progress of art are found in the monastic period of painting and illumi - nating , the period of the bottega or workshop , and that of the art schools .

		In each and all the creator of beauty has commonly lived a life apart , building up a world of his own , as Mr.
Dick	PERSON	says , while the material world '' has become an automaton ; it is wound up , and the stream keeps pouring out relent - lessly useful things , useless things , but all things that will sell , and all dead things .

		The artist is forced to take refuge in a backwater if he would produce living work . ''

		Photographic reproductions of sixteen masterpieces of art are scattered through the volume .

		No believer in '' the glory and good of art '' can fail to find enjoyment in Mr.
Dick	PERSON	's sympathetic treatment of his theme .

		To one unacquainted with the progress of artistic photography , the exhibition of present-day camera work contained in the
1912	DATE	volume of '' Photograms for the Year '' -LRB-
New York	LOCATION	:
Tennant & Ward	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- will come as a revelation .

		Almost every sort of subject available to the painter seems to have been utilized in these hundred - odd plates , and often with artistic results of a surprisingly high order .

		In this volume , the seventeenth annual issue of the work , the page size has been increased very considerably , thus affording opportunity for reproduction on a worthier scale than obtained in the previous volumes .

		Be - sides a general review of the year 's work by the editor , Mr.
F. G. Mortimer	PERSON	, there are nine brief articles by various hands dealing with progress and developments in the field of camera work through - out the world .

		The amateur photographer who finds this book in his Christmas stocking is likely to be a very satisfied person .

		HOLIDAY EDITIONS OF STANDARD LITERATURE .

		Many years ago , in the wilds of
Central Africa	LOCATION	, where
Dante	PERSON	, Homer , and
Shakespeare	PERSON	were often his sole companions except the natives , Mr.
H. B. Cotterill	PERSON	conceived a desire to translate the `` Odyssey . ''

		At last he has been able to accomplish his purpose , and a hexameter version , in a volume of quarto size , clearly printed on heavy paper and adorned with twenty-four drawings by Mr.
Patten Wilson	PERSON	, is the gratifying result .

		It was a rather bold venture to translate Homer in the metre of the original , so little has popular favor hitherto smiled on this exotic form of English verse .

		Longfellow 's '' Evangeline '' is accepted for other beau ies than those of its metre .

		However , there is no conceivable form of Homeric translation that has not its own peculiar weaknesses .

		Those who are familiar with Homer , or even only with
Virgil	PERSON	, in the original , and thus have their ear attuned to the six-foot measure of these poets , will easily fall into the swing of Mr.
Cotterill	PERSON	's verse ; others are likely to trip occasion - ally , especially over certain proper names whose English accent has yielded to the `` quantity '' of the original syllables , as in the line , ' Hailing from Dulichium .

		of the choicest youths of the island , '' and `` Him sage Telemachus addressing in turn gave answer . ''

		In its spirit , the translation is truly Homeric , the language simple and dignified , the faithfulness of rendering all that could be expected under the restrictions of metre .

		The artist 's draw - ings are in many instances finely conceived and of great beauty .

Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	-RRB-
Goldsmith	PERSON	could not have wished for a better set of illustrations to his comedy , '' She
Stoops	PERSON	to Con - quer , '' than those designed with keen appreciation of the humors of the piece by Mr.
Hugh Thomson	PERSON	500 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, in an elaborate edition from the house of
Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	.

		The play , thus issued , with twenty - five colored plates and other drawings in line , makes a volume of quarto dimensions running to nearly two hundred pages .

		Heavy paper and large type are used , with broad margins and richly decorated bind - ing , end-leaves of appropriate design , and an embel - lished box .

		Mr.
Thomson	PERSON	's water-colors for such is their appearance in reproduction have often a Watteau-like delicacy and grace that is very pleasing , while the rude joviality of certain other scenes is also well depicted .

		Nothing short of seeing the play itself well staged and acted could convey a fuller enjoyment of its merits than this fine setting pro- vided for it by artist and printer and binder .

		Hardly a year passes now that does not witness a fresh attempt to interpret one or more of
Poe	ORGANIZATION	's poems by aid of pictorial illustration .

		The latest noteworthy effort of this sort is on the part of Mr.
Edmund Dulac	PERSON	, who has made twenty-eight colored pictures for a sumptuous edition of '' The Bells , and Other Poems '' -LRB-
Hodder	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- in a quarto volume of imposing appearance in its elaborately embossed , cream - colored binding , with print of the largest , margins of the most generous width , and paper of the heavi - est. .

		The illustrations are striking for their color - effects , and often too for their drawing .

		No one but
Poe	PERSON	could have evoked such creations .

		The picture to `` The Haunted Palace , '' for example , is a veritable nightmare in color and design , that to '' Alone '' is beautifully expressive , those to '' The Bells '' are what
Poe	PERSON	himself might have been glad to be able to draw .

		Other smaller illustrations in a single tint head some of the poems , and all have a character appropriate to their theme .

		The spirit of romance breathes in Mr.
W. Hath	PERSON	- erell 's illustrations to `` Romeo and Juliet '' in the elaborately ornate edition of the play issued this sea - son by
Messrs. Hodder & Stoughton	ORGANIZATION	.

		Twenty-two of these pictures , rich even to the verge of excess -LRB- or perhaps beyond it -RRB- in coloring , and frequently of striking and beautiful design , are scattered through the book .

		The charm of
Juliet	PERSON	's young beauty is now and again successfully caught , and the con - ception of her old nurse is excellent .

		Large print , heavy paper , generous spacing , broad margins , a graceful cover design in green and gold these are among the book 's attractive features .

		It is a sub - stantial quarto in form , and is provided with a box appropriately ornamented .

		A request for a list of the flowers named in
T. B. Aldrich	PERSON	's poems , in order that the garden of the
Aldrich	PERSON	memorial house at
Portsmouth	LOCATION	might have growing in it all the flowers so mentioned , called forth from Mrs.
Aldrich	PERSON	a copy of all the lines wherein the desired names occurred .

		Thus not only the blossoms themselves , but also the accompanying foliage , so to speak , the poet 's widow has offered to such as choose to accept the floral gift .

		A thin vol - ume of exquisite design , entitled '' The Shadow of the Flowers '' -LRB-
Houghton	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , contains these passages from
Aldrich	PERSON	's poems , with drawings in harmony with the text from the pencils of Mr.
Talbot Aldrich	PERSON	and Mr.
Carl J. Nordell	PERSON	.

		The right-hand pages alone are used , and the verses as well as the draw - ings above them appear to be the work of the artist 's pencil .

		Flowers and bits of landscape make up most of the illustrations , with an occasional human figure .

		The cover design shows a part of a wild rosebush , with accompanying verses .

		The book is neatly bound in light-gray boards with linen back .

		The effect of a richly illuminated manuscript is produced by Mr.
Alberto Sangorski	PERSON	's decorative set - ting to the `` Sermon on the Mount '' -LRB-
Estes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Chap - ters five , six , and seven of
St. Matthew	ORGANIZATION	are written out in black letter , with elaborate initial letters done in gold and colors , and with a special border for each page .

		Each leaf is double , so that only one side of the paper is printed on , and the creamy tint suggests parchment or vellum .

		Holman Hunt 's painting `` The Light of the World , '' in Saint
Paul	PERSON	's Cathedral , is reproduced for the further ornamentation of the vol - ume .

		In elaboration and splendor , these decorative designs are noteworthy exhibitions of the illustrator 's and illuminator 's art .

		The first and last verses are in red , and rubricated initial letters also sprinkle the page .

		The world never wearies of Mrs.
Gaskell	PERSON	's little masterpiece , ``
Cranford	LOCATION	. ''

		Every holiday season there will be , somewhere and in some form , a new edition of the story , perhaps more than one .

		This year Mr.
H. M. Brock	PERSON	,

		The costumes , the graces , the old-fashioned formalities , of Miss Matty , Mr.

Brown	PERSON	, and other characters in the story , are well depicted by the artist , and add a fresh charm to the simple narrative .

Alaska	LOCATION	, where he finally reverts to the primitive condition of his kind and runs wild as the leader of a pack of wolves , celebrates its decen - nial anniversary by appearing in an elaborately - illustrated holiday edition -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- .

		Mr.
Paul Bransom	PERSON	has provided the stirring and touching narrative with a great number of appropriate illus - trations , both full-page color plates and smaller colored and uncolored drawings .

		A first-rate story .

		to begin with , the tale thus reissued becomes more alluring than before , and will doubtless win for itself many new readers .

		Mr.
Richard Le Gallienne	PERSON	addresses his readers in parables in `` The Maker of Rainbows '' -LRB- Harper -RRB- , a collection of fourteen fairy tales and fables supposed to have been found by an old-clothes dealer in one of the pockets of a poet 's dress suit which the poet had sold in order to get money to buy a rose for his sweetheart ; so that , with this touching story of the careless and improvident poet , there are fifteen tales in all , one of them being poetry in form as well as in substance .

		Miss
Elizabeth Shippen Green	ORGANIZATION	has illustrated the book with two colored and three uncolored drawings , in harmony with the tone of the text ; and the rainbow-maker himself , a cheery grinder of scissors and knives , is brightly depicted on the cover in the midst of a group of eager chil - dren .

		Mrs.
Barclay	PERSON	's popular success of last year , `` The Following of the Star '' -LRB- Putnam -RRB- , has followed the example of others of her widely-read romances and gone into a richly illustrated and ornamented holiday edition , handsomely bound and artistically boxed .

		Mr.
F. H. Townsend	PERSON	has provided eight colored pic - tures ,
Miss Margaret Armstrong	PERSON	has designed the page-borders and other decorations , and the printer has not been lacking in the proper discharge of his important duties .

		The vivid illustrations harmonize well with the reading matter , and in every way this sumptuous volume appears to be what an edition de luxe of Mrs.
Barclay	PERSON	's novel ought to be .

		Republished in holiday book form after its serial appearance , Mr.
Robert W. Chambers	PERSON	's '' Blue-Bird Weather '' -LRB- Appleton -RRB- , with seven illustrations by Mr.
Charles Dana Gibson	PERSON	, makes as pretty a love story as any young girl need ask for .

		It is the tale of a duck-shooting expedition in which the duck - shooter loses his heart to the pretty daughter of the keeper of the shooting box where he puts up , and of course it all ends as it should and they live happily ever after .

		The narrative is brisk , the pictures good , and the book , well printed and neatly bound and jacketed , shows nothing to find fault with unless one chooses to take exception to a rather glaring error in a Latin quotation .

		But the lover of love stories will not allow so small a matter as this to disturb his or her enjoyment of the romance .

		Miss
Zona Gale	PERSON	's story entitled '' Christmas '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- appears fittingly at this ' time of the year in artistic book - form , with half a dozen brightly cheerful pictures in color by Mr.
Leon V. Solon	PERSON	.

		The very names that greet the eye in its pleasant pages are an earnest of good things in store for the reader .

		Old Trail Town is the scene of the rural drama , and such names as
Mary Chavah	PERSON	, Ebenezer Rule ,
Tab Winslow	LOCATION	,
Jenny Wing	PERSON	, Mis '
Mortimer Bates	PERSON	, and Buff Miles are borne by the actors .

		The book is attractively bound in cream-colored cloth , richly decorated in green and red and gilt .

		MISCELLANEOUS HOLIDAY BOOKS .

		A pleasant style and a disposition to pass with no unnecessary delay from one subject to the next distinguish Mrs.
William Wilson Sale	PERSON	's handsome volume on '' Old Time Belles and Cavaliers '' -LRB- Lip - pincott -RRB- , a collection of thirty biographical studies beginning with Pocahontas and ending with
Anne Carmichael	PERSON	.

		Mrs.
Sale	PERSON	-LRB-
Edith Tunis Sale	ORGANIZATION	she signs her name to her book -RRB- believes that `` the stories of womanly heroism and manly bravery with which the lives of the old time belles and cavaliers are indelibly associated should be familiar to all readers of Amer - ican history ; for while the English men and women of that day were lounging at court or taking their ease at Bath , their kinsmen and women over the sea were suffering and enduring the privations of war and discomforts of life in a new country . ''

		Accordingly the claims of the more prominent of these belles and cavaliers to our admiration are touched upon in a manner to entertain and never to weary in Mrs.
Sale	PERSON	's book .


Robert Carter	PERSON	, or `` King ''
Carter	PERSON	,
William Byrd	PERSON	,
Mary Ball	PERSON	and
Martha Dandridge	PERSON	-LRB- mother and wife , respectively , of Wash - ington -RRB- ,
Alice De Lancey	PERSON	,
Benjamin Thompson	PERSON	-LRB- Count
Rumford	LOCATION	-RRB- ,
Peggy Chew	PERSON	and
Peggy Shippen	PERSON	,
Dolly Payne	PERSON	,
Theodosia Burr	PERSON	, with others of equal note , have their characters briefly drawn and the things for which they are to be remembered recalled to mind , while there is no lack of portraits to help fix the various personages in one 's mind .

		The book forms a sort of national portrait gallery , or one room , of peculiar interest , in such a gallery . ''

		An attempt to catch the spirit of the keen joys of the winter season '' is the explanatory sub-title of '' A Book of Winter Sports '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , edited by Mr.
J. C. Dier	PERSON	and illustrated in lively manner with both colored plates and half - tone reproductions of photographs .

		The sources from which readable and often instructive matter has been taken are numerous and varied .

		Dickens ,
Burns	PERSON	, de Amicis ,
Christopher North	PERSON	,
Blackmore	PERSON	, '' The Scientific American , '' '' Outing , '' '' The
Saturday	DATE	Review , '' w
$ |	MONEY	th many other writers and a few other periodicals , have been drawn upon for chapters on ice-motoring , skating , curling , snow-shoeing , skiing , toboganning , sleighing , and other ice and snow pastimes .

		The newest and therefore perhaps the most interesting of these sports is ice-motoring , while the wind-driven ice-yacht is still a fascinating toy and one that , under 502 THE DIAL -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, favorable conditions , can still outstrip the gasolene - propelled sledge .

		Directions and diagrams for build - ing certain kinds of ice craft are given in the book ; but these may of course be omitted by those not mechanically gifted , who will find more pleasure in '' Mr.
Winkle	PERSON	on the Ice , '' from '' Pickwick , '' or the song of '' The Jolly Curlers '' by
James Hogg	PERSON	, both of which , and many other readable miscellanies of a nature suitable to the book 's purpose , are to be met with between its covers .

		The selections are all short , and the volume has that brisk air appropriate to the
winter	DATE	season which it celebrates .

		An echo of the
Dickens	PERSON	centennial reaches our shores in Mr.
Edwin Pugh	PERSON	's careful and interesting work on `` The
Charles Dickens	PERSON	Originals '' -LRB-
Scrib	PERSON	- ner -RRB- .

		Of the real characters that inspired the novel - ist to the creation of their famous doubles in fiction no genuine Dickens-lover will ever tire of reading .

		Such chapters as those of Mr.
Pugh	PERSON	on
Mary Hogarth	PERSON	,
Maria Beadnell	PERSON	, the
Brothers Cheeryble	ORGANIZATION	, some Pickwickians , relics from '' The Old Curiosity Shop , '' certain criminal prototypes , and so on , afford both entertainment and instruction .

		The portraits in the volume are many and interesting , as for ex - ample that of
Sam Vale	PERSON	-LRB- ``
Sam Weller	PERSON	'' -RRB- ,
Henry Burnett	PERSON	-LRB- ''
Nicholas Nickleby	PERSON	'' -RRB- ,
Mary Hogarth	PERSON	-LRB- ''
Kate Nickleby	PERSON	'' and other characters -RRB- ,
Maria Beadnell	PERSON	-LRB- ``
Dolly Varden	PERSON	'' and other characters -RRB- , Mrs.
Cooper	PERSON	-LRB- `` Little Dorrit '' -RRB- ,
John Dickens	PERSON	-LRB- `` Mr.
Micawber	PERSON	'' -RRB- ,
Lord Mansfield	PERSON	-LRB- `` Barnaby Rudge '' -RRB- , and many more .

		An index of names and book-titles closes the book .

		Mr.
Pugh	PERSON	is already known as the author of ''
Charles Dickens	PERSON	, the Apostle of the People , '' and his qualifications for such a work as the present will not be ques - tioned .

		The book , with its frontispiece reproducing the Maclise portrait of
Dickens	LOCATION	, and with its other attractive features , is one of the most inviting of recent works about the great novelist .

		The proverbial Irishman , the Irishman of the Victorian novelists and dramatists , vanishes like an illusion dispelled in Mr.
George A. Birmingham	PERSON	's chapters on `` The Lighter Side of Irish Life '' -LRB-
Stokes	PERSON	-RRB- .

		Seen with the eyes of this native of
Erin	PERSON	,
Patrick	PERSON	becomes a much less picturesque and amus - ing character , a much more matter-of-fact and unim - aginative mortal , than it pleases us to conceive him .

		`` Nothing is more characteristic of the Irishman to-day than his freedom from illusion and his power of seeing facts , '' declares Mr.
Birmingham	PERSON	, and we are glad to arrive at the truth of the matter as he sees it .

		But he half acknowledges that the accepted and familiar picture of
Patrick	PERSON	as he used to be may not have been entirely false .

		With all this stripping of the Irishman of his picturesque trappings , however , there remains enough of interest and charm in his personality to furnish material for a baker 's dozen of unusually readable and often amusing sketches in the author 's best vein .

		He takes occasion , naturally enough , to insist that the Irish bull is really `` an example of abnormal , perhaps morbid , mental quick - ness . ''

		Mr.
Henry W. Kerr	PERSON	, R.S.A. , contributes six - teen colored plates , showing the Irishman rather more in accordance with the popular ideal of him than do the pages they illustrate .

		Two years ago the Goncourt prize for the best piece of imaginative writing of the year was awarded to
M. Louis Pergaud	PERSON	for his animal stories , `` De Goupil a Margot , '' published by the `` Mercure de
France	LOCATION	. ''

		These stories , six in number and dealing chiefly with the tragic fate of as many wild creatures in their unequal encounters with their foes -LRB- usually of the human kind -RRB- , are now retold by Mr.
Douglas English	PERSON	in our own tongue , under the general title , `` Tales of the Untamed , '' with illustrations by Mr.
English	PERSON	.

		Adapter , not translator , he calls himself , urging that anything like literalness of rendering was found to be impossible .

		In his telling , the stories are full of a pathetic interest , and yet the pathos is never strained , the naturalness of it all never spoilt .

		The pictures , which seem to be photographs from nature , are as true to life as could be desired .

		Mr.
English	PERSON	is already known for his `` Photography for Naturalists '' and also his `` Book of Nimble Beasts . ''

		His new volume should find wide favor as a gift for the nature-lover .

Philadelphia	LOCATION	and its environs can boast of a greater number of historic colonial residences , still in a good state of preservation and most of them occupied by descendants of the original owners , than any other city in
America	LOCATION	.

		A stately quarto volume descriptive of these '' Colonial Homes of
Philadelphia	LOCATION	and its Neighborhood '' has been prepared by Mr.
Harold Donaldson Eberlein	PERSON	and Mr.
Horace Mather Lippincott	PERSON	, who have from infancy been familiar with many of the houses described .

		More than fifty of these early examples of domestic architecture have their history and associations narrated in the book , with a great number of accompanying views , exterior and interior , from photographs .

		Numerous other old houses of the city and its suburbs are men - tioned , but the limits of space have made it impos - sible to do more .

		Among the more famous of colonial homes met with in turning the book 's pages are the
Wister	PERSON	house , at
Fourth and Locust	ORGANIZATION	streets ;
Provost Smith	PERSON	's house , at
Fourth	ORGANIZATION	and Arch streets , where
Lowell	PERSON	and his bride were entertained in
1844	DATE	; the Solitude ,
Fairmount Park	LOCATION	, built by
John Penn	PERSON	, grandson of
William Penn	LOCATION	;
James Logan	PERSON	's house , known as
Stenton	LOCATION	, at
Germantown	LOCATION	; the
Wayne	PERSON	homestead ,
Waynesborough	LOCATION	; and the houses asso - ciated with such old
Philadelphia	LOCATION	names as Willing ,
Wharton	LOCATION	.

		Morris ,
Shippen	PERSON	,
Brinton	PERSON	,
Ashhurst	LOCATION	, Pen - rose ,
Pennypacker	PERSON	,
Shoemaker	PERSON	, and
Wain	LOCATION	.

		The book is printed from type , in a limited edition ; and with its many pleasing illustrations and artistic binding leaves little to be desired as an example of what is best in fine book-manufacture .

		It bears , appropriately , the imprint of the
J. B. Lippincott Company	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
Walter Wood	PERSON	, believing that `` it may well be chat we have reached a stage when all the nations must say ` Halt ! '

		in connection with battleship con -
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 503 struction and naval expenditure , '' commemorates this epoch in naval history by preparing an histori - cal and descriptive account , from a British point of view , of '' The Battleship '' -LRB- Button -RRB- .

		From the first ship-of-the-line in Henry the Seventh 's reign to the twentieth-century Dreadnaught , he traces the his - tory of battleship construction and the manners and customs of
Jack Tar	PERSON	and his commanding officers , through four centuries of English naval development .

		Mr.
Frank H. Mason	PERSON	, R.B.A. , enlivens the narrative with eight striking illustrations in color , while many more pictures are supplied from old prints and mod - ern photographs .

		An original poem lamenting the fate of a splendid battleship insidiously done to death by a submarine is prefixed to his notable book by the author .

		Since , as Mr.
Wood	PERSON	points out , `` there is no book in our language which deals solely with the battleship , both sail and steam , '' his scholarly and handsome volume supplies a real want .

		Its pages , are alive with interesting facts , and its many illustra - tions are appropriate and helpful to an understand - ing of the subjects discussed .

		Those who enjoy gardening , and others also , will find pleasure in '' The Four Gardens '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- , by '' Handasyde , '' with colored illustrations and line drawings by Mr.
Charles Robinson	PERSON	.

		The four gar - dens are the haunted garden , the old-fashioned garden , the poor man 's garden , and the rich man 's garden , all being such gardens as are to be seen in
England	LOCATION	and
Scotland	LOCATION	, and all redolent of odors familar to garden-lovers .

		The first-named of these gardens has a ghost , pictured in the frontispiece , and a very old stone wall ; also a children 's corner , sheltered and sunny , where mint and sage grow against the old wall , and where the children do all the gardening with three tools shared in common and a shilling a year to each child for seeds .

		The gardening diary of one of the children contains an entry that may recall to the reader some of his own childhood likes and dislikes . ''

		If all the garden belonged to me I would never plant potatoes . ''

		In the rich man 's garden we see the owner ,
John Hardress	PERSON	, slowly pacing its broad paths and looking mostly at his boots , which are polished to perfection .

		Each of these gardens has its distinct character , and the artist has ably seconded the author in making that character appreciable to the reader .

		The book is beautifully printed and bound .

		Tributes to
Lincoln	LOCATION	are always in order .

		In a thin quarto of artistic design are brought together , under the general title , '' Memories of President Lincoln , ''
Walt Whitman	PERSON	's beautiful poems , '' When Lilacs Last in the
Dooryard Bloom	ORGANIZATION	'd , '' `` O Captain !

		My Captain ! '' ''

		Hushed be the Camps To-day , '' and '' This Dust was Once the Man , '' pre - ceded by the ``
Gettysburg	LOCATION	Address , '' a preliminary word from Mr.
William Marion Reedy	PERSON	, Mr.
John Burroughs	PERSON	's comment on the Whitman monody , a preface by Mr.
Horace Traubel	PERSON	, a few words from the publisher , Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	, and a part of the Lincoln passage in
Lowell	LOCATION	's '' Commemoration Ode . ''

		A short bibliography closes the book .

		The handmade paper , large print , broad margins , dec - orative initial letters , and other pleasing features of this tasteful volume are worthy of the publisher whose imprint it bears .

		An excellent and unhack - neyed portrait of Lincoln faces the title-page .

		Appropriate to the season is the reappearance in richly decorated form of Mr.
Bouck White	PERSON	's thought - ful book treating of the life of Jesus and its special significance to the world of to-day .

		`` The Call of the Carpenter '' -LRB- Doubleday -RRB- opens with a prelimi - nary chapter calling attention to two facts which in the writer 's opinion '' occupy the centre of the stage , to which all other facts are tributary , and which for good or ill are conceded to be of superlative import .

		They are , the rise of democracy , and the decline of ecclesiasticism . ''

		But while the gap between the church and the people is widening , `` this antagon - ism , '' asserts the author , `` of the working class to the Church does not carry an antagonism also to Jesus .

		On the contrary , the Workingman of
Nazareth	LOCATION	prob - ably never stood higher in their esteem or more ardent in their affections . ''

		One might feel tempted to try to improve the form of this statement , but the general truth that the life of Jesus , rightly presented , never fails in its appeal , remains unassailable .

		Hence the value of such earnest and intelligent studies as Mr.
White	PERSON	's .

		The book 's outward beauty will help to increase its circulation .

		Its colored frontispiece is by Mr.
Balfour Ker	PERSON	, its decorations by Mr.
Frank Bittner	PERSON	.

		The annual catalogues issued by Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	have for more than twenty years past held a peculiar place in the affections of book-lovers , not alone by reason of the appealing wares which they advertise or their own attractiveness of form , but also on account of the choice bits of literature scat - tered through their pages .

		These waifs and strays by many authors have now been brought together , with some revision and additions , in a delectable an - thology entitled '' Amphora , '' of which Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	is editor as well as publisher .

		The title is a happy one , for the little volume is indeed `` a vase filled and over-flowing with wine of spiritual Life , '' a jar of precious essence distilled not from the famed public gardens of literature but from the shyer and more elusively fragrant blossoming of hedge and hillside .

		That little company to whom literature is a passion an affair of the heart more than of the head will not fail in gratitude to Mr.
Mosher	PERSON	for this happy gift .

		It should find a place , perhaps the chief place , on the bedside shelf of every member of that company .

		The winning wiles and seductive smiles of Miss
Kitty Cobb	PERSON	, who leaves her home in
Pleasant Valley	LOCATION	to see what the city of big hopes has in store for her , are pictured with pen and pencil by Mr.
James Montgomery Flagg	PERSON	in thirty-one chapters , or scenes , filling a broad-paged quarto entitled '' The Adventures of Kitty Cobb '' -LRB-
Doran	PERSON	-RRB- .

		They are collected in this permanent and attractive form after serial publication in certain papers , and form a picture-book calculated to amuse children of a 504 THE DIAL , -LSB-
Dec. 16	DATE	, larger growth .

		Mr.
Flagg	PERSON	's cartoons are not unlike Mr.
Gibson	PERSON	's in their general manner , and are good examples of their species of art .

		The story part , under each drawing , is crisp and brief and very much to the point .

		Words and pictures fill the right-hand pages ; smaller sketches of Kitty in vari - ous attitudes appear on the left .

		`` A Book of Beggars '' -LRB-
Lippincott	PERSON	-RRB- contains six - teen large colored pictures , drawn by Mr.
W. Dacres Adams	PERSON	, of various sorts of mendicants , a gipsy fortune-teller , a crossing-sweeper , two sisters of charity , a
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	lassie and lad , a '' suffra - gette , '' two charity-bazaar damsels , a well-nourished writer of begging letters , a sleek politician , and others .

		The old nursery rhyme beginning , '' Hark , hark , the dogs do bark , '' introduces this company of beggars , and facing each picture is a more or less angry canine , sometimes two , while the front cover shows a ragged beggar subjected to the incivilities of a pair of unfriendly curs .

		The artist 's meaning is in each instance unmistakably conveyed , and the pictures are bright and amusing .

		The mother as the home-maker and the central figure of the home life forms the subject of the late
Margaret E. Sangster	PERSON	's thoughtful and sensible vol - ume , `` The Mother Book '' -LRB- McClurg -RRB- .

		Thirty-fire chapters follow the mother 's course and consider her problems from the first day of her married life onward to her old age , if indeed she allows herself ever to grow old .

		The male members of the house - hold , too , receive some attention , as in the chapter '' About Husbands , '' in the one on '' Bachelor Uncles and Spinster Aunts , '' and in the pages devoted to `` The Boy and the Latch-key . ''

		Of course the ser - vant question is discussed , and the book abounds in good suggestions on that and many other domestic problems all set forth in Mrs.
Sangster	PERSON	's well - known agreeable manner , and with a poem from her pen to close each chapter , beside apt selections here and there from other poets .

		The lavender binding of the book , its ornamental initial letters , its neat box , and other attractive features , help to commend it to the discerning seeker of gift-books .

		Animal stories told in negro dialect after the manner of Uncle Remus fill a well printed and cleverly illustrated volume entitled '' Behind the Dark Pines '' -LRB-
Appleton	LOCATION	-RRB- .

		The author ,
Miss Martha Young	PERSON	, opens her pages with a tribute to the old Mammy who used to delight her and other Southern children with such tales as her book contains .

		Fifty - five stories , full of amusing incident and sprinkled with snatches of verse , all in unmistakable darkey dialect , are told in the best manner of old
Mammy	ORGANIZATION	.

		Mr.
J. M. Conde	PERSON	`` s numerous drawings show a lively appreciation of the comic element in these stories , and invite to a nearer acquaintance with the text .

		Recent revelations concerning the cause of the mutilation of the Venus of Melos and the original position of the missing arms make timely and wel - come a translation of
M. Auguste Rodin	PERSON	's eloquent tribute to that masterpiece of sculpture .

		`` Venus , '' or , as the sub-title reads , `` To the Venus of Melos , '' is in its English dress the work of Miss
Dorothy Dudley	PERSON	, and forms a booklet of twenty-six pages , two views of the famous statue being added , together with a portrait of
M. Rodin	ORGANIZATION	drawn by Miss
Gertrude Huebsch	PERSON	.

		A little less literalness of rendering would have been advisable on the translator 's part .

		Otherwise the book is thoroughly pleasing .

		-LRB-
B. W. Huebsch	PERSON	. -RRB-

		In the series of `` The World 's Romances , '' pub - lished in this country by
Dana Estes & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, there appear this year the ever-popular stories of `` Sieg - fried and Kriemhild '' and `` Tristan and Iseult , '' told in simple and attractive manner , each within the compass of a hundred pages , and each illustrated with eight colored drawings in harmony with the manner and the period of the narrative .

		Mr.
Frank C. Pape	PERSON	* illustrates the `` Siegfried , '' Mr.
Gilbert James	PERSON	the `` Tristan . ''

		Covers and jackets are also brightly adorned with pictures .

		How a country boy , fresh from college , went to
Chicago	LOCATION	to seek his fortune , and just what sort of a fortune his search brought him , is told with no little cleverness of both pen and pencil by Mr.
John T. McCutcheon	PERSON	, favorably known as cartoonist to the
Chicago	LOCATION	'' Tribune , '' and deserving of still closer acquaintance through the pages of ``
Dawson	PERSON	, '11 Fortune Hunter '' -LRB- Dodd -RRB- .

		The story , which is told no less by the pictures than by the text , runs off with a briskness of manner and a flow of ready invention that can not fail to be enjoyed .

		The collegian just ready to conquer the great world could enjoyably and profitably devote a spare hour to
Dawson	PERSON	's case before setting forth in quest of his own fortnne .

		Five inviting small holiday volumes of selections call each for a few words of commendation . ''

		A Little of Everything '' -LRB-
Macmillan	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- presents titbits from Mr.
E. V. Lucas	PERSON	's books , chosen and arranged by himself .

		Characteristic essays and sketches , with a number of poems from his books of verse , make up the volume , which conveys a good idea of Mr.
Lucas	PERSON	in his happiest vein .

		Something novel in antholog - ical literature is offered by Miss
Agnes Repplier	PERSON	in `` The Cat : Being a Record of the Endearments and Invectives Lavished by Many Writers upon an Animal much Loved and much Abhorred '' -LRB-
Sturgis	PERSON	-RRB- .

		The author of `` The Fireside Sphinx '' is well quali - fied to compile such a collection as this of entertain - ing prose and verse , and to preface it with an essay both learned in feline lore and pleasing to the cat - lover .

		The book , well illustrated by Miss
Elizabeth F. Bonsall	PERSON	, extends to 1 73 pages , to the admiration of those who had not suspected how considerable is the volume of extant cat literature .

		A little book for the pocket is devoted to selections in prose and verse from those who have written in praise of gar - dens .

		`` The Voice of the Garden '' -LRB- Lane -RRB- , as the book is called , is compiled by Mrs.
Lucy Leffingwell Cable Bikle	PERSON	' , and has a preface by Mr.
George W. Cable	PERSON	.

		Under nine appropriate headings are grouped passages from a great number and variety of writers , ranging over English literature and even beyond it , but not presented to view in an alphabetical index ,
1912	DATE	. -RSB-

		THE DIAL 505 as might have been wished .

		The book is tastefully bound in blue and gold . ''

		Poems of Country Life '' -LRB- Sturgis -RRB- , compiled by Mr.
George S. Bryan	PERSON	, is pub - lished as a welcome addition to '' The Farmer 's Practical Library . ''

		The most practical things are sometimes said to be the ideal ; hence the propriety of a book of poetry in a farmer 's library .

		The selected pieces of verse , ranging from
Herrick	PERSON	's '' Harvest Home '' to
Ellsworth	PERSON	's '' Shindig in the Country , '' all have the agreeable rustic tone and manner .

		They are grouped in seven divisions treat - ing of country folk , country tasks , country pleasures , country blessings , country fun , country scenes , and country ties .

		Well-known paintings of rural scenes are reproduced to illustrate the book .

		The table of contents has wisely been arranged in the form of an alphabetical author - index .

		`` Sweet Songs of Many Voices '' -LRB-
Caldwell	ORGANIZATION	-RRB- , compiled by
Kate A. Wright	PERSON	-LRB- Mrs.
Athelstan Mellersh	PERSON	-RRB- , is a general col - lection of some of the best short poems of chiefly nineteenth-century English poets .

		A delicately ornamented binding and a colored frontispiece at - tract the eye .

		A useful closing index of first lines supplements the alphabetical author-index at the beginning .

		NOTES .

		`` The Night-Riders , '' another of Mr.
Ridgwell Cul	PERSON	- lum 's exciting tales of western ranch life , will be pub - lished in
February	DATE	by
Messrs. George W. Jacobs & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		A timely publication just announced by
Messrs. Duffield & Co.	ORGANIZATION	is '' The Orient Question '' by Prince
Lazarovich-Hrebelianovich	PERSON	, a prominent Servian states - man . ''

		The Authoritative Life of General
William Booth	PERSON	, '' founder of the
Salvation Army	ORGANIZATION	, has been written by his '' first commissioner , '' Mr.
G. S. Railton	PERSON	, and will be published in this country by Messrs.
George H. Doran	PERSON	Co. . ''

		Roses of Psestum , '' by Mr.
Edward McCurdy	PERSON	, is a volume of essays on
Italy	LOCATION	and the mediaeval spirit , charmingly written , and published by Mr.
Thomas B. Mosher	PERSON	in the exquisite form that he knows how to give to a book .

		The forthcoming biography of
George Frederic Watts	PERSON	, by his widow , to which we have once or twice referred in this column , will be published on this side by Messrs.
George H. Doran Co.	PERSON	.

		The work promises a rich literary and artistic treat .

		Three novels to be issued in
February	DATE	by
Messrs. Little	LOCATION	,
Brown & Co.	ORGANIZATION	are the following : '' The Day of Days , '' by Mr.
Louis Joseph Vance	PERSON	; `` The Maiden Manifest , '' by
Delia Campbell MacLeod	PERSON	; and `` On Board the Beattic , '' by
Anna Chapin Ray	PERSON	.

		Mr.
George M. Trevelyan	PERSON	has edited what seems to be a definitive edition of '' The Poetical Works of
George Meredith	PERSON	'' in a single volume of six hundred pages , based on the carefully-revised text of the '' Memorial '' edition .

		The editor 's notes give this work a special value .

		It is published by the Messrs.
Scribner	PERSON	.

		It is reported that the recent death in
London	LOCATION	of
William Flavelle Monypenny	ORGANIZATION	will not interfere with the completion of his important
Life of Disraeli	ORGANIZATION	, the second volume of which has just appeared .

		Mr.
Monypenny	PERSON	, it seems , had practically all the material for the work ready for the publishers at the time of his death .

		Professor
Henry S. Cauby of Yale	ORGANIZATION	has prepared a vol - ume on `` The Short Story , '' to be published immediately by
Messrs. Henry Holt & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

		The body of this book is a revision and enlargement of Professor
Canby	PERSON	's previous monograph on the short story , the principles therein laid down being illustrated by a number of specimen stories .

		Beginning with its
January	DATE	issue the name of '' Cur - rent Literature '' will be changed to `` Current Opinion , '' and the page-size will be increased from that of the ordi - nary magazine to seven by ten inches .

		We trust these innovations may help in widening the popularity of one of the few periodicals which may be regarded as indis - pensable to the intelligent reader .

		One of the most important books yet announced for publication in the new year is '' The Mechanistic Conception of Life , '' by Professor
Jacques Loeb	PERSON	, to be issued by
the University of Chicago Press	ORGANIZATION	.

		The book has been written in such a manner that the layman may understand the work done by Professor
Loeb	PERSON	and draw his own conclusions as to the importance of the fact that living creatures have been developed without the inter - position of the paternal element .

		A set of seven volumes , just received , completes the forty in which
Miss Charlotte Porter	ORGANIZATION	has given us the `` First Folio '' Shakespeare -LRB-

		In text and critical apparatus this edition leaves little to be desired , and it is matter for congratulation that
Miss Porter	ORGANIZATION	's task of presenting the '' trewe copy '' has been so satis - factorily completed .

		Shakespeare is better worth read - ing in this form than in any modernized one , and in these days when even Chaucer is made easy by translation into current prose , it is well to be reminded that such shifts do a doubtful service to serious students of literature .

F. G. Browne	PERSON	, for many years head of the publishing interests of
Messrs. A. C. McClurg & Co.	ORGANIZATION	, and a member of the directory of that corporation .

Browne	PERSON	will have associated with him Mr.
Frank L. Howell	PERSON	, and the firm name will be
F. G. Browne & Co.	ORGANIZATION	.

January	DATE	, will be '' The Lapse of
Enoch Wentworth	PERSON	, '' by
Isabel Gordon Curtis	PERSON	, author of '' The Woman from
Wolverton	PERSON	. ''

		Four other novels by popular authors are in preparation for issue during
February	DATE	and
March	DATE	.
